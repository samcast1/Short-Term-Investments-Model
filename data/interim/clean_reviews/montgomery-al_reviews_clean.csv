2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect. Felt super comfortable and the home was very clean. Had toys for the kids to play with. And the snacks came in super handy because we were all too exhausted to explore for food. Definitely recommend this location to anyone.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our young family with small children. Place was clean and had all our favorite snacks and drinks waiting for us. We will stay again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,don thank you for an amazing stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s place went above our expectations! The kitchen was well stocked, the beds were comfortable, and everything was very clean. We enjoyed the easy drive to both downtown sites and the highway. The grocery store was just a block away, but the house was in a quiet neighborhood. We also loved watching some of the DVDs!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I appreciate Don’s Hospitality and Flexibility with all elements of my stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in a lot of AirBnBs over the last few years, and this may've been the nicest, cleanest one I have stayed at. Truly outstanding. The photos in the listing didn't do it justice. The neighborhood was quiet and near grocery stores (which is important to us). And Don was super-accommodating with a request we had. Just and outstanding experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don is a great host. He is very accommodating and friendly.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don's Airbnb is one of the best I've stayed in. It was very clean and represented well by the photos. He provides a very handy local guide which includes the amount of time to arrive at the destinations. Don is very kind to provide a basket of snacks and beverages in the refrigerator. This lodging is very quiet - no traffic noise, no train whistles, or loud neighbors nearby. Don even provides covered car parking. Don is a great communicator too. If you are visiting Montgomery, this is a fantastic place to stay! I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying at Don's, always very clean and cozy as described."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don is very accommodating!!! Overall OUTSTANDING!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoy the stay !!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don's place is quite lovely. It is set up for families and with almost anything you would like (looked like he had a playpen, toys, crossword puzzles, movies, etc. for family fun). He left a basket of snacks on the table and more along with drinks in the refrigerator. It had all the amenities of a hotel but with the feeling of being in someone's home. :) The only thing that wasn't a 10 was the pillows on the bed. They were pretty fat and I'm more of a down-filled pillow person. But that is me. I would stay here again! The price is great for such a lovely place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. Thanks Don!"

After a long drive, coming in to find snacks and toys kept everyone sane while we made dinner.

We will surely be back on road trips through Montgomery & will return to Don's thoughtful place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We plan to stay at Don’s again if we’re ever in Montgomery. It was the perfect space for our family of 4 for a soccer tournament. The house is so clean, newly remodeled and is in a peaceful neighborhood surrounded by trees. The home had everything we needed and more. We were touched by the extra touches he provides throughout the house. He was very accommodating to us!"

He was so quick to answer.......We got into town and hour early asked if we could check in and pay the difference and Don without hesitation said IT'S READY FOR YOU NOW AND NO EXTRA COST... That is rare in these days. Got tho the house ( is so eay to find) the neigherhood is so peaceful and like you are at home. Got into the house ( easy peasy) and what a treat it was so nice , inviting, and warm ( well cool, it was hot / muggy but not inside..LOL) they really did offer so many nice things..snacks on the table as soon as you walked in the door kids toys ( my grandson had a blast with every one of them) to drinks stocked in the fridge THANK YOU we enjoyed them..... :) Oh and I have never stayed at an Airbnb that told you NOT to take bedding off, take trash out, this was a first and a very nice touch."

They thought of literally everything to make you as comfortable as possible. Plenty of drinks in the fridge, snacks, games, a book with places to eat close by and entertainment options. They even had Q-tips and a make up towel. This is a 5 star stay. Highly recommended."

The snack basket and beverages were such a nice surprise and the water was appreciated in this Alabama August heat."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot. Only a 10 min drive to most things in the city. Would highly recommend the legacy museum. Don even supplied some snacks and supplies which went down nicely.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"travel for work and stay at a lot of airbnbs. There are many that try way too hard and end up just cluttering things up. Others, don't seem like they try at all. I can tell you that Don has nailed it with his Airbnb. I felt right at home without a feeling like it was a canned presentation. everything was clean and there wasn't anything you could need that he didn't provide. if you are going to be in his area, stop looking and start booking this before someone else does."

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a refrigerator stocked with beer, coke, and juice, offering us a refreshing start to our stay. The clean and comfortable beds ensured a restful night's sleep, while the decor featuring cotton and origami added a charming touch, reflecting both local heritage and creativity. We appreciated the abundance of local park and travel guides, providing us with valuable information to explore the area. The spacious accommodations and board games made it an ideal choice for families. Without a doubt, we would gladly book again, the peaceful atmosphere and the comfort of the space made our stay truly memorable."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing Airbnb! Some Airbnb places make you do so much to check out but Don made it so easy for us! So much hospitality with snacks, drinks, coffee, baby items, games, movies, and much more. We were only there for one night but I would definitely stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don was great and this is a perfect spot to relax and recover after work! Definitely one of the nicest I’ve stayed in! Will definitely look for availability when I work in the area again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"After we booked our stay, we were greeted warmly by Don and that kindness continued to shine through. My wife and I stayed here for one night. However this home would be perfect for families with children, even young babies (high chair at the ready). A truly nice place to stay while in Montgomery."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! The space exceeded all expectations and the host was very kind. This will be our go-to whenever we're in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really great stay! Thank you!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don was very nice and the place was very welcoming, clean, equipped, and organized. Very great place to stay"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had such a great stay at Don’s place! It is very clean, cozy, and well stocked for home cooked meals! We didn’t have little ones, but it was nice to see options available to keep them entertained if we did have kids. The location is great, close enough to downtown excursions but also within reasonable driving distance of good eats outside the city center. We went to two local places from Don’s book of suggestions, so worth it! Overall, a great stay with clear instructions on check-out process. Would highly recommend and will definitely come back myself, should I find myself in Montgomery again. Thank you for hosting a fabulous place that made our trip even better!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don's place was incredible! The attention to detail was something I don't think I've ever seen at an Airbnb. Cleanliness was on point. The ease of check-in and check out was on point.
He had snacks, coffee, and a lot of other goodies for us to enjoy. The group I went with can't stop talking about it."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can tell when someone actually spent time thinking about their airbnb and what it would be like to stay in it. Don definitely has. We didn't have children with us, but the place is definitely set up for families as well as adults, and there is plenty to do inside the house other than watching TV to keep you from getting bored. The kitchen is extremely well-stocked with just about anything you might need for food prep. The beds were very comfortable and there was great water pressure in the shower. We did take a walk in the neighborhood at dusk and felt completely safe and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay and appreciate how well maintained, clean and comfortable the house was. My two grandchildren enjoyed the toys and snacks the host thoughtfully provided. The location was great, easy to access and convenient with a Publix just two blocks away. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What can I say. This was everything that I wish I could find when I go away from home. The consideration, the thoughtfulness, the cleanliness… we almost didn’t want to leave because it was so perfect. It was perfect for my family of 5 and worth every penny. Snacks were available, drinks, toys, a pack and play, BETTER than a hotel. Thank you so much for making our one night stay so easy."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had great stay. Just a short overnight trip, but the place was exactly as described and would definitely stay here again if I needed to be in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Clean and organize! We'll be there again for sure!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this place! Probably our favorite air bnb we have stayed in yet! Our daughter was playing in a ball tournament, and it was only about 4 minutes from Lagoon Park, and in a great neighborhood! The place was spotless, and so cozy and comfy! Lots of puzzles and games for the kids. Well stocked kitchen with snacks and drinks. We loved everything about this place!❤️"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I gotta start off by saying they have the best welcome book I've ever seen at an Airbnb. The place was exactly like the pictures, easy to find, great parking, quiet and I felt very safe. This place is a great value!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don's AirBnB is just as advertised. Great location! Don had snacks on the table and refreshments in the refrigerator. His communication was spot on. The home was spotless and looked just like the photo's used in the advertisement. I would definitely book again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is a lovely, cozy place. Easy to find, not too far from the interstate and tucked back and private. Parking is right in front of the entrance and covered, in case of rain.
The kitchen and fridge were very stocked and snacks on the table. The livingroom was very warm and welcoming with modern furnishings and very cozy.
The bedrooms are very pretty and the beds were very comfortable with soft sheets and warm blankets. Ceiling fans and bedside tables and lamps with plugs for the phone chargers.
Bathrooms are very nice with plenty of towels and everything you need for a shower and qtips for after.
If you have a child, there was a high chair and toys and games.
This was a very lovely place and we look forward to stopping here again if the future allows. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Don was a super fantastic host. The house was very comfortable and extremely welcoming and super clean. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dons place was great! We stopped while passing through on our way to Florida. The stay was significantly more affordable than other airbnbs and hotels around, and it was for incredible value. You aren’t compromising anything even with the incredible price. Feels safe as well as it’s near owners property and tucked away on a shared road. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don and Wendy’s place is really an amazing place. The space is pristine, comfortable and filled with extras you couldn’t even imagine! They truly thought of things that every guest …from infants to seniors, could possibly need/ want. Don was always quick to respond and went above and beyond to make our travels so relaxing. They left all kinds of snacks and treats …and for weary travelers that was a great delight. We are Airbnb hosts ourselves and we got some great ideas from their shining example! Highly recommend"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Do it again and again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house in great condition. Spotless clean. The local guide he prepared for us was amazing. The house had literally anything you would need to stay for several days. It had a first aid kit, toys, movies, books, coffee, drinks in the refrigerator, and snacks. It looks like Don has really thought about everything. The location was great and it was very very safe and quiet. It was very convenient to downtown Montgomery. If we come back to Montgomery, we will definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome deal
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Don is an excellent host. He is extremely responsive and helpful. The place was clean and comfortable. Don’s book on things to do and places to eat was accurate and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our stay! It was spotless and very charming! My daughter loved the games and snacks that were offered! I would absolutely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a baseball game and really enjoyed our stay!
Everything was very clean. There were some snacks and drinks there available to us. My husband really appreciated the “guide to Montgomery” book that was there and we went to some of the places listed. My favorite thing was how child friendly the house was. The first thing my girl did was go for the basket of toys! There were puzzles, books, crayons, pack n play, sippy cups, and the outlets were all covered.
The house was so close to everything—the zoo, shopping, restaurants, downtown, and the stadium. It was pretty peaceful at night even being so close to everything.
We would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely phenomenal Airbnb!! To say that this Airbnb had everything would an understatement. Don truly thought about the smallest of details. His place was fully stocked. Even with things we would never have expected! We came pretty well prepared but noticed that if we had forgot to bring items, he had them right there for our use! Not only was everything fully stocked, everything was also spotless! Every single room was squeaky clean. Best of all, this place felt like home away from home. After winding down from a long day, we were able to sit back and watch a movie at night and eat popcorn like we were at home. The house was in a great neighborhood and lovely to walk around. It was conveniently located near a Publix and many other restaurants and stores. Also, it was within 15 minutes of sites in downtown Montgomery but enough out of town where it was quiet. I’d recommend this place to everyone and will absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat if ever in the area again! Wonderful!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic host! Everything was as described. Definitely will be our go to place next time we’re in Montgomery!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I only stayed one night. We were able to get to the Montgomery Hospital quickly and conveniently. Many things were just a short drive a way, I recommend stay as a couple or family, we greatly enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very lovely, private cottage.
They thought of every need a traveler may need. Very nice"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would definitely stay here again! Very homey and also plenty of snacks and drinks were provided, which was a nice touch."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first ever stay at an Air B and B, but definitely won't be our last. Don set the standard high. I always bring my own bleach wipes. I even brought my own sheets, because I am a neat freak. Fortunately, Don seems to be, too. This place was immaculate. It had a homey feel. We all loved the games, snacks, and cleaniless. We definitely will be back. Thank you guys for such a great stay. You guys really thought of every thing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location is definitely a hidden gem for anyone visiting Maxwell AFB. We stayed for graduation festivities and we’re happy with how close we were to the base as well as other activities. Everything felt like it was just 5-15mins away. You’re located just outside downtown and about 18-20mins away from the OTS school house…traffic at the gate caused the biggest delay. Local museums and of course the Montgomery zoo are must see items for the kids. Plenty of places to eat nearby and Don also has a book of recommendations for everything. The house is cozy and the pictures are nice, but it looks better in person. Plenty of space for 2 adults and 2 kids to stretch after a long drive and just relax. Highly recommend this property, and owner, to anyone looking in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place. Highly recommend. The hosts have thought of everything. Snacks, drinks, reading materials, games, baby and kid friendly. The city of Montgomery was beautiful and historically significant. Don’t miss the downtown and museums - you’ll leave enlightened."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! So clean and nice. We felt like we were home for the moment we walked into the door. I loved all the little touches and all the extra stuff.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ice an cozy place. Was very clean and will definitely use again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome house and location. The house has more than what we expected for an Airbnb. Interiors are installed with all high quality materials. Love this place!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don was a super host came down for a funeral and my family didn't have no where to go afterwards to eat and relax before they go back to the rooms they occupied up the road.I Asked could I have them over.
His wife was so polite and respectful said of course.This home was so comfortable for my family I definitely will recommend any air bnb renters to come and check this home out if you're in Montgomery Alabama"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They really thought of everything. We extended our stay. Super nice place & I would book here again.
Great host, great place, great amenities, great stay = happy families making memories😊
Not sure if Don is a super host but he definitely should be!
Loved this place so much, we didn’t want to leave😉"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I traveled across the country from different directions to visit my dad. Don’s Airbnb was perfect because we each had a bedroom and a bath to use as well as a nice common area for eating and relaxing. There was even a washer and dryer, and we were able to return home with our suitcases full of clean clothes. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with drinks and snacks for us - the most I have ever seen in an Airbnb!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay very clean
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this adorable home. Don made sure to keep it clean and stocked. A beautiful guide to Montgomery as well as pamphlets of different activities to do. It is within walking distance of food and grocery stores. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the stay!
we have already recommend it to our friends!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house is very homey and owners take away the stress of getting what you may need until you can get to a grocery store due to traveling. They were so generous I left some things like coffee and some odds and ends for future customers. I hope others will follow since the owners go out of their way to be so hospitable.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don and Wendy are excellent hosts and we look forward to staying with them again. The house is located directly behind their home with its own driveway and carport. Located in an older neighborhood, this house has been fully remodeled and was very clean. We also felt safe where we were located.
Having locked ourselves out of the house, Don was quick to respond and had us back in the home within a couple of minutes.
Don had the place stocked with extras. My son liked the snacks that were available. I particularly enjoyed the Keurig coffee maker.
Big screen tv in the living room stocked with DVDs and we were able to enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean to relax after a long day.
Definitely recommend your next stay be with Don."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful stay here in Montgomery. Provides a cozy, private place to stay, and really feels like home. Great if you have kids! During my stay the Wi-Fi was down due to sever storms a day before my trip, but they went above and beyond with providing us with there own, Work Wi-Fi the second day of our 2 night visit. Provided excellent experience while we were there and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to drop into Montgomery. Will definitely be staying here again next time I am in this city!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Don's place is a sweet little oasis with everything that you can imagine for a family - we felt very comfortable after a long drive! Our son was excited to see many puzzles and we loved all of the books. We had a very comfortable night of rest and the accommodations were perfect for our little family of 3. Thank you so much Don for the lovely stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,this is my second time coming here and this will be be my getaway in montgomery
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at Don and Wendy’s and we already have plans for another visit. My favorite thing about their place is it feels like a home away from home. The kitchen is well equipped and the house is always spotless. I also appreciate the simple gesture of black make up towels in the bathroom. Their place is in a convenient location not far from East Chase and easy to get to! If you are looking for a perfect weekend stay in Montgomery, this is it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you bring a child they will love it my child is 9 they had coloring books board games and a toy box with nice toys the house it really made you feel at home not a visitor and the host was very sweet
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING! I cannot express how awesome this place was but, I will try.
1. It was SO CLEAN! I had a crawling baby with me and I felt 100% comfortable having him go everywhere. It felt like it was basically a new build hahaha
2. There was so many sweet touches from the snacks they left me and my kids to the labels everywhere so I wasn't confused by anything, to the drinks in the fridge.
3. KID FRIENDLY! They had coloring books, baby toys to little kid toys, they had little kid books, they had a pack-n-play and even a HIGHCHAIR! It's pretty difficult to find an AirBnB that has amenities for kids and this one seemed to have them all!
4. It was also amazing for adults! The TV was HUGE! There were also a ton of puzzles, movies and all different kinds of books.
It was truly an absolute joy staying in Don's place. He was very sweet, welcoming and communicated well and quickly. I would love to stay here again the next time I am in town. It was a blessing for me and my family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Don was able to accommodate our request for an early check-in and the place exceeded our expectations. The reality was better than the pictures.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great stay we had at Don’s Place! It was a last minute booking and we sure are happy with our choice. It was a great location and the house is newly renovated and has everything you need to be comfortable and some. We would highly recommend staying here if ever in the Montgomery area. Thanks again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! If you have kids, you should definitely stay here. Don accepted our last minute request for one night while we were traveling across the country. His home was newly renovated, very clean, and extremely kid friendly. There were kids toys, kids bath supplies, movies and board games, and he even had snacks available. The twin bed had side rails for our toddler and a Pack N Play was also provided for our infant. My wife was obsessed with how accommodating Don’s home was. Would stay here again and recommend to everyone!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was added to my list of favorites and am already planning to book again. Don and Wendy did not miss a single detail when it comes to comfort and convenience. The master pillows are the same I use at home and are incredibly comfortable. The bed also super comfy. The kitchen is well stocked, snacks provided a bonus and even have a washer and dryer. The black make up towels are always a hot in my book too. Thankful for another amazing AirBnB experience. Stay here - you’ll be glad you did!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don’s place has earned it’s 100% 5 star reviews. For our family, it was perfect. He had a pack and play and bed rail for my kids, snacks and drinks, Roku, book, games, and more. It seems like Don has thought of everything and made the perfect Airbnb. I highly recommend staying at this location."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don and Wendy provided great place and service.
Definitely recommended. Cleanliness is top notch for sure."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in a renovated house located in a quiet neighborhood. Full kitchen, big tv with Roku, laundry and full kitchen made this a special stay as we traveled from Tennessee mountains to Florida beaches. Grocery stores and restaurants are a few blocks away, and we drove less than 4 miles to museums and additional restaurants. Although we don’t have small children, this house is completely set up to accommodate them. It’s certainly on my list to rent if we find ourselves in the area again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Best air bnb ever. We’ve been to bigger homes in different cities and this house beats them all….One word to describe this stay….AWESOME!

We would definitely come back again and we recommend this housing to everybody!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has by far been the best Airbnb that I have stayed in. This place was fully stocked with anything you could think of. Upon arrival there were several different types of drinks and snack for us. There was coffee and tea for the morning. I would recommend this place to anyone who comes in the area. There was also toys, a crib and a highchair should you have little ones."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cozy place and newly remodeled
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don was amazing! We were exhausted after evacuating Florida for hurricane Ian with our newborn, and Don was so kind and generous, and his place was wonderful. We had such a restful stay. We are so appreciative, and we highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best rental experience of my traveling adventures! Don is a fabulous host!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect. Amazing. I have stayed at a variety of southern USA properties through Airbnb and this was the best one yet.
Don is great. Everything you could need is there. He has thought of every possible ammenity. From movies, games, toiletries, stocked kitchen, cold beer and drinks, childrens furniture, comfortable beds, and more!
Hoping it’s available for all future Montgomery stays on our travels."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, gorgeous, well-equipped and excellent value Airbnb. The space was exactly as advertised and AC was especially welcome in the heat. Great location near historic places and restaurants and a perfect stop along our road trip. Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want to feel like your home away from home this is the place for you ! The entire house, top to bottom is spotless! The location is safe and close to stores and restaurants. Then there is the attention to details that far exceeds any other Airbnb we have stayed. There were cold drinks in the fridge, a basket of snacks on the table, 2 types of coffee makers with coffee, creamer and sweeteners. A pack and play, high chair, toys, puzzles and videos, the list goes on and on ! The kitchen and bathrooms were completely stocked and the bed was so comfortable. Communication with Don was super easy. We will be talking about this stay for a long time !"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with plenty of amenities! If you have children, Don’s place is the one for you. Plenty of activities and books to read. I loved that they offered complimentary snacks and beverages. If I’m ever in town, I’d stay at Don’s place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don's place has everything you might need for your stay. We are a family of four were travelling down south to Pensacola/Destin from the Smokey Mountains and stopped for a night here. The place has nice family friendly touches all over the places. If you are travelling with family and have kids, they would love the place. I would recommend the place for short or long term stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After staying at 20+ Airbnb locations, I can honestly say this is the absolute BEST!
Perfectly described, lots of games/puzzles for the kids. Excellent price and low cleaning fees.
I can’t say enough about how thrilled we were with Don and his home!
We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Very clean and quiet. Loved the snacks and drinks ( pop, water, beer and wine) already there after a long day of traveling. My two younger girls loved the toys ( especially the mini Bop-It). Definitely recommend and we will for sure be back when we visit our friends!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place. Loved it!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Great location. Very clean and well furnished.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Don's airbnb was wonderful, it was just a over night stay but i was very much so pleased, very comfortable beds and the cleanliness was everything. He had everything you need, i took my own baking utensils to back a cake, but really didn't need it, the kitchen was well equipped. I would definitely book again if every in the Montgomery area, and definitely recommending it to any family or friends."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don’s place is the best place we’ve stayed at with Airbnb. The home was absolutely beautiful, modern, and comfy. This is the first time for us that a host has left snacks and drinks for us. We enjoyed the stay very much and were sad that we only needed to stay in town one night."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don is an amazing host with nice complimentary amenities!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing hosts.Very accessible, great communication, spotless home , everything felt so new in this rental. Don was great he had cold drinks & beer as we arrived. This does not always happen at airbnbs so we were grateful to walk in an look into the fridge and BOOM☺️. We had trouble connecting to the tv and Don didn’t hesitate to come over and show us how to work it. The space was perfect for us. I am a Truck driver and I booked so late, but Don accommodated my family & I quickly. Quiet cute neighborhood. Don place is the place to book!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If Don is not a Superhost - WHY NOT!? He has thought of everything, and for weary cross country travelers - we were so very pleasantly surprised, and overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness and love he had put into this cottage. It truly has everything you need - if it doesn’t have it - you don’t need it! This place is amazing - right down to a pack and play for babies and toys for your toddlers. BOOK THIS!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Small, but very well thought and efficient place. Situated at the rear of the owner’s property in a peaceful older 60’s/70’s neighborhood. Easy, calm and secure. You can tell the owner is a good guy that values treating people right. If you’re traveling though/to Montgomery with 4 or less, this is a great place to stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication, exactly what we needed. Great experience."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Great location and Hosts!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was just as described and perfect for our night stay when passing through Alabama on our way to Panama City! Don far exceeded our expectations by supplying drinks and snacks!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great stay. Place was so lovely beautifully decorated and so very clean. Everything was how described and more! It was so close to shops restaurants, and other stores . We will definitely stay there again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay! Tons of room for us. Will definitely stay here again! The air bnb was stocked with everything you could need. This was perfect for our short stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Super cozy and has everything you need in a stay. This was the only place in Montgomery that we could stay in that offered a one night minimum stay and I couldn’t be more happy that we picked this place. Would have loved to stay more than one night!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was so cozy and cute! They had so many games and puzzles, and even had the fridge stocked with drinks and had all kinds of snacks. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don’s place was absolutely amazing for us! Super accommodating to two small young children! Had a high chair, pack and play, toys, sippy cups, a stocked fridge, snacks!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found Don’s place last minute when we were passing through Montgomery and we were so glad we did. Don’s place was the perfect respite for us and our little ones after a long day on the road. Incredibly clean, updated, and full of thoughtful touches. The place has everything you would need (2 full bathrooms was a big plus!), and our kiddos appreciated the toys. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and very convenient to local restaurants and grocery stores. We would stay at Don’s place again and recommend it without hesitation!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean! Nice furniture and kitchen. Hot shower! Washer and dryer. Private.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great for two couples. Location is close to some nice places and the Equal Justice Memorial, but I car is probably best for a lot of people. One pretty basic bathroom which could use some ""sprucing up"" but has all the functionality."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We gave a 4 star because this couple is trying hard to renovate and are trying to grow an area of their town. The listing stated ""garden District"" yes it is officially in the garden district but that is very misleading as this area was in a very much disrepair. The listing stated restaurants and shopping within walking distance . I never found anything in a 4 block area and I would not walk anywhere in that area. They reached out to us after booking to tell us the bathroom tub was peeling but it was late and we didn't have anytime to get a new place so we just sucked it up. The blinds were dog chewed and needed replaced . The beds were very nice and the unit was clean to my standards . The check in was a key left under a rock. The doorknob lock was the only lock on the flimsy back door entrance . The deadbolt did not work. Again I did not feel safe. Amenities were lacking. No paper towels or shampoos ect. The rooms were large. This was not an ideal place for women traveling alone."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super comfortable place, great hosts, we enjoyed our stay! You will too."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Felt right at home. Especially great for my doggo who loved the yard and the park across the street.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host!! Easy to communicate with and very helpful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing home, clean, comfortable and adorable. The hosts are flexible and kind. Thank you for the great stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and Michael’s place was a wonderful spot for our weekend in Montgomery! Everything we wanted to do was close by, and we enjoyed a game of ping pong! We would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Julie & Michael have clearly put a great deal of effort into refurbishing this lovely home. The neighborhood is great and they were responsive hosts.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of my favorite airbnbs - really nicely updated older home in the very walkable Garden District of Montgomery. It’s nice to see older homes getting a fresh start. The character of the house shines through. Beds were comfortable, lots of space. The fenced in backyard was so helpful as we were traveling with our dog. We really did enjoy the game room and used both the ping pong table and pac man! Our main reason for coming to Montgomery was to visit the Legacy Museums - we were only 1.5 miles away. All in all just a great visit for our first time in Montgomery. Definitely go to Dreamland BBQ !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was beautifully decorated and at a great price. Do take essentials. The area has been rehabbed and does have a few houses still in need. Beautiful park across the street and gorgeous renovated homes.
Home was clean and and large rooms."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and Julie and Michael's place. It is just as pictured - the furnishing is quite modern, but comfortable. Rooms are large, light, and airy. The neighborhood is convenient and lovely. You are literally a stone's throw from the Governor's Mansion. You'll enjoy staying here."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this home - you can see the character in the space. The positives are:
* Spaciousness
* Games room with fun games (we enjoyed this a lot)
* Great parking
* Lots of televisions
However, it did have a few issues, such as internal doors not shutting correctly. We had problems turning the heating down. We could only find one spare blanket - more would have been appreciated. We would have loved a book that explained the house rules, how to work the equipment and what is available in the local area (we find this helpful Airbnbs we stay in)."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Julie and Michael's place was perfect for our weekend. Will definitely check it out next time we're in town.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay. The house was clean, and the kitchen and bathroom were stocked with essentials. Wifi worked great. The neighborhood was quiet and it’s close to everything (downtown, grocery stores, and restaurants). There's a pizza place, Can A Brotha Get A Slice, that's close by and was so good. There’s also a Thai place downtown, Lek’s Railroad Thai, that was very good. Highly recommend staying here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the house and so did our pups. Julie and Michael were very great host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bed was super comfortable. We played ping pong for hours, seeing this in the listing was the final decision on this property. We enjoyed our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, great house."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very spacious and comfortable. The kitchen was clean and the appliances are new. I’m so glad the old world charm was preserved!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice house in a good part of town. Comfy bed!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,They allowed us to get in the house even if we arrived in 5 hours earlier. Julie and Michael are very kind and super host! I woudl stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cool spot. Clean, nice decor, great location. The ping pong table is a nice touch!!! Would stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay, very clean, orderly, comfortable and had everything we needed, plus a ping pong table and large fenced backyard for our pup! Would definitely recommend and will stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was super cute and a lot bigger than I thought it would be. We had fun playing ping pong and especially playing Pac-Man 😁
The fenced back yard was great for the dogs and the neighborhood was so quiet. I’d definitely recommend staying here. Thanks for being great hosts !"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great stay! my pup loved the yard. i loved the bed and pillows.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the home, Julie and Michael did a great job keeping the character of the home while updating it and making it a cozy place to stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Passing through on our way from Texas to North Carolina, we needed a place to rest our heads with our 5 month old baby and three dogs- and a big uhaul. Julie and Michael were so helpful and responsive. Their listing met our needs perfectly- with king size bed, pack n play, coffee and a safe, fenced yard for my fur babes. I loved the unique layout of the home as well as the way they have decorated it. Hair dryer, toiletries, even laundry machines- this place had it all. I would recommend this listing and these hosts all day long and hope to stop in again on our trips to and from houston/raleigh. Thanks Julie and Michael!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This beautiful corner house felt right at home. The only differences are that is is huge inside than I thought. The picture show it look smaller. I felt more safe if having a smart lock installed than being responsible for a key everyday. I do not like have to worrying about a key on my vacation. The king bed is one of the most softest bed I have ever laid on and it hurts our back the first night. I had to tell my son to take over and me and my fiancée slept in Queen bed that is firm. It was perfect! My son love the biggest room lol. Those minor things doesn’t defeat the whole experiences. We love it! My two little dogs love being outside, we were out exploring, eating out, and stayed in the room mostly due to living room being too cold. Thanks for letting us stay there. Happy Holidays!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I give The Lawrence House a 5 star review. The host were very responsive and they responded promptly. They were also very friendly and helpful . The house is exactly how it is described and how the pictures look. The house was clean and you can tell the host put time , effort, and detail into their home to ensure whoever stays will be comfortable. Clean linens, clean home, cooking utensils, coffee maker , microwave, washer/ dryer, laundry soap, women sanitary supplies, soap, towels, entertainment for the family ( games and television in each room and a fenced in backyard for our fur baby. I felt at home away from home and I am picky. The beds are also comfortable. I will be sure to book this home anytime I visit home. A unforseen situation occurred on my part and they worked with me and helped me out and for that I'm grateful. If you are in town don't look any further, this is your home away from home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stop at Julie and Michael's place, and we were just as delighted as we were the first time. This property is on the edge of the Garden District and is just a block or two away from the Governor's Mansion. Like most older neighborhoods, there are some houses nearby that need attention, but I couldn't ask for a more peaceful and quiet environment. It is a convenient location near the interstate but far enough away to block any traffic noise. I'd like to come back again when I have time to explore the historic areas in Montgomery, and when I do, I will plan to stay at Julie and Michael's!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at this charming old house. The neighborhood was quiet, and the fenced was for dogs."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for what I needed. Most places supply with bare minimum and this place was supplied with more than I’ve ever recited at other locations.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location - so close to the Air Force base and downtown!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the comfort, stylish artistic home with off street parking in quiet historic neighborhood undergoing deserved rehab. These are indeed super hosts, fast to respond, helpful with recommendations (loved Vintage Cafe breakfast). Enjoyed playing ping pong after long day on the road. Easy check, in checkout. Fast route to downtown and fabulous museums. Great experience."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and Michael were excellent hosts! The house was pristine and just as pictured. Check-in was very easy, as was the check-out process. No issues at all during the stay, Julie and Michael were very responsive and quick to answer any questions we had. Overall 10/10 stay, would happily recommend and stay again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Julie and Michael were amazing host. Our plans changed last minute and needed to check in early and was able to do so. The home was spotless and very spacious and we will definitely stay again.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Julie and Michael's property, and it certainly won't be our last. The home is well equipped with everything we need after a long day of travel with our 2 pups in tow, and the neighborhood is great for a long walk after many hours in the car. We will be making this home our go-to spot for overnights in Montgomery as we travel back and forth from Florida to Illinois."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thus home is conveniently located to the interstate, downtown, and many great restaurants. We didn’t have a chance to walk around the neighborhood, but there were many beautiful streets filled with historic-looking homes. It is still up-and-coming in certain pockets, so be mindful of your surroundings - Julie and Michael are helping to restore the area which is pretty cool. The bedrooms were spacious, the art is incredible, and the ping pong table is a nice touch! We loved having the fenced in yard for our pups. Definitely visit Can A Brotha Get A Slice for great pizza when you go - just 2 mins from the house! Enjoy Montgomery!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect. Location. Value. Comfort. That bed! Loved having the fenced backyard for the pup. Walked to downtown, sidewalks all the way. Pretty decor. Nice shower. I turned on the Pac-Man game for nostalgia. Julie & Mike were very responsive and helpful.
My pup says, ""Hey, wait a minute, what about the floor grate that locked me in the bedroom?!"" LOL. She follows me immediately. I got to the back door and realized she wasn't with me. I went back to find her frozen. Showed her how to exit through the bath and 2nd bedroom. Other than that, she approves wholeheartedly. Seriously, I think we saved around $200 not staying at a hotel with the pet fees."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is amazing! It was just as described and my family loved it! The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The fenced backyard was amazing for my husbands service dog! My kids loved the game room and played PacMan a lot during our stay. Julie and Michael were extremely responsive and were amazing hosts! We will definitely be staying here whenever we are in town!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home in an even lovelier neighborhood. Well appointed, clean and comfortable. This was a great place to stop for the night with our two dogs on our trip from Florida to Illinois. Julie was very helpful and responsive. If you stay here and have time, do yourself a favor.. take a right out the front door and go for a walk in the neighborhood. It's a really lovely area with lots of gorgeous older homes. It was perfect for a good long morning walk with the dogs before we had to spend another long day in the car. The home is also super close to the highway and very easy to find after a long day of travel."

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was okay it would’ve given it a higher rating but there were two giant roaches in the bathroom and I am afraid of roaches. They were probably there due to the rain storm that happened earlier to be fully transparent.

Ideal for families that are okay with sharing a ""Jack and Jill"" style bathroom. Older bathroom, not the best lighting in the bedrooms, but extremely spacious. Host were super responsive."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a quick stay overnight and found everything to be as described, very clean, a very comfy bed and linens, and great shower. Although we didn't utilize the kitchen it was well appointed! Justin's place has lovely decor and furnishings and is has a quiet and warm atmosphere.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in quiet neighborhood. The only issue that we had was with parking as the driveway is shared with two other homes. We had four cars, so that made it a bit tight, but we could have requested garage access and did not.
Home was absolutely impeccable and so cozy for our family. The kitchen and all the bathrooms were luxurious and all the beds were cozy. Our 3 year PD daughter loved playing in the enclosed yard. Highly recommend this home!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveled to Montgomery with a friend to play the Robert Trent Jones golf courses in the area. We stayed April 22-26, 2024. The location of the property to I-85 was perfect for us. The home is an older home, which has been very nicely renovated. It is very clean and all the appliances, including the washer and dryer, are brand new. The bedrooms have medium firm mattresses and were very comfortable. There are motion activated lights under each bed and also in the laundry room and when activated stay on for approximately one minute. The backyard is very nice with a swing and rocking plastic chairs.
The only inconvenience we had with the whole stay was the queen bedroom has no plug in for your phone by the bed. This is a pain but nothing that made our stay any less than five stars.
The hosts Suraiya and Jonathan were great. Any question I had was answered in less than 15 minutes. I would stay here again and would recommend this home."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such great host! Great location. Perfect for my family dinner.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have only good things to say about this unit and the hosts. They make our travel days more anticipated than dreaded and give relaxing bookends to long weeks away that only come once a year. If ever your vacation or visits with loved ones do not go as planned, plan to make a ""serenity now"" stop at this sweet backwoods lodge. There is every option for kicking back from a firepit and flat screens to corn hole and rocking chairs on the patio. Its like a family lock in - where everyone can be a kid for a night. We bring a scooter and hoverboard because of the big patio and open floor plan and we always sleep hard after watching movies and chatting around a campfire, recalling the best parts of our adventure or dreaming up the next one. Thanks"

The Airbnb is so spacious and open. We feel very relaxed while there. We look forward to going back at our next visit!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic!! Super clean, comfortable, lots of extras (snacks, coffee, tea, toiletries, etc.), and very peaceful. Mikel’s place exceeded our expectations and was the perfect place to stay for the night on our drive from OH to FL."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"While our stay was short, it was exceptional!! The rental was even better than the pictures showed! The space was clean, nicely decorated, and peaceful! Mikel gave clear directions to help us find the place. We will definitely be back!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Mikels place. The until was clean, well equipped, and comfortable. Mikel was responsive and flexible with our check out, which was a huge blessing. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Mikel’s place was exactly as described. The large front room was perfect for entertaining and watching sports and the bedroom and bathroom were very large with plenty of space. Would book again next time we are in the area.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very laid back place. Peace and quiet, and nicely secluded"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far one of my best stays to date! Super cute and stylish space, they didn’t s great job with renovations! I’m only saddened that our very short stay didn’t allow us to truly enjoy this space. The host was extra accommodating in allowing us to check in early as well.
I highly recommend this location! 10 out of 10!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The Get Away Garage was awesome. Super cool place with a super cool host. Totally enjoyed our stay a Mikel's place. Would highly recommend staying at Mikel's place if you are in the area. Had a great time interacting with Mikel.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay in this unique garage apartment. A lot of detail went into the design and decor. :-) They had everything we needed and more!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! It looks even more beautiful in person than the pictures. Two of us went on a long weekend getaway and it was so perfect. Every room had so much space and was beautifully decorated. The place was extremely clean and comfortable with every amenity thoughtfully provided. The shuffleboard was a lot of fun too! The location is awesome because it's quiet and private yet only a few miles from the interstate and stores, yet you'd never know it. The host was always super responsive and so helpful. Very much look to another visit at the Garage Getaway!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The outside wasn't as private or secluded as it seemed in the photos, but don't let that deter you - the inside is beautiful. Everything was very comfortable. If you're wanting a place to relax (which is what we wanted), it will definitely suit your needs. The bedroom is so dark and quiet - the perfect place to sleep. We did have an issue with the internet, but thankfully it was our last day, so it wasn't a big deal. Also, we couldn't use the ceiling fans/lights in the main room due to the lights flickering, but the other overhead lights worked very well. Definitely worth the price and would recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you arrive on the red dirt road, you think you are in the COUNTRY. But you aren't really. You are within 5 minutes of shopping, restaurants and Walmart. It was a perfect location for us. The house was CLEAN and cutely decorated! I have family in the area and we will be using this house, again. If you are thinking of renting this place look up things in Millbrook to do."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! We’ve stayed 4 times now and every time it’s perfect!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot. Driveway was gravel with some potholes so don’t drive something too low there, but other than that it was an absolutely perfect place to be"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but this place was so perfect.. comfortable, very clean, spacious, equipped with everything you need, it was absolutely beautiful and we highly recommended this place. We will definitely be back."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quite place to stay outside the city, but still close enough to get anywhere quickly"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’m a repeat guest and will continue to be so. The place is spotlessly clean, extremely well stocked, spacious with a fantastically comfortable king size bed. It’s set in a beautiful area with gorgeous mature trees, yet close to anything you need in town. The hosts are phenomenally welcoming and helpful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very creative!!!! The rooms were HUGE! We really enjoyed this AirBNB different and spacious. Stores and things to do was literally 5-6 minutes away. We had so much fun
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable very unique!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"First impressions matter, right? Well, I contacted Mikel to confirm the distance to Wind Creek Casino in Wetumpka, and he responded within minutes. Wind Creek Casino is only a 20-minute drive away if you're a fan of the casino. When we arrived, I discovered that the photos did not do this place justice. The garage was not only beautifully decorated, but it felt like Alabama and Tennessee had a baby, LOL. The cabin-like atmosphere throughout the garage made us feel like we were in the Smoky Mountains. The garage is well-equipped for a short or long stay, and the freshly laundered bed linens smelled amazing. The king bed in the master bedroom was extremely comfortable, and did I mention how clean everything was? My husband was skeptical about the location because he assumed the garage was too remote based on pictures in “Maps” but the garage was situated in a secluded, yet convenient drive to the interstate. We really enjoyed our stay, and we plan to return soon !"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Squeaky clean, about five minutes from interstate but private, good night's sleep, awesome amenities, nice set-up"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Even better in person! This was such a great stay!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Immaculately clean, warm friendly hosts. There is so much space inside, and it’s set in a beautiful peaceful area with lots of nature around. Very well stocked with anything you would need to cook. A kitchen that I’m truly jealous of. Also has a game table just for fun and a lovely fire pit area outside."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love the cabin feeling and the great furnishings

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Location was close to I-65 for convenient travel stop. The whole place was extremely clean with all the necessary amenities. We only got to stay briefly passing through for spring break, but it would be definitely worth stopping by for a longer stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough about this jewel. It’s IMMACULATE and has everything you need. Comfortable, quiet, ultra easy to get to. This garage unit is large with extra amenities for comfort and we were there for an entire week. Even lost a key to our trailer hitch lock and Mikel arranged for an absolutely delightful young man to cut it off at 7pm at night…. No charge. Who does that? Highly recommend!!!!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Better than the pictures!!! Real barndominum feel.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Extremely pleased. Mikes place is the cleanest most cozy Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Mike was very responsive to my questions and very flexible with our stay. Clean, attention to detail on every aspect of the home. Very roomy, bed was comfy, and very quiet surroundings, while only being 5 min from the main Highway. Good pricing. They even left us a welcoming gift and snacks. Highly recommend. Thanks again!!!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place and exactly as advertised. The rental was squeaky clean. Mikel was responsive and communicated within minutes any time we needed something. The location is private and peaceful but a short drive to local shopping and amenities. Great place and will definitely come back.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was most pleasurable! The host checked in several times to make sure we had everything we needed during our extended stay. The place was spotless upon arrival. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking. The location was very private and peaceful, but quick access to stores and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! Loved it!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was immaculate and was exactly like the photos! The whole family was super nice and very responsive. First night there saw a huge deer walking right down the road. Perfect quiet getaway location.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the stay here, we chose this place last minute, in time of need for a place to stay for the night, and it was stunning!! Cleaner than any hotel, Airbnb, or condo I’ve ever stayed in, amenities were top tier, they even had Roku TV and several activities and made a house so far away, feel like home. Would highly recommend, and we hope to stay again in the future! I appreciate everything and all that the Host puts into this place, it is beautiful!!"

The garage door we will definitely we back to check out because this trip was just too hot lol. The host was awesome and on time every step of the way! Thanks so much for sharing your little humble getaway with us!
2022-07-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Mikel is an excellent host with a well-appointed and beautifully decorated place. This apartment is conveniently located to the interstate, restaurants, and shopping.
We had an issue with the beds. The king-sized bed was as hard as a rock and caused back and hip pain among our family members. The Murphy Bed mattress sunk in the middle and was not at all comfortable.
Perhaps the most concerning thing was the automotive smell that permeated the entire apartment. If you have breathing issues such as asthma, you might want to think twice before staying here. One of our family members had trouble breathing while in the apartment.
Everything we had with us at this apartment had to be washed, because it had this ""oily"" automotive smell to it.
If you're not sensitive to any of the above, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this peaceful retreat."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely awesome getaway for anyone traveling to Montgomery or just passing through! The secluded property and privacy offered here is unmatched. Access to I65 and the close proximity to everything you need is also superb. Mikel is equally a great and super responsive host!!! We will be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for our golf trip to Capital Hill. Very clean, and convenient to both courses we played."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best AirBnB’s I’ve stayed at. Very clean, well stocked, and a cool little place. My kids loved the Murphy bed and the shuffle board. Very secluded but only 10 minutes to Prattville where there are a ton of shops (Bass Pro, Target, Ulta, etc). Lot of places to eat here as well. If you are traveling to the Gulf and need a place to stay for the night, this is a great place as it’s right off I-65. Mikel was very responsive and a great host. Would definitely recommend to others."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying here!! Private, clean, and decorated very nicely!! We will be back!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll never stay in a hotel near Millbrook again, this is it!!! Beautiful, immaculately clean, all new fixtures and appliances, it truly felt like a cozy mountain resort in the middle of Deatsville. Everything is there to make you feel at home, and being so far away from traffic and noise is wonderful, but you’re still so close to restaurants and shopping! This is the perfect place for us to relax after visiting family in the area. Also, Mikel is so gracious and responds very quickly. We had trouble finding the driveway since we used google maps instead of the handy instructions. He immediately messaged us back and guided us to the location, and it was late in the evening. We felt so taken care of. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was clean and very comfortable! It had so much space and lots of fun games to play! Definitely recommend this place!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful house in a lovely and convenient neighborhood. Big rooms and several of them! Two excellent bathrooms and an attractive kitchen. Two different ""living rooms,"" one with the TV. We slept in the quiet back bedroom but I doubt if the front was at all noisy, because it is a peaceful and leafy green neighborhood that was nonetheless close to civilization. An ideal place to stay in Montgomery"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Viktoria's place. It is on a lovely street in a very walkable neighborhood. When asked, we were given several recommendations of where to eat near the house that were helpful. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes and glassware. There was coffee, but no tea, which I did miss being a tea drinker. Overall, a very pleasant stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is very cute and very well kept. Very clean and right down to all the little details were thought of. Will definitely book again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at the house was everything we expected. Great location, the house smelled good and was clean. I stay again if necessary. Thanks to Josh and Viktoria for accommodating us during a very emotional time in our lives."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Welcoming and informative hosts and clean house.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a charming and peaceful place to stay in Montgomery. The east walk to restaurants and tree lined streets made it very enjoyable. The hosts were very proactive and open with communication.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so lovely! Older and with a lot of charm, but with modern updates. Very peaceful, shady neighborhood in close proximity to restaurants and grocery store, and not too far from the highway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful cottage, clean, comfy, newly renovated, excellent front porch, great coffee. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Viktoria and Josh’s place was neat, tidy, and welcoming. Our family of six felt right at home. Sitting on the front porch to catch the cool breeze and wind down refreshed us after our days of driving. The kitchen was excellently stocked with culinary tools which allowed me to easily prepare meals. Everything we needed to regroup and reconnect each day was right on hand. If you are looking to rent a home away from home look no farther!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, good location for us, and had everything we needed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place in a quiet neighborhood!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Had everything you needed and was impeccably clean. We especially enjoyed sitting out in the beautiful porch enjoying the peaceful neighbourhood and lovely flowers.
House was nearby all the tourist spots, but in a tucked away spot that felt so homey and welcoming.
Hosts were also easy to connect with and responded incredibly fast when we had any questions. We will definitely stay there if we are in Montgomery again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and great host. Very communicative and clear instructions. Would definitely recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was absolutely lovely. The host was helpful, attentive and kind. My daughter and I stayed for just one night, but would have welcomed more time there. I enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing in the morning. So peaceful. Would definitely recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were there visiting family and stayed last year. It made such an impression we had to come back. The porch and large rooms are significant reasons for us, as well as the peace and quiet yet close proximity to all the Cloverdale and Huntingdon College spots."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Viktoria's place was very clean and we felt at ease, great location. AAA+"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, exceptionally clean, and in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. We enjoyed restaurants and the Shakespeare Theatre, all within 15 minutes of the house. Viktoria was a great communicator, and even allowed us to check in an hour early, which was very helpful. We will definitely stay again if back in the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was so comfortable and very spacious. It was clean and well-stocked. It was also just a short drive to anything you needed, from stores to restaurants, but tucked off enough to avoid noise and high traffic. The host reached out personally to provide entry and exit instructions. We'll definitely use this location again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recommend Viktoria's place. It was very spacious with a full kitchen. It was also very clean. Although it is an older home, there are many updates. Would have loved to sit on the porch but it was very cold during our visit."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A charming cottage in a lovely neighborhood! My husband felt right at home as soon as he saw the porch swing. Instructions were clearly communicated. It was easy to find, peaceful and we felt safe. We enjoyed watching the gray squirrels. Our only suggestions would be a couple of comfortable chairs in the tv room, a chair and luggage rack in each bedroom. If we are ever back in the Montgomery area we would definitely return to Viktoria's place."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Victoria and Josh were lovely hosts. Their place was great for our needs and very clean. Would recommend and stay again. Safe neighborhood.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful two-night stay! Vicky and Josh were exceptional hosts, providing superb communication and clueing us in on all the surrounding area has to offer.
The cottage has so many YES elements!! For example, my 5 year old was able to utilize the sunroom as a perfect floor drop to play with her American Dolls and accessories. Couches and beds were super comfy to all (over 6 ft hubby included)! All the natural sunlight coming through the windows is good medicine… The whole place gives off a “come on in and be nurtured vibe.” A perfect spot to tuck away and write a book or take an extended rest from the rat race. 🙌🏻
Temperatures were below freezing during our visit and heater works magnificently, toasts the place up fast! I love a good shower and my just-over-five-foot self lingered and still had hot water upon exiting.
Both physically and psychologically warm and inviting, I’m so glad to find this 1920’s jewel! Will definitely book again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay at Vilktoria’s gorgeous cottage! Beautiful home, lovely neighborhood, convenient to all the historic sights. And Viktoria was an amazing host, accommodating several special requests and going out of her way to make our stay perfect. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Victoria’s house in Cloverdale. It is definitely an old home, but was clean and well equipped for any length of stay. While not child proof per se, it was a great place for us and our toddler. We enjoyed swinging on the front porch and daily walks to local parks and coffee."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,This house is so very cute. The most noticeable thing was the cleanliness. Spotless! The neighborhood is wonderful and beautiful. There is a great restaurant nearby called 5 Points Grill. You can walk there. The house was well equipped with everything you could possibly need. I loved it so much that I have already rebooked for my next visit to Montgomery. I give it 5 stars all the way around.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a get away weekend. Quiet neighborhood yet close to downtown. Cottage has the charm of an older cottage with update amenities. I will book again when visiting Montgomery.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious cottage with lots of character. Beautiful inside, amazing front porch and in a very nice neighborhood. Well-equipped kitchen is perfect for cooking. Viktoria and Josh are great hosts!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean, comfortable, and spacious with nice outdoor space and easy parking and access. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Our hosts were great with communication and the check out process was easy and straight forward. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house gave a beautiful retro vibe. It was also very elegant. Loved the swing on the front porch. A nice, quite place to sit and have a cup of coffee.
Viktoria and her husband were good at communicating things, they don't take too long to reply back. I had to call them super late in the night to help with padlock and they were very kind.
Would come back for sure if I'm in the area :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Viktoria's place was fabulous. Lots of room with 2br 2ba, large kitchen, formal dining room, living room, and porch. Beautiful neighborhood about 10 minutes to downtown. Highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vicky and Josh are great hosts. A beautiful home in a lovely, convenient neighborhood. We would definitely stay again if we are back in town."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful home, with charming touches throughout! The floor feels like silk under your bare feet. Lush neighborhood that felt quite safe and so close to good food and good coffee, there's a jazz club within minutes! The bed I used was comfortable and there was plenty of space to hang clothing if necessary. Roku TV. Great communication throughout. On trend with cleaning and service fees and listing check-out requirements, but they only ask that you take out your trash and put dishes in dishwasher and used towels in laundry room, so another bright spot for this lovely space."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time here—beautiful neighborhood, close to downtown, extremely clean, well-appointed, really spacious. We would love to stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,extremely clean and comfortable. The pictures and description were accurate. walkable neighborhood with many different eateries around. easy check-in and check-out. great communication. definitely would stay here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house! Great location! Accommodating and helpful hosts! I’ll try to stay here again! Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So happy with this Airbnb experience! Viktoria and Josh are just wonderful to work with and the house was absolutely perfect! It is a beautifully decorated and updated charming older home. So many extras that made it feel like home away from home. The location was so great for us while visiting the college nearby. We will most DEFINITELY book again if we are ever back in the area. Thank you so much!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Property was beautiful, and there were many perks to choosing this location. Kitchen is fully hooked up with appliances, utensils, even zip lock bags and wine glasses. The washer and dryer was up to date and clean. Detachable shower heads and sink heads throughout home. The one day we had relaxing time we really enjoyed the front porch as a family. Loved the swing and the neighbors who walked during the day seemed generally friendly too. Somewhat diverse neighborhood, so we felt very comfortable during our stay.
Con: There is only one TV, and it’s in the living room. In our case we had family staying in second bedroom so it would have been nice to have a personal TV for when it’s time to wind down in your own space, but of course that is definitely not a deal breaker especially when everything else was absolutely impeccable. If we stay again I will just remember to bring my laptop or something to use instead.
Overall I very much recommend this location A+!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Viktoria's Airbnb was a charming and spacious old house. It was quite clean and well stocked with all the essential stuff we needed. The front porch was my favorite space.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Viktoria’s home was a bit older, however, it had a bunch of space and met our needs. It was in a good location and within 10-15 mins of stores and activities. Thank you for hosting us! Viktoria was a wonderful host and provided prompt responses to my inquiries. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely accommodating on all levels i highly recommend this stay to anyone!!!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This house is ADORABLE! It was very clean and centrally located in a wonderful neighborhood. The hosts were very accommodating and personally let us know of the places to eat in the area. This is one place I will be staying again at!!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An exceptionally comfortable and well-located home w/ a spectacular porch and open living areas.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of 3 (parents + teen) had a really great stay at Josh and Vicky’s. The home is just lovely. spacious, and inviting. We enjoyed sitting on the wide front patio and appreciated the a/c when it got hot. Location is a great base for visiting Civil Rights sites. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BEE-YOO-TEE-FUL little house in a very very cozy neighborhood. I walked comfortably around and passed neighbors with their dogs, and nearby is a little park with a creek. Coffee and dining are close, pizza delivers, internet worked flawlessly - everything you need for a comfortable stay in Montgomery :)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Viktoria's place is clean, spacious and airy and very conveniently located! Within walking distance we found a park with a gazebo and playground as well as an array of places to get coffee, lunch, dinner, and drinks as well as do a little shopping. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. We'll definitely stay here next time we're in town to visit family!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect. We visit our mason at Huntington and love staying here. Neighborhood is quiet. House is very clean and comfortable. Great host communication
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Victoria has certain done a lot of detailing to make this Place so charming. Communication was great. Certainly access getting in was easy. Neighborhood was lovely and quiet. And we were only minutes to downtown and to the Air Force Base for our grandson’s graduation.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, perfect for a weekend getaway!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,See previous comments.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Super close to Huntington College. Clean and cozy. Quiet street. Wonderful porch. I wish I could keep this gem a secret as I plan on booking again !!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean place to stay. It was great for my mini golf trip to Alabama.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best advice as you are reading reviews and trying to make a decision about where to stay in Montgomery- is to BOOK this fabulous cottage in Cloverdale- without hesitation! Viktoria and Josh have done an amazing job in making this historic - restored cottage the perfect place to enjoy for a few days or an extended stay.
It is decorated beautifully and it is a calming and serene space. Every glance is a photo. The bathrooms are lovely and the toiletries are divine.
The kitchen has everything you need to have a cup of coffee in the morning or prepare a meal at home. But, located just a quick couple of minutes away- are some absolutely great restaurants! Exceptional!!
My bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to leave it. But, my favorite place was the swing on the front porch!
Very attentive and response hosts and greatly appreciated them!
I am a super host in California and in Cabo, Mexico and so you can imagine that when I am looking for a place- I know what to look for in a listing. This choice was so perfect for me in everything it offered and its location in Cloverdale where I grew up and close vicinity to my family. It will be my home away from home to come home to when I return to Montgomery for future visits. 5 stars!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have asked for a better experience. The house was perfect for the two of us, as well as extremely clean and well-stocked. The communication between the owners was quick and easy. We are so glad we chose the house instead of a hotel, and will definitely stay there again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed at Viktoria’s house and we will definitely be back. The house is so cozy and comfortable, nicely furnished and very clean. The location is very convenient and safe.
Highly recommend."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was immaculate! The beds were extremely comfortable and toasty. This will always be my go to whenever I am in the area!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely neighborhood and place to stay. Great hosts and very clean!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a trip to Montg, close to multiple food & bars, easy access from the highway, and extremely CLEAN!! Renting places in COVID for weekend road trips can be risky and this home was impeccably clean. Host communication was excellent, never had to wait long for responses. Also the pictures underestimate how spacious the house is!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic airbnb in a charming historic neighborhood. Immaculately clean, beautiful decor, comfortable beds, good linens. Very spacious. Wish we'd been spending longer. Loved the swing on the front porch. The owners let us trickle charge our car which we really appreciated. The wifi is very good and reliable. The kitchen is well stocked with modern appliances and modern laundry. Highly recommended we'll definitely be back next time we're in the area."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home has tons of space and character, was super clean, and in a great location. Despite being in a quiet neighborhood, it was only a quick walk away from several restaurants and shops. Bed was comfy, and the kitchen was stocked. Would happily return next time I’m in town."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location in historic neighborhood. Cute home with everything you need. Very clean and check in/out was easy.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our stay in Montgomery, quiet residential spot, safe and lovely. Great restaurants very close, you can't beat El Rey or Vintage Year, amazing."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for over a month while in the area for work and really enjoyed it. The listing photos are completely accurate - the house is well decorated but still comfortable and livable. The essentials and more are already in the house, like soap/shampoo, laundry detergent, and trash bags. We were impressed by the well stocked kitchen with everything there that we could need - plenty of dishes, mixing bowls, measuring cups, sheet pan, glass casserole, pots and pans, etc. We also appreciated the Brita pitcher with extra filters since the home is older that made us more comfortable drinking the water. We found the bed comfortable and the sheets were cotton. Both the A/C and the heat work well. All appliances (laundry, stove, fridge, etc) are older and not fancy but they get the job done. The front porch with swing was lovely and used often. We enjoyed meeting many friendly neighbors there and walking in the quiet and safe neighborhood. The owners responded to an issue during our stay in a timely manner and got someone out to fix it. We felt the pricing for the stay was good. Overall we had a good stay and we would recommend it to others!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very nice - clean and well furnished. While we didn’t cook during our stay, the kitchen seemed well stocked. The beds are comfortable. It is an older house, with all the nooks and crannies and quirks that go with that, but Victoria has incorporated them charmingly into the function of the house. The house is also very conveniently located, both to downtown and the mid city area. Will definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’ve been to quite a few Air B&Bs now, and this one was easily one of our favorites. The neighborhood was quiet, there was a playground in walking distance for our little one, and the house itself was amazing. It looks like it was professionally decorated inside, and there were plenty of amenities for our two week stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Montgomery and we would come back in a heartbeat!"
2024-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Place was extremely dirty, hair in shower, dirty shower door, dirty floors, stained placemats. No extra covers, no paper towels, no bowls. Josh did send a cleaning person to clean the shower, but the whole unit needed deep cleaning and the interruption was frustrating."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,Josh was a very responsive and friendly host. His house is located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay 😊
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wish the stay could have been longer!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an wonderful stay, well recommended."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, Josh was a great host! The house is in a really quiet neighborhood. We were in town for a golf tournament at Wynlakes Country Club which was about a 10 minute drive. The house was pretty clean but some of the furnishings and surfaces are definitely showing wear and tear. Overall, I’d say it was a good stay and with a few improvements it could be excellent for the next guests."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean, and cozy."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh was the most responsive host I’ve ever had. House was nice and clean. Great deal.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the house! Will stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home
Quick response would stay here again ."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a very peaceful and serene spot. The home is located in a cul-de-sac. We barely saw any neighbors or were disturbed at all. My family's biggest concern was the cameras everywhere and the lack of new and used linens and towels. The cameras make it hard to feel at home there. Having to use old towels behind strangers is just not cool. And, these things don't bother everyone, so don't let it stop you from enjoying this great home with such a friendly host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this location. A spacious property in a quiet neighborhood in Montgomery. If you’re looking for a great place to stay with all of the essentials I highly recommend this property.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Wife and I stayed at Suzy’s place for almost a week and enjoyed it immensely. It had everything we needed to make our own meals and more. We loved that we were walking distance to the coolest places, and it felt safe.
Suzy is very understanding and considerate. If we ever come back to Montgomery we would love to stay here again.
Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding/Fabulous place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Would love to come and stay again! Super hospitable and clean
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Suzy’s place so much I was sad to leave. Pictures are accurate and looks even better in person. Modern, cozy, quiet, safe, easy keyless entry and exit, super clean - this place checks all the boxes! Those visiting must be able to climb a flight of steps to enter and also to reach the bedroom once inside. All local attractions are easily accessible within a few minutes’ drive and there are restaurants within easy walking distance. I definitely recommend Suzy’s place to a solo traveler (like me) or a couple!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short, but great stay. The loft was a great option for us and Suzy was very helpful and responsive when we had questions. We really appreciated the off street, gated parking. The neighborhood is walkable with many great stores and eateries clise by. The space was clean, well equipped, and we will definitely stay there again."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suzy’s place was outstanding! It was so much better than a hotel. Lots of room for the two of us, bigger than we expected and ultra modern. Suzy herself was very responsive to all of our questions. We couldn’t have asked for more."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing easy to get to! We had a great stay

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay in Suzy's clean loft. We like a cool bedroom, so we appreciated the unit's two zone a/c, which let us cool down the comfortable queen bed without chilling the entire living area. Gated parking is always a plus, although we didn't find the neighborhood worrisome. Also, probably the longest 2-sink bathroom counter we've ever seen in an Airbnb! The sites we wanted to visit were all within an easy drive. Would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Suzy place was beautiful!! Highly recommended!! Very comfortable and quite!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the best time during my stay at Suzy’s loft. It is a beautiful place that felt like a home away from home. Communication with the host was easy and clear.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed in Montgomery over a 100 nights in the past year and I wish I would have found this listing before. Great location in cloverdale. Clean and comfortable with all of the amenities for a couple night stay. Since i knew the area I was extremely happy to find it near some establishments that I already frequent regularly. I had to extend my stay for an additional 3 nights because of work, and I don’t regret it at all. Suzy is a wonderful host with remarkable response time and a great loft in Montgomery"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suzy’s loft is my favorite place to stay in Montgomery. It is quiet, safe and convenient.

The apartment was spotlessly clean."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect spot for a weekend getaway. The neighborhood has excellent amenities within one block (vintage year, vintage cafe, pine bar, and frenchies), a little market and wine shop (Derk’s), and a nice neighborhood for a morning walk. The condo is a lovely home base. Simple and clean- just as advertised."

Lovely cafe and a few restaurants just feet away. The actual Airbnb was beautiful and cozy, and I even did a lil baking in the kitchen and had what I needed as far as bowls, pans, whisks ect.
Would definitely stay here again when visiting.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suzy has a wonderful cozy little place tucked away from the stress of everyday life. The place feels like home from the time you open the door. It’s next to Alabama St Univ, but it’s the surrounding little shops that makes the place a hidden gem."

2024-06-01,4,Group trip,Cute place. Exactly what we needed for our work trip!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect space for my husband, myself and 2 daughters. Girls were able to enjoy their own space with a bedroom of their own. We are already planning on returning to visit family, hopefully this house is available at that time as well."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay here while on a work trip. They were accommodating when we asked to check in earlier. They were very responsive and answered all of our questions. Great place and nice neighborhood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb is located pretty close to restaurants but you will need a car to get around. Love the decor.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice. There were a few maintenance issues that should be taken care of in order for it to be exemplary such as: hole in the wall of the bedroom next to the master; screens on porch need to be repaired, stopper for bathtub, and protruding small nail heads on seats of dining table stools. The sofa in the living room could stand to be replaced. It sits very low and is difficult to stand up after sitting, especially for elderly people."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Hosts were great. Any concerns were addressed promptly. Will definitely book again if in the area! :)
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place was a good stay overall. Just a few concerns. The sofa was cloth and had a few stains and the dining room chairs were wobbly and we were afraid to utilize them with concern that they will break. But otherwise everything went well.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was everything we expected and more. The hosts did a wonderful job of making us feel at home. My family was able to stay together instead of being split up into multiple hotel rooms. So thankful we found this spot. :)
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Place itself was alright but it could definitely use more attention when it comes to cleaning. The floors were dirty, the bathroom was unclean and we found some unsavory trash in our bedroom. Overall ok for what we needed but I would not have chosen the place if I had known about that"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Jonathan was very responsive and understanding.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for a great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Jonathan’s place! Everything was as described upon arrival and it felt very cozy. I didn’t have many questions, as everything was pretty self explanatory but I somehow missed the labeled dishwasher switch- however my question was answered quickly when I did have a question that arose. Jonathan was a wonderful host, and everything that we needed was available within the home! Would recommend and stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! We enjoyed our stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Traveling through and had everything we needed. Very responsive and clear instructions.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our weekend getaway at Jonathan & Suraiya's home was absolutely wonderful! Their place is not only cute and cozy but also incredibly comfortable, making it the perfect retreat. The attention to detail in the decor and amenities was impressive, and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived.
The location was ideal, offering a peaceful setting while still being close to everything we wanted to explore. The hosts were fantastic, providing clear communication and ensuring that our stay was nothing short of perfect.
We can't recommend this Airbnb enough and can't wait to return for another visit. Thank you for a truly memorable experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a golf trip for four middle-aged days from PA/NY playing the Robert Trent Jones golf trail. The location is very convenient. Our rounds were at Capitol Hill (20 minute drive), Grand National (50), and Ross Bridge (80). There is a Publix and Starbucks 3-4 minutes away.
The cottage was cozy. Easily and comfortably slept 4, but thought leaving the fourth BR without a bed was perplexing.
The house is renovated and the pictures are accurate. I should add that this was a tremendous bargain and value. Would definitely stay here again since we plan on returning to play RTJ again next winter/spring.
The host is very responsive. Not overbearing. We don’t have any issues or concerns so we didn’t need to contact the host during our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and comfortable. The pictures are spot on, They’re very responsive and the neighbors are nice. This is a great place to stay."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great place the bed was real comfortable. great food close by aswell.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was just as described. It is deceptively spacey - it accommodated my four girlfriends and I well. It was very clean, had all the necessities and was very comfy. The hosts quickly responded to questions. After a long day of visiting The Legacy Sites and other historical places, it was nice to return here and relax with dinner, a movie, some wine, and cozy conversations. We enjoyed our time here and would definitely choose to stay here if we return to Montgomery."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful and beautiful place. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn't believe how squeaky clean Jonathan's home was. The kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, the furniture is very modern and I wish we could have stayed longer than 3 days. It was located just minutes off the interstate very close to restaurants, shopping and 20 minutes to the casino.
***I have to reiterate the cleaning once again because he has TOP RATED CLEANERS. YOU won't be disappointed. It even smells clean when you walk in plus he has the guests leave the AC on at 74 degrees prior to leaving which means you will never walk into a hot and humid home.
We loved our stay and can't wait to visit again soon.
Thank you again Jonathan & Suraiya."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jonathan is always responsive. He has agreed to convert one of the homes into a four bedroom which is perfect for my group.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, clear instructions for check in/check out and even a book or local recommendations for food/entertainment. The fenced in backyard and gate make it super pet friendly. We enjoyed Saturday morning on the porch. Thank you for having us and our pups!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Everything was perfect🥰
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Decent place, not so clean …
My wife and I had a contract in the area, so we decided to try AirBnB. We saw that it was a decent place and had multiple rooms. The pictures are pretty accurate!
We wanted something very clean, so we leaned on the reviews that emphasized cleanliness.
That was a mistake.
When we arrived, we noticed a maple syrup smell. The microwave smelled like bacon, so we knew they had breakfast that morning. (If we paid for a cleaning fee, I would assume this would include smells from 5 hours ago since checkout is 11AM & check-in is 4PM.)
Some of the surfaces were dirty/dusty. My wife normally wipes down areas and she noticed her wipes were quite brown.
The bathroom walls had accumulated vapors from the toilets. Imagine yellow water droplets on a wall above the toilet.
The bedsheets had hair in them. A lot of hair.
After 2 hours, their sweet parents apologized and brought new sheets. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars. I wish our experience was like the other comments"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Good for the price!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was great. Accommodated myself, my family and my pups. Location is great and the hosts were very quick to reply to any questions I had."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a find! If you have reservation about booking this, I am here to say. BOOK IT!
The only thing is not a lot of sitting area…need a larger sofa for more than 2 people in your party.
But other than that it is a bang for your buck! Close to so much.
Thanks again for sharing this and the great instructions that went along with the house.
♥️♥️"

Shannon is a great host…friendly & responsive"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house. Well decorated. Nice bedrooms and private bathrooms for each room. Main living area is very comfortable and pretty. Backyard porch and pool are also great spaces to hang out. We didn't go in the water. Weather was too cold in April. My only complaint is there was no wine opener. We searched everywhere. But beyond that we loved our long weekend stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FABULOUS, STRAIGHT OUT OF A MAGAZINE HOME.
It’s walking distance to food, shops, outlets, gas, etc. My family of 4 felt like we were at a private beach house. Everyone had their own private room and bathroom which is a bonus in itself. There is a 5th bathroom downstairs that makes you feel like you’re in a spa. The kitchen gas stove and the appliances were easy to use, she left out instructions for them, very helpful. The beds and furniture are soft and comfortable. The bathrooms are breath taking gorgeous. Her pictures nails it but the experience is beyond words.
The atmosphere gave off a sense of elated heavenly bliss. I felt a sensation of enraptured peace and relaxation in the air making us feel right at home. If we ever come back to AL, this will be the first place we look to stay.
Mrs. Shannon accommodate us as needed, just a message/call away.
Thank you Mrs.Shannon for your superb spectacular hospitality in your amazing home!
The Green Family, NC"

The home is beautifully furnished with a living room seating arrangement that’s perfect for conversations between couples. Although the weather was cold during our visit, the pool and garden area looked very inviting. Plus, there’s a convenient half bath near the pool so swimmers would not have to go inside the house.
The home is close to I-85 and access is easy. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby too.
I would highly recommend Shannon’s Great Escape!"

The house is spectacular. The neighborhood is unique and extremely quiet. Anything you’d might need or want is in close proximity. Should we ever need to be back in Montgomery, she will be our first call!!"

I’ll rent again if I have to come back for work."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing!! Exactly what me and my girl wanted and expected.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thomas’s home is cozy and comfortable! The place is easy to find and very welcoming. It’s on a quiet street and we felt very safe there. Once you open the door, you immediately feel welcome. The A/C was already blowing cold when we arrived, perfect for a hot summer day! Bed was laid out with clean towels on top. There was also a welcome book with fabulous recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I only wish we were in town for more than a day! I had no idea Montgomery had so much to offer! Better than a tour guide!
The kitchen was clean and had all the necessities for eating in. The shower has a good pressure and is easy to use. There are also shower products available to use, which was nice because we forgot to bring soap! There’s also a small dining table to eat at. So much packed into this tiny home, but not cluttered at all! Very efficient. Also the bed and pillows were super comfy.
Lastly but certainly not least, Thomas is incredibly responsive and helpful!"

This is an amazing structure built in a shared yard space. It was perfect for my needs. Affordable, private, and comfortable. 10/10 would choose this place again.
Also, Thomas left a book with recommendations for places to visit during my stay that was very useful. I went to a local cafe that had amazing southern cuisine."

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked last minute on our way through and he accepted fast. Place was a little hard to find just because it’s through a gate. Super friendly and a great communicator. Would stay again.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great !
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect space for me and my small daughter. We were comfortable and had the essentials we needed. We got in the hot tub but I should have turned up the temp before so it was hotter-my error! I have no complaints whatsoever and loved being so close to the capital building and civil rights memorial. It was great to have the booklet with so much useful info about the area too.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was perfect for our needs while visiting. Close to downtown, check in was seemless!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a splendid little nook and home. Has everything you need (A/C, shower, fridge, strong WIFI, etc) in a compact cozy space. Thomas' yellow house is perfect for the wandering solo traveler or local tourist exploring Montgomery's rich civil rights history. Neighborhood was quiet and just far enough away from downtown while great in terms of accessibility to get in and out via simple self check in even during late hours
Much better than a motel for the value and a short hop/skip from downtown. Easy access (5-10 min) to the Legacy Museum, Dexter St Churches, Civil Rights memorials, or Alabama History archives. (~45min East/West to Tuskegee/Selma areas respectively)
Thomas has a perfect welcome booklet with local venue and community recommendations. Felt safe, snug, and welcomed for my couple days stay. Likely to return in the future. Thanks Thomas!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Taylor’s place was amazing for the five days we were there. Place was better than described and easy to get to.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay! The place is beautiful and there is large mouth bass in the pond.
House is immaculate!
Don’t forget to bring body wash, shampoo, etc…"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Taylor was an amazing host. They were very understanding and respectful. They were always quick to respond if we had any questions. The house was very clean and spacious .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our daughter's Officer Training Garduation at Maxwell AFB. The location was 10-15 minutes, depending on traffic. This was very convenient. There are plenty of grocery/retail options close by too. The house was very comfortable, quiet and peaceful. Our daughter wanted home-cooked meals prior to returning to the base for her curfew. She truely enjoyed having a relaxing place to spend some time after having spent eight weeks in military training. We were able to spend time hanging out and catching up with each other by the water. I enjoyed my morning coffee on the screened porch. The beds and linens are very comfortable. I just wish we had more time to spend there!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and some friends decided to take a short golf vacation and stayed at Taylor’s place. Perfect for us and very relaxing after a long day of golf. Much appreciated and it made me look good since I picked it!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a RTJ golf trip. We brought food and cooked there every night while enjoying the porch and back yard lake views. So peaceful and comfortable. Tayler is a great host. Hope to return again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place! Can’t wait to come back! Taylor is simply the best!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every review was accurate, I honestly can’t say enough positive things about this home, it really felt home away from home, photos do no justice, it’s way nicer in person. I’d say one of the best places we’ve ever stayed in. We highly recommend this beautiful retreat! Thank you Taylor❤️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Taylor’s house is fantastic and exactly as pictured. We spent a lot of time in the screened in porch - so peaceful and relaxing. House has everything you need. Master bedroom and bathroom/shower are great. Very close to restaurants, grocery stores and any store you can think of. We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs over the last 2 years and this is in our top 3. We will definitely stay here again when in the area. Highly recommend! Don’t wait to book it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! We were in town for golf and was close to course (Capitol Hill ~10 mins). House was clean and matched descriptions. Would def stay again when back in area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely amazing experience from beginning to end. This home and surrounding property are absolutely beautiful. Pictures don’t do it justice. Amazing for a quiet getaway. Taylor was amazing throughout the entire process and responded promptly to any questions. Can’t wait for my next stay when I’m in the area! Highly recommended and above five stars!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I actually rented another place for our stay in Alabama, once arriving and seeing the place it was unacceptable. I reached out to Taylor actually while I was at the other property to see if she would accommodate my family and myself such last minute. Taylor was very professional and happy to rent her property at the last minute. Thank you so much for helping me and my family. House is on a beautiful piece of property by the water, extremely clean, spacious. House looks exactly like the pictures, just gorgeous. Thank you again Taylor for being so understanding. I will be definitely renting this place in the near future."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect serene setting to stay while visiting my family who lives in Millbrook. The elevator was a must, as I traveled with my folks who are in their 70s and our three small dogs who had to go outside often. We loved the screened in porch to enjoy the pond and commune with nature. The Traeger grill and kitchen were perfect to cook dinners."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unwind. I’m an outdoorsman that was working in in the area and I loved the rustic layout. I will definitely recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the house. We enjoyed the zoo and the lake behind the house. Taylor was extremely helpful. The house was well-stocked and beautiful. The master bathroom was so nice. We would love to visit again when the weather is warmer.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay once again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Check-in was very easy. The view of the water is lovely. The area was experiencing a frigid cold spell while we visited so we really enjoyed the gas fireplace! We used the Traeger pellet grill twice and our suppers had a wonderful smoky flavor! The kitchen was well stocked. We used the crockpot, made pans of brownies in the baking pans, and roasted veggies on the baking sheet. Kitchen has good knives, measuring cups, cutting boards and anything else you may need. Since we stayed a week, we also used the washer and dryer in the big laundry room. The master bed is extremely comfortable and the master shower is wonderfully big with great water pressure. The house is very conveniently located to downtown and to Maxwell AFB. I would recommend Taylor's place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home ♥️ it was a end to the year to remember
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This is the first time that we have rented a home over Christmas and this home didn't disappoint. From the minute we walked in, we felt right at home. Prior to our arrival I had contacted Taylor to ask if she had a couple of kitchen items that we would need for food prep while there. Taylor went out of her way to purchase those items and have them available so that we wouldn't have to bring them with us. She definitely went above and beyond. Cooking Christmas Eve and Day dinners away from home for a family of 6 can be a daunting task. But ours was made a whole lot easier by everything available to us in the kitchen.
The home was warm and inviting with a beautiful fireplace for our stockings. Taylor had even decorated it for Christmas. The home has stunning views off the back screened in porch. We would have loved to have spent time down by the water but weather prohibited it. Maybe next time!
We will definitely rent Taylor's home again for any extended stay in the area!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay and the place is just so beautiful as to the property as well as the location and Taylor is a top notch host! Property is well kept, well equipped, easily accessible, great restaurants in the area and nestled between Prattville and Wetumpka which gives many options of things to do! I am in love with the property! Taylor is on top of making sure from check-in to check-out that your experience is perfect!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic relaxing Airbnb!! Taylor’s communication was the best I’ve ever had. She is quick to respond and really friendly. The thoughtful touches and amenities provided by the host truly made us feel welcome and taken care of. Like the Christmas decorations she put out, which made my family Christmas at her home feel even more special. The pictures do not give justice to how cute this home is decorated and how peaceful the view is in real time. Home smells amazing and is clean. The kitchen had everything and more to cook meals. Let’s not forget the elevator is great to have to bring up and down your luggage. I cannot think of one negative thing about the stay. We can’t wait to come back 😊"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have one word, PARADISE. This property was so beautiful and peaceful. I did not want to return home! Taylor is AMAZING!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The beach area with fire pit was awesome. Also loved the screened in deck. Enjoyed some quiet, peaceful family time sitting near the pond. The backyard is big and plenty of room to throw a ball and play cornhole. The house had a very nice layout and worked perfectly for my family of four! We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Wow! Just wow! The only negative thing I have to say about this home is Im mad it’s not mine lol I’ll miss it forsure!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Very thoughtful and welcoming ,if a problem arose she was right there .We came from Tennessee for my grandsons wedding ,my three sisters and I traveled together .My 2 daughters and granddaughter one from TN.The other flew in from West Virginia .Was very comfortable and fun to be together there ,my son just lives few minutes away but didn’t have room for all of us.He came after wedding spent the day on the little beach playing corn hole with family .Thank you Taylor it was a lovely stay and will recommend you to all my family and friends."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Once we arrived at the house, we immediately wanted to stay longer. The property was beautiful and unique and the house perfectly accommodated all our needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay in this home, the pictures online dont capture just how beautiful it is. So comfortable and well equipped. Lots of room outside for our teenagers and toddler to run, play games and fish. We also really loved the giant dining table for games and sharing meals together!! I would absolutely recommend this home for anyone!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay, and we will be back! This is definitely a place we plan to visit as often as we are in the area. Convenient to restaurants and shopping yet so peaceful and quiet."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This home was AMAZING!!! The pictures are accurate. Beautiful home.. beautiful setting. So clean. Fabulous host. Very peaceful and secluded yet you at a quick 5 to 10 minutes from restaurants, grocery stores and shopping. Stayed here with 2 other couples. Home has a very open floor plan and wonderful outdoor area so never felt I HIGHLY recommend this home. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning and gorgeous home with breathtaking views! We felt like we were in a tropical paradise in Alabama! Great place for relaxing or family activities. Our family loved the place and they want to go back soon! Taylor is a great host and very responsive!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Taylor and her place are both awesome! Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not give this place justice.
Everything was perfect, and the views are incredible. Anyone staying in Montgomery, Alabama ""Millbrook,"" this is a 💎 in the rough. We will be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at Taylor's place very much. And will definitely consider it for future rental property for an escape in the event of a hurricane or our next golf outing at RTJ.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Just as described and very beautiful and clean. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is great.
Just I confused the location by River.
I couldn’t see the River but
The lake and backyard was really cool."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Simply put, we love, love, loved this rental. I have stayed at many Airbnb, but this stay was the most beautiful and comfortable stay, yet! Everything was as advertised. Large rooms, clean and a gorgeous space for families wanting to spend private time together. You will not be disappointed at this stay. Host was on point with communications. This Airbnb rental in Millbrook, Alabama is one of its best kept secret! Go visit and you will agree!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Taylor’s place is beautiful, clean, and comfortable. Outstanding in every way. Definitely coming back."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,A great house and in a great spot! This place was perfect for our golf trip! Very comfortable and beautiful house.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall stay was great, only thing that I didn't pay attention to in the pictures is the deer heads in one of the bedrooms. So one of our guest slept on couch because they were frighten by the deer heads. But like I stated I totally missed that in the pictures, but the images was there. But if your fine with deer heads then this minor detail will not bother you. Taylor was very attentive and informative. The house is beautiful and well kept, I would give it a 10 out 10 even with the deer head if I'm being honest."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is peaceful and quiet yet just minutes from many stores and restaurants! The home had everything needed and more! The outdoor sitting areas were so nice! This is one of our favorite Airbnb stays, you won’t regret this one."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in a great location.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was in a great location and made for the perfect, peaceful weekend getaway. We loved the backyard and beach area, and my kids absolutely loved being able to fish each night. The home was just a quick drive to lots of great restaurants, but also had everything we needed to stay in and cook meals. We will definitely keep this on our list of places to return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were on a road-trip and required a last minute stay in Alabama store heading to Arkansas. We found Taylor’s house and she accommodated us on a very last minute basis. Taylor’s house was everything we could have asked for…peaceful surroundings, well decorated, clean, large yard for my daughter’s service dog, friendly neighbors and a convenient elevator to make transporting our luggage into the house a breeze…not to mention the beautifully equipped master bathroom! We arrived late at night so I will mention that coming down the dark road and seeing all the RVs made us think we were in the wrong place, but as we proceeded to the private road we were met with beautiful waterfront homes that felt private and secluded from the rest of the area. I share this information only because I don’t want others to think they’re in the wrong place. I’m quite picky when I rent places so I can assure you Taylor’s home will NOT disappoint! Thank you Taylor for taking such good care of us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay. This is a beautiful property and conveniently located to anything you want to do in the Prattville/Montgomery area. Only a 14 minute drive to RTJ Capital Hill. I highly recommend this property, you will not be disappointed. We plan on booking it again next year!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a must Stay!
Very beautiful property with amazing view, all the amenities and very well stocked with everything you need to make you feel right at home!!! Definitely a 5star!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The beach area by the lake was awesome, caught some fish, enjoyed the sun and the scenery. We cooked Father's day dinner on the grill! Will definitely come again.
***my wife left her wallet there on accident, before we were halfway home... Taylor reached out and told us we left it and sent it to us overnight ups. She is a great host and we are very thankful. If your in the area, this is the place to stay!!!👍✅️"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a fantastic experience at Taylor's home. Our goal was a quiet, peaceful home to relax within a short drive to the RTJ Golf Courses; Taylor's home met all of our expectations.
The home is approximately 10-12 min drive from Capital Hill and several restaurants in Prattville. It sits just a short drive off the main highway in a peaceful setting with a few very nice homes nearby. The property is very clean with a well-manicured lawn and grounds, and a beautiful private ""beach-like"" area next to the lake in back where you can relax by the fire, play corn hole, or cast a line.
Inside, the decor reminds me of a mountain lodge in the Smoky Mountains with modern amenities, there large rooms, comfortable beds, and an awesome Master BR/Bath.
Taylor as very helpful; quickly answering all of our questions and offering recommendations for dining or entertainment. She was friendly and accommodating throughout our stay and during checkout. I would absolutely recommend her Millbrook home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying at this peaceful location! The house was the perfect size for us and fit all our needs. The river and dock were so fun for the kids to fish in! We loved sitting on the screened patio drinking coffee and taking in the view as well! Taylor was very responsive, sweet and accommodating with the few things I inquired about before arrival! The location was perfect for getting to local convinences, restaurants, stores and neighboring towns. We very much enjoyed our stay and hope to stay again in the future!"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Taylor’s house was the ideal location for our family vacation. As a family of 6, including a toddler, Taylor’s home was outstanding both inside and out. Set on a beautiful piece of property with its own small beach area, spacious interior that’s nicely decorated with plenty of space including a screened in deck, we were able to enjoy leisurely family time while being an easy 15 minute drive from the Montgomery sites. Taylor was accessible and quickly responded to any queries. We highly recommend!"

Stayed for a week with wife, mom-in-law, two children and two dogs - couldn’t have been more pleased. Taylor was super responsive from checkin to checkout and everything was perfect!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for 7 days and enjoyed every minute of it. We spent a lot of time on the big screened in back porch overlooking the lake. The beach area was also very clean, easy access and good fishing. Grandkids loved it. Inside of the house was even better than the pictures. Very clean and well arranged. TV in every room including back deck with great channels. It was raining first day we got there. But no problem, just pull under the house go up in the elevator. The owners were very professional but also very friendly. The neighborhood was also really nice and peaceful. And just minutes away from everything. We will be going back."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Very nice retreat outside of the busy city but only minutes to the city center. Very convenient. The beds we’re comfortable and plenty of linens.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is absolutely lovely! The bedrooms were very spacious, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the property is peaceful and quiet. Our kids (ages 9, 5 & 5) took a night to warm up to the *extra* guests in the bedrooms 😉, but other than that, we REALLY enjoyed our stay. Taylor was extremely responsive and friendly with all communication. Great home and great host!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,You will not find a better host on Airbnb. Would recommend to anyone and will be back. Do yourself a favor and book.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to relax yet still be close to town. Was perfect for our family and our 10-night stay had no issues or complaints! The place is well stocked and Taylor even left starter laundry pods, coffee pods, etc. so you really didn’t need to run to the store for anything other than food. The views and morning ambiance on the screened in porch are perfect with a cup of coffee. We will stay here again on our Prattville trips to visit family."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice, comfortable, and fairly large place. Taylor was very accommodating with having a Thanksgiving dinner at the place and we greatly appreciated it. Loved the outdoor area as well! I gave everything 5 stars because Taylor did a great job and everything is very nice. Only one thing to note so others are aware! Across the street- the neighbors- had a very well lit up giant confederate flag in their window. While this isn’t an issue for some people, I was a little uncomfortable. This is in no way Taylor’s fault, but it’s something to note for others who may feel uneasy by it! Other than that, Taylor’s place itself was amazing!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Very helpful and the place was very nice.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect place to retreat and relax! This beautiful home is clean and the interiors are well done. I was instantly comfortable when I walked through the door. The outdoor seating area at the pond is magnificent. Screened porch is an ideal place for the first few cups of coffee while listening to the birds chirp. Loved it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time here. My grandson spent the entire week fishing and caught some fish even. He had such a great time. My two daughters spent their time with their mom hanging out on the porch and playing games at the hyge dining table. The house was super clean and had everything we needed to cook all our means. The house was also well stocked with towels and blankets. The poutside covered patio was out favorite spot on the cool days. My granddaughter loved playing on the sandy beach area. My son-in-law made a big firepit the last night and hung out ny the water and watch my granson night fish. Taylor was super fast to respond to all our questions and offer suggestions too. over all it was a great week away from home.

Far enough from everything to have some peace and quiet but close enough to get to a local grocery store and food places. The fishing in the pond was great. We will definitely be coming back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Totally awesome, relaxing, spacious place with incredible bathroom amenities. If planning to cook, there are plenty of spices, condiments, & cookware! Met the sweetest, friendliest, most loving outdoor cat ever!! Was happy to give him/her lots of love 😁"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I honestly can not say enough about this place. It was a week and a half of pure relaxation. The house is beautiful and has everything you could possibly need. The beds are comfortable and the master bath is amazing! The screened in porch was our favorite place to hang out. The beach area by the pond was the most beautiful scenery ever. Taylor is the best host. She was always available to answer any questions. Very respectful to her guests and just all around amazing. I don’t have one negative thing to say about this place other than, I hated leaving. We can’t wait to come back and visit in the fall."

The beach area and firepit were great and all the porches were perfect for watching fireflies and listening to the frogs.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This property is an awesome get away experience!
You have the feels of a countryside. Very clean and spacious. If you need any to grab groceries there’s a Publix super nearby.
It’s far enough to unwind but close enough to stores if you need to grab anything.
Taylor was very responsive, definitely recommend."

All the little touches - remote operated string lights outside and at the beach area, the record player with some nostalgic favorites, the double shower heads in an already giant walk-in shower….
My personal favorite is the screened in porch. Whether it was drinking coffee and watching the sun rise or sitting out with a cold beer while hubby grilled….the only negative is that we couldn’t stay forever!!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot imagine a nicer place to stay in the Montgomery area. Minutes away from everything yet is a private oasis on the lazy river. Quiet, beautiful and relaxing. The home has everything and more. Ideal place to spend a week off the grid with a 4 year old who could not get enough of the beach. Screened porch overlooking the large back space and the water is a classic. Keep your eyes open for the heron.
This home is memorable. I will be back."
