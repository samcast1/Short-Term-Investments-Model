2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The mermaid cottage was super cute and very convenient. It has everything you need. The host was very responsive and friendly. We will definitely stay at the mermaid cottage again when visiting St Marys.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Perfect location. Very quiet. Would stay there again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the house and the neighborhood. We walked the neighborhood twice a day and found the friendliest people! It's quiet and peaceful. I wished I had our bikes with us. I did message the owner about a question with the wifi (she gave us the wrong sign in info), and she never responded. In fact she never responded during our stay, but we figured it out. That was a bit strange. Also, the well water is very smelly, I couldn't drink it. Bring bottled. The house itself is really functional and cute."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I used Lori's Mermaid Cottage to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We like St. Marys and found the Mermaid Cottage close to everything we wanted to do in St. Marys. Lori's descriptions and pictures are accurate, and we found all the amenities to be as stated. We will be coming back to this Airbnb."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We loved our St. Marys vacation and are totally charmed by the town! The Mermaid cottage was just right for the two of us. It was close to all the amenities that the town offers. In fact, we walked and rode our bikes everywhere! Lori was very friendly and gave us lots of tips as to restaurants, beaches, and other local events. We'll definitely be back in the future."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location to explore Cumberland Island and we enjoyed our stay.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,mermaid cottage is well located to St. Marys. The host was hospitable and accommodating.
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house with a great layout for our travel needs that unfortunately is a bit tired. The kitchen is well equipped and the living/dining room comfortable. Beds were also comfortable.
Neither bathroom sink stopper worked and there were bowls under the sink to collect water; we replaced one small bowl with a much larger one when we realized there was a problem. The sole chair in each bedroom had cracked plastic seats. A good spring cleaning is probably warranted.
The cottage was in many ways perfect for my husband and me and our niece but unfortunately, without a thorough cleaning and some updates I can't give a rave review."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay. Lori was easily reachable and responsive. The front porch is a perfect spot to watch the sunset! And the backyard, fire pit looked so inviting! ￼"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cottage was comfy and each bedroom had its own bathroom. Walkable to St Mary’s historic center. Lots of antique shops. Beautiful and quiet town. Two great restaurants are Local’s and Riverside Cafe. Friendly town!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved St Mary's and the Mermaid Cottage. We brought bikes and biked downtown. Enjoyed hiking at Ft Clinch State Park and Cumberland Island. It's a great refresh! We will definitely come back and stay at the Mermaid Cottage. Lori was quick to respond when we had questions. Great host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was even cuter in person! Very clean! I will definitely be back when I have to stay out of town again. Thank you guys!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to Georgia to visit our daughter. The location was perfect! She even stayed the night with us after work and the bedrooms were perfect! They allowed for privacy and she was able to sleep and we didn’t have to tip toe around. Lori was very responsive when we couldn’t get the lock to work but her daughter loved right across the street.
Overall it was great! We would stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Greet place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an adorable cottage very close to downtown St Mary's. As I get older, the comfort of the beds is important to me, and the beds are VERY comfortable. Everything you need in this cute cottage. A/C great. More importantly, the host is close by and she went above and beyond when I needed to change my travel dates due to a family emergency. If you want someone who is sympathetic and not just in it for the money, pick this place-and this host."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage for a couple or maybe 2 to stay. Bed in 2nd bedroom a little small, but didn't matter as there were only 2 of us. Clean, easy to find, and had the essentials!! Wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage was amazing. It was in the perfect location close to Downtown St. Mary's. From the time we checked in until we checked out we felt so relaxed and at home. Lori did a fantastic job making sure that everything was available to make our stay enjoyable. The beds were comfortable and we loved the tiled open Shower. Just what I would want in my home. After a long day exploring we looked forward to returning to the Mermaid Cottage! We will definitely be back for a visit, hopefully for a longer time period. Thank you Lori for reaching out to us and welcoming us back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and location. Will come back and stay in the future!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Mermaid Cottage was perfect for my husband and I traveling with one teen. We stayed two nights in order to explore Cumberland Island.
The house was a little far from the restaurants to walk to dinner in the summer heat, but it was a quick drive. The AC worked beautifully and the beds were comfortable so we slept well. The linens were clean and plentiful, and the kitchen was well supplied. The overall cleanliness was fine, but I would not describe it as spotless. The layout of the cottage provides good privacy for the bedrooms and the main living area is spacious.
We had a comfortable stay at Mermaid Cottage."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nicely situated just outside of downtown. Quiet street with large kitchen.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was very responsive to any questions or needs I had. Her family lives close by so that made it super convenient if we needed anything . Super friendly and knows the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori was a great host, very quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed upon arrival. The cottage is well stocked and has a great layout with two good sized bedrooms and bathrooms and a great open plan kitchen/living area - it was also VERY clean when we arrived. Location is great for a trip to Cumberland Island being just a couple of minutes from the ferry terminal"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mermaid Cottage is a gem in St. Mary's! My mom and I visited for four nights for a wedding and were very pleased with the accommodations. The house was clean and the layout was perfect for my mom and I to each have our own bedroom and bathroom. We enjoyed having a full kitchen to make breakfast each morning, and used the washer and dryer once during our stay. The location is very close to downtown St. Mary's. It has beautiful views on the water, a lovely park, and several tasty restaurants and shops just a few minutes away. We also made a 1.5 hour trip to Savannah and a 40 minute trip to Amelia Island, Florida. Both easy destinations to reach from Mermaid Cottage. Lori was very responsive to my questions and had great suggestions on where to eat and things to do during our stay. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. My mom and I felt very safe. I highly recommend planning a stay at the Mermaid Cottage!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy summer nights on veranda in quiet area. Walking distance to harbour for ferry

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Mermaid Cottage was excellent. It had everything we needed and was in a nice location. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was full-sized. Everything in the cottage worked great; we particularly liked the layout of the bedrooms situated on each side of the house with en suite bathrooms. Thanks for a pleasant stay, Lori!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely would come back as the decor and design were so welcoming. The mermaid cottage felt like home away from home. Two bedrooms and two baths. Showers were great. After our forays into Crooked River State Park and Cumberland Island, the washer and dryer were a plus. Fabulous local restaurants."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved St. Marys. Lori was very responsive. We brought bikes and were able to bike to shops and restaurants. The cottage was as described and was perfect for two couples.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was an excellent host - very responsive, made sure I didn’t have trouble with the lock (it was fine but nice of her to check in!), and very kind when we met during mowing time!
The cottage was fantastic for us - it would also be a great set up for two couples as there is a full bath and bedroom separated by closets off the main living area!
We walked to the historic downtown several times over our three days there, so very close!
The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with most equipment I would need (though this Hawaiian family brought our own rice pot - that wasn’t there. 😂) and plenty of utensils, plates, glasses, etc.
I’d stay here again - or have family use it when they come to visit since we are moving there in a few weeks…."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Mermaid Cottage really is a very sweet place and we enjoyed it from the moment we walked through the trellis arch of sweet smelling jasmine. The cottage is clean and very well laid out for a small house. The kitchen is good sized and well equipped. Each bedroom enjoys its own bathroom with a large, tiled shower. This is a wonderful place to stay if you are ferrying out to Cumberland Island each day for a few days. The ferry service is just minutes down the street and provides ample area for parking. As the photographs clearly show, one of the beds is against an interior wall. So for a couple in that room, one member will have to do a delicate dance to quietly extricate themselves for any middle of the night bathroom trips.
We were there for three nights and it was no problem. For a more extended stay it could become inconvenient. All in all, this is a sweet cottage for a brief stay and it is definitely a great value."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this adorable cottage. The jasmine was in bloom during our stay and it smelled divine walking through the arch. Home is clean and good location. Super cute decor!! Wish the sofa was a little more comfy, but other than that - everything was perfect. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was great! Everything was fantastic and would highly recommend. If we visit again, we will certainly reach out to Lori. Thanks so much!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Once inside, it is the perfect little place! Was excited about being much closer to the water and restaurant's than I expected."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The mermaid cottage is a really cute house in Saint Mary and it's a short drive to the ferry over to Cumberland Island. The bedding was very comfortable and the kitchen met all of our needs. I would definitely come back. Lori was a wonderful host and very attentive.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Extremely well stocked. I bought bar soap and detergent but that was fine. The kitchen was stocked with very nice things and over and above the norm.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would return again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I fell in love with this cottage at first sight. With its welcoming fragrant arch of flowers guiding us to the front door, we entered the warmth and coziness of this charming cottage. Everything we needed was available to help us feel we were home away from home. While my daughter enjoyed sleeping in, I enjoyed my coffee and reading in the quiet mornings on the covered porch. Of course, I understood why she slept in, the beds were amazingly comfortable! That’s a huge blessing when you’re needing a great night’s sleep. Just can’t say enough about how perfect this place was for our needs :)
The location was also good for day trips to the nearby islands and other places of interest. I really hope we are able to visit again someday."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little cottage! We were only passing through for a night, but after getting inside, we wished we could stay a few days. Layout was perfect for 2 couples, but would still be cozy for a couple or single. Having 2 baths was a big plus for us. Good communication from Lori plus local recommendations. We’d definitely stay again if back in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The mermaid cottage is adorable! Super cute, really clean, and close to everything."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was wonderful. It is one of those rare places that when you walk in it feels like a home away from home. Very rarely does that. Loved the decor and ceilings.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,My wife and I needed a place for a month to see our new grandson. We could not have picked a better place to stay. July was hot with lots of rain. The a/c and covered porch were fantastic. The cottage is so charming and spacious. The host gave us great things to see and do while we were there. She was spot on with the 4th of July parade and fireworks. We will be back. Thanks Lori ps. My wife loved the novels in the cottage. I think she read 6 of them.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is an adorable little place to stay! We went with our family of 4 and it was the perfect place.

We had plenty of dressing room for the wedding, the ceiling fans offered respite from the running around. Bedrooms are so private and offer noise barrier. Front porch was so nice to sit on and watch the wildlife. Neighbors are very quite and clean we didn't even know they were there. Lots of vintage shopping by the way :)"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m sitting on the dock by the North River at Don’s place in St. Mary’s. It’s 8 am on a Friday morning and I just heard the peak of a church bell in the distance. The only other sound is that of the birds talking to each other in the numerous beautiful oak trees. Old trees. Southern oaks mainly. Now, I believe I hear an owl. Then a rooster or two or three joins in. One is saying goodnight to the other’s good morning. Enough about that. There is a lovely, gentle, slightly cool breeze and the only smell comes from the cup of coffee I brought out with me to sit on the dock. I’ll taste it in a moment.
Having never been to Kimblehouse on the river, I could not have chosen a better place to spend some much needed down time, to destress and unwind. Thank-you sincerely Don and Annie for all the hard work you put in this place not only for yourselves but for others too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,went away to Don's for a long weekend away with the wife. Enjoyed relaxing on the dock with the beautiful view and enjoyed the (relatively) nearby state parks. highly recommend Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island for a pleasant walk and cool scenery.

This setting is a great place to just kick back and a great location to get the ferry for Cumberland Island."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being someone who has lived nearly 50 years in GA, the St. Marys area is still one of the “ hidden gems” in the state.
Don and Anne’s semi remote location gives one that secluded feel. Everything is top notch, first rate and both of them are friendly, accommodating, and helpful. They and their accommodations are both 5 star down the line."

Don gave us great recommendations for local eateries and had bicycles available to us in the event we wanted to go for a quick bike ride. He and his wife, Annie, even took us out on a quick boat ride which was above and beyond expectations. We even saw dolphins and other wildlife. What an amazing time we had with them. We will be back on a regular basis as they made us feel like family. Can't wait until we see them again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don's place was absolutely wonderful. We were welcomed with a personal welcome sign from Don & Anne, snacks, and water.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have very busy schedules, and so we booked Don's listing last minute to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary. Don greeted us when we arrived and was so kind and welcoming. When we first walked in, we were so focused on how cozy it was and the beautiful view, we didn't notice all the little details until we started settling in (a personalized welcome sign wishing us a happy anniversary, snacks, water, makeup remover wipes, organized binder of things to do, etc). My husband and I sat out on the dock and were so at peace. This property is exquisite and was just what we needed to unplug and get away from the noise. It's obvious a lot of hard work and love went into their home, and we dream of owning a place like theirs one day. We can't wait to stay again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot to get away and convenient to nearby Amelia Island. Super comfy and clean! Don and his wife have a done a great job to provide a top notch place. This was a stop for a work trip but got one day of play over nearby Amelia Island. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends and family! Thanks Don and Annie!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,OMG! The best day ever! Don’s place is absolutely gorgeous it was very tentative very responsive one of the best hoes I probably have ever had through Airbnb!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’s place is truly a gem. A must stay if in the area. Clean, on the water, gorgeous sunsets, peaceful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic gem we found with this stay! Had all the amenities of home … and then some. Don greeted us and gave us a a little of the backstory of this magnificent home … which we later indulged more in their photo documentary photo album of this amazing space that they have created. We started our days with yoga on the covered doc … brunch out on the back patio with the therapeutic sounds of their well placed fountains and the serene quiet … topped with an amazing view of the inlet. A comfortable and cozy space … close to all the outings we had planned for this stay. They were kind enough to loan out their bikes that we enjoyed pedaling thru their neighborhood. A glimpse of the good life that Don & Annie get to experience everyday. If we ever are in the area again, we will book with them again! A true home away from home!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don & Anne’s place is hands down our favorite Airbnb we have ever stayed at! The place was beyond perfect and had everything we needed and more. Don was so nice and hospitable and made us feel at home! They gave us some awesome restaurant suggestions as well. This was the first place we have stayed at that we had a hard time deciding if we wanted to go find something fun to do, or just stay and enjoy how amazing the house was!
We absolutely loved the access to the dock overlooking the water. The sunsets were beautiful! A perfect place to sit and relax, which was exactly what we were looking for for this trip.
Can’t wait to come back again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Annie's place is a true ""slice of heaven"". Our stay of 3 nights just wasn't long enough. They are superior hosts and the accommodations are beyond excellent. We hope to get back to visit real soon.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don's home is amazing. The pictures do not even do it justice! I've never stayed at an Airbnb where I was more blown away upon arrival! The room is great, clean, and has everything you need. You have a gorgeous view of the river. Don is the most gracious and wonderful host. Will definitely be back. Don also let us use bikes as we biked around. We took the ferry to Cumberland Island, which was gorgeous! We had a great time!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend Don's place for visiting St. Mary's. Downtown is only 10 minutes away and his spot on the river is oeaceful and beautiful. We will definitely consider Don's if we make a return trip!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"STAY HERE!! Everything about this house is 10 stars! Supremely comfy house, totally relaxing fountains in the backyard and amazing dock seating (somehow there was ZERO spiderwebs/bugs…how is that possible?!?)…a complete oasis. Don was an amazing host…he made our weekend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic weekend getaway on this beautiful slice of heaven! Cumberland Island did not disappoint and Don gave us a wonderful dinner suggestion. He was an incredibly thoughtful host and even left us some lawn chairs to take to a music festival he informed us about. I can’t say enough great things about our weekend away! Thank you Don and Annie!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding! Don and Anne’s place was was perfect for our weekend getaway. We’re looking forward to returning to this gem.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank, had a great time"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint with every amenity you need. Don and Annie were excellent host and very informative.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Annie’s ground floor apartment is clean, nicely decorated, incredibly well equipped ( full stove, microwave, large fridge freezer, wonderful king sized bed, and roomy bathroom and shower. The apartment is a showpiece, but the view surpasses it Guests have the use of the screened in porch, or the raised dock. We enjoyed using the supplied bicycles and happened upon a plein aire art contest in town. All in all a wonderful stay. We would highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience! We especially enjoyed sitting on the dock in the morning and evening with a gorgeous view of the salt marsh. Very comfortable accommodations and gracious, attentive hosts!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and this location are amazing! We had everything we needed and more, and he was very attentive if we had questions but was never intrusive. Beautiful space, added every little touch like items in the kitchen, bathroom, and some sweets and snacks even in the living room! Also let us borrow his bikes for Cumberland. Can't say enough about how great this was!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description of Don and Anne's ""Kimblehouse on The River"" is everything shown and more. They exude Southern Hospitality at its Best! 5+ Stars all around! If serenity is what you are looking for - then this is the place. The Gardens are Gorgeous, The Sunsets Magnificant, and the hosts are so welcoming. We hope to visit again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect, peaceful place on the water! We stayed here for a couple of nights and took a day trip to Cumberland Island. Highly recommend this cozy guest suite!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a relaxing getaway with beautiful sunset views, look no further! This is a comfortable, well-appointed apartment on the first floor of the hosts’ home that is complete with everything you need for your stay. We absolutely loved fishing from the dock and the ability to grill our catch right on the spacious screened in porch. Suggestion: head to Buccaneers, grab some shrimp, and throw it off the dock to catch whiting, croaker, and even crab! Don was accommodating and offered advice without being overbearing. The yard and neighborhood has majestic old growth trees with Spanish moss growing abundantly. A perfect vacation!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Lovely garden/river setting. We were able to use the dock for a River cruise, which was super convenient. The unit was spacious and had everything we needed, particularly for a longer stay. I wish the weather would have cooperated…we missed having a sunset. Quiet and peaceful!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time visiting Kimblehouse. The new king bed is a great addition and is super comfortable. As always, Annie and Don were incredible, thoughtful hosts.
We're looking forward to stay number 4 already!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If anything. Don’s place is nicer than the pictures, etc. the location and backyard overlooking the river and marsh is gorgeous. The place itself is immaculate, all newly renovated by Don of a handsome old house. Perhaps the best Airbnb We’ve ever had. Grab it if you get the chance"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful apartment with a lovely back yard on the river. Comfortable bed and great shower. We appreciated Don’s help with the TV and places to go as well as the note books of advice. There is not much in the tiny town of St. Mary’s except the ferry to Cumberland Island and a good restaurant, the Riverside Cafe. We enjoyed trips to Amelia Island and Fernandina Beach, Jekyll Island, Kingsley Plantation, and the Okefenokee Swamp."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely! Clean, comfortable, scenic and peaceful.
The location is a little off the beaten path (note peaceful), yet convenient for day trips to Cumberland Island, Fernandina Beach / Amelia Island, Jacksonville, etc.
Highly recommended."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful site in St Mary’s River. One of our favorite places to stay. Great space, super amenities and definitely worth a two night stay. Don is a wonderful host. Spotless and comfortable rooms. Kitchen has everything you need."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice and cozy place to stay, great views of the river, and awesome hosts. Great location for what we came to town to accomplish. Everything is labeled and in its place in the home. The librarian in me appreciated the book selection in the front room. If anyone is up for a side quest, there’s a cool cemetery in the front of the subdivision. Pretty spooky at night. No complaints from me. Thank you, Don and Annie!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this rental. What a treasure and an incredible find this property is. I can't say enough how perfect everything was for our stay. The location on the river is stunning and the quarters are clean, comfortable and packed with thoughtful amenities.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don is a great host and the Kimblehouse is a wonderful place to get away, relax and enjoy yourself."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is what Airbnb dreams are made of! Don is a wonderful host, and has created an amazing space for guests. Every room has views of the water, and it opens up to a huge, incredible screened in porch. The apartment was sparkling clean and had everything you could need. If I’m ever in the area again, I would definitely return."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are fortunate enough to stay at Kimblehouse on the River, you will love it! The location, amenities, cleanliness and host cannot be beat!! The views all day, but especially at sunset are magical. Thank you Don and Annie for a perfect stay!"

Nicest Airbnb I've ever done."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down simply put you won’t find a better more accommodating place or friendlier people. Great experience and anything you need for a nice getaway.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're back for our second stay and as always, it's amazing! This time we were fortunate enough to arrive at a decent time which allowed us to be greeted by Don. He and Annie definitely go out of their way to make sure this is a great vacation experience. The weather was perfect, allowing for our first day trip to Cumberland Island to experience the wild horses, beautiful trees & breathtaking views. All the restaurant suggestions are spot on but not as good as grilling up ribeyes on the top-notch grill as the sun sets over the river. We enjoyed borrowing the bikes to ride around town seeing the sights and trees. (We love trees). Thanks so much for providing a perfect place for the perfect long weekend, we hope to be back soon! 
Jason & Jackie"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don is a wonderful host! We absolutely loved this Airbnb. If you are looking for something quiet and relaxing this is most definitely the place for you. Definitely will be back!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Annie place was spectacular everything was so nice and amazing .
Don was super nice and friendly she made us feel very welcomed .
Thank you Don for everything we are looking forward for our next vacation there ."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this stay was delightful; from the gracious host, to the nicely decorated home, to the incredible yard and view to enjoy. We thoroughly enjoyed it all. The added touches of cold water, coffee and snacks made us feel at home. We were intrigued by the photo album of the renovations that had been done to home. We also were thrilled to discover the album with all the local restaurant menus and things to do in the area. St. Mary's is such a fun and relaxing little town to visit. Everything at this home was so well thought out to make our stay a pleasure. We cannot express how much we enjoyed this beautiful and peaceful retreat and look forward to another time when we can stay even longer! Seriously, it is one of the best vacation rentals we've ever stayed at. Thanks to Don and Annie!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Spectacular!!! Peace and quiet in a magical setting. Don and Annie are the true meaning of ""hostess with the mostest""!!!. The meticulous setting will awe you upon arrival. The gardens, the dock area, the whimsical art collection, the screened in porch, the whole package awaits you. Everything you need, comfortable and clean and at your finger tips. Don't miss a trip to Cumberland Island, the view of Atlantic is stunning from there. It's a very sleepy town, but if R&R is your goal this is it. Great golf within a close radius and it is very reasonable for the quality of the courses. The area offers lots of antique shops if you enjoy treasure hunting and enough good restaurants to sample them all. Ten stars if it were allowed. Hurry and book!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place to stay and get in touch with nature. St Mary's is quiet and so peaceful and the tranquility of the home and surroundings is a tribute to the attention given to every detail by the owners for their guests. We had a wonderful time and plan to return someday.
Don and Lucy"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a beautiful and peaceful place to relax and unwind, you will not be disappointed. From the cleanliness and comfort of the home to the gorgeous views on the river, all within a very short distance to the historical St Mary’s you will enjoy!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Kimblehouse is an absolute must for anyone looking to get away from it all. The pictures don’t do it justice!!! The setting with the abundance of live Oak trees and Spanish moss have a hold on you right from the start. Sunset views from the St Mary’s river are incredibly beautiful and Don and Annie are the most gracious hosts we have encountered with Airbnb. So whether you want to just relax around the gorgeous landscaped yard or take a drive into Historic St Mary’s, there is plenty to do and see and the living is easy. ***Oh, and you must visit Cumberland Island while you are there."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimblehouse is an extraordinarily beautiful, pristinely clean, elegant home right on the river with stunningly gorgeous views from the bedroom, kitchen, and living room. You have a wonderful shady screened in back porch with outdoor kitchen, lovely seating in the backyard and on the dock at the riverside. This home has a luxurious feel to it and will not disappoint. Don and Annie are extremely thoughtful hosts who go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. I cannot say enough about their hospitality and their lovely home. We will definitely be going back. This one is going on our list of special places."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just cannot adequately express how amazing Kimblehouse is. If peace, beauty, relaxation and stunning sunsets are what you seek, you will find it all here, along with two of the nicest people you will ever meet. Like so many of the other reviews mention, Don and Ann seemed to have thought of everything to make our stay so perfect. The apartment is so lovely, with a fully-stocked, modern kitchen and beautiful décor (I loved the artwork and the various boats that were placed throughout the apartment - each so unique and beautiful). The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom so nice. The windows in the apartment have amazing views of the property and the river. It was pure joy to wake up and open the blinds each day. The yard, gardens and dock were just so magnificent and the pictures just don't do it all justice. Every stunning sunset from the dock seemed to be more beautiful than the night before. We brought our boat and loved having access to the floating dock and were able to come and go as we pleased from it, even during low tide. We thoroughly enjoyed the St. Mary's River throughout the area and were so happy to be staying on the upper river - so peaceful, surrounded by the beauty of the marshlands. Do not pass on the opportunity to see Cumberland Island. We took our boat and bicycles and the shady, gorgeous rides through the island were so lovely and the beaches amazing and not the least bit crowded (we were there on a Tuesday, though - weekends are likely more crowded). We loved seeing the wild horses grazing in several locations on the island, including at Dungeness Ruins. Thanks again to Don and Ann for sharing your beautiful home with us for our anniversary."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! Fantastic setting and beautiful scenery. Annie and Don provide everything you need for an enjoyable stay. This was our second visit and we plan many more.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Don and Annie, for the relaxing and luxurious get-away at your place. Judy & Liz"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was clean and as or more lovely than pictured. Don and Annie were welcoming and kind. We would definitely enjoy staying here again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We always wanted to visit Cumberland Island. I'm not much on camping, so we needed a place to stay. I found Don's place on Airbnb. It was not more expensive than the local hotels. But far better than we could have expected. It was absolutely beautiful ! Spacious, comfortable, decorated nicely. A beautifully landscaped garden overlooked the view of the North river. It was peaceful and very quiet. We even cooked dinner on the grill and ate on the enclosed screen porch.
( After enjoying the sunset on the dock) I'm not sure why Don is sharing his little peace of heaven, but I'm sure happy he did. Fabulous!

PS. Take your own bikes or rent some for Cumberland Island. They have very few and the ones they have are barely ridable.The island to to big to walk it all on a day trip."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don and Annie's place was the perfect weekend getaway for my husband and I that were looking for a last minute babymoon. Don greeted us when we arrived and gave us some good recommendations for the area as well as had muffins waiting for us! We wanted something relaxing and quiet and this was perfect. The airbnb itself is much larger than how it looks in the pictures. It's clean and has the most gorgeous view of the river! We loved going out on the private dock and enjoying the sunset. We will definitely be back next time we need to get away from our busy lives!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect retreat!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimball House offers a beautiful space with outstanding views. The apartment is very clean and well laid out. The covered screened porch is a bonus. Don & Annie had two binders full of local info which was helpful. I have never stayed in a place which offered so many clean, nice towels. The location felt off the grid but not too far from 1-95 and we were able to visit Amelia Island as it was an easy drive. St Mary's downtown area has alot of charm and a sweet waterside park. Weather didn't permit our ferry trip to Cumberland Island, but maybe next time!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of our top Airbnb experiences. And end of the world beautiful setting plus great hospitality and fabulous well-appointed apartments. Hope we can make it back there someday!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arrival, we knew that we were in for a special stay here in St Mary’s but little did we know how special this apartment would be! The pictures don’t do it justice, the space is gorgeous & the view is to die for from inside the house with large picture windows overlooking the gorgeous grounds! Everything is so well thought out with everything you could need to make us happy & content! The huge screened in porch overlooking the water/dock is beautiful with a great indoor grill, seating for many in comfort! Then outside is a beautiful firepit, beautiful grounds with tons of fun objects de art everywhere to look at! Loved the huge flamingo! Then you go down to the dock / boathouse with comfortable seating overlooking the water & many boats in the Bay! So very peaceful with great sunsets! We thoroughly loved our stay at Kimblehouse! THANKYOU Don & Anne for sharing your special Paradise in St. Mary’s!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Kimblehouse is a perfect setting over looking the marshes of the North river. A peaceful oasis with beautiful sunsets. This is one of if not the best Air BnB we have stayed at. Don and Anne go beyond to provide you all that is needed just to relax and enjoy the house and the immediate area. They also provide great recommendations to help you enjoy all that St Mary's has to offer. The accommodation is a perfect self contained apartment with everything you need, that has nice sized screened in porch and outside patio. And you can sit down by the river to enjoy the sunsets and do some fishing. A great getaway."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don & Annie are amazing hosts and Kimblehouse doesn't disappoint. The space is lovely with beautiful views from every room, there just aren't words to describe how peaceful and relaxing our whole stay was. The apartment is perfectly appointed and the outdoor space is beyond exceptional. We enjoyed coffee on the dock every morning and amazing sunset views every evening. My only regret was not having more time there. Can't wait to come back again soon."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is the best I've seen. Don and Anne are the perfect hosts and the apartment (the entire lower floor of their house) is amazing!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Anne's place was fantastic! The pictures do not do it justice. The views are incredible! They were so thoughtful, they had muffins for us in the morning, they also sat out fishing rods and bikes for us to use. It was extremely peaceful and relaxing. We fished off the covered dock in the mornings and afternoon and we caught between 25 to 30 fish. We didn't keep any but it was fun anyway! We would definitely go back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time visiting Kimbellhouse. The apartment and grounds were immaculate! Don and Anne are gracious hosts and go above and beyond to make sure that every detail is accounted for. We hope to visit again soon.

The power went out after a big storm and they were on hand immediately with candles and flashlights. The place is wonderful--updated, clean, and beautiful. The water view is amazing. I cannot say enough good things about this place. It's on the ground floor, so no stairs, too. I would give it six stars if it were possible."

The hosts have thought of everything you might need and then added extras like fresh muffins and a bottle of wine chilling in the fridge. It was the perfect location to serve as a base for expeditions to explore Saint Mary’s, Cumberland, Amelia Island and a couple of beautiful state parks. The setting is so lovely that we decided to stay “home” and have dinner on the dock watching the sunset over the marsh instead of going out to a restaurant. No restaurant could have a better view and the full kitchen made it easy and much more private and relaxing. We had complete privacy but the hosts were always available to answer questions and checked in once to make sure everything was going okay. We loved having the bikes available in the mornings for a bike ride around the beautiful neighborhood. We definitely hope to return to this lovely gem of a home again in the future."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the heart of Saint Augustine. Everything in walking distance. Tip the valet and ask him not to move your car without your presence. Just a word of advice.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kimblehouse is an excellent choice...... DON'T PASS IT UP...... WONDERFUL!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had high expectations. And they were met in flying colors. Just check out the view! This is a sparkling clean and well appointed one bedroom with a great deck, lawn and boat dock. Go there!
Don and Anne were friendly and helpful and also respectful of privacy.
I will go there again."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anyone traveling to St. Mary's, Georgia needs to stay here. All consideration is given to feel ""home away from home"". Coffee and muffins were a nice touch!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimblehouse is the perfect getaway. It’s also perfectly furnished with everything you’ll need, as well as a beautiful waterfront view. Centrally located and convenient to St. Marys, Cumberland Island and more. We also visited Jekyll Island for biking and Amelia Island for kayaking. You won’t be disappointed!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay with Don and Anne. It feels like our home in St Marys. The apartment is perfect for a relaxing stay--the grounds beautiful and the views from the dock sublime. Don and Anne are wonderful hosts who make you feel welcome and comfortable.
If you are in the area do not hesitate to stay at the Kimblehouse on the River"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Don and Anne have a beautiful home, with all the amenities. It is the perfect home for a St Mary's fishing vacation, with its deep water dockage even at low tide. The concrete floating dock is capable of accommodating boats up to 35 feet with both water and power available. Don and Anne are very nice. The Kimblehouse is the perfect vacation retreat for anyone."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was skeptical when we saw the views of the location and the room but it was exactly as pictured and even better in person. Don made us feel welcome but never intruded on our time. The view is beautiful and we had everything we needed. It was a perfect centralized location to visit all of the many islands and have a quiet place to come back to at the end of every day.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view of the sunsets are spectacular! This is a great place to relax. We especailly enjoyed the screened in porch. The space was very clean and we had everything we needed!
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a such a Fantastic stay! The view is Fabulous, and the accommodations were Top Notch! The first day we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast while watching the sun break through a cool morning mist to cast an enchanting glow on the sailboats in the small harbor, So beautiful!
We fell in love with the delightfully quaint town of St Mary's and were fortunate to also explore Cumberland Island on the first ferry out since ""Irma "" left her mark! The tour was a fun and adventurous time through the amazing history and peaceful nature of the Island. Our stay could not have been more perfect! Thank you Don and Anne for sharing your lovely place. We are looking forward to a return trip!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Anne, thank you so much for your hospitality and for sharing your beautiful home. We would recommend your home to anyone who would appreciate perfection in accommodations - beautiful inside and out. An added bonus was our hosts: friendly and informative but not intrusive on our need for rest."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely perfect and more than I expected for the value. The host were so friendly and generous. The neighborhood is very quiet. A great one to ride bikes. The dock is absolutely beautiful for either sitting having a cocktail and watching a beautiful sunset every evening, fishing, or cast netting for shrimp. It felt like I was at a private resort."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing and the pictures don't even do it justice! Much bigger than anticipated. Excellent set up and perfect privacy!
Don & Anne were amazing hosts, great communication and a fabulous find overall!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don and Ann have created a perfect retreat along the river. The pictures just give you an idea of how beautiful the guest accommodations are and cannot capture the sense of peace and serenity or the gardens and riverside. One morning while sitting on the dock a dolphin came so close I could hear him breathing. Don and Ann are perfect hosts--please don't hesitate to book and do enjoy your stay.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean. Scenic. Great hosts; great space, and the finest sunset...."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,ABSOLUTELYAMAZING!!! We had breakfast on the porch every morning and dinner on the dock and it was all quite breathtaking! This is an amazing place to be if you are looking for a relaxing vacation.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The sunsets are breath taking and the hosts are absolutely amazing.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don has an amazing place right on the river with fantastic views and lots of privacy. It's incredibly quiet and all around idyllic. Our host had every amenity we could hope for and then some. Perfect spot for a couple's get away. Pictures are more than accurate and description is spot on. We will definitely stay with Don again.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space they have created for guests is perfect. The pictures don't do it justice. Inside is decorated nicely with everything you would need. Outside is landscaped beautifully and is very peaceful. We had breakfast each morning out on the screened porch and watched a perfect sunset one evening from the covered deck that sits right on the St. Mary's river. From that deck we saw two dolphin and a manatee swim by right in front of us. We could not have asked for a better place to stay for our anniversary. Thank you Don and Ann.
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimblehouse is a tranquil and serene home experience. A great mix of living space, indoors and out, with fantastic views. I would visit again."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first AirBnb stay and I have to say- I'm not sure anything can top this! Don and Anne are marvelous hosts and so welcoming.
The space is beautiful and so comfortable- and the VIEW! From anywhere- the bedroom, living room, kitchen- the view of the river is gorgeous. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway- look no further!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kimblehouse On The River is breathtaking. The whole 1st floor of the 3 story upscale home was for us. It was spacious, had everything we needed, and was private and quiet. Don and Anne were wonderful hosts. St. Mary's GA is a fabulous weekend getaway. The marshes and rivers here are so scenic, and the view from the Kimblehouse is phenomenal!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was convenient for us since we planned to use it as a base for travel between Georgia and Florida, not too far from the highway or St. Marys Downtown. The partitioned part of the bedroom was OK for small children but not for teenagers. We love the pool"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m familiar with the area. I used to live nearby. Very peaceful and clean. Host was responsive to every question I had. Directly across the street from what would be considered the local, “mall” which is a Belk and Bealls.
If you like Sonic, you can see it right through the trees. I would definitely stay here again. Nice pool, nice furniture. Cool design. Good host."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stay, thanks for hosting us!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean. We also enjoyed the privacy of the location. Steven was very helpful and attentive the entire stay if we ever needed anything.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Steven’s place at the beginning of May. As soon as we walked into the front foyer the place felt cozy and inviting. The space is open and bright. We were only there to sleep and we didn’t try out the pool or patio space, but it looked great. Nice tranquil space. The queen bed in the master was very comfortable. It was really nice that the hand towels and the toilet paper were folded into bows. Super cute! I highly recommend Steven’s place as not only was the stay great, but Steven was very responsive and communicative. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoy my visit! Steven was a great host! Respected our privacy, was helpful and responsive! Will definitely book again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We spent a winter here and loved it. Steve is ALWAYS outside working in the yard or cleaning the pool and is very attentive to making sure his guests are happy. You can literally walk to Sonic (BONUS). It’s a quiet, safe, clean place to stay with excellent security (every exterior door has a keypad). The parking and entrance is well lit You’re definitely not in the middle of any action, but you’re also less than a mile from a grocery store, a liquor store and multiple restaurants. It doesn’t hurt that the host is easy on the eyes either 😂🤷🏼‍♀️"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Steven was a very kind host for my 1 month stay! Would recommend staying here to any medical students who need a place to stay for a few weeks at a time for rotations. The pool/movie room were my favorite parts of the house!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are in the area and need a place to stay, I recommend Steve's place. The pool was delightful; very clean and private. The suite was well appointed with everything we needed and more. The washer and dryer were also a huge plus!
Steve goes out of his way to give his guests privacy and provide a pleasing environment for his guests."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place to stay. Very private and clean.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was the perfect spot for a family get away. We enjoyed a train ride, good seafood, a day trip to Jacksonville, a pool day and the friendliest and accommodating crew in Kingsland. Host was proactive and sent follow up messages and check in throughout the stay. It was peaceful , so we were able to get in some much needed rest."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Steven's place. Everything was super clean and well-functioning. We really liked using the smart devices, too (thermostat, trash can, garbage disposal). Very cool! And most of all, we had the perfect balance of privacy and host responsiveness, which every property should strive for. Thank you, Steven, for a great experience, and we'll look forward to coming again when we return to the area."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steven's place was everything pictured; spotlessly clean, nice pool, and in a quiet neighborhood. It was also close to town, you could walk to restaurants and stores. Very close to a beautiful waterfront area with ferry to Cumberland Island, museums, and great restaurants.
Steve was very responsive with suggestions for the local area, very friendly and quick to respond to questions or concerns. We were very happy with this place and would love to stay again sometime! Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable during our stay. Due to the weather, we didn't get to enjoy the pool area as much as we would have liked. We hope to get to enjoy it next time!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This AirBnB was extremely clean and had all the amenities one could desire. New appliances and overall everything felt new and clean. The pool was really nice. A short drive down to the downtown area of St. Mary’s with a really nice river side park and good eateries. Highly recommend this spot.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Clean nice home. Recliners were comfortable until you got up. Hard to catch. Bathroom didn’t have much counter space but worked out okay. Nice pool but it was a little too cool to try out
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great deal for having a nice built in pool! Clean, spacious, safe, private, convenient and a super nice host.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steve was a wonderful host! Very kind and easy to communicate with! He was extremely helpful and willing to go out of his way to make your stay amazing. We are from the northern Midwest where it was snowing (late March) and according to his listing the pool would not be open until April, I messaged him to see if there was anyway we would be able to possibly swim early, SURPRISINGLY replied and said yes!
Fully equipped kitchen with new dish/cookware. Conjoining rooms with the master and bunk beds where my kiddos slept.
We never been to the area. Quiet and safe neighborhood, which I was VERY worried about, traveling with 2 small children and myself, I felt very safe. Peaceful nice area. S
Smart locks on every door. The front door opens to a small “greeting” room with chairs and info. THEN where is main door to the place, also equipped with a smart lock! It makes the entire vibe feel so safe.
Hopefully we get to visit again! Thanks Steve you’re the absolute best! ❤️"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was great and Steven was a great host! Highly recommend!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Steve’s place at St.Mary’s turned out to be a GREAT location. A quiet, historic town w/lovely waterfront but also 30 minutes to Amelia, Jekyll, St. Simon’s islands and 40 minutes to the Okefenokee National Refuge. Steve has earned the Super Host. He was friendly & very responsive almost immediately to our questions. When we asked if we should bring our own drip coffee machine as we don’t support the little Keurig cups, Steve purchased a drip coffee maker for the house. Finding the property was easy as we had a picture of the location. Most impressive was how clean & well stocked the home was. The sheets were high quality & so comfortable. We were there for Georgia “winter” (1/2 of January & all of February) so the pool wasn’t functional yet but it was easy to see it was going to be great. We especially appreciated that Steve was environmentally “aware” and didn’t use pesticides on the lawn/yard so it was very natural. We are already looking at dates to stay at Steve’s next year."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place, comfortable bed, lovely big well equipped kitchen, spotless. We'll be coming back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed Steven's place, it was very quiet, we were able to bring our dog without penalty, and it was an uncluttered space. The kitchen was pleasant to use and it was very convenient to have a supply of coffee and sugar until we had time to make a more serious grocery run. We enjoyed walking in the quiet neighborhood every night, and our kid enjoyed the tv room probably way too much."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven was responsive, friendly and helpful. Although there was a cold snap, the home was toasty warm. Everything was well-appointed & clean. The neighbourhood was quiet, and convenient to the location which we were visiting. We would be delighted to stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was clean, great location and Stephen was great. He was in constant communication and was helpful. Beds are firm and rooms are open to living spaces by way short wall dividers."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great space! so relaxing and perfect central location.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Five out of five stars! Loved how cozy and clean the place was. It had a nice sized kitchen and living area for all of my family and friends. And our host was super friendly and great at communicating with us about any questions we had. It did also have a pool and porch area that I’m sure would be great during the summer time. But overall I would definitely recommend this place and we will most likely stay here again when we come to town.😊
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My children and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving at Steve's place. It's perfect if you have someone who is stationed at Kingsbay Naval Base. His place has everything that you will need. I will stay there again and highly recommend his place.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"this place is comfortable, 7 minutes from the ferry dock, and my kids loved the tv room. The neighborhood, while close to shops and convenient, lacks the charm of downtown and has no sidewalks."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing home and host! This place was perfect for my month clinical rotation! I would recommend traveling students and medical personnel to stay here if you can!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place with a pool and close to everything
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Steven is a wonderful and attentive host. His attention to detail is above and beyond most hotels and air bnbs. The pool didn't disappoint, along with the covered sitting area outside the guest house.
Just a note: renters should be aware the guest house is connected to the main house where the owner (Steve) lives. This is actually a huge help when you have a question regarding the property. You never see him, unless you go knock on his door.
Great location! Near grocery stores and the waterfront downtown area, that has great local establishments."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was clean and stocked with all the essentials.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This rental is an in-law suite to the owner's home which I was definitely not aware of and would not have booked if advised because my kids were very uncomfortable knowing that someone else was in the home. Everything else was fine, it rained the entire time so we didn't get a chance to enjoy the pool but it was nice."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was awesome, super clean, spacious and comfortable. The linens and towels were top notch. We enjoyed a variety of coffee that Steve provided. The pool was beautiful, just wish we had more time to enjoy it. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, and close by to everything that St. Mary's has to offer. Thanks Steve for making our stay wonderful! 5 star for sure!!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were only in town for a couple of nights. I wish it could have been a longer stay. The location offers easy access to Old Town St Mary's and I-95. And is close to stores & entertainment options. The neighborhood is quiet and well maintained. The lodgings were spacious, well decorated and well equipped. There is access to a private patio and a beautiful pool. Steven has thought of everything. We highly recommend you stay here if you are in St Mary's."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This property is very peaceful and relaxing. Everything you could need is very close: grocery stores, restaurants, the beach.. The home is lovely and comes complete with quality, comfortable furniture, three amazing beds and cozy linens. Sitting out under the stars in the pergola in the evenings is so relaxing.

Loved the 1/2 bath for the teenagers( they take soooo loooong to get ready)🤣
Overall was a great house close to everything."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The beds were extremely comfy! It’s hard to find good beds in bnb’s! Everything was perfect! Even better than the pictures! The bikes were a very nice surprise. Very clean. Eileen’s property is my new number 1!!! I couldn’t have wished for anything more!! Very close to the ferry to Cumberland Island!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,we love staying at Norris cottage and Eileen is a spectacular hostess.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was a great base camp for exploring the St Marys area. Very clean and welcoming, with many amenities. Eileen is a top notch host who communicates clearly and in a friendly manner. She responded quickly to questions and proactively notified me the cottage was ready earlier than the check in time. I enjoyed the cottage and the area so much I extended my stay. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and within walking distance of downtown St Marys. Lots of birds and squirrels in the yard, too. The screened porch was a great place to relax. I will book the cottage whenever I am in the area. Highly recommended."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very comfortable, quiet location, clean, met our expectations"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage on Norris St! Location was perfect for us. We loved being able to walk around the quiet neighborhood on the edge of the marsh and get to the center of St. Mary’s on foot easily.
The house is super well equipped and has a great collection of books about the immediate surrounds which we consulted nightly. St Mary’s turns out to be very well situated for many superb outings. We made day trips to Cumberland Island, Okefenokee Swamp, Amelia Island, and Little Talbot Island. Coming home to the cottage was always a joy at the end of a day. Recommend buying bottled water for drinking and coffee!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,St Marys is a peaceful place and this cozy cottage was great!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful Thanksgiving vacation staying at Norris Cottage. It is clean, well maintained, cozy and homey, and also very well equipped with everything you need in a real home!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us, loved the back screened in porch and lights. It was fabulous for relaxing during a midnight thunderstorm."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place. Highly recommend. Particularly clean, so peaceful, riding bikes down the middle of the neighborhood streets past live oaks that are so old they build the street around them...we loved it. Eileen had local info for us, and some great books about Cumberland Island on the shelf.
I've been staying at Airbnb's for more than 10yrs and with time it seems they've generally moved towards feeling a bit more like a hotel and less like you're staying in a real home. Eileen's place was a breath of fresh air. The kitchen is stocked like a real kitchen - of course stocked with all the basics, but extras like storage containers for leftovers. And two very small things that are game changers for me: 1) she doesn't leave you with 4 k-cups...there were probably 30! and 2) REAL LIQUID HAND SOAP IN THE BATHROOMS. I know, I'm a weirdo, but I really hate a bar of wet soap sitting on the bathroom counter."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our short stay at Norris Cottage. Eileen was responsive with any questions we had, and made local suggestions for us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at the cottage. Some of our favorite things we enjoyed while there were drinking coffee, reading, and playing games on the screened in porch, being able to walk down to the downtown area to hop on the ferry , the fireworks for the 4th were great, having everything we needed for cooking most of our meals at the cottage, and we also enjoyed the couple of restaurants we went to in the area as well. Eileen was a great host. She was always eager to help with any and all questions that I had. If we are ever back in the area we wouldn't hesitate to stay at her cottage again if it is available."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Norris Cottage is a beautiful place with everything you would need for a pleasant stay. Close to river front and local stores and restaurants. Eileen responded to every message in a timely manner. The whole weekend was perfect. We will be back sooner rather than later hopefully☺
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and comfortable place to stay! So clean and airy. Eileen is a very responsive and clear communicator. I would love to book Norris Cotttage again sometime!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mom and thoroughly enjoyed our quite getaway! Ellen’s home was perfect! It had everything we needed to prepare our own meals and relax! We rode bikes around town daily and walked to town in the evenings! Ellen gave us great advice regarding Cumberland island and the ferry. We had a fantastic time on Cumberland! We are already planning when we can go back!! Thank you Ellen! Your thoughtfulness and kindness shines through in your home! We look forward to booking with you again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. It was cozy and homey the moment we entered. This cute little cottage is right around the corner from all the action and an easy walk to the downtown and the ferry., but at the same time quiet and peaceful."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here before. Eileen is a great host!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen left no stones unturned in our rental experience in Saint Mary’s. We had a great time. The place was squeaky, clean no issues with anything whatsoever while we were there. It was very quiet at a very nice size yard a private driveway, and was walking distance to the waterfront. I could not have asked for more relaxing experience with my wife to get away and hang out at Cumberland Island for the weekend. I will definitely be back to use this Airbnb in the near future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Eileen’s cottage was lovely and quiet. We enjoyed the screened in lanai in the evening which was beautifully lit by strings of lights around the perimeter. The cottage was decorated with lots of whimsical sea life which added to its seaside ambiance. Very clean and cozy with all you might need right at hand. We hope to return to visit Ocheefenokee Swamp and Jekyl Island. A true gem of a place that’s situated inside an area that’s a gem of nature.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely loved this house and had an amazing time! Eileen always responded very quickly to any questions, the house was pristine, she paid such close attention to detail providing anything you may need (umbrellas, coffee, bug spray, extra blankets, etc), she suggested local attractions, and made us feel right at home. We would definitely stay again and recommend staying at this BNB!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Cozy Norris cottage. It a little gem in the gem mine that is St. Mary’s. We came for a few days on our daughter’s spring break and we had the sweetest family time. We followed all of Eileen’s recommendations, but our favorite was the wild horses on Cumberland Island. (Considering this was the only request that our 7 year old made for her spring break plans! )The is the perfect quiet getaway and we know we’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful cottage. We had the best stay! Eileen IS a super host! We would definitely stay again.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for a much needed getaway to relax. It is quiet, clean and comfortable with every amenity. The location is great - within walking distance to St Marys. We were there to relax and enjoyed the Roku TV and the ""fireplace"", and though it was too cold to use the screened in porch, it is lovely. Hopefully, we will be back for another, longer stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Eileen is a great host! Highly recommended
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our first trip to St Mary’s, we loved it, and Eileen’s place made it feel like a home from home. Norris cottage is a well located base from which to sample all the area has to offer, the bikes were an added bonus, the local neighbourhood is flat and very safe to cycle.
Make sure you visit Cumberland Island if you have not done so before. Enjoy a walk with Molly’s tours, a great introduction to the area, and don’t be put off by the loud music from Southern River Walk, the food is great and music bingo in a Tuesday evening is a blast."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I had a wonderful stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay in every way. Comfortable, clean and charming."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Norris Cottage is great! It’s such a quaint little cottage with first-rate amenities. Everything was spotless and Eileen (our host) thought of everything. Kitchen was well stocked as well as plenty of linens and products to do laundry and dishes. Decor was perfect! I loved all the whales and the blue/green decor (my favorite colors). So relaxing and we felt right at home. Eileen was super responsive and gave us great ideas on restaurants and local sights. We’d stay there again in a heartbeat! 💕 loved it!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as advertised, & she was a great host!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is clean and comfortable in a private setting. Eileen responded immediately to my questions or concerns. She’s very easy to work with. It was unseasonably cold during our stay, so unfortunately we couldn’t use the great screened in porch or bikes. Easy walk to downtown.
We will definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Eileen was a.wonderful host. Norris Cottage was comfortable & a great place to relax & recharge. St. Mary was a quaint town & the gateway to a must see - Cumberland Island.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sightseeing, attending an event, or just relaxing for a night, weekend or an extended stay like us for a long overdue vacation; I highly recommend Norris Cottage.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in St. Mary's at this cozy home. Eileen was super responsive and had great tips for activities during our stay. The home is beautifully renovated and had all the amenities we could ask for. We'll definitely return in the future.

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing cottage, clean and well equipped! Loved the bikes and the quaint area! Eileen was a great hostess!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful. We have stayed here before but wanted to come back and do the Cumberland Island experience, which was amazing. We learned lots of great history and saw wonderful iconic structures. Norris Cottage was in wonderful condition (clean, cool, roomy, and all the comforts of home). Most of our time spent at the cottage was hanging out on the screened in porch and we even used the bikes she had available. We will definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Eileen’s place was perfect for what we needed. It was very clean and updated and had everything you would need in the way of kitchen supplies and toiletries. She was also very helpful in sending us information regarding Cumberland Island which was the purpose of our trip. Great trip!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was quiet and quaint within walking distance to the historic downtown St Marys. My stay had the perfect combination of cozy and at home feel!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. Close enough to attractions but secluded to give you peace and quiet! I love the cottage.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for clean, cozy, comfortable place to stay the Norris Cottage is your choice. This home is attractively decorated with many amenities. It is an easy walk to the waterfront. There are two bikes also for riding around the historic area. Eileen is easy to communicate with."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will be pleased and feel like you are right at home. Cozy and comfortable when you walk in the door. Great host and great communication. Neat and very clean place to stay. We got more than what we expected in our stay. Location was perfect and close to everything. We were really up the street from the St.Mary’s water park. Great place for a family fun. We definitely would come again. The cottage place is a home away from home!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest and most comfy cottage! The furniture and beds are super comfortable and the space was perfect for the 2 of us. We enjoyed eating our meals and playing cards on the back porch and walking into town. We didn’t get a chance to use the bikes so next time for sure. Our favorite meal was by far at 401 West! The view from the top was spectacular to watch the sunset.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage in a great part of Saint Marys! House was impecable and had a fantastic back porch.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was excellent, very clean and decorated to be beautiful as well as functional. The kitchen was well stocked, bed was comfy, plenty of linens. Eileen really thought of all of the things that make a visit perfect - the porch was relaxing, and there were even extra toiletries in case you forget something. The neighborhood was super quiet, and just few blocks from the waterfront. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had never been to St Mary’s before this trip. As we were leaving we were already planning our next trip back! We can’t decide if eating at 401 West, Cedar Oak Cafe, Seagles Seafood, or Riverside Cafe; OR visiting Cumberland Island was our favorite thing we did. However, the food and drinks were amazing at each restaurant AND Cumberland Island was fun! We took our bikes and a picnic lunch and covered as much ground as possible. The morning we checked out we had a chartered fishing trip with Lo-Joe Charters. Capt. Joe was very knowledgeable about the River and took us to several different fishing spots."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,PRECIOUS place!! We loved our stay!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Norris cottage was exactly what we’re looking for on a recent trip to visit our son who is stationed at the nearby sub base. Eileen was so sweet through the whole process and her directions and instructions were clear and easy to manage. She went as far as to help me find a local Catholic Church and mass schedule so we could attend Easter Sunday mass. She supplied me with links for booking ferry tickets to see the beautiful Cumberland Island. She was always very fast to replay to any messages and her place was just beautiful and very clean. It has everything your looking for weather you a couple looking for a getaway or a family in town for a few days to see a loved one. I would highly recommend staying at this cottage to anyone I come across and also look forward to my next stay here as well.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Norris Cottage was perfect for a romantic getaway for two, but it would work just as well for a family of four. The large kitchen, communal dining area, and cozy living room make Norris Cottage feel like a home away from home. There is a large back, screened porch with string lights that is perfect for outdoor dining or family game night.
Eileen has the personal touches at the house I appreciate when visiting a town like St. Mary’s: a few local history books, games, and a few beach reads. In addition, there are two cruiser bikes available for use; we spent an hour cruising around St. Mary’s and enjoying seeing the town by bike. The cottage was spotless and stylish; we were just as happy hanging out there as we were wandering around Cumberland Island. We can’t wait to for another visit and make Norris Cottage our home away from home once again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our visit to Saint Mary's and our stay at Norris Cottage was fabulous! Eileen really has thought of just about everything and you can tell it is all about the guest experience and making their stay comfortable with her! The cottage was a perfect size for a small family of 3 or 4. The location is very convenient to historic downtown Saint Mary's and the Cumberland Island ferry dock. We even made a day trip to Amelia Island Florida as it too is only 30-40 minutes away! The bunk beds were a great touch for kids and makes a room for them to feel is their own. The whole cottage was spotless when we arrived and there were an abundance of creature comforts for guests. Every bed had plenty of pillows and extra towels were available and easy to find. The kitchen had everything you could ask for in an AirBnB and Eileen even has it stocked with a Kurig and coffee available. There were some pantry items in case you needed (cooking spray, salt, pepper and a few other seasonings). As mentioned in a previous review, there are even two bicycles and bike helmets in case you would like to go for a bike ride during your stay. In the bathroom, Eileen has left shampoo, conditioner, soap, and even a toothbrush and toothpaste in case a guest forgets! Her very detailed explanation on how to use the shower, due to a slight configuration issue, was very thoughtful so that guests aren't left freezing. The breakfast nook even includes books about nearby sites, a detailed list of restaurants and when they are open, games and adult coloring books with pencils in case you want something to do on a rainy day or to pass some quiet time! Our stay was truly enjoyable, definitely one of the best AirBnB's we have ever stayed at! We loved everything about our stay and hope to be back again someday!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Norris cottage exceeded our expectations. It was comfortable, nicely decorated and fit our family perfectly. The screened in porch added additional space to hang out. My daughter and I enjoyed riding the bikes that were provided. The location is perfect to downtown and the ferry to Cumberland Island. Eileen was so sweet to check on us after the rainstorm to make sure our trip to island was not ruined. We will definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Norris Cozy Cottage was exactly what we wanted for our Cumberland adventure. The Cottage was extremely clean, well stocked, stylishly decorated, yet comfy! Eileen was super accommodating and always available if needed. Everything went without a hitch and we especially loved the bikes which were available for our usage. The location was perfect for the Cumberland Ferry, shopping and not far from Amelia Island and St. Augustine!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Norris Cottage was a great place to stay in St Marys. It was decorated so cute with plenty of room for our weekend trip! We certainly enjoyed the lovely screened porch in the mornings and early evening too! The cottage was a short distance to restaurants , ferry and shops! We will definitely recommend this cottage to others and the adorable town of St Marys!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The sheets and towels were 100% cotton and were amazing! Eileen was so accommodating. The place is very clean and allergy-friendly. Eileen even removed a small air freshener for me due to my fragrance allergies. You can tell that it hasn’t been smoked in and there have been no pets. The kitchen was well-stocked and clean. This is the perfect place to stay with your family to enjoy the St. Mary’s and Cumberland Island area. We’ll be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is wonderful, cozy place to stay and is only a short walk to shops, restaurants, and the ferry to Cumberland Island.
Absolutely spotless, this little house feels very spacious because Eileen has arranged the furniture to maximize space. The king bed is super comfortable, the linens are top-notch, and the shower has excellent water pressure. In the kitchen you will find everything you need to cook or bake during your stay, but if you don't feel like cooking, there are wonderful restaurants a short walk away. Having a Keurig with plenty of coffee, tea, creamer and sweeteners was a special treat too. The screened porch out back is a beautiful place to sit and read or enjoy coffee in the morning in one of the rocking chairs. My husband and and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here.
Eileen is an excellent host and you can tell she put a lot of thought into creating a comfortable and relaxing space. She is kind, knowledgeable about the area, and very quick to respond to questions or messages and all-around a great person to work with both before and during our stay.
If you are looking for a place to stay while visiting St. Mary's, look no further!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, convenient location. Very spacious and very clean. Lots of nice little touches. Comfortable beds and 2 1/2 baths were nice. Large, well equipped kitchen and large screened in porch. Even 2 bikes in case you want to ride around the area for exercise. Would definitely stay there again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Norris Cottage located in St. Mary's Georgia is worth the trip. The town is absolutely charming. A local market is held every Saturday at the Marina. You can also catch the ferry to Cumberland Island. There are unique shops and restaurants. Everything mentioned above is within a five minute walk from Cozy Norris Cottage. The house is just as the name states, cozy. There's a new king size bed and new shower."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a sweet experience. Such a great location. Check in was a breeze and we loved how clean everything was! Definitely recommend a stay at this cozy cottage !
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"St Mary’s is a very charming and historic community
Norris cottage is quaint and cozy
Very close to the historic district so I enjoyed walking
Loved the river front park"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton was the perfect host. Great instructions for checking in, operating television, to local recommendations. We were very comfortable in this sweet, quirky home. The screened in back porch is the best! We so enjoyed meeting him and chatting over Sunday coffee. Would stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton was a gracious And responded promptly to any questions I had. As soon as you open the door, you will feel at home. I loved the back screen porch. We ate all Or meals out on the porch. One night we got lucky and had some rain, beautiful peaceful. You can walk right down to the water and through the town from his house. We all had a wonderful time here. Thank you, Peyton ."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the most charming and unique stays ever! Host communication is above and beyond & the host is well known & loved in the community - which made us feel like VIPs in beautiful St Marys!
Peyton’s place has everything you could possibly need, and things you didn’t know you did!
Felt right at home the moment we walked in the door - comfortable, private and relaxing. The rear screened porch is perfect for sipping wine and listening to the abundant birds.
The home’s location is perfect, on a gorgeous street running directly into town. We recommend bikes to really get about and fully explore this great town, and Peyton will connect you with some friends who will bring them to your doorstep.
St Marys far exceeded our expectations so we we will be back, and will definitely book Peyton’s Place again as we can’t imagine a better, more welcome home and host in this beautiful and charming place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Payton is a very friendly host with a great little house located in the historic district of St. Marys. It’s only a couple blocks walk to “downtown” pier with a really nicely taken care of park is located. I lucked out and Taste of Camden [county] was going on a block away at Orange Hall. I think it stays booked up so grab it if it’s available!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton’s Place was spacious with wonderful porch dining and a relaxing seating area. Decorated with love, enjoyed the lovely artwork, porcelain, etc. The kitchen was fully stocked. The linens were extravagant. Location for Cumberland Island was perfect. Was nice for just two of us, but would definitely accommodate more people or serve as headquarters for a family gathering."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Peyton's place was simply adorable. we felt like we were staying with an old friend and loved the quirkiness of the house. The back porch was idyllic and is made for relaxing. The bed was extremely comfortable and we loved the choice of linens. If you are looking for a stripped bare modern home, keep looking - at Peyton's place, you will find charm, tradition, homestyle comfort and love. We hope to visit again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely an older house, so smaller bathrooms, etc. Easy walking distance to the Cumberland Ferry dock. The owner was very attentive to my messages and accomodating in my requests."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,charming cottage. wonderful location
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peyton was a fantastic host. The check in and check out were easy, the home was just as described and the house was very clean. You cannot beat this location if you are traveling to St Mary’s. Close to everything in town, yet quiet and private. The back porch was our favorite part of the home. We have 3 children and they loved the home. Peyton was very responsive and attentive. We hope to come back and visit again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Peyton was a nice host-- very detailed instructions and especially recommendations for lots of things to see and do. Great local knowledge. We found St Mary's last year and fell in love with it. We could not have asked for a more beautiful spot, street, or town than here. And lots of books to read! ( but didn't have time with all going on outside around here!)
A pleasant stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peyton is a great host, his house was very cozy. We had a great stay, easy walk to the heart of downtown!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Needed a get away and St. Mary's is our fav place to visit. Peyton's Place was the perfect location and a great place to stay. Close to the waterfront for our many daily walks. Neighborhood was nice & quiet. Walkable to shopping & restaurants.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our third stay at Peytons place. It feels like a second home to us and our go-to place to stay when we visit family in St. Marys. Peyton's well loved house and his kind, personable demeanor is what AirBnB used to be and what continues to draw us there. We had an illness while there and had to extend our stay, and he was so understanding and even came to check on us. I highly recommend his place and know we will continue to use it every time we return to St. Marys."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peyton is a good man and was incredibly helpful during our trip. All of his suggestions were great, he’s very knowledgeable about the area, and his home is well furnished and perfectly located in the town of St Mary’s."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint cottage. Very peaceful and quiet neighborhood, yet close to shops, restaurants and the waterfront. St Mary’s is a quiet, unspoiled location. The ferry to Cumberland Island and its wild horses was our main reason for coming, but we loved the town too and wish we had more than three nights to explore it.
The screened in porch was absolutely wonderful. The cottage is pet friendly, which was a main reason for us selecting it. Our babies were very happy.
Peyton had any pot, pan, or kitchen item one could need. It was unusually cold during our visit, and we had some difficulty figuring out how to work the thermostat, but Peyton was very responsive.
Overall we were extremely happy with our stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peyton’s place is eclectic and lived in. You feel like a friend let you house-sit. It’s comfortable and we were able to walk to restaurants for dinner and to the ferry to Cumberland Island. Everything was clean and welcoming. I would recommend his place to anyone visiting St Mary’s
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, Peyton was a wonderful host and had a lovely home. Thanks for sharing it and we would return and rent again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paytons house shows a lot of love and amazing character. I loved it the minute I walked through the front door! It is definitely a home away from home very clean and all you need is in the house. Walking distance to the river and all the restaurants in Saint Marys I love the peaceful neighborhood. I cannot wait to return! Five stars all around! I highly recommend.😍
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay, would recommend to others."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow! We could not have asked for better! Peyton made us feel we were his family borrowing his home! It’s clear Peyton has put considerable thought into the comfort of his guests. His home is beautifully decorated, comfortable, impeccably clean, inviting and peaceful. It was the perfect refuge for us. The location was perfect, close to town but quiet and private. We loved everything about Peyton’s place and hope to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet neighborhood right down the road from the river. Close to everything but far enough away from being busy. House was clean and was perfect. Will book again next trip
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton was an amazing host!! his home was so comfortable, easy to get around, walking distance to everything in the area. close to St. Amelia Island. Peyton had wonderful recommendations. we took advantage of the massage therapist during our visit, and she came right to the house! Everyone we spoke to were very pleasant they couldn't say enough about living in St. Marys. We had a wonderful time and will return soon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderfully welcoming home, full of charming decorations and warmth!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely home and a lovely host. From the warm and thorough initial greeting, we knew we were in for a special treat. We were delighted to find Peyton's Place cozy, clean, and absolutely adorable. The rooms were spacious and comfortable with charming eclectic decor. The kitchen and bathrooms were stocked with condiments, coffee, and quality toiletries. While we didn't utilize most of the offerings, the availability was incredibly hospitable. (We did use some of the aloe after a day at the beach, THANK YOU!) My favorite unexpected find was the comfortable quilt-covered recliner on the screened porch facing the private backyard; it was the perfect place to relax and read. Peyton stopped by to meet us and I found him to be absolutely adorable. St. Mary's is a beautiful location (we walked to downtown easily) with a rich history. We enjoyed several day trips to Savannah, Fernandina Beach, Fort Clinch, Amelia Island, and Tybee Island. We would love to go back and see Peyton Place's again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very comfortable at Payton's place, which is cozy and filled with beautiful things. Would definitely return, but next time when it's not so hot and we can enjoy more time on the screened porch!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's place was a true gem. Very homey with a touch of funkiness. There were chairs for the beach, an outdoor grill, a screened in porch and the kitchen was stocked with condiments and spices to make cooking easier. It was hot and muggy outside during our visit but inside the AC was great. The ferry to Cumberland Island was only a short walk away through a nice, peaceful neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you Mr Peyton for a safe place to be during a big family transition. The air conditioning was beautiful. Totally loved the friendly neighbors and how easy to get around. Thank you so much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Easy walking distance to restaurants, waterfront etc. Peyton’s description of his home was exactly as online, he is great at responding quickly and giving details about his home, bike/kayak rentals, massage therapist etc.
His home was very welcoming & comfortable. We loved the screened in porch!
We would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peyton’s place was a cozy, eclectic home in a wonderful location!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, enchanting, and a home away from home. Ever wanted to stay in a quaint, eclectic, sweet home filled with memories… this is the place. You will feel safe and cozy in this older home tucked beneath the trees. It is equipped with the sweetest outdoor space (screened back porch) for your morning coffee or evening wind down. Close to everything like the waterfront, shops, and restaurants. We rented a golf cart and zipped around the area taking it all in. Peyton’s home is a delightful spot to rest awhile. Peyton even went so far as to send us flowers on our anniversary. Unprecedented and appreciated!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay and Peyton was more than helpful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was exactly as Payton told us. It’s and old house but is very comfortable. It is located within easy walking distance to the waterfront and Market on the Square. Perfect house for an enjoyable stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From the moment we drive up, you could tell that this is a special home. Walking I. The door, you can feel the love that went in to making it a home. We loved the screened in porch…being able to be outside and no bugs in Georgia is a major bonus! The house is in an excellent location! This was my very first time using an Airbnb and Peyton was VERY responsive to my questions. This will definitely not be my last visit to Peyton’s Place!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable, kid friendly. Easy access to my son’s family. The screened in back porch a favorite feature. We were able to set up and watch big screen outside on porch, kids able to stretch out, adults played card games which resulted in quality time together. Thank you Peyton for your quick response to the appliance issue, much appreciated!
The only appliance I missed having was a garbage disposal. All of the big stuff, we bagged up for my sons chickens. It was the little stuff that a disposal could have taken care of the small stuff.
Again, thank you for your hospitality.
Kevin and Bev"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My sons and I stayed at Peyton’s place for a week, and we enjoyed it so very much! Peyton is a superb host—generous and kind—and provided everything we needed (including great and open communication) to have a wonderful experience in St. Mary’s and in his lovely. The house is clean, charming and comfortable, and it is in a wonderful location within walking distance to shops, restaurants, the historic Oak Grove Cemetery, the beautiful St. Mary’s River, and the ferry. We are already planning our next visit to St. Mary’s and hope to stay at Peyton’s place again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peyton's place never disappoints, we felt blessed to be able to return to another wonderful time. We are already planning our next visit!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,So relaxing and close to downtown. We loved staying here.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,This cottage is the perfect place to relax and explore a beautiful area … highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton,
I’ve said it before, but thank you for welcoming us into your home and making us feel as if we were at ours. You have a wonderful warmth to you- the house is eclectic and full of art, sweet memories and creativity. The downtown area and ferry are about a 5 min walk away and there are plenty of great restaurants and beautiful scenery nearby! We even had a massage therapist come to the home (recommended by Peyton) and give a massage on the back screened in porch with the birds chirping and a perfect breeze! We will be back god willing! Thank you again sir!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Payton’s place was the most relaxing AirBnB we have stayed; it felt like home. The screen porch made my trip. Just to sit out talk, play cards and just hangout was just what we needed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent four nights in this very cozy and comfortable home - spent a ton of time on the big screened porch, and everyone slept very comfortably. We walked into town multiple times and enjoyed two nearby playgrounds with our kids. A wonderful place from which to visit the Okefenokee and the beaches."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was just as described in the listing. Very convenient to the downtown area and the Cumberland Island Ferry. Would definitely add stay here again if in the area. Highly recommended.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My second time staying here and this time I had two friends join me. I told my friends before they came what a special place I thought this was, and they felt the exact same way! They even contemplated returning with their families. The house has the spirit of an artist and Peyton is a warm communicator. The location is great, only two very walkable blocks to the water. I just returned to my home and am missing Peyton’s Place already."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I did our annual getaway to this lovely home with our 10 month daughter. We loved the screened in porch, the cozy living room, and the walkable area of St. Mary’s. Peyton was a great host, responsive, and flexible with us. We’ve already recommended it to our in-laws for an upcoming anniversary trip. We recommend it! Thank you, Peyton, for providing your home for our getaway!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peyton's place was so adorable. It is within walking distance of the water and restaurants. The house had everything we needed and Peyton left very clear instructions too. It was clean and well decorated. We felt right at home. I highly recommend this quaint home for your visit to St. Mary's
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was one of the better Air BNB’s we’ve stayed in that had a fully equipped kitchen and plenty of linens and pillows. It was warm and cozy. Extremely comfortable. We enjoyed the screened in area every evening. The grandchildren could visit without us being on pins and needles. It was quiet, and we were able to sleep well. The layout offered privacy in the cottage as well."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great stay there!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough about our stay. House is adorable and comfortable. Peyton has thought of everything you may need. Close to waterfront. Three block walk to Cumberland Island ferry, shops and restaurants. Peyton very responsive to questions. Would stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful, cozy and friendly home to spend time in. Peyton's Place is equipped with everything you may need and has thoughtful touches everywhere. Don't miss the fabulous back porch. You need to spend time there with a cup of coffee and that book you've been meaning to read. St. Marys has wonderful restaurants (you've got to visit Spouse's bakery!), friendly people and a very walkable downtown area. It's an easy drive from Metro Atlanta. We throughly enjoyed our stay - can't get enough of the live oaks and spanish moss!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peyton's Place is located a few blocks back from the shorefront in the beautiful small village of St Marys. It is a classic summer cottage added to over the years with a big screen porch, lots of bushes and beautiful live oaks on and around the property. It is quiet but accessible to several restaurants with a 5 - 10 minute walk. There are all kinds of memories all over and also modern conveniences - fast internet, wifi controlled thermostat, electronic door locks as well as everything you need for a great stay - coffee maker with supplies, cooking pans and utensils, Netflix etc. Just an enjoyable relaxing, casual place to stay with Peyton as a gracious host. We recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a perfect little home! My family and I rented from Mr. Peyton for our week stay in the area. It was clean and comfortable, and the screened porch and artistic flair were I think our favorite aspects. We felt like locals for a week, thanks to this little gem of a home!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is the perfect downtown St. Mary’s spot. My family has been coming here for years so we were so excited to stumble upon this place. It’s a lovely, eclectic, cozy cottage! The yard is beautiful and a perfect place to play if you have little ones. The back porch was the highlight for me. It’s a beautiful space!! We’ll be back for sure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited this home for a few days for my brother in laws retirement from the Marine Corps. Very nice home in a quiet neighborhood. The back porch is an amazing place for breakfast, or for friends to gather. The house is walking distance to the Cumberland ferry. The owner was very easy to talk to, and responds to texts or emails in a very timely manner. We would definitely visit again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for such an easy check in / check out process. It was a nice surprise to be able to access Google and Netflix for evening entertainment after a long day at the beach or Cumberland Island.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Charming and comfortable! Love Peyton’s Place…it’s close to everything making downtown an easy walk. He has all the extras you need and is enjoyable and easy to communicate with. His place is what St. Mary’s is all about…an absolute gem!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peyton’s place is so charming and comfortable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peyton’s cottage is a serene spot with great energy. My daughters and I enjoyed 3 days there and wish we could have spent a month! The screened-in porch was our favorite spot. Peyton was a very gracious host and could not have been more accommodating.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The ONLY place to stay in St Mary’s is Peyton’s Place!! It was my second time and I have fallen in love with the house and St Mary’s once again!! Walking distance to the Cumberland ferry and all that the town has to offer!! I did Cumberland island this time and it is simply magical!! ✨💕✨
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The adorable little cottage shows the owner's artistic personality and made us feel right at home. Everything needed (and more) is provided. It's not the place, if you're looking for luxury living but a good value in a great location for enjoying quaint St. Mary's and the amazing Cumberland Island. Hoping to return again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peyton’s home is perfect for relaxing, working if you must, and getting out to surrounding sites and wonderful restaurants! He was a wonderful communicator. The kitchen has everything you need whether you’re cooking or bringing in food. The porch was delightful and a great place to listen to the birds and smell the blooming plants."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fit this Bill perfectly! My wife and I were looking for a place to rest a bit on our drive between Maine and Florida. We like to break up the drive with a little multi-day adventure along the way. Peyton’s Place was ideal being in the historical district of a small quaint town, a short walk to the town center, yet a quiet and peaceful distance away from all the hubbub.
If you are looking for glitz and glamor this is not the place for you. (Although Peyton’s trash can is quite a glamorous experience, I haven’t seen anything like it. The trash can lids opens with a wave of your hand and closes on its own, cool, hands free. ) Now if you are looking for a casual place to relax and enjoy the moment before you, than this is the place for you. The place is cheerfully and colorfully decorated in a manner that is uplifting, comfortable and relaxing.
Peyton generously provides abundant offerings. His detailed written orientation explained everything we needed to know; in a manner and tone that welcomed us to feel at home right from the start. My wife liked that she could get caught up on on her shows on a big screen. The beds were comfortable. I appreciated how Peyton had set up night time motion detector lights in the hallways and bathroom, very unique and helpful. The kitchen had everything needed and more. The WiFi signal was strong.
I especially appreciated taking in the fresh air on the huge and amazing private screened back porch. The porch was so relaxing. I liked grabbing a beverage (the porch has its own frig), setting back, feet up in the recliner, watching and listening to the birds. The porch and the whole house shows signs of creativity. I even learned a new very creative way to repurpose wine bottle corks, which I will put to use myself, thanks Peyton for the idea. (I still chuckle trying to image the story behind how that idea must of started.)
Peyton had provided guidance on where to rent bikes; Camden Bicycle Center, who provided outstanding service beyond expectation. Reasonable priced pleasant service. Darlene, co owner, delivered and picked up the bikes right to the house! When we were loading the bikes onto the Cumberland Island ferry, Terry, the other co owner, recognized that we had bikes from his business. He pleasantly introduced himself and wheeled my wife’s bike from the dock onto the back side of the boat. Both Darlene and Terry provided Outstanding pleasant service; above and beyond; Peyton thank you for recommending them.
Peyton also recommended The Golden Pineapple shop which we also visited. My wife wondered off exploring the plentiful collection of whimsical items. I was taken by the historical building. The elderly owner, was very pleasant and noticed my curiosity about the building. I am fascinated by the southern vintage architecture like several buildings in Saint Marys historical district. The gentleman explained the building’s history and how the building was destined for demolition but had to be moved in order to save it. We chatted a bit about the history of the building and his own history. That store is filled with many treasures including the gentleman who owns the place.
After our day exploring Cumberland Island, we satisfied our hunger at the Riverside Cafe. I was trilled to see that their menu included Greek specials including Moussaka, one of my favorites, which was really good. Given how tired we were after peddling 18 miles on Cumberland, we really appreciated that Peyton’s Place was only a few blocks away.
Our stay at Peyton’s place and his recommendations made our time in Saint Marys as we had hoped; adventurous and relaxing. Thank you Peyton.
Bill"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peyton's home was everything we hoped for. It felt like how AirBnbs used to feel before they become so commercialized. It was cozy, super cute, and homey. Truly a home away from home. It was in a perfect location, walking distance to many establishments, and had everything you'd ever need for a great vacation in St. Marys. Peyton himself was such a kind host. He met us at the home and showed us around, and even accommodated us when we arrived early. We will absolutely be staying here the next time we are in St. Marys and have already recommended it to family members."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is awesome. Great in every way.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a special place to spend some great days with our family exploring Cumberland Island and great beaches not to far away.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful little house in a quiet neighborhood close to downtown. A ten minute walk to the shore of the river and a handful of charming little restaurants and bars. It’s mostly quiet here so don’t expect lots of excitement. It’s serene and relaxing, and Peyton is a wonderful host. Communication was easy. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a quiet, relaxing getaway."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem. Very convenient to walk to downtown and Cumberland Island visitor's center and ferry. Comfortable, a ton of supplies, and just a fun place to be."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton’s Place is wonderful! My mom and I spent two nights there on our way to FL. We got in late (which was no problem), hit Cumberland Island for a few hours the next day, and had dinner in town at Seagle’s before leaving early the next morning. The house is so charming and comfortable and Peyton was so lovely and extremely easy to reach. I would absolutely recommend his place and hope I can get my whole family back sometime."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great home in a great neighborhood. Peyton set up the house well and communicated details and expectations very well. I would stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Peyton is the ultimate host and the adorable house was perfect for our visit with such an amazing location close to lovely downtown St Mary’s. We walked to catch the Cumberland Island ferry and it is an easy drive to other beaches as well as Okefenokee Swamp and Crooked River for our kayak adventures.
Thank you Peyton!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's Airbnb is absolutely charming - live oaks in the front yard, lovely furnishings and art, quaint front porch and huge, beautiful screened-in back porch, and great location. We hung out on the porch and cooked great meals, walked all around St. Mary's and ate local restaurants, took the ferry and explored Cumberland Island, and paddled in the Okefenokee Swamp. Peyton was very helpful. We felt right at home."
2021-11-01,4,Group trip,"This is a quaint, cozy at home feel place. Very quiet neighborhood, walking distance to the waterfront.
I will be looking to stay here again when we return to the area to visit friends and family."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton was an amazing host. His home had so many lovely and unique touches. We wanted for nothing - the kitchen was very well stocked, extra blankets and pillows were available. The beds were very comfy. And, the screened in porch was such a great and comfortable place to hang out. The yard was beautiful and lush. So many little touches made this an extra special stay. Peyton is a wonderful host."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peyton was a wonderful host. Very easy to communicate with. My family and I felt at home and cozy. The scenery around the town was really an extraordinary. We love the backyard the most it was really one of the best place just to hang out and have breakfast and lunch with the family.. so glad Peyton was able to join us for breakfast even for a short time. Thank you for the warm welcome.. truly recommend this place to anyone that would love to stay in a small town of St Marys!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton is a host beyond all others! He is genuine, accommodating, and goes above and beyond to make sure his guests have everything they need. Our family was moving to St Mary's from out of state and he made it easy to schedule our arrivals and departures, communicated rapidly and throughout our stay. His adorable home right near the wonderful historic district of St Mary's was so inviting and comfortable, with the most amazing screened in porch ever! We had absolutely everything we needed and more. He even welcomed us with pretty fresh flowers upon arrival and a bottle of wine to calm my nerves after our long road journey. Would rent from again in a heartbeat and will tell all of our out of town friends who visit to stay and enjoy as we did."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peyton is the perfect host! He gave us detailed information about his house and the about the town. His house is fantastic and it's an easy walk to the Cumberland ferry and downtown. We would definitely use his place again in the future!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. The house is SO cute and cozy. It has a very welcoming and comforting feel. A lot of love and detail went into decorating. Everything you need has been thought of! There are really neat trees and bushes in the yard. Plenty of room for our 3 kids. Very conveniently located to the Cumberland ferry. Would definitely recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome place, cleanliness is impeccable, awesome kitchen with everything you could need, close to all the beaches, River, and attractions, we would definitely do this again.

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Mr. Peyton was an excellent host. His home had everything you could think of. Our party had a great time in St. Mary’s. The house is a short walk to the Cumberland Island visitor center and ferry. There are some great restaurants down there too. We will definitely stay at his place the next time we visit St. May’s.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peyton's place was great for what we needed! Very comfy and plenty of room for our family of 5.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute little beach house, host was more than accommodating to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Will stay again"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been my favorite trip to St. Mary's and Peyton's house just made it that much better. This house has so many great qualities that it would be hard to go into such detail. There was such a whimsical charm to this house that it would be hard to do anything but enjoy yourself, even on a rainy day, which was honestly one of the more peaceful moments if you were out on the wonderful back porch. The house has so much color and charm that I would happily visit again. Peyton was always easy to get ahold of, he left notes throughout the house to help figure something out, the house was fully stocked with anything you might need. The back yard was wonderful for the kids too. They really enjoyed it. We never encountered any problems here. T"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are staying in the St. Mary’s/Cumberland island area, this is the perfect Airbnb to book. Peyton was very thoughtful, responsive, and his home is a real treasure. A beautiful screened in sunroom, very comfortable beds, and all the amenities you could possibly need! I could not recommend highly enough."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hey, just a quick note to say how much we enjoyed our stay at your place. Everything was just as described. It was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed seeing the Knick knacks, mementos, and photos of your family. It made the place feel like home. We spent one day exploring the ruins and wildlife of Cumberland Islands and visited several of the restaurants downtown. Our favorite was Polly's due to the quality of food and the excellent prices. We would recommend your place and Pauly's restaurant to anyone interested in visiting St Mary's. We hope to come back again sometime."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's Place could not be more adorable...and, though we were unable to meet in person, Peyton could not be a more gracious and accommodating host. There is absolutely nothing that he hasn't considered in providing for the needs of his guests. His kitchen has every kind and sort of utensil and tool you'd have in your own well-appointed cooking space.--including a second refrigerator on the most delightful back porch ever! We were able to cook a 7-course meal without a hitch! Ten stars all around if we could give them!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Cute and quirky style. Pup friendly. Everything you’d need for a stay in ST. Mary’s and convenient Short walk to Cumberland island ferry and historic st Mary’s restaurants.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortabl, clean and quiet . I enjoyed the kitchen and made good use of the charbroiler in the yard ."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for sharing your home with us, Peyton! My partner and I stayed for four nights and it was perfect. The screened in porch was where we spent most of our time while at the house. It was lovely to sit out there for our meals. A woodpecker came by one day, lots of birds, and some anoles. We also laid in the backyard enjoying the quiet under the gorgeous spanish moss covered trees. The location is perfect - not too close to downtown to hear the live bands on the weekend but close enough to not drive our car at all during our stay. Visiting Cumberland Island is a must - it's magical. We had a great dinner at 401 West as well. They even have a vegan dinner option (and a vegan brunch option). We biked around town also which was super easy and flat. Peyton gave us great instructions and advice ahead of time and the house was comfortable and well attended to. Coming from the city, the hardest part was how quiet it was at night!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect and so close to all there is to do in St Mary’s. Cuter than the pics show!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our January 2021 stay so much, we returned to Peyton's Place for another week. Love the house, the location, the nice quiet town, and the host's gracious hospitality. We will be back again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic house in a great location--- close enough to walk to shops and restaurants, but not stuck right in the middle of things. The back porch and yard were a great place to relax after days exploring everything the area has to offer."

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I loved staying at Peyton’s place! I could tell Peyton really cared about making our stay an enjoyable one. He went out of his way to order us a water kettle for morning tea. The home was so comfortable and well decorated, I felt like I was staying at a close relatives home. The porch ended up being a bit too cold for my dog to sleep on so we sent her to grandmas. He was clear from the beginning though about keeping the dog on the porch, we just didn’t expect Georgia to get so chilly!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peytons place was very cozy, quaint home! Neighborhood was quite. We loved it and can’t wait to come back!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A quaint old house with a homey atmosphere. Not as much of a guest house feel.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house worked perfectly for our one-week stay. An unique and welcoming property in the historic district. Comfortable bed, nicely stocked kitchen, close to the ferry and eateries. Great neighborhood for long walks. Will stay here again as often as we can."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice homey place within walking distance of the Cumberland ferry. The owner was very responsive and the place fit our needs perfectly. I would stay again!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was like being inside a Mary Engelbert painting while staying with your most favorite relative.
Amazing generosity, sweet decor, all the amenities you can ask for and you can walk to the Cumberland Ferry! Only a few blocks away to all the little shops on the square.
We loved it and can’t wait to return!!!!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first AIRBNB and I was 100% satisfied and probably spoiled I fear. It’s the most beautiful and unique home. Older but such a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere . I felt as if I was home but still on a family get away. My wife and I completely fell in love with the house. There were little sticky notes all over the house to help with the lay out of switches, coffee ( that was my favorite part) and the one above the ceiling fan the simply said “ I love you “ tells you this is such a kind hearted family. The beautiful display of family photos is what gave it the at home feeling. I hope the owner is happy with us and if there are any pointers or mistakes I made renting my first Airbnb I would kindly take and learn from it. My sister recently moved to St. Marys with my mother so I will be going often and we will be renting it again. I know there is a cleaning service but we tried to leave the home like we found it. Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home with us."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is the most interesting and welcoming Airbnb we have visited. Peyton’s hospitality is evident everywhere with so many interesting features and amenities to help visitors. The house is spacious with plenty of indoor and outdoor spaces to relax. In mid-November, we’re enjoying the huge screened porch for dining and reading. The home is in the Historic district of St. Mary’s and is great for walking or a jumping off point to visit Cumberland Island National Seashore Park or to take a 50 minute ride to Okefenokee Swamp. We hope to return."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This a delightful older home that has everything you need for a comfortable stay. It has been whimsically and artistically decorated which adds to its ambiance. It is walking distance to many of the historical sites and waterfront. The screened-in back porch is lovely and a perfect place to read a book or have a cup of coffee. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t recommend Peyton’s place enough! My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and had such a wonderful time. The home is enchanting and cozy, has plenty of amenities for cooking meals at home, relaxing spaces for game nights in, and is in a beautiful neighborhood that we loved walking our dog through. We especially enjoyed being walking distance to so many things in Saint Marys, and barely used the car once we were there because there was so much to do nearby. Peyton gave us wonderful information about the area before we arrived, and also provided plenty of resources and contacts in case we needed anything else during our stay. I would definitely stay here again :)"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peyton was awesome to work with. We had a great time at his place. It was very clean and organized. We really enjoyed it

2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The photos of this listing don't do it justice---it's much nicer than it looks. In a beautiful neighborhood, the house is filled with good books, beautiful art, handmade quilts and lots and lots of love. Very comfortable and charming. I could have sat on that back porch for weeks and just enjoyed the peace and serenity. It's also the best jumping off point to get to Cumberland Island which is magical. Peyton is a gem who goes out of his way to make your stay at his home a delight. Thank you, thank you, my dear sir. Had a much-needed respite from the madness of the news these days."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just love Peyton’s Place. Cute, cozy and a short walk to wonderful restaurants, shops and the pier. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Charming home, with thoughtful details. It’s not far from the waterfront area, which is just terrific. It was just my husband and I with two dogs. The experience was just great, and yet made better by being able to stay at Peyton’s. We will be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place, comfortable although older. Had everything we need. Fun place to stay!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's place was a fantastic stay for our little get-away, the home was spotless and there was plenty of amenities that were very thoughtful. the kitchen was stocked full of spices for our meals and he even had complimentary beverages for us. The neighborhood was very quiet and friendly.
Highly recommend Peyton's place for your future stays!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is an older, charming, and beautiful home. We enjoyed sitting in the screened in porch each night. St. Mary's area is quiet with a lot of small town charm. Great area to walk around. A few restaurants on the river. Lots of personal touches in the house. Everything you could possibly need during your stay. Peyton is quick on responses to questions, and has many helpful tips for local things to see/do. We enjoyed our stay! We look forward to coming back again. A real gem!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time using an Airbnb and it was a great experience. We felt right at home at Peytons Place. The house is clean, has lots of charm and is located in a nice area. The neighbors are friendly. I would definitely go back."

2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house is a gem! Much more important, Peyton is a host that treats his guests like family."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a perfect stay in St Marys. Peyton’s home could not be more charming. The location, within 3 blocks of historic downtown with its many shops, restaurants and the riverfront will not be forgotten. We visited Cumberland Island (highly recommend the guided day long tour), St Simon’s Island, and Jeckyll Island, all of which were an easy day trip and very worthwhile.
Peyton’s house was impeccably clean with every amenity we could think of. The historic sites and moss draped live oaks made our twice daily walks through St Marys so memorable. It was especially nice that the neighborhood came with 3 very friendly golden retrievers who were great playmates for our black lab.
Thank you, Peyton, for your great communication and hospitality."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So amazing. Highly recommend; very roomy. Lots of amenities. Perfect for family. I dont recommend dogs since there is not a fence & there is dogs out back; sweet dogs but present so I recommend a plan for that & a crate. We ended up not bringing our dog and it was a good decision. The PERECT AREA! So cute! So quiet & perfect for walking around. Right next to the water & all these cute shops. Going when the weather is nice is highly recommended. Great place & sweet host.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is an amazing gem. It’s so warm and inviting. The extra touches really were top notch. I spent most of my time here curled up in the reading nook!! The cute little house is sooo comfortable! I hope the owner lets me back!

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks so much for an amazing stay! My parents & I think that your house is absolutely beautiful, and we loved all of the personal decorations & knickknacks throughout the premises!
We LOVE how cute your house is and we thought that it’s super “homey” and comfortable! The multiple bedrooms and bathrooms create a great setup for multiple guests! The kitchen and bathroom amenities are also super great. The suggestions for local attractions are very thoughtful, and we actually ended up going on the ferry to see Cumberland Island! My parents could definitely see themselves staying here again, and we’re also very appreciative of the great communication we experienced with this stay. Highly recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in the Saint Marys, GA area! :)"
2019-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you want colorful with a lot of character, this is the place for you. There was something new to discover every time you looked around. The bed was very comfortable and crozy.
It's located on a quiet street within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and churches."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location....loved all the whimsical touches. Porch was great, we had good weather but not quite warm enough for us to use it. We would stay here again if in the area."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Peyton's place. It was charming, spacious and clean. The house has a relaxed atmosphere where you can enjoy sitting around with family & friends yet you're minutes away from historic St. Mary's. Big enough for two couples to share! I highly recommend this house if you're traveling to St Mary's!"
2019-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's Place has everything you need for your stay. It's an adorable, comfotable house in an equally adorable area, right on the St. Mary's river. I must point out though, that this is the owner's primary residence, so if he isn't traveling, he will be staying in part of the house. He is a really nice guy and a wonderful host, but if you're looking for 100% privacy, this may not be the place for you."
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton’s place is very comfy, quite and is ideally located in the really charming and totally laid back town of St. Marys. The location is only a couple blocks from the waterfront, ferries and restaurants. He provides everything and more that you could possibly need. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, relaxing and great location home, along with great communication with the host. Highly recommend!!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay while in charming St. Mary’s. Clean, comfortable, convenient, and safe. I’d stay here again in the future. Easy check in and check out."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Peyton’s Place is a warm, homey little house. We were in Saint Mary’s for a family celebration and were much happier with Peyton’s Place than we would have been at a motel. We spent a lot of visiting on the large screened in back porch as well as the small living room. We comfortably slept 6 adults, with 1 person on the couch. It was an exceptional deal."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton’s place is super cozy and clean! His home is also very spacious and has a terrific screened porch. He had Netflix, dishes, and silverware that came in handy for us making/eating snacks. His home is closely located to the Cumberland Ferry, as it was convenient for us to walk there and take the ferry to Cumberland Island. Locals were super sweet and we enjoyed walking through downtown St. Mary’s. If we visit Cumberland Island again, we’ll definitely want to stay at Peyton’s Place!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peyton’s place was a great getaway spot for my wife and I and our infant son. Peyton’s personal touches (a welcome note, fresh fruit and flowers) were very thoughtful, and the property was clean, well organized, and extremely relaxing. It is a great base from which to explore St. Mary’s, or venture down to the beaches 30 min away. Overall, we had a great experience at Peyton’s place and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay near St. Mary’s or Amelia Island."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peyton’s place was perfect for our trip! His house is absolutely beautiful and we really appreciated all of the notes and special touches. The check in process was easy. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the St. Mary’s area!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's Place is amazing! Pictures don't do justice to the beauty of this place. You can feel the love and peace as soon as you enter.

Overall Peyton's Place is perfect! Will definetly be back."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's home is cozy and delightful. The check-in was easy and we were comfortable throughout our stay. His home is so close to the small downtown area, and only a couple of blocks from the parking lot to the Cumberland Island Ferry. When we weren't sight-seeing, being at Peyton's Place felt like vacation in and of itself. We would definitely recommend his home to other travelers and would love to return ourselves!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable charming cottage is a gem! I felt like I was staying at a friend’s house. Peyton was quick with responses and provided very clear instructions. Everything was labeled in the house, making everything easy. Location is right next to the downtown area. Peyton’s place provides every type of bathroom amenity you can think of and the beds are quite comfortable:-). I loved the eclectic style of this artistic abode. Will definitely stay here again if I come back to St. Mary’s and would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton’s place was a lovely home. Close to everything we wanted to do. Very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our 4 day stay. Would recommend it highly for anyone wanting to stay in Saint Mary’s, Georgia."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can expect to have all the spices and utensils you need for cooking. A back porch that is large and relaxing to have coffee in the morning. The location is convenient to everything. You can walk or ride a bike to downtown St. Mary’s.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Colorful beautiful home, very comfortable, 3 blocks from Coast."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and beautiful historic location. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. There is also a public pool very near by that is inexpensive and not very crowded when we went. Beautiful park nearby with plenty of benches to sit and relax and watch the water. Beautiful old cemetery a few blocks away. Peyton's Place had everything we needed. There were 5 of us and we had plenty of room. There are some games that we enjoyed playing as a family. The sunroom is very peaceful. It's a great place and would definitely stay again if we're in the area.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are a family of four (kids ages: 11 & 9). This was a PERFECT size and location for our week of exploring the GA coastline. For reference, our trip included exploring: Cumberland Island, Amelia Island/Fernandina Beach, Jekyll Island, and St Simons. This was a great home base, with the farthest drive being 50 min to St Simons. We loved St Mary's and being able to ride our bikes everywhere. There is a convenience store (super friendly owner) within walking distance. We ate at Fulford's Fish house twice for dinner (!!) and went to Cedar Oak Cafe for breakfast. Would recommend BOTH! The ferry to Cumberland Island is just a few blocks away. Peyton's Place was just our speed--we loved the eclectic decor. We can't say enough how much we enjoyed the amenities! So homey and we enjoyed coming back there each evening! Thank you, Peyton!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Peyton left notes with details about the house and many added touches. THe screen porch overlooked a more private area with birds and even a little turtle that wandered into the yard. The swings on the water front were within walking distance. It was fantastic!

Peyton was great when we had any questions and he went above and beyond on the amenities. The covered back deck is amazing and so peaceful to enjoy! We have stayed at many Airbnb’s and this is the best one thus far!!! We will definitely be returning!! Thank you again for everything!!!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Great communication. Charming atmosphere. Highly recommended!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's place is a unique family home with real soul. He was attentive throughout our visit and made us feel very welcome.

We really enjoyed our visit and hope to come back again soon!"

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peyton's place is a quaint little house in the middle of a neighborhood in St. Mary's, Georgia. St. Mary's is small town coastal Georgia at its best.

So fun! Camila's place was beautifully decorated. Very comfortable and stocked with all the comforts of home. We made some great family memories walking to town, going to Cumberland Island, listening to live music and playing games at the house. We definitely plan to book again! I will also recommend it to friends and family! THANK YOU!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I believe this is my fourth stay at Bonelle's place. She is kind and welcoming. The bedroom is an extremely comfortable space. The guest spaces in the house are squeaky clean and the house is private and quiet. I highly recommend this home!

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The space was lovely, we were only in for 1 night, but it was perfect. The only thing that was tough was sharing 1 bathroom for 4 people in a public space."

The bed was super comfy. The tea room and outdoor seating spaces were adorable.
We walked to the Riverside Cafe for dinner.
One night was hardly enough.
it was chilly the night we were there so we were happy to find an extra comforter in the closet.
Our hostess was very responsive.
We had the Henkel Room with the sink in the h space on the wall between the bedroom and bathroom. it worked out because we didn't see any other guest at the times we were using that space. It was clearly stated ahead of time so we knew what to expect.
We would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The charm and warmth of Bonelle’s Airbnb left me speechless! It felt more like an inn than a traditional Airbnb, which was wonderful. My dog and I enjoyed spending time on the two porches and the fenced in front yard. Bonelle was very thoughtful and she even placed a dog bed and a water bowl in my room. The location was wonderful - I walked many times to the main strip, the river, and the Cumberland Island NP Visitor’s Center. If I ever visit the Golden Isles again, I would absolutely stay at Bonelle’s home again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I was very pleased from start to finish. Very peaceful and relaxing if you need somewhere to just get away. Clean! All areas was very clean. Bed comfortable. Bathroom was not in my room but right outside my door which was not a problem at all. I was able to speak with her briefly in the kitchen but she made me feel right at home. Very pleasant. Hope to be back sooner than later!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bonelle's place was absolutely charming. Decorated in period southern style but with all the necessary modern amenities I especially enjoyed the upstairs porch and tea room which were lovely places to hang out in the evening and early mornings. The neighborhood is beautiful and full of grand trees and singing birds.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came here on our honeymoon. We wanted to stay in a historic home with easy access to the Cumberland ferry & Bonelle's place was perfect.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bonelle’s home was exactly as described and conveniently located near downtown Saint Mary’s.

The balcony was AMAZING!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Bonelle was a wonderful host. Even though she had a broken wrist she went out of her way to clean a room for us so we could have an upgrade on a different room. She was amazing! It’s a peaceful place to stay. Great for walking to restaurants and some stores. We will be back again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bonelle was a great hostess, from the letting us check in early to directing us to places in town. Her home was absolutely breathtaking. I’m a porch lover, and that’s where I spent most of my time, sitting in the couch in the upstairs porch. Quiet and the view of the neighborhood is lovely. My bestie becs and I had a great experience and would definitely stay at Bonelle’s home again when we visit St Mary’s and Cumberland island.. thank you so Bonelle for opening your home to us.. P.S. tell Molly. We said hey🙂"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It feels like home in so many charming ways - I wish my real home was like this. Bonelle provides thoughtful amenities to make guests comfortable and relaxed… you won’t want to leave. Location can’t be beat and town exudes southern charm as well.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our go-to spot in St Mary’s which is a cute historic town convenient to 95 and Cumberland Island ferry. Classic home with Southern charm, wraparound porch with lots of space to lounge, and a short walk to town, restaurants, and waterfront. I’ve stayed at just about every small hotel in town and this is the one I come back to. Great value and lots of thoughtful touches."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a short stay but the two of us and our two pups enjoyed it! Had everything we need and enjoyed visiting with other guests. Would definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I was only staying for one night but it was perfect. Experience in an old typical house very well maintained. I highly recommend.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Our stay was great . Beautiful historical place and surroundings. Homey ambiance. We had hoped to stay again on our way back home but took an alternative route. I will recommend to others and would stay again when traveling to FL.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Bonelle’s place was short and sweet. We just needed a place to sleep for the night and her place fit the bill!! It is a beautiful home! We didn’t use many of the amenities because it was such a short stay but we had use of the large kitchen if we needed. The bed was comfy and perfect for the 2 of us!! Bonelle was very kind and greeted us at the door. If you want a place that is full of southern charm, I highly recommend this place! We plan on staying here again when visiting family."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bonelle is such a friendly, gracious hostess; I felt right at home immediately. Her house is not only historic and well-appointed, it is easily accessible and spotless! I stayed in the Jekyll room, which was quite large with an incredibly comfortable mattress. St. Mary’s is a quaint town and a great place to visit for all who enjoy the great outdoors. Plenty to do! Cumberland Island is a must-see! By far the best Airbnb experience I’ve had. I’ll be back! Thanks, Bonelle!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing Cool Experience 😎

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed one night. Everything was perfect
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very nice. I don’t normally get a shared place, but I’m guessing before Airbnb this was a regular Bed and Breakfast. I would definitely recommend it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great communication. Good value.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would definitely book again. Bonelle was the best host. So very responsive to every message I sent, but also respected privacy. Her home was so very inviting. I loved the Southern charm- porches to relax on, the many interesting/ engaging books & magazines in the home to read. There was fresh coffee brewed in the morning and I was able to use the refrigerator/ freezer to refreeze my cooler blocks, etc. i highly recommend booking this charming Jewel."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,So lovely we will definitely be back
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay and it was extremely convenient to taking the Cumberland Island ferry, it is a three minute drive from the parking lot. It’s a beautiful 1908 home with amazing furnishings. I didn’t see Bonelle until the morning I was leaving, but she was very friendly. I appreciated the full use of the kitchen. My bed was very comfortable and located near the bathroom which was nice. I like that it has the sink outside the toilet/shower area since you share the bath with another room. I also very much liked having a sitting room upstairs that had coffee and tea as well as coffee available in the mornings downstairs by seven-ish. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Bonelle"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bonelle was one of the best Airbnb hosts I've had thus far (and I travel a lot.) She always messaged me back right away with help, questions being answered, or recommendations nearby. Her and her daughter were contantly making sure we were comfortable and taken care of throughout our stay.
Bonelles home was beautiful and I felt at home in the gorgeous South! Everything was spotlessly clean and she had fresh coffee for us every morning. Her dog Molly was also so cute and fun to meet ☺
It took us five min to get to ferry from the Airbnb for Cumberland as well which was convenient.
I would highly recommend Bonelles place for exploring anything nearby including Jekyll Island, Cumberland Island, Jacksonville, FL, etc."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed meeting Bonelle, and our conversation. The bed was extremely
comfortable! The shared bath situation wasn't as expected. While the tub/shower and toilet are in a private space, the sink where you might want to wash up, is in a public space where anybody could walk by. It worked out for me, because there was no guest in the room that would've shared the bathroom. I would request the room with a private bath next time.
The area was extremely quiet, and I enjoyed some outdoor time on the porch. Quite lovely. The town has very little to offer, but is the gateway to Cumberland Island. Other than that, it has very little to offer."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a great stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,So very happy with choosing this place to stay. Very quiet and quaint. You won’t be disappointed.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house, peaceful surroundings, we never saw the host but we felt right at home. The instructions for checking in were very clear. The bed is massive and super comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a neat old home! So clean with lots of indoor and outdoor spaces . My favorite spot was the upstairs deck on the rocking chair, enjoying the breeze and watching the wildlife .
It's in a great location for restaurants and catching the Ferry to Cumberland Island."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay in this historic home! We needed a place to stay on our way home from FL and wish we had been able to stay another night. We would definitely like to come back and stay at Bonelle’s again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I spent a very relaxing night at Bonelle’s place - the king bed & lovely crisp linens were beyond comfortable & I didn’t want to leave my peaceful morning spot on the grand, wraparound porch surrounded by old oaks with cardinals singing & flitting about.
Next time I will definitely extend my stay here!!!
Cumberland Island by ferry, made a great day excursion, as well.
Thank you again,
Polly"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described! Nice place to lay your head down for a night and would have loved to explore more if we had the time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The minute I walked into Bonelle‘s place I regretted that we booked only one night and not more in this charming house! Everything was so nicely decorated and prepared, the whole house is so cute and calm and relaxing, I highly recommend staying here! There is coffee and tea and cozy space (on the porch or in the tearoom) to hang out. The shared bathroom is clean and the shower warm and with enough water pressure. If I could I would come back and stay a week!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing unique place! A gem we are still telling our friends about. Highly recommended!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint and quiet. Walking distance to water and restaurants. I will be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just stayed one night here but felt very comfortable in our room. It was a real treat to have hot coffee ready in the kitchen in the morning and the option to make tea in the common room near our bedroom upstairs. Enjoyed having coffee on the front porch too, would definitely stay again if we’re back in town!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cute place. The wrap around porch was lovely. We had lunch out there before walking into town.
We would book again but for a different room with private bath. Bed was comfortable.
A little confused as breakfast was not included in any way but my husband was told where a good place to get breakfast was - and it was within walking distance - everything was really."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great airbnb in a cute, very walkable town for our overnight stay. Lots of interesting decor & personal touches add charm & character. Don't miss sunset over the nearby river- spectacular!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bonelle’s place is in a gorgeous 1908 house with a lovely décor and is a five minute walk from downtown and great restaurants. The wrap around upstairs and downstairs porch is a wonderful place to sit and have a cup of coffee. The whole vibe of the house is warm and inviting, can’t wait to stay there again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. Highly recommend it, the house was magical and such a joy to be at. Don't miss the opportunity to stay there."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough nice things about this lovely historic home close to St Mary's waterfront. Restored and beautifully decorated with art, antiques and vintage pieces, but not stuffy though. This Airbnb is more than just a cozy comfortable room, it is many places that invite you to just relax and linger: the tea room upstairs, the living room or the wrap-around porch overlooking the peaceful neighborhood. It was so nice to have access to the kitchen with plenty of room in the fridge to unpack our cooler. Bonelle is a wonderful hostess, providing true hospitality and not just a room, available but never intrusive. I highly recommend her place and I am looking forward to visiting again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Bonelle’s place was great. Peaceful and beautiful. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bonelle's place is a lovely old house furnished with antiques. There is a very nice upstairs sitting room that opens into a fabulous, huge covered porch with comfortable seating. Downstairs, visitors can use a beautiful living room, a dining room, and the kitchen. Tea was available all day, and morning coffee was ready at 7:00. Bonelle was responsive, but never invasive. We had a great stay here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything that was described, portrayed in writing and photos, was what is there. Close to downtown and the Saint Mary's river. Enjoyed my stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We just stayed here two weeks ago on our way down South, and had a fantastic time. Liked it so much that we stayed here again on our way back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home is meticulously appointed highlighting the era of the community. I enjoyed sitting on the porch drinking morning coffee with my dog, listening to a variety of birds. After coffee I took a stroll down by the beautiful riverfront enjoying the stillness, serenity and quietness. If you are looking for a quiet spot to rest and rejuvenate , with a step back into another time, then this home and town is a perfect spot. A 43 minute drive will take you to Amelia Island full of a variety of things to do, places to eat, etc."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW. Such a thoughtfully, curated place. I would stay here for weeks. There were so many inviting places to pause, rest and take in the details - from the comfy chairs on the porch, to the tea room, and the living room. Great location for a respite. I've stayed at a lot of AirBnBs and this tops the list. This is a gem and I would recommend it fully. I hope to visit again and stay longer!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Bonelle’s home is welcoming and full of gracious touches. My bedroom was cozy and there were two comfortable sitting rooms and a full kitchen where I was welcomed to make myself at home. Highly recommended.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in the Jeckyll Room. We will definitely be back to enjoy Cumberland Island and Jekyll Island was a reasonable hour drive away. We enjoyed access to the kitchen and cooked some meals while we stayed. Coffee was available each morning and Bonelle was available if we had any questions. We enjoyed talking with the other guests that were staying at the same time.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Only spent one night was just passing through but loved the town and location very peaceful neighborhood.
Great waterfront area and restaurants all walkable from the air b&b.
Would definitely stay here again"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in the Jekyll room, was wonderfully peaceful and relaxing. The bed was super comfortable, and the views from the two windows just showed the tops of trees with their hanging Spanish moss. Everything was as described, and Bonelle was super communicative. I highly recommend this place and think it is a really good value for the money as well."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed in the Jekyll room which was very clean. The house as a whole was beautiful and Bonelle had sitting areas and tea set out. She was very responsive as well. I highly recommend this house, especially if you like historic homes!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The Leggy Herron is a beautiful home. It felt clean and inviting. The sitting room adjacent to our bedroom was perfect for a morning cup of coffee. The hot coffee waiting for us in the kitchen was the perfect touch!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the house I wish my grandparents had when I was growing up. I always wanted to stay in a house like this, so this was perfect! Bonellle went above and beyond to make me feel at home. I LOVE the tea before bed and the coffee was already made at 6:30am because I had to leave at 7am. Very wonderful experience!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, great host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cornell has done a fantastic job of recruiting a turn of the century local home. It has long front porches with wicker chairs and I guess have their own sitting room upstairs. It is a lovely home.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for our family to get together. We booked all 4 rooms. Thanks Bonelle for setting up our reservation at the Cedar Oak Cafe. You went above and beyond.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Nice and quiet, beautiful house walking distance to Cumberland Island ferry."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous place to stay for two nights … hostess is great great!!! “Tea room” on 2nd floor connecting the other rooms is so ideal with outdoor porch ! Would love come back !
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bonelle’s place was gorgeous. Beautiful home filled with art and antiques, walking distance to the waterfront. Our room was clean and very comfortable. We will absolutely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful time at this stay. The house is stunning and the wrap-around porch was gorgeous. Sitting or napping out there with the warm breeze and hearing the birds was delightful. I love everything vintage so the decor was right down my alley. It was clean, warm, and I had everything I needed. I only stayed one night but I truly would’ve stayed longer if I was able to. It was only a few minutes from the pier and local shops, restaurants etc and the general location was peaceful. Check-in was smooth and the overall process went well. Definitely would stay here again and definitely recommend to book with Bonelle! 5 stars."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and charming home! Walking distance to town, Bonelle and Challie are wonderful hosts, will definitely stay again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bonelle’s home was beautiful and spotless, everything was laid out for us with very easy to follow directions. Very cute town within walking distance. The porch was incredible and relaxing!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay if coming in from out of town and heading to Cuberland Island or just travelling. The charm of the 2nd floor sitting room and porch were a super nice amenity. Retored / maintained old boarding house feel was excellent. Full kitchen if you cook (with cast iron pan!). The property and neighborhood are tree filled and quiet and peaceful.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Would stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve had a wonderful stay! Thank you to Bonelle and Chally, who was so helpful whenever I had a question! As described, clean, comfy bed, easy check in. Backing out of the driveway can take a bit of maneuvering (due to a lovely little fruit tree near the door), but definitely doable. Loved that there was hot coffee ready when I got up :) Easy 5-10 minute walk to waterfront, restaurants, Cumberland island ferry/visitor center, park and shops.
Also, as a bird lover it’s an amazing spot - I got an incredible close up moment with a pair of pileated woodpeckers sitting on the porch this morning and heard a barred owl duet tonight, as well as all your favorite backyard birds!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stay all around. The house was clean, with a lot of character, relaxing and homey. Bonelle and her daughter were responsive and flexible with my scheduling through the app. The location was great -walking distance to town but tucked away on a tree-filled quiet street. Highlight was the wraparound porch and even the fun hotel-style feel. Jekyll room was perfect and just as pictured. Sharing a bathroom was easy, with the sink/mirror outside so there was always access. Had a great stay in St. Mary’s. Would return and highly recommend! Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Bonelle was extremely accommodating of our unplanned very late arrival. We are sorry we were not fully able to appreciate her beautiful home.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I will definitely stay here when I return to the area! Gracious host, lovely home, and super comfy bed! Should be a super host!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean- cute place within a short drive of downtown and all it has to offer! Highly recommended
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The room had everything you could want… it was clean and well decorated and had every amenity one might need. I highly recommend this location. It’s less than a half mile to the ferry for Cumberland Island and downtown St. Mary’s. There are several rooms upstairs and it would be fun to rent them all for a big family or group to experience the camaraderie of quaint small town living. 5 stars. Well done.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely and serene. Usually I’m skeptical about a place with no reviews but this was great! I guess it’s just a brand new Airbnb. Historic with southern charm. Bonnie was a kind host and it was clean and comfy just what we needed on our travels! Our dogs had fun playing together too.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"This airbnb adds a wonder charming touch to your visit to St. Mary's, Georgia. The hostess was very pleasant and helpful at check in. She also provided many recommendations for places to eat and visit. The Jekyll room was very cozy and the chocolate was just the touch to welcome you. i would highly recommend this location for a stay and hope to come back myself later in the year."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay. It was a cute quaint little guesthouse. Big enough for the 2 of us. Wendi gave us privacy, and we felt at home in the guest house.
Thank you Wendi!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location , close to St Mary’s and Cumberland Island Ferry"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very nice stay at Wendi’s. The place was super clean, cute, and had everything we needed. Wendi is a great host, friendly and very personable. The St. Marys area is picturesque and quaint. My granddaughter enjoyed the local parks and waterfront playground. Would not hesitate staying here again. 5 Stars!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I were meeting for a MOM Daughter 4 day stay. We loved where Wendi's is located, walkable to everything one needed...easy access to Ferry to Cumberland Island, walk downtown for shoppes and restaurants, just a delightful, peaceful place to return to after a long day out.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This stay reminded me of what Airbnbs are meant to be, cozy and affordable retreats with welcoming hosts, not the commercialized overpriced investment properties that have recently taken over the site. We had a warm welcome from Wendi, who offered above and beyond helpful items during our stay, such as beach chairs and a cooler. She had great recommendations for local restaurants and activities. She was also very respectful of our space and gave us privacy during our weekend retreat. This was the perfect size space for us, our two kids and small dog. There's a fantastic and efficient kitchen that has all the basics covered, so you don't need to eat out if you don't want to. The beds were comfy and everything in the cottage functioned well. We hope to come back and stay in the future and take a trip to Cumberland island! Thanks again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Next-ta-sea is a cute little bungalow on the edge of the grasslands in beautiful St Marys, GA surrounded by large Live Oaks covered in hanging bunches of Spanish moss.
Wendi greeted us on arrival, gave us lots of great suggestions and answered all our questions in a friendly manner. She offered us the use of her golf cart to get around town in and all of her beach amenities as well. Overall there was a wonderful “Mi casa es su casa” vibe to the whole thing. Next-ta-sea was the perfect place for our rest up before and after our trip to Cumberland Island. We only wish we’d had more time to spend there. 😊"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi was absolutely lovely. She was warm & welcoming and so helpful! Her place was very comfortable with everything we might need easily accessible. We had a great weekend getaway!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a very enjoyable stay at Wendi's place. It is perfectly located for easy biking and walking and the apartment is charming.

The Cumberland Island ferry is less than a mile away.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi was a very friendly host who had great St Mary's recommendations that enhanced our stay. The rental was attached to her home, which was only a plus as far as we were concerned. We appreciated the comfortable beds and the great shower pressure, as well as the little kitchen space. We had all our own gear for a day on Cumberland Island, but it was great that she offered to loan all the beach things anyone might need. Wendi's cute little place was the perfect location for us, and we hope we can stay there again in the future."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wife and I stayed at Wendi’s for a long weekend away from the cold and it was everything we paid for and then some. The space was more than large enough for the two of us (had a room with two twins we didn’t use) and everything was clean and organized. Wendi was an incredible host who had a binder filled with things to do around town, the best restaurants with menus so we could pick out where we went based on what we wanted. Location wise, it was a short couple blocks into town (about 5 minutes on foot) which was perfect to stretch our legs before sitting on the ferry. We ran into Wendi on the first day and she was as nice as could be and gave us the inside scoop on everything about town, where to go, what to do, how to get there and the best time to do it. We loved every minute of the trip and would love to go back! 10/10 trip"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi is a lovely host and has a great place. She is super-friendly and helpful in every way. St. Mary's is a quiet, historic town and Wendi's place is withing easy walking distance of the Cumberland ferry and numerous restaurants. And the bonus for us was that Wendi let us use her golf cart to go to dinner! Very fun! Thanks Wendi!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi’s place is awesome. It’s easy to find and in a great location near downtown. Wendi was there to welcome us and give a tour of the space. Wendi is a teacher and it shows in her welcome book. It describes and suggests everything you need to know about the Airbnb as well as St Marys and the area. Her positive attitude and personality really helped us get in the mood for a fantastic adventure. The kayaking and hiking is so beautiful and the town is quaint and friendly. Be sure to see Cumberland Island.
We will return."

She is an outstanding Host and spoiled as with her hospitality. We felt like Familie. She provides excellent info about the area and what to do to enjoy our little mini vacation.
The neighborhood is nice, quite and close to the river and downtown. We have been at a lot of AirB&B and Wendi‘s place stands out for us Saône of the best exspiriere we have had."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Wendi’s place- I loved the accommodations and meeting Wendi and her son and all the animals- dogs, cats, chickens. Wendi was very responsive, friendly, easy to communicate with and flexible with my scheduling needs. She was so thoughtful with everything that was provided with the Airbnb. to make the stay GREAT. The place was quaint, clean, spacious and I felt right at home. Perfect setting for a quiet retreat after a couple days camping nearby. Great location to explore St. Mary’s and easy walk to Cumberland ferry. Hope to return again soon!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi goes above and beyond to make your stay as perfect as possible. From providing a binder of information about St. Mary’s to allowing you to use her beach stuff, she makes it very easy to have a great time. You are about a half a mile from the Cumberland Ferry dock and there are a bunch of cute shops around. Overall, great experience!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a marvelous stay with great weather and everyone we met in St. Mary's was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the Fernandina beach and it's easy access to the water.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about Wendi's place that has not already been said? Add my name to the list of guests who have been overwhelmed by Wendi's hospitality. We felt like we were visiting family! The connection was immediate. I must say that at first I wondered how it would be to stay next door to the owner of an airBnB, never had seen one like that before, but it turned out to be the best EVER! My sister and I both will now use this airBnB experience as a ""measuring rod"" for our future stays in other areas. This place and Wendi are too good to be true. Trying to find something to suggest to improve it but can't come up with a thing, seriously. So, to any future guests who may read this review, just go, you won't regret it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The place was very clean and walking distance to downtown and the Cumberland Ferry. Super comfy bed, pet friendly, and really great communication from Wendi. We felt very welcome!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi's place is very nice, clean and quiet. It was the perfect spot for us, in between various attractions, in GA and FL. The house is exactly as described and the pictures are accurate. Wendi is a great host and answered all our questions quickly. Even if the back porch is shared with her house there is a lot of privacy and the unit does not share any wall with the main house. I recommend Wendi's place, especially to people who are vacationing with a pet. It was a real plus to find such a nice, spacious place that allows pets."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb is a step above the rest. I booked Wendi’s place as we were relocating to the area. We were her longest stay and you couldn’t tell. We stay for about a month as we awaited the availability of permanent housing. From the moment we booked Wendi was the most accommodating and gracious host. Leaving us a welcome gift and Even letting us check out 30 minutes late so that we could sign our new lease without bringing the dog. Wendi is extremely knowledgeable of the area and was able to offer us wonderful advice. The moment that solidified the trip was the first night when I messaged about a lighter and no less than 30 seconds later Wendi was at the door saying “ask and you shall receive”. Our whole trip was like that, Wendi is wonderful and if you get the opportunity to Visit you should. She would do anything for any one who walks in the door."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really comfortable relaxing place to stay and enjoy St.Marys. If you're looking for parties, pools, action this is not the place. If you're looking for a peaceful place to stay this is it. Easy access to the riverfront restaurants and the ferry to Cumberland Island. I highly recommend Next Ta Sea!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a Great stay. Location was great in such a quaint town. From the little breakfast table there was a peek a boo view out to the marsh and a beautiful sunrise. So convenient to get over to Cumberland island. Would definitely stay again.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My girlfriend and I travel quite often for work, and we stay at several places a year using mainly this app. The generosity and effort put forth to making sure we were accommodated with everything we needed was over the top! That alone made this one of the best experiences we have had yet! The house is great and has everything needed for your stay, plus more! It is in a great location and one of the safest places we’ve been too. It exceeded our expectations by far and we will definitely book again when we are in the area!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and a great AirBNB host also!! If you are going to be visiting St Mary’s we HIGHLY recommend staying at Wendi’s. It’s a cool little cottage in a great location and Wendi is a fantastic host. It is also very convenient to Fernandinq Beach and we visited there and also made a day trip to Cumberland Island and Wendi’s cottage was an ideal “home base” for us to use to explore the area. THANK YOU WENDI !!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi's place was a great home away from home for a few days while we were visiting around St. Mary's and Cumberland Island and the perfect place for our quite family New Year's celebration and cooking a favorite dinner in the kitchen. We had everything we needed during our stay, and Wendi was happy to answer questions and offer recommendations for things to the do in the area. Wendi is a great host, and felt very welcome and at home during our stay. We had a slight change of travel plans, and Wendi also was kind enough to be flexible."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering this Airbnb then think no more and book it NOW! I couldn’t believe how reasonable it was. Wendi is a great hostess, too.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A big thank you to Wendi for providing such a great place for us to enjoy a girls’ weekend! We spent three nights and four days relaxing and visiting some cool places! We appreciated your advice on restaurants and fun things to do! House was spotless and had everything we needed!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Hi Wendi - It was so nice meeting you and your son. We appreciate your hospitality upon arrival and during our stay. It made our transition to St. Marys so much easier and enjoyable. Loved being downtown and able to walk to the surrounding cafes/restaurants. We will recommend your accommodations when friends are coming down to the St. Marys area. Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you around town. You totally deserve the SuperHost Award!!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing spot to visit so many things to do near our host house. She was very attentive to our needs and was very friendly. Soon we will be back. Thank you Wendi for everything.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendi was an amazing host and the house will definitely make you feel like you are at home. I have no bad complaints at all everything was perfect. She will greet you with open arms and make sure your comfortable. I definitely recommend her Airbnb anytime to tourists and contractors like myself that work at the Kings Bay Naval Base. Thanks a lot again Wendi!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, cozy and perfectly decorated place to stay! Our group had a lovely time and would definitely stay again- Wendi is great!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay we had with Wendi on our recent girl’s trip. It was like we had known her for years! She was so welcoming and check in-out could not have been easier. The Guest House was perfect and had everything we needed including utensils and cookware to prepare several meals. We enjoyed the suggestions Wendi shared with us about the area. On the last day, I unfortunately had a bicycle accident on Cumberland Island which required surgery and an overnight hospital stay. Wendi was amazing and offered to help in any way. Thank you Wendi!!! ❤️"
2021-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Following our stay, Wendi contacted me regarding damage to the apartment. This issue is still in dispute and I have agreed to resolve the issue through legitimate means. Wendi texted a request that I send $100 cash directly to her through Venmo or PayPal for the damage. She stated she has video of the apartment immediately prior to and after our stay as evidence that we caused damage, she has yet to provide these videos. Additionally, Wendi represents herself as owner of the property; however, she is not. I learned she is not the owner when speaking to her handyman who said he would contact the owner, Charles, regarding the repair. She had the handyman call me, I'm not sure why. He would not accept payment directly from me and will not provide a receipt. Wendi stated she would request payment for damages through Airbnb, when I agreed that would be best, she replied ""I'm trying to make this smooth."" After reviewing the videos, if it is determined the damage occurred during my stay, I would like to quickly and professionally resolve the issue with a licensed and insured handyman who can provide an invoice and receipt. Communication with this host has been very unusual and problematic in my experience with Airbnb."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Wendi’s! It was a perfect location for catching the ferry in St. Mary’s to go to Cumberland Island. And then when we were hot and exhausted after visiting Cumberland Island, it was a perfect place for relaxing!! Wendi was a lovely hostess, super helpful and friendly! She provided a ton of information about St. Mary’s, which we used for exploring the town.
Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This listing is SPOT ON! You are RIGHT in the heart of historic St. Mary's, GA. Wendi left us GREAT information about the area including sights to see, places to go, and DELISH eateries! Although we were visiting family, it was nice to have our own space to go back to at night. I like that the two bedrooms were on opposite sides of the place since my teenage daughter likes to chat with her friends a little later than I would like to be awake at night!
If other family looks for recommendations for a place to stay, I will DEFINITELY steer them to Nex-ta-sea!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wendi is a 5 star hostess - ready with local tips and so helpful! Her place was the perfect location for us, we will be back!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute place. Excellent small walk to town. Great place for a short trip.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful stay and experience. Wendi made everything so easy and stress free. I will definitely book here again when I go back. 10/10 recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Wendi’s Airbnb. Very thoughtfully decorated and cozy. Perfect for the whole family . We will definitely have Wendi host our family from out of town when the time comes! Truly a hidden gem! Thanks for everything .
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi was an awesome host from even before I got there. Making sure I had everything I needed. During my stay, hurricane Elsa came through bringing a tornado which took out some power lines. She immediately kept in touch with me making sure I was alright and even set me up with a new place for the night with power. 100% will stay here again and recommend this to anyone. Thank you again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From one host to another, Great place to stay, Great value, Great amenities, Great for pets, and Great host!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely time! It was perfectly located so that we could easily walk to downtown within 5 minutes. The recommendations from Wendi were perfect! We were luckily enough that there was a parade happening the morning we were leaving and Wendi was nice enough to let us keep the car parked so we could walk and enjoy the parade before leaving! We will definitely be back to come visit Cumberland Island (it rained on and off the 2 days we were there unfortunately) Thank you to Wendi and her son for playing with my daughter and letting her hold the chickens!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very nice stay at Wendi’s cottage. It had everything that we needed and was very comfortable. Wendi lives on the property so she was there for anything we needed and for recommendations on places to go. She was very nice. The cottage is beachy and cute. They started painting the exterior when we left. That will make the outside as pleasant as the inside. We we go back and will refer it to others.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi has a very comfortable two bedroom place. It is equipped with all the necessities of home. It's also very convenient to all the waterfront restaurants, shops, and museums. Her place is a good location to have a restful vacation. You'll want to stay longer than your reserved days."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host and super cute space!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you can find availability to stay here you should jump at the chance. The cottage is perfect and has all the comforts of home
Including privacy! St. Mary’s is a beautiful small town right on the GA/FL line and walking distance
To the river walk. Wendi is the hostess with the mostest! She had a welcome card for us and a check in book with tons of useful information about the area including a map and great instructions for what to expect during your stay. My dog was welcomed with a jar full of treats and an incredible pet sitter Bel Ange right next store where your fur baby is treated like family. Wendi left nothing to chance and exceeded our expectations!! Next ta Sea has something for everyone, trails, River walk, places of interest for history buffs and beautiful beaches close by, you will not be disappointed!
We will be back and can’t wait!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down the best rental I've ever stayed at. Wendi had a full binder of helpful suggestions on how to navigate tourist sites like a local so I saved time and money. She also offered what for me are the essentials for a successful beach day - beach toys, chairs, beach bags and most importantly a cooler. These are all objects I can't bring on an airplane. The rental was clean and airy -- my kids kept referring to it as the beach house from the theme. The location is also perfect. Each day I went on a different adventure and Wendi's rental is right in the middle. Savannah is 1.5 hrs north, St Augustine is 1.5 hrs south, Okefenokee swamp is 50 min west and the islands for daily beqch hopping were within 30 min east (you have to take a ferry or drive to reach the separate islands). We're definitely staying here again next summer"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great get away! Host is super helpful!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wendi’s place was exactly what we were looking for for our night in St. Mary’s. It was clean, comfortable, had all the necessities, and Wendi was very accommodating, friendly, and helpful. We will definitely stay here again in the future. Thank you, Wendi!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wendi is an excellent host!! She communicated throughout the checking process and also gave us lots of recommendations on what to do and where to eat in town!! She also made sure our daughters had everything they needed to have a great stay!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Great host. Highly recommended.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hi Wendi- thank you for a wonderful stay in St Mary’s. It was amazing to bring our doggy and have the dog sitter right next door. Everything we needed was available. Having your peaceful neighborhood to walk our dog was an added plus. Thank you for your St Mary’s attractions and eateries binder. We enjoyed reading it and it was very helpful. We would definitely stay with you again when we are in the area.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived we felt at home. From the quaint neighborhood, to the hospitality shown from our host. Wendi was very knowledgeable about St. Mary's and suggested some great local things to do, which we enjoyed! Any time we come this way, this will be our new spot to reserve!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Wendi is a fantastic host. Our daughter loved the chickens!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a nice getaway to the Georgia coastal area. Convenient to various islands. Quiet location to relax. Host is exceptional.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable with an “@ home” cozy feeling. It’s a great little friendly town with everything you need and more. Wendi left some nice Florida Oranges which I took to the waterfront and ate on the swings every morning. It’s not quite finished meaning a few added necessities needed which will probably be fulfilled before next guest. The entrance door sticks so keep trying - it’s not a 🔑 issue. Powerful shower. Ample supplies were nice. Wendi left a Beach travel cup that was cute. 8 minute walk to waterfront. Perfect bicycle riding, beautiful little park, and a water park a few miles away that wasn’t open yet but, I gave myself a tour. It’s very reasonably priced. 2 grocery stores, Walmart and a couple of department stores. The Riverfront Cafe had the best food I have EVER had and the other guests were commenting the same. The entrance to St. Mary’s is an eye sore with dilapidated buildings but, hang in there for a surprise. I’ll surely return."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendi is a lovely hostess, she took us on a golfcart tour and had wine for us to celebrate my friends 50th birthday!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in St Mary’s and at the Pelican’s Perch. Everything was not only as presented on the listing, but better! The furnishings inside were cozy and comfortable, and the patio and gardens were absolutely beautiful! Wendy was so helpful with recommendations for activities and reservations! Our day trip to Cumberland was wonderful!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendy was an excellent host. Her place is beautifully decorated and appointed. We really appreciated all the amenities. Wendy is a wonderful person and we would love to stay at her place again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay!! Had everything we could possibly need and so many special extras!! Perfectly clean and comfortable in every way! Friendliest hosts you will ever come across. We loved it and wish we had more time there and hope to return soon.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice place to stay. They thought of everything. Well thought out, spacious and nice decor. The gardens were the best!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at this beautiful apartment! Everything was clean, cozy, convenient and very comfortable. Mike and Wendy went above and beyond what most would do and that’s why they’re super hosts and guest favorites. We can’t wait to come back!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Five-Star Plus Experience! I spent over a month in their lovely, comfortable apartment. Enjoyed their beautifully manicured gardens. It was the perfect place to meditate, swing and watch the moon rise.

Wendy and Mike will leave you to your solitude or enjoy spirited conversations if you choose.

Thanks for having me. I will return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful hosts, location, and atmosphere in an art filled hideaway with all the bells and whistles. The golf cart was a huge selling point and we really enjoyed using it. The space is bigger than expected, and had plenty of room for everyone in our family of 4 to be comfortable. Our first time staying in St Mary’s is now our designated place to crash when we’re traveling through. We look forward to visiting again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the town , loved the apartment . So many nice touches and so comfortable . And did I mention how great the hosts were? Golf cart and bikes were such a nice touch. Perfect weekend away."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was exactly how you see in the pictures.Clean and organized with everything you need.I loved it and recomend the place 100%.
The welcoming was my favorite i did not expect it.Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Wendy’s place! Lovely plants and garden - there was always something new to check out! Super charming decorations. Could tell a lot of thought went into making it comfy and homey! Golf great was a great perk - had a nice little drive to dinner downtown! Overall, fantastic stay and beautiful place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice. It’s beautiful, clean, colorful & decorative. It’s a one bedroom apartment (with ALL the amenities) detached from their house above a garage. She really put a lot of thought in making sure we had everything we needed for a nice stay including labeling everything. The place is private and surrounded by beautiful landscaping but minutes to downtown & the ferry. Perfect location for visiting Cumberland Island. We enjoyed driving the golf cart to a antique store around the corner & dinner. Highly recommend! Thanks for letting us stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The golf cart was a huge plus. Very clean and just like described.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful garden, peaceful patio, clean and spacious living space! We loved riding our bikes to the ferry and then biking all around Cumberland Island from there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy's place was exactly what we were looking for minus a waterfront view but the price would have been more of course for that so this place was perfect. We were able to park our 15 ft Jon boat, grilled steaks outside, golf cart around the community and have everything inside the unit we needed with a comfy bed, nice shower and a equip kitchen to cook in, it's a perfect place for a couple. St. Mary's is a very small community with a few restaurants, to enjoy a peaceful atmosphere and going out on the water, to go to Cumberland Island to see the wild horses and find you a private beach all to yourself."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay. Was as good as our first. Charming well appointed cottage. Friendly and accommodating hosts. Convenient to the city. Great for day trips to St Simons. Amelia. Looking forward to our next visit.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect! Loved having the use of their golf cart and bikes! Yard is interesting with lots of vegetation and birds. Hope to return again someday!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Definitely the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. It deserved way more than 5 stars. Wendy and Mike were wonderful and very nice and friendly. This place was loaded with everything to make it feel just like home. They even had a golf cart and bicycles! The grounds were gorgeous and the inside of Pelican’s Perch was extremely gorgeous as well. They went above and beyond to make us extremely comfortable. Great place to stay and you can walk to great restaurants and explore the historic downtown area. We highly recommend Wendy and Mikes place!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were both super friendly and so were their dogs. It was our first time to the area and they helped us navigate the best places to see. The residence was extremely homey, clean, and comfortable. They had everything we needed to include soap, shampoo, coffee, backpacks, bikes with helmets, maps and brochures. It will definitely be our go to place whenever we are in the area."

Wendy and Michael were welcoming, incredibly helpful and eager to share information about the area to help you navigate food/shopping/fun options while there. The best place to stay and will definitely be back :) Check out/check in was easy, communication was great. Both beds were comfortable, nice linens."

Fabulous location in a lovely town full of wonderful people.
Hosts provide excellent suggestions and are easily accessible. History books provide background. Amenities galore-- our favorite, the golf cart.
You may just have to come again."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage; Everything you would need for a long weekend stay. Comfortable; Hosts were amazing and access to bikes and golf-cart. Beautiful grounds surrounding the cottage. Located in a good place for walks/bikes of St.M. as well as jumping off point for J.I. and S.S. And if you are going over to Cumberland then this is the place to be.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic and cozy place. Has everything you need and a few nice touches on top of that. The place was super clean and had a great feel to it. The hosts are friendly, but not intrusive. We'd definitely stay again!!!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pelicans Perch is such a cute place. We enjoyed our stay very much. It was very clean and was nice to be able to do laundry after a day at the island. Its less than a 2 minute drive to the Cumberland Island ferry and downtown St. Mary's. The use if the golf cart was great.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Pelican's Perch is a clean, comfortable place to stay. We had everything we needed which made our move to the area much easier. Wendy and husband, Mike, are friendly and easy to work with."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great little spot in St Mary's. I stayed here with my son and husband for a visit to Cumberland Island.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful accommodations with use of a golf cart and bicycles close to all restaurants and ferry to Cumberland island. Laundry is available, lots of space as it is a true above garage apartment and lots of special touches that make the stay so memorable!!!!!"

Beautiful grounds, super clean, everything you need to cook, grill, etc. I hope we will be back one day to explore the Cumberland island (when our daughter is a bit older)."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"St. Mary's is a great hidden gem and staying at Pelican Perch was the icing. Coming home in the evening and lounging in the gardens, watching the birds in one of the many feeders, or smelling the fresh roses and jasmine was the highlight. Wendy's home and grounds are immaculate with the right touches everywhere you look. The garage apartment was private with all the amenities needed for a quiet weekend. Give this a 5 star rating and would highly recommend to all."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful home away from home. Everything was perfect and better than I could hope for. The owners are kind, the yard is a beautiful and relaxing oasis! Coffee outside in the morning was so relaxing. The house was spotless, and decorated adorably! I could go on and on. I appreciated all the extras that make a stay away from home easier. A cooler, ice packs, board games, books, dvds, brochures and maps for the area, bikes, the golf cart, every kitchen item you might need, and many more things I am probably forgetting. St Mary is a lovely area, and you are also close enough to take quite a few day trips. I appreciated the suggestion of Jekyll Island- as this was a lovely place to visit. I hope to return soon and and would recommend Pelicans Perch to anyone considering a trip to to GA."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the best Air Bnbs. The grounds are amazing, Wendy is so lovely. Super clean. The beds were comfy. And the extras like bikes, patio and the golf cart make it a must!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! From the amazing interior to thoughtful touches (beverages, snacks) PLUS getting to use the golf cart to explore downtown St. Mary's...AND the washer and dryer! Oh my goodness. This little hide-a-way was a welcome and restful retreat after we finished a long (340 miles!) kayaking trip. We vegged out on the comfortable couch and recliner, watched movie (a solid selection), slept GREAT in the comfy bed, enjoyed the breakfast nook, used the golf cart, cooked meals in the well-stocked kitchen and generally had a ridiculously great time. This place is awesome and we will definitely go back!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't have imagined a better stay than the one at Pelican's Perch. The space was so clean, so comfortable, so convenient, and completely full of extra touches like snacks and thoughtful notes everywhere about how to use the space. Wendy was very generous letting me use the golf cart whenever I needed it and lending me a bike to take a ride around town. When I go back to St. Mary's this is where I want to stay. It's quiet and extremely convenient to the center of town + Cumberland Island ferry dock. So happy I stayed here and grateful to Wendy for her hospitality!!"

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place in the area!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pelican Perch is a loft apartment above a garage adjacent to the owner’s home.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow! The pictures do not do this place justice. My stay there was phenomenal. The Pelican Perch does not lack one single thing that you may need to have a wonderful stay. All the amenities you could possibly ask for including a fully stocked kitchen with every possible appliance, utensil, plates, bowls, paper towels and a stocked refrigerator with all the condiments that you could possibly need. A super location for enjoying southeast Georgia and it’s nearby islands. Make sure you carve out enough time enjoy the wild horses on Cumberland Island and the wild and crazy people at Captain Stan‘s Smokehouse to which my wonderful hosts, Wendy and Mike took me. You will not find two nicer people to serve as your hosts while enjoying their beautiful property. Without question, this is the finest Airbnb stay I have yet to experience."
