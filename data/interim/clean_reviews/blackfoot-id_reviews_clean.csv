2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôd give Carla six stars if I could! This was an absolutely perfect place to get some rest and work before continuing on a very long drive. Carla was incredibly generous with giving me a late checkout, and that made life a whooooole lot easier as I tried to figure out the logistics of several meetings when en route to Boise. The cabin is even nicer than it looks in the pictures. I would‚Äôve happily stayed for a longer and would definitely stay here again. Thank you to Carla for being such a great host and welcoming me to your lovely cabin home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a nice well stocked cottage! Very relaxing out there on the Snake River Plains. Paddling and fishing on the Snake River only a couple miles away.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of our favorite airbnbs we've ever stayed in. The cottage was very clean, cozy, and peaceful, which is what we needed on our road trip. The scenery is absolutely stunning.Our dogs usually take a moment to settle in new surroundings, but right away they seemed to really like it too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage was in a great location for us on a road trip. Peaceful and quiet, it was a tidy little house with everything we needed. We stayed with our two dogs, who loved the lush grassy yard and the shade of a beautiful willow tree. Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Carla is quite probably the best host on AirBnB. She goes above and beyond and is a big reason why we have stayed in her cottage three different times. Already looking forward to staying in her cottage again next year. Thanks again Carla for being such an exceptional host and for providing the perfect cottage for my family!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carla's cottage was exactly as described, and just what we wanted and needed. It's adorable, private, and clean. We loved being able to bring our 2 small dogs, and having a full kitchen, and washer/dryer. We were lucky enough to meet Carla, and she was so friendly. The area is beautiful, and very convenient to visit our family in the area. Thank you Carla! We can't wait to visit again. Take care, Bethany"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and home!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is what an AirBnB is supposed to be. Clean. Comfortable. Home. Value. Carla was so kind. The place was so clean. If you are looking for a relaxing place to spend a night that feels like home this is the place. So worth the 15 minutes from the interstate. May be the best value left on AirBnB. Thank you Carla for sharing your farm house with us.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's place was one of the best AirBNB's I've stayed at. The cottage was clean, private, quiet, and comfortable. It was perfect for someone like myself who was passing through the area. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So place was perfect, weather, yard, birds singing. I have stayed here several times but this time the weather, eveything made it perfect. I slept better here then I do at my house, very refreshing place. super cool setting from the mountains I come from, fields upon fields of open land and crops being planted. pretty cool..."

The cottage is sparkling clean, the bed is incredibly comfortable, nice hot shower with good water pressure - all the things a traveler appreciates. Highly recommend if you want to decompress. Carla is kind and responsive should you need anything during your stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The willow tree cottage was a wonderful place to rest after a day on the road. Carla was a great host. With gorgeous views of the farm lands coupled with cozying up by the gas stove, I‚Äòll be back! Definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We love this Cottage! We‚Äôve stayed 3 yrs in a row as a stop over for various road trips and it is just such a lovely stop over after long drives. And our dogs love it just as much as we do.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,One of the best places on airbnb!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We went from Twin Falls to Idaho Falls on Highway 86 and 15. Previously we went through Pocatello. I suggest you skip Pocatello, heading north at American Falls on Highway 39 to the tiny place called Pingree then on to Blackfoot. It is only a few miles extra, but the drive is worth it. You will love driving through the farmlands and rural beauty of Idaho. Stay at Carla‚Äôs little Willow Tree Cottage.
It is clean, quiet, peaceful and dog-friendly. Our dog was intrigued with the cows and horses close by. Don‚Äôt pass this place by. We liked it so much that we stayed there again going back South.
I recommend this little gem."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was so nice to drive through the countryside to get to this little cottage. It was so great to see all of the farming. It was clean and very quiet. It is well stocked and had everything we needed.
At first I was surprised that there was no TV. But I think that is a great idea because then you get to really enjoy yourself and relax.
It was nice to sit on the porch and enjoy all of the green grass around the cottage.
We loved having a dog friendly place. It would be nice if it was fully fenced, but we got by just fine.
We liked this cottage so much that we are going to stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at the Willowtree Cottage took me back to a much cherished time in my life when I had the opportunity to live in the country. This peaceful and cozy farmhouse will not disappoint if you can appreciate what it doesn't have, that being frills. It is off the beaten path but still close to necessities. I would not hesitate to book with this host again. Carla is very respectful of your privacy, you will probably only see her in passing as she is doing chores. I am writing this the day after I left as my 2 city dogs are still sleeping off their 4th of July weekend in the country."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's cottage was an amazing place to stay! It's quiet and quaint. It was exactly the restful place we needed after traveling and camping.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was a breeze, a little escape from bustling life. The cottage is cute and has all the amenities needed, including internet (but the books are better). Would come back to stay again. PS: there is a friendly tabby on the property that loves pets."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect little cottage in a private country setting for a nice, quiet getaway - no TV, no traffic, and no noisy neighbors. Carla was a gracious host and welcomed us upon our arrival. We would most definitely return."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla was very kind and accommodating, she responded to texts right away and helped us find the separate driveway. Such a cute little cottage home with beautiful views and a very comfortable bed! Plenty of games and great books to explore. 10/10 would stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was an adorable little cottage. It was perfect for our sister weekend. we look forward to coming back many times.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is an absolute gem, especially if you're looking to unplug and enjoy some peace and quiet. Everything is so clean, and cozy, the bed is like a cocoon I did not want to emerge from. Carla is so accommodating and warm. Highlights are the beautiful fireplace, the willow tree - of course, and I saw some swans in the field. Off the beaten path, so take provisions, and enjoy your respite in this sweet place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cosy place to stay! Was clean and was very easy to communicate with the host.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Willow cottage was a cozy little place to get away from all the busyness of the city. Really great place to unwind and relax. Carla is a great host with really great communication.

Days!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Love staying at Carla‚Äôs farm house in a rural setting. It‚Äôs very comfortable and has everything we need. This was our second visit and we‚Äôll definitely stay there again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is even better than expected! It‚Äôs private without being isolated and has everything you could need. We were lucky enough to see a beautiful sunset, sunrise, and an owl! Thanks so much!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Carla‚Äôs place and I would recommend it. it‚Äôs a great rural location, perfect for our dogs. It‚Äôs a cool, old farmhouse with modern touches, very comfortable and roomy with great views."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Carla‚Äôs Willow Tree cottage for two nights in mid-December, and it was a perfect, off-the-beaten-path retreat spot. There were swans wintering in nearby farm fields, which was special to see. I highly recommend for the sense of seclusion and the view of the mountains and buttes. All the furniture was very comfortable, and I got to run all my laundry before heading home."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage was a nice place to stop over and stay during a long road trip. We had our dog with us, and he was able to settle in nicely- no loud noises, cars going by, or other disturbances you get in more populated areas or shared buildings. The living room was so cozy, and we were able to decompress and stay away from screens for the evening, which was relaxing. The space was small and nice, the bed was extremely comfortable, and we were only there for a quick 12 hours, so it was great that check in and check out were speedy and convenient. It is a little out of the way- especially driving up at night through some dark back roads-but directions were clear and description was accurate. If you're looking for somewhere off the beaten path for a very quiet stay, this is your answer."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy cottage. Clean and comfortable. One of my favorite bnbs!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a charming, relaxing cottage. We‚Äôve stayed here on two different occasions as an overnight stop while on a road trip and they were both wonderful. I loved having my cup of coffee in the front porch chairs while the dogs rolled around in the grass, great way to start the day."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice price and included with all the essentials. Good location to get away from the hustle and bustle.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a good value and a peaceful location-you just found it. This home is just like being at home. It clean,cozy and comfoetable."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is exactly as described. We were pleased with how clean it and how quiet it was. Carla was very friendly.
We are from the city and living on a farm for 2 days was fun. We did, however, discover that our pup at 20 months old couldn‚Äôt resist investigating the farm fields and the cows. We found 3/4 of a fence yard had us on edge or her tethered to us. The bathroom was super small and the bed not very comfortable. The cottage is WAY out in the sticks which we now know we don‚Äôt prefer, but that is just our preference."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean little place as advertised. Nothing in the area but it was perfect for me as my class was just down the road. Carla is a good host and very helpful."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful place a bit off the beaten path. Birdsong, several cows and a sheep. Traveling with out adolescent cat and she loved the place as much as we did! Thanks, Carla"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed here late one night. This place was perfect for our road trip back home.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the nicest and most peaceful AirB&B we‚Äôve stayed at. It‚Äôs such a special experience and I wish we could have stayed longer. I highly recommend staying, a steal at twice the price."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking to get off the interstate & motels? Exquisite little gem tucked away in Pingree. Charming, super clean vintage vibe in quiet, rural green setting. Carla is A+ Host!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very private and off the beaten path, which I loved! Quiet and relaxing. Beautiful sunset. Clean and cozy. Wonderful deck and yard for my dog Goose to play in! We loved it!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little cottage!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We‚Äôve stayed here twice and both times have been fantastic. A quiet place to rest and explore. One of our favorite AirBnBs. Carla is a great host too. Super private cottage, quiet, serene, and pleasant."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at the cottage and it was just as charming in the summer as it was in the winter! I fully enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and comfortable space. My pup and I highly recommend it.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Willow Tree Cottage was just perfect! Super clean, comfy and pet friendly. We absolutely loved the farmland setting. It's remove from town is what makes it so peaceful and restorative. Lovely place to spend a few days in the beauty of the Idaho farm country."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute cottage! A great place to stay out in the country if you are in the area. We would definitely stay again.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was beautiful. Perfect spot for me and my pups for a few days. It was really clean and the owner was very nice and welcoming (I happened to arrive as she was working on the property). It was nice that she got to meet my dogs and even let her dog play with mine for an hour or so after we arrived. The bed was comfortable and the cottage was equipped with the basics. There was no TV but, honestly, that was nice. I feel that it allowed me the space to decompress. In the morning the sunrise view was amazing and one of my favorite parts about the cottage, along with the quiet. I would recommend this place to anyone coming through."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is so wonderful and Carla is a lovely host! It's a cozy space with a thermostat for the chilly months (I was there during wind/snow and it was so warm with the fireplace on!) There is a coffee pot and coffee which was important for me :) and even popcorn! It was nice to have a washer/dryer, and nice hot shower for warming up. It's a quiet location too so very peaceful. A perfect stay if in the area. Thank you!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful time at the cottage! It is such a comfortable and cozy place. It was the perfect retreat from the snow and cold, especially with the lovely fire place. Thank you for a beautiful weekend!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderfully unique find - such a sense of history in an old cottage that has been updated just enough to modern standards and beyond without losing the historical charm. The host was friendly and communicative, the check in and out super easy. Loved the bookcase filled with classics, Stephen King and games - with no TV, was reminded of the pleasures of disconnectedness (while still having wifi). Beautiful views of the Snake River and Rockies on Idaho rt 39."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a snug, quiet, and cozy little farmhouse! It was everything I hoped it would be. Thank you for the lovely stay."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's place is a quiet retreat from city noise and chaos.
We cooked our dinner in the neat, tidy kitchen and watched the cozy fire while we ate. After dinner we perused the book shelf filled with a broad variety of classic and modern titles, then read ""Castles of the World"" together on the comfy couch under a blanket.
I watched the sunset through the living room windows from the delightful rocking chair, and the sunrise lit up the bedroom through the blinds in the morning.
The bathroom does have a shower/tub combination, but the room is pretty small and tight, with no counter space.
The whole place is very clean and appealingly decorated.
Overall a very quiet, pleasant cottage."

2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had brief trouble connecting to Wifi, and Carla responded immediately...within 5 minutes she popped over and solved the problem. We really appreciated how quickly she took care of it. We arrived after dark, and the beautiful willow tree in the front yard was a nice bonus to wake up to."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing and secluded cottage in the middle of farmland. Will definitely stay again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quit and comfortable place. Lovely fireplace keeping the entire place warm even during cold nights. Great place for a short stay. If you plan for an extended stay keep in mind the location is a bit far from the cities/stores/restaurants so better come stocked with groceries.

Verry comfortable and Carla is a great communicator. I would not hesitate to stay again."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place! It was a perfect respite after a hot day of driving. The cottage was cool and comfortable and sparkling clean! The cleanest of clean spaces - which is especially appreciated in this pandemic time. It‚Äôs a beautifully decorated cottage in a lovely country setting. And so quiet that even the cows were courteous.
Carla is a great host and responded immediately to all my messages. I highly recommend this place. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place. It was the perfect spot after Yellowstone in our road trip. Very cozy and homey place, plus laundry room was clutch for an extended road trip. Very clean for Covid worried travelers. And Carla was very accommodating and hospitable."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's cottage was a sweet little landing spot for my drive between Colorado and Oregon. I wish I had arrived a little earlier because it was a little hard to find in the dark after a long day on the road, but Carla met me out at the drive and showed me in which I was very grateful for! I slept well and enjoyed breakfast under the big willow tree in the morning sun before getting back on the road! Thank you Carla!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place! It‚Äôs even better than the pictures suggest, we were thrilled with our stay. Easy access to so many great fishing spots and it‚Äôs an easy drive to Blackfoot if you need any ‚Äúbig city‚Äù amenities. The local country store had plenty of necessities in case you forget anything. The huge tree out front provides excellent shade so you can enjoy the front yard and it‚Äôs views at any time of day. We loved it and hope to come stay again some day."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our visit to Pingree ID! Carla was a great host.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"When we booked our night at Willow Tree Cottage, little did we know that 800 miles from home, our road trip would take an unexpected turn for the worst. We awoke one morning to find our 6-year-old Dachshund, Ragu, paralyzed from the waist down. Fortunately, we were able to find an excellent clinic and surgeon in Salt Lake City. Ragu underwent surgery that same evening. Unfortunately, the road to recovery is going to be long and extensive. He is still not walking to this day. We praise God for Carla‚Äôs home, which was clean and cozy. The perfect place for us to care for our little Ragu, while at the same time giving us the chance to unwind, regroup and shed our tears in comfortable privacy."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Carla's place is a great little country place. Nice mountain views. Awesome be that she allows pets. Nice that she left bagels and yogart. Her response was very quick to my questions. Thanks
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a country experience, which was exactly what we (my 15-week old puppy and I) wanted. We very much enjoyed meeting four all-black calves and I enjoyed holding a couple of the adorable 6-week old kittens. We both found the cottage relaxing and country familiar (we live in the country too). Air conditioning made the house comfortable despite the heat in the area as did the shade from the willow tree."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cozy place, great AC during the hot summer, nice peaceful and quiet location."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will find everything you need in a cosy Little cottage in an amazing surrounding.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, clean and peaceful with proximity to the Snake River"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic cottage in a quiet community in eastern Idaho. Perfect for my wife and I and our small dog. We were concerned about fireworks noise as we stayed on the 4th of July but Carla assured us that our stay would be quiet - the only noise we heard was wind, rain, and the occasional cow. Perfect. Looking forward to staying again next year."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to relax and unwind!
We stopped here for a few days on our cross country road trip and couldn‚Äôt wish for a better place. Beautiful, peaceful, immaculately clean house. Excellent base for Craters of the Moon or day trip to Yellowstone, or just to enjoy Idaho."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated. It was well supplied with everything one could have needed. Carla even stocked the fridge with some fresh breakfast supplies. The area is quiet and safe. My dog loved the lawn and we enjoyed a walk down the adjacent gravel road a couple of times a day. I wish I could have stayed longer.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was great little cottage and very clean. We stayed there for two nights and it was unforgettable.
Thank you"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla, is very hospitable, even included a breakfast for us which was not expected, but really appreciated. There was not a TV, which at first we thought was a bummer, but she had ALOT of really amazing books, and we ended up playing some board games that she had provided. We ended up staying up pretty late without realizing it, just because we were having so much fun with the games!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came for our son‚Äôs wedding open house and we chose Carla‚Äôs place because it was very close to the venue. Now that we have stayed at Willowtree cottage, we would go out of our way to stay there. It brought back memories of happy, relaxed farm life. We checked-in, showered and went to the open house. When we returned, exhausted, the porch light was on, and the fire that operates on thermostat had the whole place cozy so we could just go right to bed. When I got up in the middle of the night needing some water, discovering the bottled water and continental breakfast in the fridge was wonderful!!! We enjoyed our bagels with cream cheese and homemade raspberry jam by the fire in the comfy living room before going on our way. Wish we could have stayed longer."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect little oasis just outside of Blackfoot to rest up from a day of playing. We came to compete in agility at the East Idaho Dog Classic. This was about a 20 minute drive southwest of Blackfoot. It was dog friendly and the yard is fenced on three sides which was very nice. Carla also provided a fully stocked kitchen and left breakfast items in the refrigerator which was a nice surprise. Air conditioning and hot showers were a blessing after a day out in the sun. The bed was very comfortable as well. Thanks again. I have told others about it and they couldn't believe my luck. I am glad I booked it 3 months early.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was exactly what I was looking for. A place that was off the beaten path, where I could rest my head an a clean space and not be at a hotel with my dogs barking at passers by outside. It was nice to have the wrap around driveway and a yard and water hose to air/feed/water my dogs (my dogs are working dogs and do not come in the house). My reason for being in that area was only a few miles away and so location was really convenient for what I needed! the place was very clean! An older cottage for sure, but well kept, updated and super clean, and perfect for my needs with kitchen, laundry room, mud-room etc. Nice touches like the fresh home-grown roses and some basics in the fridge were appreciated. Carla was super friendly and helpful! They live right next door, so I felt like if there was anything I needed (which there wasn't), it would be no problem to ask."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't let the fact that this cottage is a little ""off the beaten path"" dissuade you. It is a wonderfully cozy home and close enough to Idaho Falls, Blackfoot and Pocatello that they are easy to get to. The cottage is very comfortable and Carla made us feel right at home. The back deck would be a wonderful place to spend a summer or fall evening (were were there in the winter so a little chilly for us though!). We enjoyed the technology free evenings and the walks along the fields. This was a great value and I highly recommend Carla as a hostess."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is so very quaint and adorable. The heater keeps you nice and toasty while you enjoy the cozy couch, clean and comfy bed, or brew yourself a cup of complementary coffee. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the wide array of books provided and played a few games while relaxing. Carla was incredibly understanding and quickly responded to any questions about our late check in and the options for bringing along our pup. Highly recommend this little cottage if you‚Äôre in this beautifully rural area of Idaho."
2018-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great peaceful place, close to the desert and the Craters of the Moon National Forest."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love this little house. It is so perfect for a quiet relaxing getaway. The last few times my husband and I have gone we have had plans to go fishing right off of Tilden Bridge. But with as relaxing as this little house is my next visit there will be simply for relaxation. I plan to take a couple of books and a couple of downloaded movies and just relax in the house for the entire time that we rent it for. It is clean and comfortable and most importantly incredibly relaxing. 2 times now I have got some of the best sleep in my life in this house.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is a gem. Away from the noise of city life and everything you need. Carla made us feel so welcome.
2017-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice little cottage among the potato fields. Kids will love running around and adults will find peace.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable, clean and quiet. It was the first time my husband and i truly relaxed. We used both the back and front patio. We got to see some cute kitties and one was friendly enough to visit. This home is what we wanted.... to be in the country and have peace."
2017-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cottage with great yard & area. Quite and peaceful. Kitchen was perfect for making breakfast!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla was a great host, gave us a tour and let us enjoy the home for a perfect stay!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of our favorite airbnb's we have ever stayed in! Not only was Carla more than accommodating to our needs and terribly late arrival time, but she was so warm and welcoming, it felt as if we had come to a familiar place. The cottage was beautiful, inviting, and comfortable. Carla did her best to insure we were comfortable and provided for during our short stay and left me wishing we were staying longer. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, tucked away little cottage, with no tv! This was exactly what we needed to get away, finish books, and play board games. We loved our stay here! We loved her selection of books to choose from :)"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla was a wonderful host! She was helpful and left us bagels and even homemade jam for breakfast. The cabin was just like the pictures, Very homey and secluded, and was a great reprieve from our travels. There were many books to read and Carla did lots of little things to make the cabin feel like a home away from home. When we visit family in this area we will definitely stay again!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carla's cottage was very secluded out in the farm country. Provided a quiet and restful night's sleep. She provided some breakfast items in the fridge and fruit on the counter. Even though it's off the beaten path, it's worth the extra drive, very private and quiet."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed here twice on our tour through Idaho and both times the cottage has been our oasis. It's warm, cozy and quiet. I cannot recommend this place enough for anyone looking for a quiet retreat. It's something wonderful."
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A tiny cottage with wonderful views of the Idaho mountains. The place is a perfect getaway for anyone in search of some quiet. I can not recommend Willow Tree high enough.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very well taken care of place with good proximity to National Parks
2023-06-01,3,Stayed about a week,"It was ok quiet and clean way out in the boonies you wont be close to anything!!
Had a couple problems where the host entered the premises after check in time without announcing themselves because they didnt see a car a profiling situation from Co but also a couple from us i forgot to add +1 a stain and trash that was left out but don‚Äôt hesitate to rent this place linda was an ok human invited us to pick from her garden"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If your looking for a relaxing place to stay, this is it. Very quiet with all amenities at your fingertips. Clean & well taken care of property. Lovely scenery with lots of wildlife. Wonderful hosts who are just great people. Thank you Linda & Amador, it was a pleasure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Excellent place, quite country retreat. Close enough but far away to really feel the country life. Highly recommend. The hosts are the best. 5 + stars"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Loved it. If I‚Äôm ever in the area again I will definitely come back üëåüèΩ
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was a quaint quiet place. The house is fully furnished, and the kitchen is equipped with just about anything you might need. Additionally, there is a grill available. As far as the location, this home is located deep in an agricultural/residential area with views of the Snake River. The place itself, it‚Äôs a bit far from town, especially if doing business in Pocatello. Nonetheless, boasts of a serene ambiance, and it is frequented by various wildlife.
During our stay, we were able to see a few moose, mule deer, coyotes, porcupines (alive!!), muskrat, owls, kingfishers, raptors, among many bird‚Äôs species. Even got a show by seeing a red tail hawk snatching a poor squirrel. There appeared to be three resident moose that we were able to observe frequently during our last two weeks here. Additionally, the area is dark enough that on clear nights you can even see the trail of the milky way. Great spot for star gazing and sunset watching. Perfect location if you want to escape the city noise and light pollution and like to enjoy nature."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Linda and Amador were great. They communicated with us very well and were so welcoming. They even let us have some of their veggies from their home garden. The space was clean upon arrival but it was upsetting when a lot of bugs ended up getting into the second bedroom and we weren't able to use it for the entire month. It had everything we needed to cook and clean for the month including bathroom amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and soap. Very secluded area, quiet. We loved how close we were to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. A hidden gem in the area was Craters of the Moon which was only a short drive away."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"(Long stay) Amador and Linda were great hosts; their communications were timely and clear. The cottage includes many special touches and the stay guide was straightforward. The house is very well-equipped for long stays and there is plenty of information available on how to make the most of the stay (not including the wealth of information Amador and Linda offer given their direct experience hiking and camping in the region.)
The cottage is located in a quiet area and the grocery store is located within a 15 minute drive. There is also a Walmart near the grocery store.
The beds are super comfy and the place was spotless!
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and are most grateful to Amador and Linda for hosting us!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Amazing experience, we would definitely stay there again. The hosts were super helpful, beds very comfortable, clean and well equipped home. So quiet too, only the sound of birds"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Friendly, attentive, and responded quickly when we communicated a great and squeaky clean place. I totally recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love this Cottage! ‚ù§
Secluded, very clean and comfortable. Don't miss out on the peaceful place surrounded by lots of wildlife!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful location on the Snake River. Very quiet and peaceful.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a very nice stay at the cottage on our way to Montana. It‚Äôs not too far off I-15 and the directions given during check-in helped. It‚Äôs a very private area and the place was so nice and clean! Had a great night‚Äôs rest (amazing bed!) and the cottage is kept warm by heaters in every room. We had a Subaru Forester with a Thule roof cargo and it fit perfectly in the garage. It helped so much! Will visit again as I assume it is beautiful there in the summer & will be lovely to see the river.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to stay! Right on the river, nice and quiet out of the way location. I‚Äôll definitely book it again soon!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cottage that is quiet and isolated. A nice get away from the bustling city. We would‚Äôve loved to explore the area more. The hosts are wonderful and my son and I had a great time.
2020-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,Nice if you want to get away from the busy city lifestyle.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need is there and has been thought of from kitchen gadgets to toiletries.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage on Snake River is a beautiful place off of the beaten path with all the amenities, comfortable beds and ample outdoor space for a relaxing retreat. Linda and Amador were perfect hosts. Even though we arrived late in the evening, Amador greeted us with a warm welcome.
The cottage is a good place to stay if you want to avoid crowed lodging in Jackson Hole, but it‚Äôs almost 3 hours away. Since it was raining in the Tetons, we took a beautiful loop drive up to Targhee Ski Resort and hiked the trails there. I highly recommend The Cottage on Snake River for people who like to be out in the country surrounded by wildlife."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a view, I loved the house. It was such a peaceful place to stay at. No noise from the city and an honest it was a breath of fresh air. Linda and Armando where very loyal people. We definitely enjoyed our stay."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little gem of a place was so lovely! We stayed here to visit Craters of the Moon National Reserve. Linda and Amador were super quick to respond and they are such warm and welcoming folks! The cottage had everything we needed and was organized and clean. We also loved watching the birds outside on the yard in the morning, it was very relaxing. 10/10 recommend!! :)"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great spot. I was staying with a coworker so it was great the the bedrooms were on opposite ends of the space. Love the location. Even saw a great horned owl!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a perfect retreat from the bustling world we all live in. The place was super clean and very nice. Linda and Amador were fantastic hosts. We'll never forget our stay on this beautiful property.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,The cottage is a great place. It is so clean!! It is also quiet and peaceful.
2020-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quick responses

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location if you are looking for somewhere quiet and scenic. Extremely cosy and clean. Well stocked with everything you need. Hosts were very helpful. Loved our stay.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Linda and Amador have a very comfy home. Loved the beds and the location of the place. Country setting nice and relaxing for a peaceful stay. Slept very well on their comfortable beds. Kitchen fully stocked as well. Would definitely stay their again
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very well set up unit. Very comfortable and quiet. Very good hosts, who provided great travel tips. Would stay here again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was gorgeous. There are large grounds to wander and we were able to see some wildlife.
Amador and Linda are great! We were greeted with a tour and felt welcome at the property. There were several thoughtful touches- several types of coffee makers, extra toiletries, labels on light switches, and much more. The unit was clean and had great lighting. We will likely stay again when we return to the area."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice and clean. Linda and Amador are very welcoming and walked us through everything . My family and I will be back again
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely off the beaten path, the property is so quiet and relaxing. Linda and Amador are amazing hosts ,but most importantly clean-clean-clean.
They have thought of every detail."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean with fine attention to detail. Great use of space - more space than I expected from seeing the exterior photo. Hosts are awesome. Great stop for us after visiting Craters of the Moon National Monument. Would love to visit again when in Idaho!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I travel mainly for work and I‚Äôve used Airbnb or HomeAway rentals a handful of times over the past year. Linda and Amador are the absolute best hosts I‚Äôve experienced. They maintain their property with a keen eye to details that make travel bearable. The home has everything you could need plus all of the little extras just Incase you forgot something. I really appreciated how the house felt like a commercial rental but they treated you like old friends who‚Äôve come for a visit. They definitely set the bar for other property owners to follow.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Linda and Amador were absolutely amazing and welcoming hosts. The cottage is super cute and in a secluded area that was easily found and had beautiful views. Everything we needed was ready at check in and all we had to do was get our food for the week.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Linda & Amador's home is absolutely beautiful!! It was perfect for our stay - I only wish we could have stayed longer. Linda spent time to give us information on going to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National parks. She offered vegetables from her garden, although we didn't have the time to go pick anything. The home is in a beautiful country setting with a big yard. We had a lot of privacy and lots of room in the house. Linda and Amador are wonderful hosts and very friendly. I would highly recommend their AIRBNB to anyone!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda and Amador have an absolutely amazing place. So quiet and tranquil, we would definitely stay again."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and quite place. Great place to relax,"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Linda and Amador were great hosts, and we really loved the cottage. Lovely private property where you can just kick back and relax :)"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was perfect. It was clean and comfortable. The area was so peaceful and pretty
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place out of the way. Peaceful
2019-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A home away from home and a slice of solitude.
My co-worker and I stayed for a month. Linda‚Äôs Cottage is placed perfectly next to Snake river. There is plenty wild life and nature here to see. Its great for fishing, photographers or the nature person that just want to take it all in. The Cottage it‚Äôs self is very cozy with everything you need and then some. It‚Äôs well located and within 20 min of all you may need.
Linda is very knowledgeable about the area and gave us plenty of sites to see and places to venture to, all which aren‚Äôt to far of a drive.
P.S.
Linda makes delicious home made bread!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This nicely designed cabin full of amenities was well beyond our expectations. There is fishing close to the cabin, major sightseeing spots within easy driving distance, and fabulous scenery. It is where you can leave the concerns of business, home and family behind in this tranquil setting. The hostess could not be more accommodating and enjoyable. We were ready to sign the buyers paperwork, but alas reality returned."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"You will not be disappointed staying at Linda's. Quiet, clean, and for my wife and myself, privacy.
Ralph & Margaret"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Linda‚Äôs home is very clean and she is an amazing host‚Äî even gave us freshly picked vegetables from her own garden! Great clean space and beautiful surroundings. Would recommend to anyone.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was absolutely wonderful! If you're looking for a place to stay, then look no further. The place was amazing and Linda gave us tips on what to see, where to go and places to avoid on our travels. We chose this place because it was a decent middle ground to what we wanted to do. Lava Hot Springs is only an hour away which the hot soaks are wonderful. A few hours from Salt Lake City, an hour and a half away from The Grand Teton/Yellowstone. The place is off the beaten path which gave us freedom away from our electronics and a beautiful night sky. So if you're in the area and looking for a place, this is a must."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great little cottage with an amazing location! We really enjoyed our stay. Linda was great at communication
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was so clean, comfortable and well decorated. Linda is a wonderful hostess and thought of every detail. We look forward to our next stay!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda‚Äôs Airbnb was very nice, comfortable and a great value. She provided great hospitality and even shared some her homegrown veggies."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and myself spent a week at Linda's place and loved it. You have country solitude natural surrou ndings. Inside is quite amazing as well. Anything you might need for a comfortable stay. You will enjoy it.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Won‚Äôt find a nicer place or nicer host
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Linda's place is situated in a cosy corner, in a quiet, farm encircled environment next to a meandering river very close to nature.
Linda was there to greet us, even with her busy schedule on arrival evening.
The outside belies what's inside. The whole place is warmly, thoughtfully and affectionately done up as a home. The kitchen's complete and useful. The rooms are lush and beds super comfortable but most importantly, it's lived in. It is very thoughtfully decorated and designed.
The toilet is very lush, it has all and more of all the amenities that's needed. It's complete and more.
I will definitely return if I have a chance to use her place for my base to travel to Yellowstone National Park. It takes 3.5 hrs to reach the West Yellowstone entrance as well as to Jackson, a quaint, lively town with lots to see and do.
Stock up to cook or else you'll have to drive 30 - 40 minutes out to Blackfoot.
It's a great experience that I recommend anyone to try it. You'll love it, just like I did."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is idyllic with views of the mountains and wildlife! The hostess has thought of everything and more for convenience and comfort! I hope when I‚Äôm back in the area, I would be so lucky to be able to stay again!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time there! Its so cozy and has eveything you would need. The area is beautiful i would definetly visit again!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will stay there again when we return to Blackfoot.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property sits on a little piece of paradise - it's on an island too! It is quiet and private and beautiful. Linda is a most gracious host and had everything ready for us. The house is plenty big for two people but cozy at the same time. Full kitchen (with all necessary dishes, cooking utensils, dishwasher, cooktop/oven, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, etc., etc.). You are just 15 minutes or so from Blackfoot and I-15 for adventures beyond. I highly recommend this property - you will NOT be disappointed!"
2024-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Letitia‚Äôs place was close to the venue for our big market which was so nice. I enjoyed eating at some of the local faves like rupes and the homestead. We also stopped into the potato museum and the candy jar which we loved. Bring extra blankets and a heater we definitely froze. There were quite a few remnants of cereal, a bag of half eaten cheez it‚Äôs and a some dust bunnies. Overall not bad, and a great location for us."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is a wonderful space and so calming. Looked forward to going back every night to this Airbnb. I used this as a transduction between homes while I waited to close on my new house and Letitia made it a wonderful experience! She worked with me during what could‚Äôve been a tougher experience. Grateful for her kindness and wonderful amenities!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Letitia was such a kind host!! The place was perfect for what we needed and I would recommend it for a clean, lovely, and safe stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome value and super clean definitely will be back!
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice lady
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wonderful place and host!!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed at a handful of places in the area while traveling for work. This is the only one I‚Äôve booked more than once; it‚Äôs definitely my favorite. The place is very clean and the beds are super comfy. It‚Äôs a great place to unwind after a busy day.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value for the price.
2020-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Leticia was a great host! The space was clean and exactly as expected. The plumbing was a bit weird, with water coming back up from the drain while doing dishes and the toilet overflowing once by flushing too quickly after the first flush (so just be mindful of that). We had a space heater when we needed heat. Beds were comfortable and kitchen was fully stocked. She gave us fresh produce which was a lovely treat! We also got cute Idaho potatoe pins!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! All amenities were great, and even the little (Big) things like coffee were supplied to help start the day with our 5 and 1 year old. We spent most of the day at my parents' house, so when we came back to the house in the evening, the driveway was a little difficult to see, and may have gone past it a couple times lol :) but the house itself worked great for my family and I. Thank you, Julianne, for allowing my family to stay at your property and being quick to reply to any questions."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"was in town for a funeral. couldn't have asked for better accommodations. had an issue with the internet, but she was very responsive in explaining the outage from ISP and offered multiple options until it was repaired. Could not put TV in Guest Mode but didn't need it with all that we had going on. if I'm in Blackfoot again, I certainly would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great experience here! It was very clean and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy place in a nice location! Excellent communication. We have no complaints. Thank you so much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Rusty Farmhouse. It was in the 90s when we arrived to town but the house was nice and cool with the AC running. We loved how private and quiet the surroundings were. The house smelt nice and clean. The king size bed was comfortable and we slept great. The host was very responsive and accommodating. Check out instructions were simple and reasonable. We will definitely be back!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is great, and Erin is an awesome host! I highly recommend staying here.
The photos really don't do the place justice. (just FYI, all of the beds come with bedding, even though the photos don't show it, and there are plenty of blankets and pillows in the house.). There are three bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs. We had two adults in the master suite upstairs, a toddler in the second upstairs bedroom, and one adult in each of the two downstairs bedrooms, and we all had plenty of room.
The house is also fairly safe for toddlers. Standard door knob guards fit over all of the bedroom doors, and there's not a ton of decor or furniture that can be easily knocked over or broken.
The drive to Idaho Falls isn't terrible, and it was nice to be out in the country where it's quiet. There's a horse arena right next to the house, and we got to watch them ride horses and lasso cows.
I really don't have any complaints at all. We will definitely book again if we're ever in the area."

We loved that it was close to the wedding we were attending, but it‚Äôs also not far off of the beaten path, but far enough that we saw some amazing stars and sunsets. There are plenty of blankets and space for spreading out in this floor plan. And Erin is the sweetest! She was quick to respond when I couldn‚Äôt find the iron. We had zero complaints and a fabulous week!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It‚Äôs an amazing clean house, with good ambiance. Didn‚Äôt had any issue with check in. Erin was super prompt in answering to my questions. I will definitely stay if I am back to Idaho falls any time in future"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My only wish is that the backyard would have been freshly mowed as we had dogs and it would have made the poo clean up much easier. In Melissa's defense, I understand that the prior tenants before us stayed an extra day and left the place a complete mess. They were cleaning and getting it ready for us up until the time we pulled in the driveway. After speaking with the neighbors about the prior tenants I was pleased and surprised they got it ready for us in time. If we do the dog show again next year we will definitely stay here again. Melissa was a great host. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

She has a huge heart and that's the kind of people I love to rent from.....Now on to the house. The moment you walk in you know there is a lot of love in the home. It has a very warm feeling. Not only that it is stocked far beyond what one would expect. The best thing though was coming home after work knowing how comfortable the beds are.....You kinda melt and don't want to get back up lol....I would shout from the rooftops to recommend this gem and hopefully already have my reservation in lol.
Thank you,
Kyle Bowser"

we really appreciate you helping us out."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, perfect location"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,It was great place to stay for the price and the convenience of being right across from the potato museum and just around the corner from an escape room and restaurants. The floors in spots were squeaky and you could hear through the walls but that is to be expected in an older building and it was still a nice stay.

Only one washer/dryer and permanent tenants are assigned certain days.. so if you‚Äôre passing through on one of their assigned days you might be met with some resistance since there is only one/washer dryer. Apartment appear as listed, clean. Had a slight problem early in the stay and the owner got it corrected quickly."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed in the trailer and it was comfortable for our needs. We were only there for a few hours to catch some sleep during girls weekend. Dan and Adrian were very responsive to our questions and flexible with check in/out since we arrived so late and left so early. We never actually connected in person because of our timeline.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing and beautiful with friendly host. Would stay again
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a beautiful place to stay with children. Dan and Adrian showed us tremendous hospitality! Any question I had, whether related to the camper or local places to go, they helped. My family and I received free baskets of eggs from their hens and ducks; that was awesome! We had a hiccup the night we arrived (late), and it was addressed the very next morning. The rest of our time at this stay ran smoothly. You will discover they have a large land where you can relax in the sun while your kids run around chasing chickens, ducks, and dogs with a side action on the trampoline. My experience with Dan and Adrian, this Airbnb, and the area has made me heavily consider moving to Idaho - said a city girl born and raised. In the meantime, I will stay here again! Thank you, Dan and Adrian, for everything! God Bless you both and your family!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a lovely stay at Dan and Adrian‚Äôs homestead. We stayed in their camper and it literally had everything we needed even with being such a tiny space for a family of 4. The kids especially loved the accommodations and running around outside with the chickens and ducks. The fresh farm eggs were an excellent treat too! Thank you for letting us stay on your beautiful property. Highly recommended!

Dan and Adrian were very responsive and communicative in how to check in and out. Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dan and Adrian are amazing hosts - if they're not available they make sure someone else is there to help. Their property is beautiful and the camper is great - it's clean, comfortable and has everything you need. We had a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a long, stressful trip, this was the perfect place to wind down. Clean, cozy, and close to stores/restaurants.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Have a great stay at Dan and Adrian's place. Excellent hospitality in a very nice and unusual setting.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First, we would like to thank Dan and Adrian for being exceptional hosts. Their warm and genuine hospitality made our stay truly memorable. The farm stay was wonderful for our little one. The camper van itself was nothing short of amazing ‚Äì it was spotlessly clean and beautifully designed. The meticulous attention to detail, combined with the hosts' welcoming nature, created an unforgettable experience. From the well-equipped kitchenette to the cozy sleeping area, every aspect of the camper van was thoughtfully crafted to ensure a delightful stay. In retrospect, the only regret we have is not extending our visit, but that just adds to the cherished memories we carry with us. We will comeback soon to eat fresh farm egg!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our quick one night stay! The bed was a little hard, but I expected that in a camper. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Dan and Adrian's Airbnb, and I must say it was an absolutely wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and at home. Not only were they exceptional hosts, but they were also genuinely kind and friendly people. They took the time to get to know us and made us feel like we were staying with friends rather than strangers.
I cannot recommend Dan and Adrian's Airbnb enough. If you are looking for a place to stay where you will be treated like family, this is the perfect choice. Their warmth, hospitality, and attention to detail made our stay truly unforgettable. Thank you, Dan and Adrian, for being such incredible hosts and for creating a home away from home for us. We cannot wait to visit again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely LOVED staying with Dan and Adrian! They are such a wonderful couple and so great to work with! Adrian left us a hand written personal note...she could not come out to visit personally as their little guy had decided to try gasoline earlier in the day and she needed to be with him...thankfully everything was ok!
Dan took us on a tour of all of their wonderful projects...He has done so much! The yard is magical at night!
The trailer was extremely clean and comfortable! It had all of the amenities that we needed and fresh eggs in the fridge! Lots of info on local things to do and places to eat etc.
We loved meeting the dogs and just enjoying the beautiful surroundings!
Dan took time to show us through their tiny house and shared with us some of their dreams for the future and the property is going to be even more wonderful!
We will absolutely be back the next time we need to take a trip north! Happy to pass their place along to friends and family!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Prescotts were the most wonderful host. Extremely friendly and genuinely the kindest family.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adrian's place was perfect for what I needed. She knew I was traveling with a mini horse and was very accommodating. The property is out of the city center (what I enjoy) but very close.
Their property is really fun for kids who enjoy being around animals. My daughter loved seeing the chickens, ducks, and dogs. If you're into the small farm lifestyle and just want things to be accessible without the city in your face, this is the place for you! It felt like I was walking into a kids' dream. I wish my plans allowed us to really spend more time there to use the fireplace and walk around."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dan and Adrian was a great host! Responded very quickly, and was very accommodating to our needs/requests.
Upon arrival thry provided us water and the A/C were turned on.
Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful. 
The camper was very clean and well equipped and cozy and a country ambiance. (simple with elegance feeling).
The backyard is amazing with lights on they have fire pit bit we never had a chance to do it coz we have been busy. They have friendly dogs and chicken and duck and horse.
We could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place, we would stay here again easily!
I will recommend 100%"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dan and Adrian are so sweet! They are responsive and helpful. Their place is so clean, nice and PEACEFUL. Thank you for letting us stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great people. Great communication. Great camper.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We often come into town for work and our technicians have stayed at Trent's place several times. Every time has been great! This last time we had to reschedule due to illness and Trent was very flexible! We appreciate his communication and clean home. When we are called back to the area, we will stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the home. It was large and spacious. The bunks were super fun for the kids. The parking in the front was a huge plus. Although, I thought the garage was accessible but it was not. Overall, it was a great place and would probably rent it again in the future."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place! We had two families there and everyone was comfortable. the kids loved the basement and the adults enjoyed the upstairs. The kitchen was great and we prepared all of our meals there for two days.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was as if the owners handed us the keys to their own immaculate 6 bedroom home and said stay here for a couple of days. This is a real home with fantastic art on the walls, all the amenities you would desire, nice quality beds, and furniture, etc. - as opposed to a property someone simply bought and outfitted on the cheap to rent out on Airbnb. It was truly a relaxing oasis for our party of eight ‚Äì so much so that our 11-year-old said he did not want to leave (he had the living room bunk-bed haven to himself and played ping-pong with various family members for hours).
Trent went out of his way to make our stay perfect and responded to any questions we had both before our stay and during within a few minutes. I highly recommend staying at any of his places because he truly gets what hospitality is all about.
Thank you Trent for being an amazing human being and creating a fabulous and fantastic oasis in Blackfoot where we made memories we will fondly cherish throughout our lives."

Plenty of bathrooms and mirrors for everyone to get ready. Large kitchen and so much space for everyone to either join in the fun, or take a break for a nap or enjoy a good book.
We highly recommend getting fun, custom sodas at ‚ÄúPick Me Up‚Äù in Blackfoot, ordering some pizza and enjoying a family game night! We had so many laughs just hanging out at the house playing games together. The kids were entertained for hours building ‚Äúforts‚Äù at the bunk beds, Mom finally learned how to play poker at the legit poker table, and we enjoyed a little nostalgia beating the younger kids at the classic arcade games. There is a fire pit and a grill‚Äîeverything you need to build precious family memories!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here for a week was pretty good overall. There‚Äôs a few things to keep in mind when booking (listed below), but I was very impressed at how proactive and responsive she was to answer questions and see to the issues that came up.
Pros:
-clean
-spacious
-felt like new/well cared for
-comfortable beds and bedding
-AC worked wonderfully
-had all the listed amenities
Cons:
-had a residual cigarette smoke smell, which she promptly worked to address by buying us some air fresheners.
-internet was slow, about 3-5Mb download speed when we did a speed test. If we turned Wi-Fi off on other devices, we could watch a show no problem though.
-internet kept shutting off, which she said could happen if the modem (sitting on the ground) gets bumped. I think my kids being a bit rambunctious in the living room made it rattle, causing it to shut off. Just something to be aware of if you have rambunctious kids like me, haha.
Overall, it was a nice, comfortable place to stay."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the minute we opened the door, we felt the warmth and care the host put into this house. We had a large family group of 16 and from the extra large dining table to the furniture layout, to the wall decor, the house was made for family. We hung out in the dining room and around the large kitchen island playing games. Everything was spotless. There were plenty of linens provided for everyone even though we were a large group. Communication by the host was terrific. All of our family agreed this was the best Airbnb/Vrbo we had stayed at. My only regret is that we may not need something this large again since family gathered for our granddaughters graduation from ISU. However, if this host ends up with additional smaller units in the future, I would certainly highly consider staying at one of his properties. This particular stay couldn't have been more perfect for our needs of this trip."

We had a great time relaxing - and driving into Idaho Falls for groceries was quick and easy. Would recommend!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Shelley Tiny House was a fantastic and neatly modern location to spend a week over the holiday. The house was clean and welcoming with a small snack basket, plenty of pillows and blankets, and a sparse but functional kitchen with about every utensil you might need. We enjoyed cooking and baking and playing board games in the small downstairs area. The only real downside was the firmness of the beds but it was not so much so as to disrupt our entire stay. Everything was well stocked and check in and out was easy. Our host also shoveled the walks when it snowed and we were out for the evening. We enjoyed the views and the quietness of the location."
