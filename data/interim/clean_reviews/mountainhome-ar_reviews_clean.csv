2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect and exactly as described! Clean, close to everything we could possibly need, and so comfy! Karla is so incredibly sweet and responds super quick to messages, like quicker than would ever be expected of another human. She made sure there was a pack-n-play and high chair for our 1yr old to use. Then a tornado rolled through town at 3am our first night and even though she has a family of her own to think about and keep safe she responded immediately and told us where to seek shelter. Then, in the aftermath, when power was spotty and things weren't working she was offering to help us in any way possible (fans, blankets for fridge and freezer insulation, etc). Our place had no damage (thank goodness) but her area did and she was STILL there for us. I can't recommend this host and their places enough. I imagine they all look just like the pictures and include all the comforts of home plus they are willing to bend over backward to get you what you need if it doesn't."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely adorable!! Very clean and they have everything you might need!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous apartment! So much space for my family of 4. Lots of room for privacy and having 2 bathrooms was heaven. Short walking distance to a wonderful brewery and restaurant, as well as coffee shops, a bakery and an awesome book store. Thank you so much for all you help so we could watch the NCAA women’s final basketball game too!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. It was close to a coffee shop and other fun boutiques that were all in walking distance. I will definitely stay again the next time I am in mountain home!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karla had a custom sign in the home that said “welcome to the attic, Joshua!”, it’s clear the host took the time to clean and have the place ready. She is highly responsive and the home is unique and cozy. Will book again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic. Lots to do in this town and the surrounding areas.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Attic is utterly convenient for the Entertainment District of downtown Mountain Home. This space is pristine and super cute. It fit my husband and two girls perfectly. The proximity to Bull Shoals, Norfork and the White River makes for a perfect location. Karla is an excellent, responsive host!
Looking forward to a return visit!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our choosing The Attic was the best choice we could have made! The convenience to shopping, restaurants, coffee shops, the amazing bakery were all within 2 city blocks of The Attic!
The Attic’s floor plan is cozy and comfy for 6 people. Our criteria for gauging an AirBnB is how clean the rental is, the attention to detail by the host/hostess, and lastly, how comfortable the beds are! Karla and Josh are at the top of the game for AirBnB places to stay! We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, super cute and accommodating. I would stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, beautiful rental walkable to the charming downtown area of Mountain Home."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The Attic was exactly as pictured and described. It was perfect for our holiday getaway with 4 adults and 1 teenager. The decor was very tasteful and it felt like home. We cooked breakfast each morning which was perfect before we headed out for a day on the lake. Karla was very easy to contact and always responded immediately. We loved staying in the downtown area and trying the new restaurants on the square. We loved seeing the revitalization of an area we have been going to for over 20+ years. We will definitely be back for another stay at The Attic!!

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Karla was such a helpful and accommodating host! The place was picture perfect and plenty of space for us! We loved being able to walk to dinner and the marina was just 10 minutes away! Overall we had a wonderful visit and would stay again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat property. Excellent decor and feel. The host thought of so many nice touches to be ready for us. Felt comfortable the moment we walked in. Everything worked as expected (wifi, tv [nice big one], appliances etc).
Do know that there are stairs (single flight) to get in and out. We knew and it wasn't a problem, but be aware if stairs are a challenge for you with suitcases etc.
Overall, very good and I'd not hesitate to stay in any of Karla's properties."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at this Airbnb! Arriving at night, we were greeted by a mesmerizing display of clear night skies, perfect for stargazing. Waking up to the breathtaking view of the river in the morning was simply magical. The location offers a wonderful blend of nature, tranquility, and privacy, making it an ideal retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
The nearby town with its local coffee options added to the charm of our stay, and we especially enjoyed exploring the Made in Mountain Home store. It's worth noting that an SUV is recommended for getting around, as some roads might be challenging for standard cars.
Communication with the host was seamless, and the property was clean and well-maintained. We truly appreciated the peace and remoteness of the surroundings, making our stay incredibly relaxing.
Overall, highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a serene getaway surrounded by nature's beauty."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great! Immaculately clean, well-equipped, and surprisingly quiet, considering it was within walking distance of a downtown-ish area. These are renovated old car wash bays, it looks like. But you can only tell that from a coin machine at the far end of the apartments. There are four side by side, so that's helpful to know. Walt was tremendously responsive and helpful - working to extend my stay by a day - when the AirBNB app glitched. Will definitely stay at one of Walt and Amy's places, again, if I'm in the area!"

We were within walking distance to the main square. Super clean and beautiful apartment. Walt responded almost immediately every time we can a question or concern. Will be staying with Walt and Amy again when we are back in town!

Walt and his wife are very friendly and available as needed. But nothing was needed … with coffee, popcorn , m&m’s and large smart TV life was too good to bother them."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as always! Amy and Walt have several cute places in town and I always enjoy staying with them. Quick to reply if you have any questions.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Walt & Amy were wonderful hosts & great communicators. Their long term tenant next door was a delight as well. :)
It’s so impressive how they converted a car wash into the most adorable living spaces. I walked in and was immediately “wow’d” by how clean & new it smelled and how spacious it felt with the high ceilings. I also noticed that they had the a/c turned down so it was nice and cool when we walked in. My Mom said “I could live here!” Lol!
I was also excited to see they had a box fan in the bedroom since I need one to sleep. Speaking of sleep… very comfy bed & the shower has great pressure. We really enjoyed our stay & would definitely come back again if we are ever back in Mountain Home. Thank you both for your hospitality. :)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third stay with Walt & Amy, and it was another clean, comfortable, and beautiful stay. Walt & Amy are kind and responsive people. You can tell they really care about their rentals and the people who are staying in them. Looking forward to our next visit - thank you for everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was very accommodating with all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet, comfortable beds for sleeping and comfortable couch and chair for relaxing by the TV. Very clean bathroom with all accommodations of shampoo, conditioner and body soap, adequate towels and washcloths. All the necessities in the kitchen were clean, electronics all working, snacks on the counter, candles available in living room for nice ambiance. Extra blanket in bedroom. Not a detail omitted. We will definitely try to stay here again as long as our daughter and son in law live here. Great deal for all they offer. Thank you for all your superb accommodations!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely enjoyed our stay. Who would have thought a car wash could be transformed into such a nice apartment complex. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful Space! Loved the concept of it being in an old car wash. I'd say outside curb appeal and parking was lacking but didn't hinder our stay! Hosts were great and easy to communicate with!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walt and Amy’s place was perfect for our stay in Mountain Home. This was our first experience renting an Airbnb. Checking in and locking up couldn’t have been any easier. Everything we needed was supplied and we felt perfectly at home. We will be staying here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect place to stay while my son was at a fishing tournament. Peaceful, good bed, great bathroom and kitchen. The shower took a bit to heat up but once it did it was as hot as you wanted it to be. Overall, incredibly comfortable and exactly as described."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Slightly hard to find - there is no actual building number. But the apartment was excellent, very clean, well equipped with new utensils, dishes etc without chips, cracks and tarnish. Very comfortable and well laid out with really comfortable bed. Location is great, pretty much the middle of town, about a minutes walk to the town square yet very quiet in the apartment. Super easy access with parking by the front door and the immediate area is well illuminated at night. Would rent again without hesitation."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment! Photos do not do it justice. Walt is quick to respond and check in instructions were very clear. I would definitely stay here again next time visiting Mt Home.

Would definitely recommend. Cute and cozy do not start to describe this place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodation- clean, comfortable and accurate. Fantastic laundry facility. Walt is a fantastic host. He stepped up in a big way to help us on a Saturday. I am grateful and will remember his kindness and generosity for some time."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! I would never have believed that this was the old car wash. It amazing! The furniture is comfy, and we haven’t slept so well in another bed, ever! The location is perfect - across from the park and a couple of blocks from the square. If/when we return, we’ll stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this apartment! it's gorgeous! The park is right across the street. There is a beautiful square a few blocks away. Everything was perfect! There was a loaf of banana nut bread waiting on the table. Comfy bed, huge couch, wide open with tall ceilings and beautiful retro appliances. All around spectacular experience. Amazing hosts! I'd move here if they'd let me! 😁"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was our favorite so far and we’ve been to quite a few. It was so cute, modern and functional. Location was convenient to anywhere you want to go.

You will not be disappointed I promise!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Walt's rental units in the old Chevy dealership before. They are charming and decorated in cool contemporary style. Comfortable and clean. Located right down the street from the courthouse square, which has cool bars and restaurants."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Wonderful area and comfortable bed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I picked this peaceful town in northern Arkansas to see the 2024 eclipse. It was a great choice. Our hosts were extremely helpful. A far better choice than any hotel. The theme related snacks were a thoughtful touch. My wife and I liked the this place a lot. My wife loved the coffee from the shop directly across the street.

Very close to anything you would need and within walking distance of a great downtown area - make sure to check out Cove Coffee and Rapps Barren Brewery all withing 2 min walking! All of the amenities were brand new/like new, super comfortable and very spacious. It was a bit tricky getting in to the unit the first time due to some issues with the door handle but the host was very responsive and once I figured out the trick to the handle it was painless getting in & out of the unit. I would love to stay here once more if I'm ever in the area again!"

I would live there permanently if I could."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walt’s place is ideal for anyone wanting to stay in Mtn Home. Really cool refurbished place that’s bright and open with very nice decorative touches. The space is very comfortable and you can’t beat the location. Coffee shop just next door and steps from Rapp’s and The Fork. Walt is a great communicator and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We highly recommend this spot for anyone wanting to visit Mtn Home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location! There's a coffee shop right across the street and a good brewery not more than 200yards away. Comfortable place, but note that the floor is a bit cold in the winter. That'll be a nice quality during the summer as it helps keep the place cool but you'll want to make sure to bring slippers or something of the sort during colder months."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location was great, just as advertised, super clean, the old Chevrolet building was remodeled and is amazing!!! Staying in the historic down town district was a huge bonus.

Prime location to town and short drive to lake/river for fishing. All around great spot."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! The place was clean and beautifully decorated! Hannah is very responsive and a few things that I noticed was that there was a binder on the table listing local things to do and restaurants to eat at and also in the bathroom there was shampoo, conditioner and body wash. I didn’t use them because I had brought my own like I always do but I found that to be very thoughtful and hospitable. There weren’t a lot of check out instructions with a list of things to do before you leave which I liked because leaving can be hectic. I loved the location right there on the square not far from town where everything is. We will definitely stay there again when we come back to Mountain Home. Thank you Hannah!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were Hannah's first guests it was a great place for us. We loved being steps from an excellent brewpub. Everything was just right.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our host Walt was so very helpful. He was on it any time I had a question he would respond right away. He was very accommodating and even went above and beyond to find us a crib to borrow during our stay. We felt very comfortable during our stay and the accommodations were very nice and very clean. It was stocked with kitchen appliances and bathroom supplies of shampoos and such. He even had assorted games at our disposal. We were within walking distance to the park which was a big plus for the 2 year old. We will definitely stay there again next year for our annual visit. Thanks again Walt!

We were there for a lake vacation and it was 10 minutes from the marina. It was very close to Cooper Park where we walked or ran every morning. It was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the living room had plenty of comfortable seating. It was quiet, we never heard any of the other guests. The kitchen was clean and had everything we needed. The bathrooms were also very clean and adequate towels, etc were provided as well. The hosts were extremely responsive to any questions we had and they were very friendly. We would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it as well. We loved our stay at Walt’s place!!"

I’m a clean freak and it was extremely clean and equipped with everything you could need!! I had friends come and meet me over the weekend and the layout is perfect for 4!
I would highly recommend Walt’s place if you are staying in Mountain Home!!"

2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was close to many things and walkable to a park and some restaurants. The downside was the walls are thin so the coughing lady next door was an annoyance. The upside was the size, the cleanliness, and the closeness to other things. It is done up nicely. I would stay here again. The only things I would add is a coat rack by the door and some better coffee mugs. Nice place. Comfortable beds. Good hot water and pressure."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for letting us stay at your AirBnB! The shower items were a nice touch seeing as we forgot shampoo and conditioner! Thank you for checking in with us as we left as well! :)

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cozy is an impeccable space. It was super clean, well-kept, and very well-appointed. Joe and Marci are awesome people who made me feel right at home. I loved their two extremely well-behaved dogs, Eli and Ivan! I wanted to take them with me! Overall, this was one of the best-appointed spaces I've encountered on Airbnb, and I feel that Joe and Marci would have accommodated nearly any request to make me comfortable. From the toilet paper rolls to the linens to Alexa and their recommendations for eating places, my trip to Mountain View was awesome staying at their Cozy guest space! I'll be coming back!! On a side note, the Wifi is fiber optic with 500+ Mbps download speeds. I actually got some work done, too. :) The restaurants they recommended were all extremely good, too!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very, very nice place and a great value. Very quiet and peaceful. Comfortable furniture and bed plus a kitchen and bath complete with all the amenities.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This may have been the best AirBNB our family has ever stayed in. The space was fantastic for family groups with multiple adults. Owners obviously have thought through how to make stays comfortable! Beds and linens were high quality. Kitchen was well-equipped. Unique features were interesting - especially the native stone shower! Location was great as well - close enough to be convenient but secluded enough to feel private.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin for two pairs of tournament fisherman on Norfork. Buzzard Roost boat ramp is eight minutes away and recommended. Mid lake access. Clean w all that one would need. Wish the upstairs had a shower like the downstairs but otherwise great 👍👍

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at Knotty pines was fantastic. The pictures and all descriptions are exactly as advertised in the listing. The property is private and peaceful yet still very close to restaurants and groceries. The hosts have thought of pretty much everything you could want or need. But if you do have questions, there is a guest book to answer most anything. Larry was very responsive as well. My only regret is not being able to spend MORE time at the cabin during our stay. We would 100% book again. In fact, I planned to book another week out but I was too slow and the reservation got away from me! You will love your stay here. Book it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pretty home right next to town I would highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Larry & Cassandra are wonderful hosts. Their home is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and within walking distance to restaurants, grocery store, and shopping.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome! Exactly as described and more! Larry was extremely helpful and provided excellent communication about the property. I won’t consider staying anywhere else when I’m in the area again!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The pictures do not do this place justice. It’s amazing! There were extra touches like phone chargers beside every bed!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,If you’re looking and wanting that old cabin feel this is definitely the place!! Loved it looking forward to next time! Will definitely book again when at the lake!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We were very impressed with Larry’s cabin! Very affordable price and very nice place. One of the cleanest places I have ever stayed, and very homey. Larry was very understanding and nice to let us stay in the bind that we were put in. He was quick to respond to any questions we had and made our stay very enjoyable. Highly recommend this beautiful cabin!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Larry: you have a great place to stay and we had a great time even though we didn’t catch many fish. Might try this fall.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed here twice and I will stay here again. My family loved it. I loved it. Oh this place surprises me, it’s got new things and everything is perfect, updated and clean. All the amenities you could Imagine and it is nestled so close to town , yet it feels like you’re in the middle of the woods."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best equipped place we have ever rented. Very very comfortable. Would recommend to anyone.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was clean and comfortable. We have seven people in our family and there was plenty of room for us to enjoy our time away. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need for cooking meals. They have lots of extras around the cabin to help you enjoy your time, things like board games, arcade games and yard games. It was really close to the stores and restaurants but was still very quiet. It had a beautiful view of the forest behind the cabin. And the front porch was a really nice place to sit in the mornings and drink your coffee while watching the sunrise. When we needed to speak with the hosts they are very responsive and quick to help. Everything in the cabin was labeled, this was very helpful! And there were instructions set up if you needed additional information for operating things in the cabin. Everyone in our family enjoyed our stay at the Knotty Pines Cabin, and we hope to stay there on our next trip down."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Larry was extremely responsive and helpful as a host. The location is beautiful and private. Great for a getaway without being far out of town.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the greatest Airbnb‘s. I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying at. This is my wife’s hometown, and she’s lived away for more than half her life. Coming back and finding a log cabin to stay at was a great surprise.
The amenities were everywhere, and the attention to detail was very surprising. From the decor, to the leaning, to the design in the whole place, it was off the charts. There was entertainment in every part of the house. Also, the most comfortable beds I’ve ever found in an Airbnb. We will stay here again very soon, and I recommend it to everyone who’s looking to stay even two hours distance within this place."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This wonderful cabin has so many thoughtful details, such as an assortment of spices! It is cozy, but has lots of room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and appreciated the quick response to questions! Thank you!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful cabin with all the amenities. The hosts are very helpful and keep you well informed on every part of your stay.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Larry was incredibly helpful and communicative. We had some special accommodations necessary for our stay and they were most considerate and responsive.

The house was super clean. The kitchen was well stocked. We felt right at home.
Amy is very attentive to messaging for questions and is a wonderful host.
I can’t say enough great things about this house. We would definitely, stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very comfortable in this 2bd 2bath. We traveled to be close to family in the hospital. Close to everything we needed. This is a great spot in the Historic district. We loved the furnishings. TV is bigger than photo so we loved that too. It was perfect. We will rent from Amy if we stay in Mountain Home again. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great! It is such a cute apartment, very homey, with lots of space. It was well decorated and was even decorated for the holidays, with a Christmas tree. The apartment was very clean, which is greatly appreciated!! I would definitely recommend as I would book again if I’m in the area again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a great time staying here. It felt like home. Loved the layout and bathrooms. I recommend staying here if you’re ever in Mountain Home! The inside is beautiful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite places we’ve stayed. Everything you need and more. They have thought of everything. Very clean and the pictures on the walls make you better understand the former use of building. It is absolutely PERFECT! I can’t recommend highly enough!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Walt & Amy’s place in downtown Mountain Home. It couldn’t have been more perfect - sparkling clean, comfy bed, high quality bedroom and bathroom linens, beautifully furnished, great location! The history of the unit makes it very unique; it’s not often that one gets to stay in what was a car dealership showroom many decades ago!
Walt and Amy were wonderful hosts and Mountain Home was a sweet little town. Highly recommend! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was ideal in every way. Perfectly located for our stay. Very spacious, well designed and sparkling clean.
Primary bedroom/bath very roomy. Bath is nicely designed, allowing the two of us more than enough space to get ready for the day. Shower was the best!
Comfortable living area. Kitchen is spacious, appliances are new, plenty of counter space, loved the sink!
We will certainly stay there again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in the two bedroom unit, and I think it was bigger than my first house. Any place with an elegant soaking tub gets five stars from me!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this place! We’ve stayed multiple times and are always pleased with the it. Amy & Walt are so easy to work with! Right off the town square with the best coffee shops, ice cream parlor, and brewery."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great. Place is worth it. Felt very comfortable. Love the downtown area. Amy and Walt are perfect hosts. I will stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s place worked out great for our needs. We always patronize Cove coffee and Rapp’s Barren while we’re in Mountain Home. Both are an easy walking distance. To us, it is obvious that Amy and Walt pay attention to detail. No complaints! They were very responsive. It’s always a pleasure to stay at a place like this.
Tim & Liz"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place was really great! A very unique place with great amenities and location. She was a great host and we would definitely stay here again!
All the instructions were clear but I would recommend checking in during the daytime as the door may be more difficult to find in the dark."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very walkable to restaurants & shops. Condo was clean & well stocked. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this Mountain Home getaway!!! Amy and Walt were excellent hosts who were very responsive, provided clear instructions and a very clean home. 10/10 would stay here again!!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at one of Amy and Walt’s properties. So comfy and cozy. Hard to leave. 10/10 would recommend.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ok so, if you appreciate history and nostalgic places then YESSSSSSS!!!
You have to stay here to truly appreciate what this couple is doing to enhance the usage of this building.....
We have family in Salem so staying here is very worth it."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Thanks for sharing your home. Was great location close to lots of things
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Probably the nicest Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Great location right off the square.
It looks better in person than in the pictures. Can't recommend highly enough.
We hope to stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unique stay was both nicely renovated and updated, while maintaining the original charms of this historic building. All the finishes were well designed and tasteful, and the furnishings were very comfortable. Having two full bathrooms with separate water closets was a very practical feature, and would make the space easy to share with friends/family. Although the entrance is tucked away in an unexpected location, being so walkable to nearby shops and restaurants is definitely part of its appeal! We would recommend this location to anyone."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Walt and Amy’s place because we love it! They are so accommodating and ready to help at any moment.
The fact that we can walk to Rapps Brewery, to get coffee, or grab ice cream is fantastic!
Amy always leaves a personal note and gift (ice cream coupon) to make us feel welcome upon arrival. We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very happy with this property. Will definitely come back. No complaints. Highly recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy’s place is awesome love it for a place to stay in the Mountain Home area and guests.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, this place has been done up so neat. From pictures, it looks so nice and in person even better. They've done such a great job on repurposing this old building. We were in town for our sons ball games, which were just a short drive away. This was the perfect place to come back to and relax, plenty of space. And a short walk to an ice cream shop. Beds were very comfy, had all the amenities needed. Hosts were very friendly to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific 2 bedroom. Master bathroom is shockingly nice. Very clean and very quiet and super close to a great brewery/restaurant. Way better than any hotel or resort. Would definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and unique place! Great accommodations and amenities! Location was wonderful. Very responsive host for this last minute getaway! Would highly recommend and stay here again!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to Mountain Home for a weekend tennis tournament, and staying at this airbnb was a highlight. The hosts were very responsive and friendly…they clearly wanted to make sure we were comfortable. They even extended our stay to help us accommodate an unpredictable tournament schedule.
The apartment was spacious, beautifully appointed while maintaining historic charm, and very clean. It was within walking distance of the town square with it’s shops and restaurants…a perfect location for us. It was a welcome retreat from the stressors of our very active weekend.
We would definitely like to stay at this airbnb again when we come back to Mountain Home to explore the many outdoor adventure possibilities.
Thank you for a lovely stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy and Walt were great hosts! We enjoyed the recommendations for restaurants and the local coffee shop. This place is truly unique and comfortable!! We had all that we needed and more!!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy and Walt’s place was exactly as portrayed. Great amenities and very modern and well thought out. Our hosts were responsive and very helpful. The location is in walking range of a couple of really cool spots. If we ever visit again, we would love to stay in this location again! Thank you both for everything."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was beautiful and a perfect place to stay for our weekend in Mountain Home. We were able to walk for a late dinner the night we arrived. The apartment was beautiful with just the right touch of original and brand new. Plenty of room for our family of four to eat and enjoy a hog game on the large tv.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home, and super nice host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I was here for a week due to a school event I had to attend. It was amazing! Cute and cozy and close to everything. The host was very accommodating and would get back with me quickly if I needed anything. It was stocked with plenty of linens and extra blankets. The only downside was the parking. I don't back up very well, so I made sure to back into my parking space in evenings after classes when there were no cars around, so I could easily pull right out in the morning when the other cars from the Law Firm were parked there. That pretty much solved the parking issue, and of course the shower and soaking tub in the master bedroom made you forget all about it! Definitely well worth it and I can't wait for my next trip back. <3"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! Was in area with colleague for work for two days. This place was cheaper than staying at Holiday Inn. Was bigger than I expected and as nice as pictures. 1 block to a coffee shop and great brewery. Ate there both nights.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Great location and very clean. We enjoyed our stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Responsive hosts and a convenient location! Property was clean and comfortable!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in Mountain Home, don’t pass up this apartment. Location was perfect in the downtown area, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Accommodations a perfect and beautiful."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific property. Furnished with everything a guest could need, super comfortable kitchen and living areas, fantastic master bathroom (second bath great too). If you're looking to be in the heart of Mountain Home this is it."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! Right in the heart of a small downtown area with wonderful shops and eateries!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely place! The location is tucked away and private but also so convenient to Cove Coffee and Rapps Barren. It's very clean and spacious. I highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would give this place a 5***** review!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is perfect! The place is so clean and pretty. The master bath is beautiful. The tub and shower are both amazing! If you need to do laundry bring laundry soap there are machines but no soap. Beds are very comfortable. We enjoyed walking around the square to shop. There is a coffee house just steps away. The parking is very tight if you drive more than a smaller car you may struggle using the spot in front of the apartment. We unfortunately had a truck and trailer and could not park in front for the apartment. The hosts were super helpful and communication was excellent. The treat left for us was a lovely surprise. We will stay here again if we are in the area. Thank you Amy for all your help.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great place to stay in Mountain Home. Perfect location, spacious and has all the conveniences of home. Our hosts were the most accommodating we have ever had ."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The work that went into remodeling this building really shows. The owners did a wonderful job making the place feel modern with the feeling of the history of Mountain Home. The master bedroom and bathroom were wonderful. Hands down one of the best showers we have used. Looking forward to our next stay here! If you are not from the south be prepared for the heat outside but the ac in the place works great!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home. Perfect location. Hope to stay again on our next visit.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is very nice, and does not disappoint! The master bedroom and bathroom are great. The exposed rock and stained concrete floors are beautiful! It is within walking distance of a couple restaurants, coffee shop, and a pharmacy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay here again just for the master bath
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don’t think again - just book it! You won’t be disappointed. Great communication with the host and a beautiful place - can’t ask for more. The location was perfect for walking around the square too. We hope to be back and wouldn’t think twice about booking this place again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Mountain Home! Well decorated, comfortable, roomy, clean and convenient! I highly recommend staying here!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely beautiful and we can’t wait to come back! So fresh and clean! And communication with the owner was very easy and quick!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is even better than the photos suggest. The location in the downtown historic district is fun and walkable - just blocks from Rapp’s brewing, Cove Coffee, the farmer’s market, and Louie & Roy boutique. There’s also a large grocery store and library within walking distance. We biked or walked everywhere. The apartment itself is beautiful - a thoughtful renovation of a former industrial building, with all the comforts and bells and whistles. I wish I could have brought the master bathroom home with me. Check out that bathtub!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. Loved the bathtub. Walt was super helpful and very responsive. Just a block away from a coffee shop, a burrito place, and a brewery — which are some of the best spots in Mountain Home."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for an unique place to stay! This is it! Walking distance to town square and only a few minutes to the White River, and Bull Shoals and Norfork Lake are close by. Very spacious and beautifully decorated. Great communication with Walt. Will definitely stay again when in that area."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous apartment with great amenities. We absolutely loved the shower and the tub!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It is adorable but the fire escape stairs carrying luggage can be rough and know there are 0 windows. None.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place and so close to downtown square. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t wait to come back and maybe even check out one of her other Airbnb’s. Just the weekend I needed to get away! Beautiful place.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had another great stay and will only book Karla’s properties when we are visiting the area. Such an adorable place and I can’t say enough good about her being so accommodating and responsive!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Would stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second property ive stayed with this owner and the communication is alway great..such a cute little place, only downfall...there arent any windows but overall great experience!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really great stay. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and minimal. I personally loved it.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Updated, clean and quiet. The Roku TVs were a plus. Great amenities too . We will be back!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place, bed was not the most comfortable and on the small size. The fridge made a weird noise throughout the stay but not anything you couldn’t get used to. The bedroom gets much warmer than the living room so be sure to turn the heat down at night or you will get really warm. Maybe bring a fan or owner could leave a fan in closet for use. But overall, it was a nice place to stay!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karla’s place is located close to town center. It was clean and had great amenities.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karla's Airbnb is the perfect place to stay. Updated, Clean, and conveniently located to everything. Karla is easy to get hold of and fast at responding. I will definitely be staying here again. It is perfect. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for the best place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place to stay. it was comfortable and very clean! Would definitely recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,She was very friendly and helpfull
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to go and relax after work. Felt very welcome and at home. Couldn’t ask for a better host constantly checking on us making sure our stay was a good one.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and responsive. I felt right at home as soon as I got there. It is a very cozy home with lots of privacy. I was traveling with an infant and was offered a pack n play which made my traveling much easier, since I didn’t have to bring it on an airplane. This was greatly appreciated. Would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Friendly and responsive. Booked on short notice. Older home that looked to be recently renovated. Clean and comfortable.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a small hiccup with the washer but Reagan responded right away, so no big deal. Stuff happens we understand. The place was great we felt right at home, had everything we could have needed. It was beautiful and very cozy!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views walking around the property. The beds were very comfortable. I liked staying here compared to the local hotels (I have stayed at several over the past 20 years). The space is roomy and Pam had the essentials needed to save guests time (toilet paper, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, she even had a snack basket with some water). I used Airbnb as a space to make dinners for my relatives who live in the area and had them over one evening. It has a full kitchen, bathroom, living room, and dining room table. Some of the furnishings are dated but everything was clean. It is stated as a barn/shed, with the outside area set up for storage or animals. The inside is not like being in a barn because it is all drywalled and set up as a home. There are two chairs outside to sit on and a fire pit. The home doors and entrance appear to be handicapped accessible."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing dtay for anyone but especially if you're towing a boat!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice setting. A little hard to find with the no trespassing sign in the main driveway.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful property!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were apparently among the last of the people who decided to book a stay in the path of totality for the eclipse of 2024 because when we started looking Pam’s place was the LAST option that wasn’t a campsite. We booked on faith that it was going to be okay and it was better than ok!
The home was very comfortable and well-appointed. They left a welcome basket with a few snacks/waters, and lists of recommendations of local restaurants and sites. The location is wooded & private but not a bad drive into town. Communication was fast and helpful and as we were checking out, Pam was headed from her home next door to come clean so we got to meet her and her husband who were both extremely nice and welcoming…..even inviting us to come back to watch the eclipse from their property!!
We would definitely plan to stay here again!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple. Cozy, & homey to stay at. Reasonably priced, very clean, no clutter."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large beautiful cabin, very private."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"The cabin is gorgeous and comparable to what you would find at a luxury rustic resort. It is beautifully furnished and provides all the necessities of home. The cabin is easy to access given the property is right on a four lane highway and that is the view from the front and sides. The back of the cabin is wooded, providing some great bird watching. While on a private road, it's not secluded and the road noise can be intrusive.
The master bedroom suite is amazing. The second bedroom with its own bath is upstairs and to get to it, one has to walk through the loft bedroom (no privacy for whomever is sleeping there). The master bedroom is the only bedroom with space to hang clothes. Hooks or something to hang towels from would be a good addition.
The kitchen and living areas are open and inviting. We had everything we needed to cook and enjoy our meals.
I would have given a five star rating if it weren't for the proximity to the highway."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin. Had coffee and cups for the go which really helped with our busy schedule. It was little things they had available and the place was awesome. Able to use several apps on TV without any issues. Our golfing group loved this place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place. We really liked the open great space. Bedroom layout was just a little deceiving but we made it work. We had our family Christmas there and everyone loved it.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This cabin is amazing. The pictures actually do not do it justice. It is much prettier in person.The beds were comfortable and the kitchen well equipped.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely beautiful. The only thing that caught us off guard was how close to the interstate it was. However, even with the proximity, there was no noise polution in the residence. So it was no bother at all! We had nearly everything we needed and all the instructuons were clear and very easy to follow. Absolutely worth the stay and the peaceful weekend it had broyght to our family. Thank you for the opportunity!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the cabin. A couple of suggestions. 1. More hooks to hang towels in the bathrooms since there is only one and 2. A sheet pan and wine glasses for the kitchen would have been great.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kelly was an awesome host, very responsive. She was flexible about things that came up for our party we were having and also got us trash bags when needed. The place was beautiful and perfect setting for my grandmothers 90th birthday.
There were a few small things like when we went to make up the sofa beds a few of the sheets and pillow cases were dirty and there were quite a few crumbs along the counter edge on the floors.
Overall a great stay and I would highly recommend to others."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great spot right off of the highway. Came here for a golf trip and it was the perfect size for our group and close to everything we needed. The host was great and the place was spotless!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it's a nice cabin could be cleaner but pretty typical lack of detail cleaning as usual, like cabinet doors and outsof refrigerator and other kitchen areas and of course along baseboards. overall pretty nice."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, we will stay again!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and just as described. We had a couple complications, but Kelly was very responsive in trying to get those addressed. She communicated extremely well. Would definitely stay here again if ever back in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly’s place was the perfect landing spot for our family as we gathered in town for a funeral. The large kitchen was well stocked and there’s a Walmart just up the road. The location near the highway was convenient - easy to get where we needed. The downstairs bedroom suite is huge! Appreciated Kelly’s responsiveness and clear directions for check in/check out. Thank you!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay. My 2nd time staying here and just as perfect at the first time. So relaxing sitting on the porch and watching the deer. Nice place to unwind after a hard day at work. Highly recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had to stay in Mountain Home for a week for a business trip. I can honestly say that this cabin is absolutely the nicest place to stay in the entire area. Everything about the cabin was perfect. The decorations, furniture, and fixtures are all very high end. The attention to detail is astonishing. The kitchen is extremely well-stocked, which I was happy about as I cooked the entire week. The one thing that concerned me prior to the trip was the proximity to the highway. This turned out not to be an issue. There is a bit of road noise during the day, but it was silent at night. And the property is fenced in, so there's no concern there. All in all, it was a perfect place to stay. Could not have been happier."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Thanks Kelly for everything
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Truly a lovely cabin with great hosts. Felt like our home away from home only WAY fancier. I can't share enough good things, from the high quality furniture to the amazing pillows and fabulous wrap around porch. This place was our oasis!! Thank you Kelly! We will be back!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is in a great location. Close to a marina and to Mtn Home for restaurants and shopping.
Check in was a breeze. Only thing that I would suggest is that the sofa bed in the middle room be an actual bed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a great experience while staying at the cabin. Kelly was very helpful throughout the whole process we appreciate her quick response to all our questions and concerns
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cabin was gorgeous. Highway right there was a bit of a surprise and that billboard 😭 😭. House offered everything we needed. I’m crazy and got my day mixed up so the poor house keepers showed up and we were ready 😭 but they were so sweet. Very relaxing and the locked gate was nice. Definitely worth the price 😎
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,She was always available and responding fast when I would text her

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This gorgeous log home is a real treasure! The kitchen was so well equipped we were never tempted to find a restaurant! The porches surrounding the home gave lots of opportunity to enjoy the sunrises and sunsets. We’ll worth the cost!!!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Would recommend to anybody a Kelly was the best host what a beautiful cabin so far the best I have ever stayed in
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in Mountain Home. We had to, unfortunately, visit for a funeral and the cabin served as a cozy home to come back to in order to relax, unwind and decompress from the long hard days. Location is great to everything around the area: cute downtown district, hiking/lake and more. Cabin is super clean, stocked with everything you need. Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a relaxing 4 day stay in this cabin. The pictures definitely do not do this cabin justice. Very open and spacious perfect for a medium sized family trip.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to stay at the Bradley House. It did not disappoint. The beds were comfortable, the place was spotless, and the owners are friendly and responsive. The welcome gift was a nice touch and the shuffleboard was a hit! The owners went above and beyond to work with us on our arrival time as our plans changed. I believe this home is a perfect combination of modern and antique amenities. So much character!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful historic home just off the town square. Spacious and very clean! Comfortable beds and clean kitchen. We enjoyed playing shuffleboard and relaxing. Shawn is great and super responsive. No issues getting inside and everything was wonderful. Highly recommend! Thank you Shawn for being a great host! - The Janes Family
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Wow! What a perfect place to stay in MH!

The sweet home is walking distance to great restaurants and shopping. Shawn provides guest with a very a comfortable, clean, quiet and safe place to stay. The beds are super comfy. We will definitely be back through and stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd stay at this house. We like the size & space of the house. It’s clean & neat & close to a lot of places in Mountain Home.
A great value! We love the wood shuffleboard table!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was great. Thanks.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What an amazing home. Everyone should run their Airbnb like Shawn and Chrissy. Everything from floor to ceiling was spotless. The beds were comfortable, towels and linens were super clean and fluffy. The washer and dryer was a real nice bonus. Shawn even brought us another Keurig when the one we had needed cleaning (thanks again 😊). Next time we are in Mountain Home, we will definitely stay here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! I definitely recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Shawn's place was great to stay as a couple--lots to do and the little details like leaving us a bottle of wine were so thoughtful. But it would also accomodate our friends and the shuffleboard table and the location were so great that we are planning a return trip with more people because it would be a great place to spend time together.

The location was perfect and within walking distance to drinks and food!!
We plan to spend more time in Mountain Home and the Bradley House!!
Thank you for sharing such a unique rental!
Ed and Lisa"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time renting this home and it deserves a 5 star rating. Shawn and Chrissy take the time to go the extra mile with details in their place to make you feel right at home. The place is clean and spacious. It's in the middle of town, right near everything. When you walk in the doors, you are made to feel welcome. They decorated for Christmas, which was very nice and we loved playing shuffleboard while we were there. Can't wait to come back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely well kept. We had an amazing time with family. Didn't get a chance to get out in town because of the time of year. We had fun playing shuffleboard. We will definitely recommend it to others. Shawn, our host, was very responsive and was even willing to come by on Christmas if needed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,My family and I really enjoyed the shuffleboard. We appreciated the homey touches like the selection of teas and coffees at the coffee bar and the water cooler. It is walking distance to a little down town area and very close to everything in town. The beds were comfortable and we felt safe and secure at night.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t boast enough about our stay.
Everything we wanted or needed was available. I visited this home at different times over a period of 40 years and it has never been this beautiful. The location is perfect. We will definitely be staying here again."

We were a group that met here and everyone was comfortable and the house has a great little carport with chairs as well as chairs/fire pit in the backyard too. It’s surrounded by offices so it was very quiet and private as well as being on the same block as their cute downtown & wed/sat farmers market
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! so many little extras that the hosts include that make you feel right at home. beds were comfortable and most importantly it was very clean. we will definitely go back.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Walkable location close to downtown square close to brewery wine bar and coffee house. Great time with lots to do.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an excellent place to stay in Mountain Home. The location is perfectly situated near downtown. The home has a near perfect melding of old and modern elements. There’s so much character. The beautiful hardwood floors are “worth the price admission” by themselves! The beds we’re comfortable and the bathroom well-appointed with everything we could possibly need. The owners even left us an anniversary gift! The shuffleboard was so fun to play. I was impressed with the record player and selection of vinyl. The owners truly care about providing an excellent experience. We won’t hesitate to stay anytime we come back to watch our son play baseball.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"YOU’VE GOT TO STAY AT THIS HOME!!!
This home has it all, The Bradley House is located literally a block away from downtown Mountain Home offering great restaurants, entertainment and quaint historic venues. The home is well stocked and equipped with everything a family could ask for. The home has à nostalgic feel to it offering original wood floors and elegantly decorated furnishings that replicate the era in which it was built. The home also offers a full size shuffle board tablé that provided us hours of “fierce family competition”.
The owners - Shawn and Chrissy who were born and raised in MH, gave us a local insight on various things to do in the area. They were awesome!!
Don’t miss out on this one fellow AirBNBers, you can thank me later. We have already planned a return stay, can’t wait!!
The Ingold Family"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shawn's place was great. very comfortable, fairly large, and in a good location. We especially liked the game room with a record player and ""classic"" LPs. We will return."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place and great host
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was top notch. It was extremely clean, very organized and well stocked with what you would need. I esp appreciate a large stack of clean towels and wash clothes.
The house was inviting and decorated so well for its age. I loved the nods to years ago."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the Bradley House, and won’t be our last. The location is hard to beat—right on the city square of quaint Mountain Home. We enjoyed the walk-ability of all the local restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques as well as its “home-base” location for day trips down into the natural forests & watering holes. (Gunnar Pools, the Norfork Hatchery—endless beautiful places to immerse yourself in nature!) We enjoyed family shuffle board games illuminated by the vintage neon beer signs and the coziness that is Shawn & Chrissy’s home. All of the staples for a family to feel right at home were present, as well as extra touches— like the Keurig coffee, purified drinking water, and an array of family game night essentials (board games, karaoke machine, bean bag lawn toss, shuffle board, etc). The backyard is large & lush, and the covered garage / driveway was great for keeping our adventure gear/cooler as kids produce a lot of wet clothes, towels & shoes. 11/10 will return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay in downtown Mountain Home! Clean and neat! Walkable to local restaurants. Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is what every host should strive for. Outstanding place to stay, but the details are what makes it. Extra toothpaste and toothbrushes in case you forgot yours. Unique beers in the fridge (we didn’t drink them but… y’all everything was considered). Wine as a welcome. Extra towels. More toilet paper if ya need it. Coffee cups and enough coffee for a group of 6 caffeine addicts.
Did I mention they have a professional shuffle board? Polished old wood, legit shuffle board in a room perfectly sized for it. I imagine it was built around the board. Unreal, so cool.
Can’t say enough. We’ll be back. This was by far the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at, and it’s in an outstanding location. In a five star rating system, it’s a six. ❤️❤️❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay and great hosts. Really enjoyed the location and lots to do within walking distance. Also great base camp for exploring outside activities as well.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was awesome. We were in town for a baseball tournament and we had 5 family's stay in this house. we have room for more people if we wanted. The players had a awesome time playing pool, ping pong, and went across the street to the park. Best airbnb we have rented in any state."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a group or several families. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and chill, or come together and have a good time. The living room was huge with a great sound system and plenty of seating with lots of games. The game room was great.....just as pictured....beds comfy...great bar area with games. Everything you could ever need in kitchen."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay and great communication from the host. This is the second time our group has stayed here. It’s an unusual property but works perfectly for large groups. We love the large space, game room, and bar area. The kitchen has everything that we’ve needed. Just a short walk to the square where we discovered a wonderful microbrewery with an original menu. We hope to be back again next year. Thank you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family absolutely loved our stay at Clay and Sarah’s Airbnb spot. It was the perfect place for our family of 11 to meet and celebrate the holidays.
The kids loved the kids area and the game room (the adults did too!)
We also loved the park that was nearby.
Everything we needed was at the home and the home was one of the cleanest airbnbs we have stayed at.
We would most definitely stay there again if we were to come back to Mountain Home!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay and enjoy having family over for get togethers
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,The family members all agreed that they would recommend to others and they would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,House was big and spacious with plenty to do in the house along with the surrounding area. The host was responsive and gave clear instructions on how to get in when we arrived and had instructions laid out on how to use certain equipment. Anytime we have a big group needing to stay in the area we will be booking the same place!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We were looking for a place for people to stay during the Fourth of July weekend and this place had enough room to accommodate everyone during our stay, we would definitely recommend this place to anyone with a large party looking for a place to stay!!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This place was 100% perfect for our annual Arkansas motorcycle trip. The host was phenomenal and very responsive. The parking lot is huge and accommodated motorcycle trailers. Everything in the description was accurate. Thanks!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very convenient and roomy!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was exactly what we needed for our guys trip. Plenty of beds, bathrooms, TV’s, and places to sit. This place has enough room for everyone to spread out and have their own space or all gather together to hang out. Can’t say enough good things about our hosts. Sarah texted the day before with all required information to check in as well as bent over backwards to have the cleaners there first thing the morning of our check-in so we could check in early. They even have scannable QR codes next to all remotes, thermostats, and sound systems that take you directly to a YouTube video detailing how to operate the particular device. Seems like they thought of everything, right down to extra batteries for the remotes. 10 out of 10 will be staying here again next year and hopefully for many years to come."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,So much to do! Multiple families visited and had a lot of fun.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"From start to finish, we had a wonderful weekend in this beautiful, downtown location. Check-in instructions were clear and easy to manage. Mountain Home had a Christmas parade the same time of our visit, and our hosts ensured several parking spots were blocked off special for us before our arrival. Ms Sarah's attentiveness was over and beyond. The home had plenty of room and bedrooms to accommodate large groups. The game room was a big hit for our teen-adults! Kitchen was extremely clean and had everything you could possibly need. We will most definitely be returning again."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Really awesome location and the sound system and media room is amazing. I highly recommend this place. The hosts are thoughtful and have put a lot of effort into this space.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect fit for us, I try to stay here each time I’m in town."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect and very comfortable. So roomy, I even got lost a couple times"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,This place is the perfect place to host a large group. It was extremely clean. Clay and Sarah did not skimp on anything when furnishing the house. We had everything we needed and more!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was the most delightful stay. The hosts have thought about everything. The kids said it was the best place we had ever stayed, I would have to agree. They talked about the house several times on the way home."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Clean and a lot of space for big groups.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Mountain Home at this venue. It was plenty big enough for our big family. (8 adults & 10 kiddos ages 18 to 1 1/2) The kitchen is well stocked, the kids corner was a big hit with the littles-also well stocked with toys, colors, coloring books, chalk/chalkboard, and the game room was big fun for all! We had a problem with the small refrigerator in the game room and within 2 hours we had a new one to replace the one that didn’t work. There is no outside space but there is a great park a short walk away. Unfortunately it was really hot & we didn’t explore the area as much as we thought we would but felt right at home in our “home away from home!)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were great!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Could not ask for a better property for a very large family. It is just as advertised and within walking distance of the downtown Square.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a group of 15 with plenty of room, great accommodations for our age group. We loved the kids corner, game room, sports lounge, surround sound in the living room was unreal. The kitchen is fully supplied, everything we needed and more. Thank you for a great stay!!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at this Airbnb for a wedding south of town and this worked perfect for our family. The game room and the bar were nice additions to the Airbnb and the hosts were amazing to work with. Highly would recommend this Airbnb for a large family!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing & unique property. Well decorated and extremely clean. We enjoyed the stocked kitchen and fun games room. Only 3 of us on a business trip in this big place but see how it could be fun for a group or family. Convenient location & easy check in/out process
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing place to stay for a large family. Plenty of comfortable beds, game rooms, full kitchen with anything you could need, laundry room, 5 bathrooms, and so much space! They put so much thought into making the stay comfortable including availability of cards, boardgames, and even a kids play room with plenty to keep our kids busy. Furniture is all comfortable and each bathroom was stocked with towels and toilet paper. Location is so convenient to anything you need including restaurants, grocery stores, and the lake. I will book this location everytime we come visit the area. Clay and Sarah reached out to me the day of our arrival with specific instructions and pictures of how we could get checked in and even information on what the weather was going to be like. Amazing hosts with an amazing place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for our large family to stay together. It is right downtown, which makes it central to everything. There was plenty of space, even with several kiddos running around. Our family had fun bonding while playing the games that were provided. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to town!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean with lots of room. Clay was a great host and was easy to communicate with. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs lots of room.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Excellent accommodations ... huge space but very comfortable. Perfect for our company crew working in the area! Hosts were super ... highly recommend for large groups!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this expansive repurposed office building. There is loads of space and everything is so well done. They have thought of everything. There is a great kitchen with everything you can think of, including a Kitchen Aid mixer. They have innovative QR codes though out the house with helpful video instructions on using everything including how to use the home theater. I had a group of teenage boys that came fishing with me. They loved the game room with pool table, ping pong and pinball machine - and the Dairy Queen only a few hundred feet away. As a matter of fact, this property is convenient to everything in Mountain Home, including the fishing in the area.
But back to the house…. There is a huge parking lot. The home’s expansive interior has many wonderful gathering spaces, including large comfy sofas and recliners in 3 different rooms. There is even a “sports bar” at one end of the house. The upstairs bedroom has a queen bed, bunk beds and a king bed that is an adjustable Tempur-Pedic.
This place is perfect for multiple families or a large group of friends. There is plenty of room to spread out!
The only thing that was a little different is the downstairs bathrooms are down the hall and not in the rooms - which makes sense since it was formerly an office. It is a clever use of the space and it worked out great for us!
Communication from the property owners was also terrific. …Very personable and thoughtful. I highly recommend this property."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved the house in mountain home; it was a great fit for a large family/friend group. There was tons of space and so much for the kids to do for entertainment. The game room and kids corner were so fun for the different children age groups and the bar/sitting area was a great space for the adults. One more full bathroom would have been great for our large group but other than that the stay was great 😊 great walking proximity to a growing downtown area and restaurants!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place had something for everyone in our group. The primary goal of this trip was to give our parents the opportunity to see and visit with all of the Grand and G-Grand kids ... We definitely spent time together with plenty of activities in the rental.. The movie room was perfect for the movie watchers.. the game room with pool and ping-pong table was really awesome. The bar was great for the grownups to hang out and talk.. We spent a lot of time cooking as well and the kitchen was stocked with all of the tools needed. The overall location was pretty great as well, we were across the street from Hickory Park for the walkers.. We happened to hit a great weekend, with the Grand Opening of a micro brewery for the beer drinkers, Flea market, Jeep club car show, and festival at Hickory Park all in the same day.. Nice coffee shop was in walking distance.. The golfers were able to sneak off for a quick 18 holes before everyone was stirring, we rented some boats and hit the lake for an all day excursion. We didn't even get to some of the things we had planned like Hiking and Trout Fishing... but I don't think anyone noticed.. This rental is optimally setup for just chilling and visiting.. I hope we can return and I think that downtown has some serious potential and it's just getting started.."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place to host a big group!!! I had a team of 8 traveling for work that stayed here and we had room to spare. There are so many thoughtful touches.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The owner Clay was awesome, he checked on us often, offered tourist advice and made sure that everything went smoothly.
The place itself was awesome and the pictures were accurate, there were a ton of amenities and thoughtful touches. It was a great place for our family to just hang out and not have to be up under each other the entire time. The game room was awesome, the bar was great and the kids corner was a nice touch. It even had arts and craft materials brand new and ready for my 5 and 6 year old to use.
I highly recommend this space!!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a great stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my third time staying here and I’m looking forward to my next trip! Absolutely fantastic all around. Couldn’t ask for a better host. Trust you’ll be staying in a wonderful, peaceful environment. Couldn’t say enough about this place. Thank you!"

The outdoor spaces are great.
It is located in a very quiet neighborhood.
Next time I get back to Mountain Home I would not hesitate to stay here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mountain Home doesn't have a lot going for it, but if you're in the area this place is a fantastic stay. Should it be available, you should absolutely take it."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place! Beds were so comfortable! We were in town for a pageant, didnt explore much but also didnt see much to do..
The house was great, the host was great! Would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second time staying at this lovely home and I look forward to my next trip! Excellent location, excellent host and excellent vibes all around. Couldn’t recommend this home enough. Stephen is absolutely one of the best hosts in the business. Thank you!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying here! Our 3rd visit!!! Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stat at Stephens home. The kitchen was equipped. It has 3 beds, but one of the rooms a bed is in has just a curtain that closes it off from the kitchen. The master also has a barn door verses a door that latches. Overall a pleasant stay"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a wonderful neighborhood! The house was beautiful and very clean. The backyard is also nice and we enjoyed watching and interacting with some of the golfers, and the grill is nice. Loved how spacious the home was. There is only one TV in the home and it's in the living room, no bedroom tvs. Neither bedroom door was lockable which wasn't a problem for me but maybe a family with a couple smaller kids may benefit from a lockable bedroom door. Definitely recommend this home you will not be disappointed!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent all around. It was a great stay. Highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Mountain Home. Thank you for everything!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and great location in Mountain Home!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This house was in a beautiful setting, close to amenities, and had a relaxing atmosphere. The host was very responsive. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This well-kept home is situated in a private neighborhood yet still close to town. It was quiet. I enjoyed sitting on the back porch drinking my coffee for multiple hours. I also walked the neighborhood everyday with no worries about safety. I very much enjoyed the kitchen; it was well stocked and had everything I needed as far as equipment to cook multiple meals. We would choose this house again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay I would recommend to anyone
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here twice so far, always nice."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this location! Perfect for our family when we come to Mt. Home to visit our family there!!!! Perfect house!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We walked into the house and were very pleased with everything we saw. The house looked like a model home. Everything was very clean. The glass shower doors had no water spots.
Two things that I would mention are: 1) the hot water ran out pretty fast in the shower. We just took faster showers, and the problem was solved. 2) the washer did not seem to spin dry very well. We had to run each load of clothes through the dryer twice.
In spite of these two small issues, I am glad to rate the house and the experience a 5 overall.
We will try to rent it again when we are in Mountain Home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful house and neighborhood to stay at. If you are looking for something quiet, close to the hospital, or lake adventures this house is perfectly located."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean and conveniently located in town near restaurants and shopping. Stephen always was proactive with his communications and made our trip hassle free. We had zero issues and were completely satisfied with our trip. The house was the perfect place to work and stay.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was nice, and clean! The only thing to note was that one of the bedrooms just a curtain separating it from the dining area/main living area of the house."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay. The house was impeccable clean, very comfortable and the location is fantastic. Being able to view the golfers on the fairway was very enjoyable.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"I can't say enough about this home...beautiful location on the golf course, lovely home with all the comforts of your own, and centrally located to every shopping, dining, and entertainment you would want. They are fast to return a message and easy to book! Thanks so much for the experience!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,clean and comfy highly recommended
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and would recommend it to anyone. The property is a beautiful, private river retreat located right on the White River between Mountain Home and Cotter. The host was communicative and friendly - they checked in prior to, during, and after our visit. The home itself was extremely clean and in good condition."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best places I’ve stayed in. It was quiet, peaceful and well equipped with everything we needed for our stay. The view was amazing. The owner was very responsive and available to us when we needed her. I will definitely return to this property."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful area. Home is extremely comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked with cookware and basic spices and condiments.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic! It exceeded our expectations!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I decided on this place for a family trout fishing vacation. It did not disappoint in any way. This place was absolutely fantastic!! It was exactly as described if not better. Everything was pristine, very well stocked and clearly labeled. This made it easy to feel right at home. The location was very private, peaceful, and beautiful. We enjoyed watching a bald eagle and lots of other birds & wildlife.
Even the fishing did not disappoint. All 3 of my children were able to catch both rainbow and cutthroat trout from the dock. I was able to wade fish when the river generation was low and had good success. There was fishing tackle in the garage if you didnt have your own equipment. Enough cant be said about this place.
Most importantly, Darcie was a great host! She was very communicative, proactive in reaching out to us, and even allowed us to check in a bit early as our son needed a breathing treatment. She was thankful & appreciative after check out. Darcie was AMAZING!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, wonderful fishing areas, perfect getaway to relax."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best place to stay on the White River! We have been visiting the river for years now but nothing compares to this place! Everything was perfect from the easy check-in to the amazing amenities to the cozy, comfy furnishings. Nothing goes unnoticed here! The place was absolutely beautiful, private, and easy to get to. Darcie is amazing to check in on you and answer any questions in a prompt manner! Everything you need is here. Thank you again for such a lovely New Years getaway ❤️🎆"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend visiting this home. It’s perfect for a few days or two weeks or more. Everything you need is there and there is fishing right out the back door or anywhere in the area. The hosts mate more than accommodating and so very friendly. I will go back.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place. The house is very nice and the setting is very very nice.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at the property. It’s a great place to relax and recharge! It’s also well stocked with everything you need for your stay. Shout out to Darcie! She was extremely helpful and always responsive! Highly recommended property!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peaceful secluded getaway! Perfect for families ! The back porch and fire pit were my favorite place to be to just relax. The kitchen was stocked with whatever utensil or pan you need and everything was labeled ! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location was perfect for my family. Beautiful and very clean accommodations. Was wonderful overlooking the river-fishing, relaxing on swing and enjoying s’mores at the fire pit at night. Darcie was great answering any questions, providing recommendations and checking to make sure our stay was going well."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We fell in love with this home, the location, and the river view! Darcie was incredibly kind, thoughtful, and welcoming. This place is the perfect spot to explore the White River and feel at home while visiting. We cannot recommend this place enough, and greatly appreciate the hospitality and amazing communication. We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We live far away from this place and drove, so my only real disappointment was that we didn't plan to stay longer to fully enjoy our time there and take full advantage of all they had to offer. They had great amenities to cook, entertain guests, and relax. Decor and furniture were nice. They even had options cover a few things that some visitors might have forgotten, though we were prepared so didn't need them. For us, the location was the right sized for our crew's needs; it had a great balance of scenery, isolation, quiet, and still relatively convenient to our planned activities; it exceeded our expectations. Our visit was for trout fishing with a broad age range of family members - it met those needs well. Some the older ones probably would have preferred everything on one level, but otherwise it was great. We definitely plan on returning to the area again with a different mix of people and for a longer stay. I sincerely hope this location is available when we do."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was amazing
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was wonderful and location was quiet and relaxing. This location was one of the best places I have stayed.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family could not have asked for a better vacation get away! The riverside hideaway has by far been the best Air BnB we have ever stayed. It’s very secluded, private, clean, and beautiful. It was the most fun we have had in a long time. Darcie is the best host around!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely house, great location"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The perfect place, well maintained and fully stocked. We enjoyed Father’s Day weekend. Relaxing and peaceful. Wonderful Host. Everything is labeled and organized! Very clean and soft nice sheets! Five stars and look forward to our next visit. Downside we caught no fish! Maybe next time!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,The Riverside Hideaway was perfect and exceeded expectations. Everything was labeled well. The house was stocked with everything we needed. The back patio views and surroundings are awesome. Thank you so much!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend getaway and will definitely be back!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay good people thank you
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible time relaxing and enjoying the sights and sounds of the river. Capping our nights off with a fire in the fire pit was the cherry on top. We were even able to reel in a few trout off of the dock, despite the water being up pretty high and moving faster than normal.
The porch provides a great view of the sunset in the evenings and the house is secluded away from any traffic. It was a great outdoors escape for us!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to stay for the weekend on the beautiful White River! We love to fish and it was a perfect setup just for that and so much more. They aren’t kidding about the fully stocked kitchen. The entire home is so cozy and we were sad to have to leave. It’s definitely private and a bit out of town but not inconvenient. Just the perfect distance to be if you want privacy and peacefulness. It was freezing cold when we were there so we’re anxious to come back to enjoy it in the summer with your own private dock in the backyard. Beautiful views. Exceptional host who went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfection. Book this now! You won’t regret it!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most relaxing & peaceful Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at! The host had this house stocked with everything we could possibly need during our stay…lots of small touches throughout. We would definitely stay at this super clean & cozy home again!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place, enjoyed our fishing trip on the White river and time with family and friends."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at this precious home. They had everything we needed and more! Such a relaxing time for our family!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As a family, we started traveling for Christmas and this was the perfect place for us!!! There is plenty of space upstairs and downstairs for everyone to hang out. The kitchen is well stocked and we were able to prepare meals without any difficulties. Darcie stayed in contact with us before we left and during out stay. We look forward to staying there again!!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to visit and we were just as happy as our first! Everything between the fire pit, fishing dock and wonderful back porch view exceeded our expectations! Wonderful time!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location speaks for itself, but they have gone the extra mile to make this place as comfortable as possible for the guests. Everything was perfectly organized, clean and the communication was the best you could ask for. We will be going back."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house with an awesome setting overlooking the White river. Hope to stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property located right at the white river. The property is equipped with everything one can wish for. Really enjoyed our stay here. We will be back soon.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. Great view of the river . Would highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really needed this week away to relax and do nothing. What a perfect home with beautiful views that provided everything we needed. (The kitchen is even better stocked than our own!) We only left the house twice in the week- for church and ice cream!
The communication with Darcie was better than any other airbnb I've used. The river view was amazing and so many outdoor seating options. The area was very quiet and secluded. The downstairs bedroom with the huge ensuite bathroom was perfect for my mom who uses a walker.
Campfires, S'mores, cornhole, games, cooking, making memories... a time my parents and I will always treasure. We would love to return next year. Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Unbelievable home wonderful so glad I found it
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect
Thanks so very much"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is a perfect relaxing getaway on the white river. The home is very well appointed, clean and cozy. The view from the patio is amazing. The setting is perfect. The fishing is good. What more are you looking for?"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in a lovely location. I could have stayed on the deck overlooking the river for the entire two day trip. Didn't get to stay long enough to use the fire pit, but it was calling my name! Everything was as good as advertised...clean, comfortable and beautiful. My only regret was having to leave!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best way to describe this place is simply awesome. My wife and I celebrated our Anniversary here. The house is situated right beside the White River with its own small pier to fish off of. Everything was perfect and staged for relaxation. The outside patio overlooks the river and was a great spot to sip a morning coffee and watch the fog float up off the cold water. No other houses are close so no worries about rowdy neighbors disturbing the peaceful atmosphere. We highly recommend this hideaway property and look forward to returning for future adventures.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, especially the outdoor area and fire pit. The location is great, and only 15-20 mins from all the activities we had planned. The host was quick to respond, thoughtful, and extremely helpful. We definitely plan to stay here again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Riverside Hide-A-Way was so enjoyable! The property is perfect for relaxing and fun as it is right on the White River which can be enjoyed from the large deck out back or from most windows in the house. We enjoyed the fire pit each night also. Inside the lovely house, the kitchen is fully equipped with updated appliances, the living area offers a lot of cozy seating and the beds were extremely comfortable. We also hiked and fished in the area to add to our memorable time here. The host has thought of every detail and is so responsive. We lacked for nothing during our stay and did not want to leave. I highly recommend!"

Three beautiful bedrooms with plenty of space and very clean. Fishing, games, fire pit, horseshoe setup, laundry room with washer and dryer. Full kitchen with refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, range, coffee maker, all the supplies for baking, cooking or grilling. There’s a grill on deck, perfect for a cookout, complete with tables and comfortable cushioned chairs and cushioned couch. Also, there’s a gliding swing hanging from a beautiful ivy covered tree that’s very relaxing. There’s a little fishing pier on the edge of the river for fishing. Also, there’s televisions in all the bedrooms and the main room. Also, there’s a picnic bench by the fire pit for a nice place to relax. The bathrooms are very clean, the downstairs bathroom is a glass shower stall and the upstairs bathroom is a very long bathtub and shower with nice hot water pressure. Definitely would recommend this to other travelers looking to enjoy nature and the beauty of outdoor fun."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a tranquil place to rest and recharge!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing, pictures don't do it justice at all!! Large enough for everyone to spread out, and cozy at the same time. And pretty much every amenity you can think of made it feel like home! The views were absolutely stunning, I highly recommend coffee on the dock first thing in the morning! Can't wait to go back! 12/10 would recommend this place!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
When we arrived the lights had been left on for us, soft music was playing, and the windows were open with a slight breeze blowing through the house. It was so very nice! Especially since we arrived after dark. The lights were very helpful!
The house is just as the listing says, plus more. No detail had gone unnoticed including bug spray and citronella candles for outside.
The view from the back deck is beautiful! My husband and son spent the week trout fishing and caught plenty, including several from the dock.
It was such a peaceful week and we hope to visit again!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Amazing stay!! Beautiful house and view. They have paid so much attention to details and have thought of everything! I loved that everything was labeled! We will definitely be back. Thank you!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful, secluded place to disconnect and relax. Although we didn't utilize all the amenities this place offers, it has everything you need. We will surely try to come back another time."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a getaway from daily life to unwind, to chill out, and to simply do nothing…. This Riverside Hide-A-Way was just what we needed. Darcie, our Host was very attentive to each and every question we had, the check-in process was perfect, the place was perfect in every way and we cannot wait to return! Very, very clean and this place exceeded our expectations…. We spent most of our time on the back porch overlooking the River! Very nice!!! Everything that you need and more!!! Thank you for sharing your home away from home with us! Cannot wait to plan our next visit here! If you are thinking about reserving this getaway…. Do not think about it!!! Do it!!! You will not be disappointed!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is an absolutely fantastic spot! It is in a nice secluded place directly on the river but also not very far away from anything you might need (restaurants, grocery stores or gas stations). The host was also very quick to respond to any questions. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to ""get away"" for a little while."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and location! Had such a fun time with the family and loved being so close to the white water river.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place to enjoy nature and unplug. Beautiful views of the White River. Very nice outdoor space to enjoy. We really enjoyed having bonfires every evening and do a little star gazing. We even say the International Space Station fly over one night.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is amazing, I could just rent the deck and put a tent there and be happy!!!!! Gorgeous view 24/7. The house itself is impeccably clean, tastefully decorated and totally equipped for anything you may want to do. A big plus, everything is labeled, even light switches, so you don’t need to look everywhere to find what you need. Great communication with host, we are already planning a trip back!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very comfortable property, great host."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darcie was amazing! She stayed in communication with us. The house was very clean and comfortable. We had a wonderful time. The place was better and far more than we expected.
The only complication was the price. When we booked the house on Airbnb on Apr 30, the listed price is $280 per night. However, when my reservation was confirmed, we were charged $362 per night. When we requested to add one extra night on to our stay, the price went up to $480.61 per night. I never met with this kind problems before, so did not paid attention when I made payment. Kind disappointed about it."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place just as described! Darcie was very helpful and accessible. Kitchen was very well stocked with everything we needed and everything in the house was labeled. Hope to get to stay again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don't think twice, just book it! Our family of 7 spent a wonderful few days here. Our host Darcie was amazing! She stayed in communication with us and made us feel like family. The house itself was so beautiful and every attention to detail was taken. From labels on all the lights and drawers to clean air filters and extra toiletries and condiments in the fridge. The house and location are so relaxing and homey. We even had a few wildlife visitors and caught some brown trout off the pier. Will definitely recommend to our friends and family visiting the area!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unwind and relax. Very clean and comfortable place to stay.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Darcie is the best host ever
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. We thoroughly enjoyed how close it was to norfork and cotter. It was an awesome spot for fishing. We will be back !
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and peaceful!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at this charming riverfront house. The host was very easy to communicate with and we had no issues with check-in. My daughter really enjoyed the kids closet in the bunk bedroom. This attention to detail made our stay feel personal and unique to us.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Grandkids loved it!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome place. We had a wonderful time. The place was better and far more than we expected. The house was very clean and comfortable. The area was very quiet and had a great setting on the river. The best rental we have ever stayed in. You won't be disappointed.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darcie will go the extra mile to make sure you're well taken care of. The peace & tranquility were just what we were looking for. Right on the river, close enough to hear the water, you won't be disappointed!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a long fishing weekend at the house (“Riverside Hideaway”). We could not have asked for a better location or accommodation. The house was great, directly on the White River (there is a dock but no direct water access to walk in), and it is less than 10 minutes from Rim Shoals boat launch and just as close to Buffalo City boat launch. There was room in the driveway for our truck and boat and additional room for more vehicles.
Pulling up to the cabin was such a treat. The property was even better than we had imagined (although the pictures almost do it justice). It is right on the White River with steps down to a dock where my husband and I caught both rainbow trout (many) and even a small mouth bass!
For a large family or group of fisherman, this is the perfect house. We didn’t even need the upstairs because there was so much room downstairs but there were an additional 2 bedrooms (with 5 beds - one room with 3 twin and second with 1 twin and 1 double) and another bathroom with bathtub available to use. There were plenty of towels/extra sheets/blankets/pillows available. And there were even thoughtful, kid friendly extras like a walk in closet which had been turned into a kid-friendly hideaway, complete with a “no boys (or no girls) allowed sign on the door”. Our nieces/nephews would have loved it!
The kitchen was one of the best stocked kitchens I’ve ever had in a rental. Every pan, baking sheet, knife, colander, measuring cups/bowls, small and large appliances we needed were available (and easy to find because every cabinet is labeled)! There was also a great selection of spices (all the basics but also cumin, basil, and others). Keurig was available and stocked with enough K-cups for the weekend plus. There was a breakfast nook, full dining table, and breakfast bar seating. There were also a sofa and chairs on the outdoor deck and a 4 person dining table in the breezeway between the house and 2-car garage (which was empty, useable, and stocked with extra fridge/freezer and a large washer/dryer). Lots of thoughtful extras all through the house.
There were smart Roku TVs available in every bedroom and the living room. The WiFi was great and we were able to stream live football games at night by logging into our own Hulu account. Very easy to set-up and use.
Last but not least - Darcie is the best host we’ve ever had! She was in communication with us our entire stay to make sure things were ok, very quick to respond to any questions, and even went out of her way to return something we left behind. Darcie went above and beyond and it showed the second we pulled up to the property. We will absolutely be renting the Riverside Hideaway for all of our future White River fishing trips (we’re already looking to book in the Spring) and recommend it to all of our family and friends. You won’t find a better property on the River with a better host! I promise!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,We had the best stay at riverside getaway with friends. The house was perfect for 3 couples with plenty of space. Very peaceful with beautiful views of the river!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolutely beautiful property. The pictures online were accurate. The house was wonderful and the White River is fantastic. Loved just sitting watching the water roll by. Lots of animals and nature to look at. The kitchen was fantastic and we felt so secure in this wonderful place. Will definitely return.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely beautiful location very private tucked away with no distractions.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, tranquil, relaxing. Cleanliness, thoughtfulness and personal touches were superb. The home was clean and very well stocked with everything that was needed. Beautiful home and setting. We will definitely return."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host is as amazing as the house!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You won’t find a better relaxing vacation spot than the Hide Away at Mountain Home! Darcie-the host-was AMAZING! So friendly and welcoming. She made everything a breeze! The house was gorgeous and in pristine condition! It was so warm and inviting. Beautiful lantanas on the lawn that were covered in butterflies from dusk til dawn. Watching the fog rise and fall on the water every morning and evening. A few of our favorites about the house were the reading nook, oversized back porch, all the woodland creatures (deer, raccoon families, beavers, and ground hogs) The tree swing & private fishing dock made for some great photo memories. The large lawn with picnic table is perfect for lawn games and snacks! Located about 20 mins from Big Spring swimming hole right next to the Cotter Trout Dock where you can book a guided trout trip. Also close to the Norfolk fish hatchery. A MUST for kids and even fun for adults! So much nature and fresh air to be found at the Hide Away in Mountain Home! We will be back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Remote location
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed two nights and could not recommend a better location for both fishing the White River and kayaking the Buffalo River. Sitting on the back porch and in the swing was delightful.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for the opportunity to have a relaxing weekend with my family at your place.. the area was perfect! It was open for the kids to play, right on the water for my husband to fish. The house was amazing.. I loved the kitchen and the deck overlooking the water.. We will definitely be coming back. Thanks again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,An amazing experience for those who seek to have some peace and relaxation. So many thoughtful touches from our host and local tips. The weather was great and we had such a wonderful time as a family fishing right out of the backyard.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view and cabin. Bachelor Bluff is a good location, close to amenities. Responsive hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to stay for the eclipse and had an amazing time. The cabin is small but the layout is very usable. Our family of 5 had no troubles hanging out comfortably. It was so clean and open it just feels so nice to be in the space. The cabin had everything we needed. To top it off the outdoor area was nice. We cooked our food on the fire pit. We didnt even need chairs as the area has a picnic table and benches. We were blown away by the view, it is just so beautiful. We drove down to the spring/river below and the kids had a blast playing in the water/swimming hole and playground. It was just the perfect, easy going trip.
We definitely would stay again if we come back to the area, hopefully to actually fish next time."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Bachelor Bluff for a fishing trip. It was perfect for my three night stay, centrally located to shopping, close enough to restaurants, and close to major fishing destinations. Clean cabin with lots of nice touches and extras inside."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! We were only there one night, and wished we could have stayed for a week. Such a beautiful view, great amenities. A perfect place to unwind. Kitchen was perfectly supplied -- only a portable 2-burner stove, but that's all we needed. Hope we have a reason to come back here someday."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We love this place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The kitchen was well stocked, we appreciated that ground coffee was supplied. The bathroom was spacious, attractive, and clean. The double bunks were unusual but worked out fine. The fishing was great! We enjoyed exploring the area in the off season."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent cabin! Plenty of space around the cabin on the property with ample area for campfires and parking. Nice amenities inside - exactly what you need to watch a movie after a long day fishing or hiking.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, perfect place to stay before a fishing trip"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Bachelor Bluff was such a great stay! My friends and I drove from Maryland for the weekend.
The location has the perfect view during the day and night, especially since the bridge has gorgeous lights! My only comment that I think is note-worthy, the property is fairly open to neighbors and the main road so do not expect to be in the private! I would absolutely stay at this property again and recommend it for a very casual getaway."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great peaceful place. You can tell they take care of the area I love it here
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s a great place to stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Awesome hosts. Perfect layout for a weekend away. The view was spectacular and it was just what I needed to get away for a few days.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot with a view of the Cotter Bridge and the park below was still lit up with Christmas lights. Easy access to go see the bridge at night. Great nearby coffee shops and food. Loved the lighted fire pit area and available firewood! Wonderful value for an overnight stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My brother and I decided a nice getaway would be the perfect Christmas gift for our mom & king Carl helped us perfectly execute our stay. Phenomenal place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quick overnight getaway for some last minute Christmas shopping. We love the town of Cotter, the White river and the natural beauty that surrounds it. This property is a hidden gem. The pics of the surroundings and bluff view do not do it justice. Wish we could have stayed longer. Will definitely be back for some trout fishing in the spring. Much attention has been given to this property. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I love this place. We have stayed a couple of times and the value for money is always amazing. Winter hideaway with a great fishing community. Wish it had a fireplace but for insurance and maintenance, I would not have one either.
Great fire pits and bbq equipment. Plenty of seasoned wood.
We will return."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean and peaceful and hosts were very responsive; a great little resting spot. My only complaint is that there was a strong synthetic fragrance smell (like a strong febreeze or detergent) that made me slightly uncomfortable. I'm more sensitive to these things than most, but something to be aware of if those kind of things bother you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is very efficient and was perfect for our weekend. The only negative is the beds are ver squeaky and you feel the supports under the mattress. The location is lovely, awesome fire pit and ver well appointed. Would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful respite! The cabin is lovely and well-appointed and the directions were exact so I had no trouble finding it. Carl is extremely responsive and helpful!
After an afternoon in town walking around the pretty riverfront park I got back to the cabin after dark. The heat was on and it felt great! The Wi-Fi is excellent and I enjoyed streaming a show on the TV over dinner. This was a quick trip for me to run in a race but I would love to come back with my husband!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place! So peaceful and beautiful. Looked wayyyyy better in person than the pictures!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was very clean. Great location. Gorgeous scenery. Would definitely recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect get away--peaceful, easy to find, and had all the amenities I could possibly need. Carl was a great host--available but not intrusive. I'd recommend this place to anyone, and I hope to return soon."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it!! At night it’s pretty private. Where no one can see and it gets dark. I hear animals lurking around the property and kinda paranoid me only for a few min. Bring a infrared camera it could be a deer 🦌. Ate breakfast in the small town across the bridge it overlooks. Fly fishing is perfect in this area
Ate at the Gastons resort restaurant that sits on a river and it was cool looking inside. It’s not that far the next few towns over. The scenery on the way there and back to your cabin is breathtaking. Seen a deer cross the road on the way to cabin about 1/8 mile from it so drive carefully. Inside the cabin was modern and clean. Nothing you can find wrong with this place. View from the hammock was great and a place to park two RV s with hook ups."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, I came up for a fly fishing trip and it was the perfect place to stay"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was hoping for a few days of quiet relaxation and got just that! Great cozy place with easy access to natural areas. Definitely worth the price. Had some trouble finding the place the first time around. Just follow the host's instructions. Once arrived, saving the coordinates on g maps really helped. Won't get the same results with just the address. The place was clean upon arrival and everything smelled fresh! The host is very responsive and was there within minutes when needed. The place has all the amenities for a short or long stay. Would recommend to anyone!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bachelor Bluff was amazing. I would highly recommend to any couple looking to get away for a bit of fun, relaxation and spending time together. The cabin was cozy, clean and perfect. We will definitely be returning to Bachelor Bluff again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really loved our time at Carls Bachelor Bluff, amazing atmosphere.

You sit outside long enough you’ll hear a train whistle in the distance echoing through the valley below."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very private and comfortable place to stay. You can be on the river in 4 minutes and reach restaurants within 10 minutes. HIGHLY recommend this place!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view is stunning, and it's so peaceful. Lovely place to watch the sun rise and set over the White River. The hosts are so thoughtful with great little touches like extra chairs for outside, card games, teas, and plenty of firewood for the fire pit. Can't wait to see this place in different seasons"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful host--perfect spot if you are going to fish the White River--or do anything else in No. Central ARkansas
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My two sons and I had the best time here! I loved that they got to explore nature and how beautiful everything was. We loved the cabin, the property and the swmiming hole close by! We have already been talking about our next time to Arkansas and how we would love to stay here again! Thanks for everything!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall the cabin was great! It was cozy, clean and had pretty much everything we could possibly need for a night away. My husband and I each are slightly claustrophobic so neither one of us wanted to sleep on the inside of the bunk bed next to the wall, but we wanted to sleep next to each other and not as if we were siblings sleeping on both bunks lol… so we opted for the futon. I was quite uncomfortable as the futon mattress seems old and lumpy. I’d think a nicer inner-spring or foam futon mattress wouldn’t cost too much to upgrade to. Also, the dish soap was not the greatest and that combined with trying to wash the dishes with rags caused us to have to use a ton of soap as it just didn’t want to lather up! A sponge and/or some better quality dish soap for quests to wash the dishes with would also be a fairly reasonable fix. The fire pit/outdoor seating area was really fantastic! The string lights made for a nice relaxing evening. Definitely 1 of the better Airbnbs we’ve stayed in!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Close proximity to Mountain Home and Bull Shoals. Beautiful view. Great host. Very responsive. Will stay here again….
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved the cabin was exactly as the pictures and sooooo clean !
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful great place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed staying here. Unfortunately it rained the whole time so I was unable to enjoy the hammock while relaxing with a great view or sitting around the bonfire pit at night. This is a very serene wooded location and the cabin was the perfect place to relax.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have to say, it was an absolutely fantastic experience! The cabin itself was cozy, comfortable and had everything I needed for a great stay. The highlight of the cabin was definitely the breathtaking view of the White River right outside my window. It was awesome watching the fog roll off the river as I enjoyed my morning coffee on the porch.
One thing that really stood out to me during my stay was the thoughtful touches included throughout the cabin. From extra blankets and pillows to a well-stocked kitchen, everything had been thought of to make my stay as comfortable as possible. I especially appreciated there being everything needed to BBQ right outside the cabin, including a grill and fire pit with a ready supply of kindling and logs.
Truly the best experience and value for money in all my years of Airbnb!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view, peaceful, quiet, and comfortable! We loved Bachelor Bluff, and we hope to come back!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful modern cabin with great shower and comfortable environment. View was spectacular and very peaceful. Lots of nature to explore nearby. Great host and we would strongly recommend this listing.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place. Very private and like home. I came here to fish and It was a very good location. White river. North fork river. Norfolk lake. Bull shoals. Buffalo river and crooked creek were all easy to get too. Great view and very comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The outside area was so nice, day and night. I personally loved hearing the trains go by and viewing the bridge lit up at night. I do recommend this place for a single person or a couple that is very comfortable with each other. Because the walls do not go up to the ceiling, and the ceiling is vaulted, the slightest noise made in one room is amplified and bounces off the ceiling throughout the entire cabin. This means all bathroom and kitchen noises are heard, loudly, in the bedroom/living room area. It was very hard to get comfortable at night with three people because of this. The other thing was that the sleeping options were all quite uncomfortable and made for a rough night's sleep. The space otherwise has everything you need and we loved getting food at the Cotter Market just minutes away. We also visited the ghost town of Rush and enjoyed traveling the back roads."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin with amazing views! Very clean and neat.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,For the price you can’t beat it.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carl we had a great stay at your place!! I wanted to leave you a note but we truly did not have a pen. We’re old forgetful fishermen! It turns out we had about 3 hours of great fishing weather and then the faucet turned on. I was one drowned rat when we quit. Caught several rainbow trout & a couple Browns which we were looking for. Now that I’m home & dry and sitting by the wood stove, in retrospect it was a great day!!
The setting for you cabin is perfect!! I’d like to bring my wife back for a getaway retreat!!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Hosts were super! The cabin is centrally located to the White and Norfolk Rivers. We’ll be back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Really enjoyed my stay at Carl's cabin during Thanksgiving week 2022. This was exactly what I was looking for and expected, based on the pictures and description provided. The location is on top of the bluff with a view through the trees of the White River, the valley and the town of Cotter below . The property provides plenty of privacy and a nice area with a fire pit in front of the cabin. Plenty of trees all around add to the cabin feel. The cabin itself is functional and clean. No complaints. Good location from which to explore the surrounding lakes, the White River and Mountain Home. Looking forward to staying there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was very clean and well stocked with cleaning supplies that was convenient
wish there would’ve been a little coffee creamer to get me through the first day.
There was a point when they turn the lights off on me but after communicating with them they agreed to leave the porch light on as we were hunting late into the night.
The beds were comfortable I tried all of them!
The tv was hooked up with everything I could want to watch and the Board game’s were a nice touch. I’d rent again. Thanks"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to getaway! Fire area was a highlight and we appreciated the firewood and tinder available. The only reason I could not give this BnB a 5 was due to misleading views in pictures. Listing gave the impression the property would have unobstructed views of the river bend. Other than that, the place was clean and tidy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was a great place to stay. 2 of our kids were at the beach with friends. So we took our youngest daughter for a fishing trip and a 2 night stay in this place. It was very convenient, nice setting, and Carl was very responsive to any needs we had."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cabin, no breakfast."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just an awesome little property!!!! Everything with Carl was incredibly easy. questions were answered, instructions were easy and on time. i wanted to get to town so I could get an early start on floating the buffalo river and this was the perfect place. not only was the was best priced property in the area, it met every need and beat every expectation. the outdoor space with the lights and firepit looking down on the town of cotter was the perfect spot to start my getaway.
the cabin was spotlessly cleaned, and everything I needed was in the cabin. it's going make my next trip super easy because I'll definitely be going back here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t say enough good things about Carl, the host and his adorable Airbnb. I messaged fairly late after booking hours and got an answer almost immediately and was able to book and stay that evening. The cabin has just about everything you’ll need for your stay and the outdoor area is a nice touch for cool evenings and a perfect spot for coffee in the morning by the fire. Plenty of fire wood as well and the beds were very comfortable."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our fishing trip! Super clean and all around great hosts. We will be back here!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a find. It was very clean and new. The view from the porch and outside fire pit area was great. As a bonus we saw a doe and twin yearlings the morning we were checking out. The location is private and is very near the Cotter Bridge Market where I had a great mocha.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a clean, cute and lovely hideaway with an amazing view. Perfect location with everything you need on the property. Even though it was a warm night we enjoyed the fire pit. Peaceful town with a neat park, river views and swimming hole. Drove to Yellville and ate at Carolyn’s Razorback Ribs which was delish! We stayed on a holiday Monday and very few places were open. Make sure you bring food and drinks because once you get out there you won’t want to head back into town. ❤️"
