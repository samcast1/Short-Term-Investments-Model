2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was exactly what we needed for our stay in Lincoln. It was very accessible to everything in south Lincoln. The apt is really cozy, very clean, and super comfortable. The little shopping area it's in is great. Steps away from an ice cream shop, a coffee shop, a chocolate shop, three tap rooms, and several restaurants--all very good. Parking was also super easy. Five stars all around!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was fun and a perfect size for the two of us to land during our whirlwind weekend. The Creamery below is an incredibly popular place but the activity was not at all disruptive to our experience, which we wondered about. The bed was comfortable and the linens nice. The ceiling fans were a welcome addition for air movement during our warm stay. Filtered water in the fridge door saved us from having to buy bottled so environmental kudos! The decor was updated and calming. The location got us quickly to all major streets so moving around town was very convenient. We had a really nice stay and would stay again instead of using a hotel!"

Even though this loft is in the south part of town, it was a short easy drive to/from the concert, and it was so nice to have a clean, quiet place to come back to. Our only regret is not having time to try the ice cream shop! We will definitely stay here again."

There's a coffee shop and an ice cream shop right next door. We were only 10 minute from downtown, and the traffic was much lighter.
It's situated in a commercial district with some shops nearby. We didn't explore much of them because we were there for an event."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space, very convenient with wonderful restaurants in walking distance. Very clean with plenty of amenities. The only two things I didn’t love: in one of the photos it appeared there was a balcony which there is not in this particular unit, and then the other very minor thing for us was the space above the bedroom wall that opens directly into the kitchen, only because we were traveling with a toddler and like to keep the room dark when we’re up after she goes to bed… so that’s very personal to our situation and likely wouldn’t impact most people. Otherwise loved it and would stay again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect apartment for singles or couples. Bed was really comfortable and the place was perfect. Great location with tons of things to do within walking distance.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria’s ice cream loft is exactly as advertised. So cute, extremely clean and in a nice, quiet area mixed with commercial businesses and residential homes. Bonus points too for having extra travel toothbrushes and coffee supplies in the place! I only stayed for one night but it made me wish I could stay longer. And yes, the ice cream downstairs is amazing!
One thing I would mention and it has nothing to do with the loft itself: I noticed there were no Ubers to be found when I needed to get to the Haymarket for a work meeting. I had a rental car so it wasn’t an issue. Not sure if it was a fluke but just a heads up either way."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean apartment with great amenities and location! Maria was super responsive during our stay as well.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a really nice time! The place is very clean and has a nice calm modern atmosphere. All the buildings remind me of a cute ski resort which was fun! There were also lots of thoughtful amenities if you needed them and of course the ice cream is an added bonus! Thanks for the lovely stay!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is lovely! Very clean and comfortable, outfitted with all the things you need, even for a longer stay. My husband and I booked the space for a week-long stay to visit my family. We had all we needed in the kitchen to make meals, and enough space for my family to come hang out.
The location is also excellent - walking distance to several restaurants and bars, and there's a coffee shop right across the street.
Check-in and check out were smooth and easy, and Maria was very responsive (and very patient answering all my questions). This space is definitely going on our list of favorites!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was exactly the place we were looking for to break up our drive from Colorado to Iowa! It was a beautiful space, clean, and the communication was excellent. There’s a scooters across the street and we were able to get coffee and get back on the road the next morning quickly! Would definitely stay again if we need to split up our drive!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent stay at this location. The host was very fast with communication. The neighborhood was fantastic. Only two things we didn't care for.... the apartment was above a garage so could hear everytime the garage door opened and closed. There was also lots of echoing in the apartment which could be resolved with some simple sound proofing. Otherwise it was the ideal place to stay.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you have to be in south Lincoln, this is a cute one bedroom loft apartment. Know that there are STAIRS when you book here.
The kitchen has everything to prepare meals but there are plenty of options within walking distance.
It is pricy however, at least compared to the Residence Inn a block away (where we usually stay) but they were booked and our travel plans were not flexible."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful apartment. Better than the pictures! It has everything you could possibly need and located in a nice, but quiet shopping center. Would most definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is wonderful, it’s conveniently located to some good restaurants, breweries, there’s a coffee shop right across the street, and of course the ice cream shop. All of which were walking distance. There is also ample parking.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is seriously a hidden gem. FANTASTIC for families it had everything a family could need: bibs, kid dishes, sound machine, baby monitor, bath seat and toys, even baby shampoo. They had baby bottle brush, countless toys, stroller, wagon and even a booster seat. We were blown away by this amazing place. Great location in a safe neighborhood with grocery, coffee, and restaurants in under 6 min drive. 3 families stayed 7 adults and 5 kids under the age of 5. Something for everyone big and small. All of my questions were answered quickly and there were countless little touches that made our stay. Kitchen is fully stocked with all appliances you could need. Plenty of bedding and towels with 12 people we went through so many towels and never ran out. Lots of storage areas to tuck items away. The hall closet even had a shoe rack for all the kids shoes. We could have stayed for a month but sadly all we had time for was 1 unforgettable weekend. We will be staying again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was great. It was easy to get to and not on a busy street. The kitchen was well stocked with coffee supplies and cooking equipment. Amy was fast to respond and communicative with instructions and house information. We would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The New Nostalgia house was perfect for our weekend getaway for Easter to visit with relatives. The hot tub was great after a long car ride and to wind down the day. We took advantage of all the amenities including the large side and backyard with hammocks and plenty of seating. Also the downstairs kids room and TV area was great for our 9 year old, she was ready to move in. All in all it was a great experience there. Would highly recommend it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The New Nostalgia House is such a wonderfully thought out place.

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The new nostalgia house was a nice getaway. I feel that the host tried to think of everything you might need while you were there from infants needs to adults cooking hotdogs over the fire or playing cornhole in the backyard. The flow of the house is a little cumbersome at times, but very manageable with a little patience and effort. We had 8 adults there for three days, and overall had a really nice weekend and felt pleased with our decision to stay there."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,House is perfect for me and my crew. We will definitely be back soon.

As an Airbnb host myself I was literally taking notes on how to step up my game! She is not only friendly, but the house is worth the higher cost. If this house is open do not hesitate and book now before someone else does!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What can’t I say about this place! Amy and Todd were very accommodating and responsive from the moment I reached out to them. New Nostalgia place feels like home away from home. The detail they put into making their guests feel comfortable and cared for exceeds expectation. The home is charming and is filled with thoughtful and beautiful curated pieces throughout. Each member of the family is considered with amenities ranging from high chairs and toys and cribs for littles all the way up to those who enjoy a good workout, a serene patio experience, through comfortable beds for those of all ages. Amy responded to my questions throughout our stay immediately and went out of her way to leave a kind note and a thoughtful snack upon our arrival. I would love to stay at their place again. It was a privilege and amazing experience through and through. Thank you Amy and Todd for making our little family reunion so special!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome spot. We were in town for a friend’s wedding. Amy’s place was just big enough for a handful of couples to have their own space.

Hot tub: amazing. Clean, and we were able to adjust the temp to be perfect for us.
Hammocks: so delightful that one in our group thinks they should be counted as beds.
Fire pit: Tucked away for quiet conversations, with the perfect furniture.
Kitchen: Most well stocked with equipment and supplies that I've ever seen. She even thought of a vegetable peeler. Lovely dishes, beautiful set of pots and pans, high quality knives, delightful coffee bar, and a lamp!
Game/party room: Just so, so well done. Great games, perfect set up.
Kids' bedroom: such an outstanding selection of furniture, toys and books. One of my favorite rooms in the house!
Hosts: Amazing! No one does it better.
Bottom line? Book it. This is THE place to stay in Lincoln. Who wouldn't want to stay in a place Pinterest is jealous of?"

We arrived late at night, and Amy had some inside and outside lights on, which made us feel very safe and welcomed when we arrived! The house is very clean and comfortable! The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is very well stocked! We made use of the hammocks & hot tub! The downstairs area is so comfortable too! We had a family game night downstairs with the games provided! So much fun! I felt very safe in the neighborhood going for my walk in the mornings. We used the outside porch area a lot! We enjoyed our last dinner on the back patio with other family members grilling steaks on the grill (that is provided). AND, to put the cherry on top of everything, there is literally a BEAUTIFUL huge Cherry Tree in the backyard that Amy encouraged us to use, so with our steak dinner, we topped it off with cherries for dessert!! What stands out the most is Amy's thoughtfulness in all the details of the house and her kindness with so many things!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed in New Nostalgia home last weekend for a reunion with frineds...4 of us total. The home is spacious and comfortable for spending time there visiting inside in the 2 living rooms and in the backyard in the hot tub, hammocks or on the deck. There are plentiful amenities in the kitchen such as coffee and teas, ziploc bags for leftovers, and just about every gadget you'd need for meal preparation. Bedroom and bath linens were soft. Laundry facility had everything too including an iron and ironing board. The garage holds outdoor games, such as corn hole and an oversized Connect 4, as well as weights and yoga mats for working out. Instructions for the TV were easy to follow as well as contact-less entry and departure. Amy responded quickly to questions ahead of our arrival and left friendly, welcoming notes for us. Expectations for cleaning up for departure were reasonable too. I'd certainly stay here again at our next return to Lincoln!"

We enjoyed our meals outside on the deck and the kids had plenty of toys and games inside and out to keep them busy. Our older kiddos enjoyed their workout in the garage gym and the hot tub was perfect! You can tell how much the host truly desires to spoil their guests. We were so thankful for the prompt delivery of a coffee press, complete with local coffee, when we discovered we left ours at home. Just amazing!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Really nice house and had a great time!

Cannot recommend Amy and this space highly enough!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amy's place is amazing! It is a warm, inviting and beautifully furnished and decorated home that feels like a home away from home.

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolute wonderful stay! This house has such a warm and at home feeling. Our family enjoyed every moment of our stay and my girls LOVED the downstairs area to hang out, watch movies and play games. We enjoyed our time in the hot tub. The weather got too cold while being there to hang out in the awesome looking hammocks and to use the fire pit but rest assure next visit to Lincoln those things will be first on the list to do!
Amy is an absolute pleasure to work with and so accommodating to any need you may have. She has also made certain the home is clean, stocked with any item you can think of needing, and provided a sweet little surpise!
We can't think of a better place to stay or better person to deal with. Until next time New Nostalgia ❤️🖤
The Hagerty's"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy and Todd’s New Nostalgia House is the best Airbnb we have stayed at, and we have stayed at many here and overseas. Nothing is missing. Like coffee? Your options are pour-over, Keurig, expresso maker (Italian stove-top) or coffee pot. (Plenty of teas too!). Have children? The kids room downstairs is designed just for them. Babies or toddlers? Baby bath, toddler potty seat, step stool , kids plates, etc. Older kids? Games—board and Nintendo. Adults? 2 big screen tvs. And the hot tub is fantastic! It snowed so we didn’t check out the beautiful outdoor fire pit and other backyard capabilities. But they are all there. In other words , there is nothing we could have wanted that wasn’t there. The house was spotless, beds so comfortable and whole house beautifully decorated. If I could give this a 10, I would. And the next time we are in Lincoln visiting family we hope to stay here again. Great for families or small group of multiple friends. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was absolutely adorable! Such much attention to detail. The backyard space with the hot tub and lounge areas are such a great touch to the house. Honestly wish I could live in this house for myself, love it!:)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing love, absolutely amazing host. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Amy’s home for the Christmas holiday. We can’t say enough great things about this place. From the thoughtful extras (candy, popcorn, Christmas tree and decorations) to the amazingly comfortable beds and fully stocked kitchen Amy has thought of everything. It was the most “at home” we’ve felt while staying at an Airbnb. Amy was very responsive throughout our stay and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Although we didn’t get to enjoy the outside area (it was negative 15 when we arrived) it seemed like it would be a great place to relax when the weather is warmer. I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Lincoln-you will not be disappointed!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We came to Lincoln for a wedding reception. This house was a perfect location for our family. Easy access to anything you need. Owner is very responsive. Kitchen is supplied with anything you need. Beds were comfortable. Very clean. Hot tub was perfect for the cold weather we endured. Definitely would stay here again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay and I think my daughter said it best the day we left: “I don’t want to leave! I love it here!”. So cozy and welcoming, looks just like the photos, but the attention to detail, when you’re in the space, makes it apparent why Amy and Todd are super hosts. Always so responsive and thoughtful to our life situation with kids. We are so grateful to have had this place to stay as our house is being worked on! Thanks, Amy & Todd!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home. A great stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thoughtful and amazing. Clean and bright with the perfect touches of artistic taste. Comfortable yet elevated. What a perfect place for our family to rest!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"New Nostalgia was everything I hoped it would be and Amy & Todd were over the top helpful hosts! The home lives up to the photos and even better in person. The only “problem” was that we didn’t want to leave! The house made us feel totally at home. The amenities contributed to that feeling. We come to Lincoln frequently from Texas and need a place to stay to visit our college student, son. It was an easy drive to UNL and many wonderful restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. I live in Texas now, but am a native Nebraskan and have spent a lot of time in Lincoln. New Nostalgia is perfectly located, ideal for families, staycations, Husker game weekends, etc…We can’t wait to return on our next visit! There aren’t enough words to express how much we loved New Nostalgia! Until next time…"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at the New Nostalgia house. The house is perfectly set-up for a comfortable stay in Lincoln. Amy is a great host and communicated with us through every step. We will definitely keep the New Nostalgia House in mind next time we come back to Lincoln.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay. It’s a very neat and clean home. We spent a lot of time hanging out in the basement as it’s a perfect lounging spot.
It also has a fiber optic connection from ALLO. We were there for work and it was very fast and reliable.
Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb experience. It’s exactly as pictured with so many details included. Amy’s great communication added to the ease of the stay. You can clearly tell that she and Todd have put their heart and soul into their Airbnb. Great place to stay in south Lincoln!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house has everything you would ever need. When we travel with family, we typically choose an AirBnB over a hotel as it’s much easier to be together. This house hits it out of the park.
There really is nothing to change as everyone who stayed with us commented on how nice the accommodations were. Excellent job, I wish every AirBnB was this nice."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The New Nostalgia House was wonderful in all aspects.. we were a big group and never felt crammed for space. I absolutely loved this house, it should get 10 stars ⭐️ Amy covered every detail you would ever need and more. One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at! The hot tub area with hammocks and outdoor patio were so nice for relaxing and that basement was a great place for all of us to come together watch tv and share stories. We hope to get welcomed back one day.. #GBR thanks so much!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are no words for how impressed I am by this property as well as Amy.
Communication was fantastic
The photos don’t do the home justice. Her sense of style, creativity, and attention to detail are apparent EVERYWHERE- even how she has the dishwasher pods organized.
The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you may need or want.
Bathrooms have hairdryers, toiletries, and emergency items you may have forgotten.
The hot tub works and it gets hot!
There is a gym in the refinished garage.
The basement area is huge and has games that came in handy.
There are multiple outside seating areas that really add value.
The mattresses are firm and supportive.
Access to the home was easy with the touch keypad.
This is .5 miles from Union College- easily within walking distance.
The neighborhood was safe and well established.
I would highly recommend this property and Amy! I have no doubt that whatever she touches will be high quality and beautiful.
We hope to stay here again in the future. ❤️Jeanice"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amy and Todd's haven is beautiful! There are so many lovely and well thought out spaces for groups of varying sizes to gather. The gaming system and the hot tub were a big hit with our teens! The home is as described and pictured or better! The kitchen is also well equipped. The local treats (popcorn, licorice and coffee) were a nice surprise. The home is located in a great spot in South Lincoln, with great proximity to many awesome spots for dining or take out: Copal (Mexican), The Mill, LaMar's Donuts/Colby Ridge Popcorn & Ice Cream, Bagels and Joe, Taco Inn and Butterfly Bakery, to name a few. This Airbnb is as nice as any I've stayed at."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at Amy and Todd's New Nostalgia House. The house is as adorable on the inside as it is on the outside. The hot tub, kid’s playground and hammocks makes this a standout Airbnb for families. Amy was quick to respond to all of my questions. I needed to extend my stay and Amy worked with me to make it happen. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make a gourmet meal. The house is located in a safe neighborhood. We spent a morning walking around the College View area. Discovered a good coffee shop, breakfast place and Mexican restaurant all within walking distance. We had a family emergency and Amy was able to book us a couple extra days around another family. When we moved back in, the house was just as clean as our first visit. New Nostalgia House is a 10/10 Airbnb."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The New Nostalgia home is a place you will want to stay if you are in Lincoln, Nebraska! Clean comfortable and all of the right touches! Super fun for the two boys (8 and 5) and lots of special features for the adults. Wished we could have stayed longer!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved this place. In addition to all the amenities like the hot tub and kitchen items, the owners went above and beyond to provide everything needed for small kids like a cups, dishes, safety gate for the stairway, high chairs, lots of books and toys, etc. lots of extra toiletry items in case you forget some thing. They truly thought through everything intentionally to make sure people have a great stay. You can’t beat the location if you are going to be doing anything in South Lincoln. We will definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The New Nostalgia House is a home away from home. Amy and Todd had everything you could think of and more to accommodate our stay here. We traveled with a 4 month old and the thought they put behind our weekend was so wonderful and shows the heart behind the owners of the home. They had a crib, monitor, toys, bottle brush, baby bath, and sound machine set out for our sweet baby. They even had a little tub of baby food for her. Knowing our baby would’ve been taken care of whether we forgot something or not is such a peace of mind for a mom traveling with her baby.
The house is beautiful and accommodating for large groups with so many gorgeous hang out areas and amenities, but the kindness and heart shown in the owners is greater than anything you could ask for. The world needs more people like them. My group cannot wait to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay, great space, clean, beautiful, and appreciate the little details."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was wonderful! Amy communicated clearly and provided specific descriptions of everything we would need. She also provided local places we could visit and great recommendations. The house was cozy and had many accommodations for a variety of activities we chose to do. I would strongly recommend this house and the hosts to any friends or relatives. They made us feel cared for and a top priority.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay for a Husker weekend. The home was in a good location, had good amenities, clean and the hosts were super easy to work with."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy and Tod have one of the best Airbnbs we have ever experienced. They have thought of everything a guest might need or wonder about the area. Their place was absolutely beautiful, inviting, restful and perfect in my opinion!! I highly recommend them to ever!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,What a beautiful place to stay! Amy was incredibly responsive to any questions. New Nostalgia is well stocked and an absolutely blast and I will be trying to stay here any time I am in Lincoln!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was really awesome, truly everything we could’ve asked for. Excellent location, wonderful aesthetic, plenty of things to do to pass the time if needed. We’ll definitely be back if the place is available for next year’s trip to Lincoln."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the cutest air bnb ever!! Everything was so clean and so homey. We have two kids and Amy literally had everything we could’ve possibly needed! By far the best air bnb we’ve ever stayed at!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house made mine and my families trip everything we could’ve asked for. We traveled with a toddler and it had all the amenities needed. It was also set up to make any adults stay comfortable and relaxed. We very much enjoyed our time in Lincoln at the Nostalgia House! Definitely will be coming back when I’m back in the flatlands!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amy's home is by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. She literally thought of everything when creating this wonderful place for people to stay and enjoy. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly and the home is in a great location. Our family absolutely loved the many areas of the backyard and patio and spent a lot of time there. The house is super cute and comfy. Amy's communication is top notch!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot imagine accommodations that would be more convenient, comfortable, and practical for our family stay in Lincoln. The home was immaculate and everything I needed for a week long stay was there. We made dinner for a large family gathering in preparation for our daughters wedding and there was space for everyone to sit and enjoy the company of the family. When we return to Lincoln to visit family again, the availability of this home with Amy and Todd as hosts will be a large part of the consideration of when we visit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,I love this place! ❤️❤️❤️
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a masterpiece. Amy and Todd went above and beyond to create a unique housing experience. Simply, our trip to Lincoln was a memorable trip largely due to The NN House!
Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"New Nostalgia truly has everything. Traveling with kids is hard, and traveling with extended family is hard - but not here!! Parents with littles, this stay has it all: baby monitor, baby bath, bibs, cups, toys, a play set... it was fantastic to not have to worry about whether or not we forgot something! And our large group loved the common spaces, especially on the deck. We agreed that staying at New Nostalgia was so much better than staying in a hotel where you're separated by floors, have to gather in uncomfortable common spaces, and store food in awkward situations. None of those inconveniences crossed our minds at NN!! We cannot wait to return to this beautiful and relaxing location!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at Amy’s. Hands down one of the best airbnbs we have stayed in, and we have stayed in a lot! Her attention to detail is truly outstanding. She had so many extras I can’t begin to list them all. Toys and stuff for kids, a gym in garage, lots of extra toiletries under the sink, coffee, teas, and so many more! The best part for us was how kid friendly it was. It is a perfect set up for those with small children. Amy is a delightful host and super helpful and friendly. We had no issues at all during our stay and the communication before, during, and after our stay was great. We will definitely stay again in the future when in the area. Highly recommend!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The New Nostalgia House is a beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood. We went for the weekend with friends to ride bicycles and visit some local breweries. The house is near bike trails which we were able to take along with side roads to go everywhere we wanted to go. When we were at the house we sat outdoors most of the time enjoying the amazing outdoor space. Amy and Todd really did think of everything to make this a perfect place to call home during our stay. It was a great weekend spent with friends. We highly recommend their slice of heaven and hope to stay again in the future.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is comfortable and well equipped with everything you need plus more. Everyone in our group felt that it's one of the nicest places they've stayed. Will definitely stay here when in Lincoln in the future!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home was perfect! Best AirBnB we've ever stayed in!
Amy made us feel like family. We were in town for a family funeral. We felt so at home in Amy's house that we really relaxed and focused on being together as family.
Really, we couldn't think of anything else she could do to make the stay better. The home is beautiful, came nearly as fully stocked as our own home, and with too many attentions to detail to list.
We worked out in the garage gym space, played Cornhole & on the swing set, lounged in the hammocks, played video games on the big screen and board games at the table down stairs, we bbq'd & enjoyed the relaxing back patio, entertained the little ones with adorable toys, cooked in the well stocked kitchen with ease, and slept well on the super comfy beds.
The ONLY reason I would hesitate to give this a great review is that I'd like to be able to stay here again if we visit Lincoln -- and selfishly hope there will be ""room in Amy's inn"".
Thank you so much Amy and Todd! Hope you get much joy out of hosting!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"5 STARS. We had a great time at Amy’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located, and perfect for a quiet evening in the backyard. The house was very clean and well stocked. We could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place. Building was so convenient to Haymarket and UNL. Loved everything about our stay and would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is stunning! Great central location and has everything you need. Comfy beds with beautiful linens, a well appointed kitchen, easy to access and we had no issues with finding parking even though it was Graduation weekend at UNL. Loved our stay and can't wait to return!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place itself was excellent and looks exactly like the photos and the hosts even left a hospitable note and snacks. Unfortunately it was much more difficult to find parking than previous reviews suggested and the location was on a very busy street above a bar, so it was quite noisy very late into the night on a Friday and Saturday. Perhaps should have been expected staying downtown."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was immaculate and beautifully decorated. My wife loved it, and she's an interior designer. Daryl and Sally thought of everything that a guest would need from drinks in the fridge and snacks on the counter to instructions on how to use the higher tech items. Even a little first aid kit in the bathroom. The condo is perfectly located downtown close to Haymarket and tons of restaurants. But the location is a double-edged sword and the only section I took off one star. On the weekend, there is a lot of nightlife traffic and even though the condo is on the 5th floor, you can still hear it quite a bit. Not Daryl and Sally's fault the builder didn't use better soundproof windows. Just bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Not a huge deal, though. We do plan to rent this condo again in the fall when we stay in Lincoln."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daryl was an amazing host! So hospitable, the home was spotless and designed beautifully. He left beverages, snacks, and very cool games for me to enjoy. Top tier host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You’re going to wish you could make Daryl’s place your place after staying here!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very luxurious space. We have stayed at many AirBNB’s, but never one that was designed with such quality. The unit came with everything one would need and was extremely clean. The couches, bed and linens were very comfortable. The location is also perfect walkable to everything in downtown Lincoln as well as UNL campus. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Lincoln. The host also communicated proactively and left some personal touches like snacks and drinks."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The condo was immaculate and very comfortable. On check in, I found a handwritten note and some snack provided for me. The bed was super comfortable. They also provided items to use for several just in case situations like extra toothbrush kits and grooming kits, and umbrellas and ponchos at the door.. plus more. Even being off a major street it never got super noisy. And it was within walking distance to a parking garage and to the event I was attending at the Bourbon Theater. Wonderful place with wonderful hosts. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Daryl’s condo was nothing but perfect! The description was precise, great furniture, super cozy and amazing location near to the best spots in downtown. Instructions were very helpful and crystal-clear for checking in and out. Everything was super organized and well thought out, as well as little personal touches that made us feel even more at home! I can’t suggest this condo enough, great experience for anyone visiting Lincoln!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fabulous! It was much better than the pictures displayed. The place was spotless, and the owners thought of everything. We stayed there a week and had no issues. Their attention to detail was amazing. The condo was tastefully decorated with high-end features. I definitely recommend this place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! They have thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was absolutely breathtaking! For example the amenities! The snacks on the counter, drinks the fridge, and the coffee selection was very sweet! The directions were very clear on how to check out and the way they had everything organized and labeled was also very helpful! It was very fun and modern and a really cool view from the windows! All the furniture and sleeping areas were very comfortable as well! I highly suggest anyone to stay here. It’s a great location in Lincoln!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Daryl is a spectacular host! There was literally so many personal touches that just makes you feel right at home! The building was very easy to find, and nice security which is a comfort to us! My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and the hosts were kind enough to leave a personalized note and chocolates, which made our day! All in all we'd rate this condo a solid 10. The place was immaculate and it still felt so welcoming. We felt right at home in Daryls Lincoln condo. Definitely would stay there again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay when visiting Lincoln! The apartment was easy to find, with readily available parking after a long drive. The flat was completely spotless, had all the amenities required and every piece of furniture was comfortable to relax on! The blackout blinds also meant I got a really full sleep.
It's within striking distance of the Haymarket and downtown areas, with an array of good restaraunts and bars. As I was in town to visit friends, it was the perfect location. During the day it was an easy walk to Memorial Stadium, the State Capitol and shopping.
Daryl was polite, friendly, and so thorough with the instructions I barely had to ask anything - but he responded quickly when I did.
Would absolutely recommend staying here if you visit Lincoln."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is so cozy and beautiful. We spent a lot of time inside last week with the sub zero temperatures. We had everything we wanted and more. Good communication and lots of thoughtful touches.

Daryl was a great host! Highly recommended & we will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this spot conveniently located in downtown Lincoln. Will absolutely be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a Great space! We've never stayed in a place that had so many luxurious features.
The building/condo was easy to access (secure) and had a very private feel as well. It was within walking distance of all sporting venues in town.
A very comfy bed, and an awesome Living space with a 75 inch TV with all the viewing options out there! Remote control blinds, fans, & lighting controls with a fully stocked and wonderful kitchen area too!
Ultra modern, fantastic furnishings, and a very, very, clean space.
Great communication and assistance was consistently provided by the owners.
This will certainly be our next stop when coming back to town!"

Everything was very clean and comfortable in the condo with all the amenities you need, plus extras. The host was very helpful with parking instructions, we didn't have any troubles parking even with a Nebraska football game going on. Although, you do not need a car to get around in this area, everything you may need is walkable. There is some traffic noise at night but that is to be expected in a busy downtown. Overall, this was an excellent experience, and we look forward to staying here again."

The location was fantastic and I loved all the little amenities like the bottles of wine for purchase and the white noise machine! I will book again if we have any other little local adventures.

The shower is tiny with low water pressure and it was difficult to find parking, and the loft is on the third floor with no elevator - the only cons."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the loft. It was well appointed and had Christmas decor, which was really lovely. The only difficulty was climbing three flights of stairs several times daily and paying a parking meter or paying daily for parking underground, but the parking was close by. Overall, it was a great experience. We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Amy"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Although we had some mishaps with checkin, the apartment was beautiful and clean. It is very close to many restaurants and shops. Amy was very helpful.

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The location if excellent if you want to be in Haymarket district. The loft is clean and well appointed. Parking is not included- there are meters and parking garages near by. It is noisy- you can hear doors slamming from other units and neighbors having parties in very early morning hours making sleeping difficult.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for game day!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in a good spot aside from smelling all the food in the restaurant underneath. Adequate place. The AC had a hiccup and didn't really work the first night but it eventually came back on its own. So that wasn't too bad but it took more than 24 hours to get any response from the host which seems not great if you have a real issue that doesn't get solved on its own.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Was everything we expected
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very clean place and Amy was very accommodating to my requests. For game day weekends it is the perfect spot to stay as it's close to everything you need.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy was a very sweet and amazing host! During my stay the fridge stopped working and she was very accommodating and tried her best to get it fixed.
The bed was flawless and the space was spotless, clean and fantastic! Loved the charm of the unit and the location was top notch, probably one of the best spot in Lincoln! ❤️
Parking can be tricky but if you play your cards right grabbing a space even closer than the garage is totally doable. Truly would return anytime I am back!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a husker weekend or even just a relaxing Lincoln getaway. The apartment was clean and what we expected and within a 1-5 minute walk from many attractions
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family (two adults and two kids) stayed at Amy’s studio apartment for a night after a looonnng day of travel. My husband and I both agree that the bed was the most comfortable we slept in throughout our whole vacation! The location was perfect after a day of traveling. We parked the car in the overnight garage (only $11 for the night!) and we’re able to easily walk to dinner. My kid’s favorite part was the ice cream shop below the apartment!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A really cool hip city place to stay
No coffee maker only instant coffee
Bring your own French press and coffee"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is utter perfection. Especially as a visitor from big city ... we couldn't imagine staying in other parts of Lincoln and not having some fun bars to walk to at night. The apartment is large and clean. But the halls and stairwells are dirty. If you can ignore the public areas and go quickly up to your loft, you won't have any complaints.
The coin-op dryer took our money and spun for the expected time but when the cycle finished, we had cold soggy clothes. Hopefully they get it fixed quickly and you won't have this problem.
The noise from outside is minimal, if at all. That was a treat. But, there are metal industrial doors to the stairwell and the neighbors. Neighbors were very disrespectful and even into the late hours of the night, would come and go slamming doors which literally rattled the walls in the loft and woke us up many times.
Overall, since I will only every stay in downtown Lincoln and it's important to have a kitchen to make/eat my own food, this is a GREAT option for the price. I can take the good with the bad but not everyone has their priorities in the same place as mine so wanted to put this out there for those who it might help ...."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a very pleasant stay, communication was easy and simple. Great location close to campus and walkable to many restaurants/bars."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for spending a weekend in the Haymarket. Right in the middle of everything with a lot of stuff in walking distance.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft in an amazing location. Very clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again! The door to access the third floor is unlocked, you just have to press the thumb lever extra hard. Nice quiet building with a south facing window so not directly above the restaurant terrace. Parking garage within half a block."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute loft! RIGHT in downtown, lots of restaurants and night life in walking distance. Parking is hit or miss, but there is a parking garage about 3 blocks away. The loft building itself, is very old and the hallway and stairway are a bit sketchy, lol. But the loft itself is all updated and clean and very cute. Was a great spot for the 3 of us to hang for a girls weekend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Lincoln! Amy was quick to respond, the place was clean, and we had everything we needed. The available wine was a great touch."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and wonderful place to stay, clean and organized well! Be sure to bring coins or a chip card for your parking meter, as far as I noticed there is no free parking unless you park a block or more away or find a free parking lot but I didn’t see any of those. Other than that I highly recommend this stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing! Couldn’t be happier with our experience!

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute and convenient but it’s really not for adult humans. The entire building seemed to be occupied by students who def partied (loudly) until the sun came up. Nothing wrong with that when you’re younger, but if you’re looking to get good rest, a hotel might suffice."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amy’s place was great as usual!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amy’s place was perfect for our weekend trip to Lincoln. We can to town for the Elton John concert and the fact that her loft is walking distance from PBA and all of the Haymarket shops and restaurants made the trip really enjoyable. It was very clean and had the amenities we needed. Highly recommend staying here!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a great time at Amy’s apartment, the location was great and the view was nice. The bed was comfy, the place was tastefully decorated, and within walking distance of everything in Haymarket and downtown.
However, there were a few areas for improvement. Namely some loose door hinges/door knobs and broken dining chairs. The noise level from the street and thin walls within the building were distracting at times, and parking was incredibly hard to find.
Overall, we had a great time and the location was as advertised. I would stay again, maybe just at a quieter time of the year."

Her location is right near all the best restaurants and coffee shops. I wasn’t there to shop but I did notice many place to shop. It was very easy to get an Uber or Lyft. Renting a car was not needed. Her loft is like 10 minutes from the airport.
Did I mention the BED?!! Has to be the best night sleep when I am not on my own bed!! WOW. Just the perfect loft to spend a week in. Amy’s communication is spot on and this is very important to me. I will definitely stay here again!!!"

The only thing to know is there are no elevators, so if you have a heavy bag you will have to carry it up the stairs. Otherwise, the spot is fantastic and will meet all your needs :)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amy's place was very cute and in a great location! I'd stay here again. The place was clean and the bed was super comfy. There is no elevator and it's 3 floors up so just don't bring too much luggage ;)

Will definitely look into staying here again my next time in Lincoln."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easily the best place to stay in Nebraska!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the warm hospitality and fresh coffee.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was cozy and neat, it's as much as you could ask for on a short trip and just as described and shown in photos, LeeAnne and her husband are just sweet people, we would end up conversing for long periods while hanging around the kitchen or even having meals all together. LeeAnne was very accommodating across the board with shared spaces, helpful about regarding the local area, and a great host. The location wasn't too far from everything, but I preferred not to be close to the downtown area, plus it was less than a 10 minute walk to a nearby lake, so that was convenient. In the future I might have to return to Lincoln for personal business, and if I do, I'll be staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We could have stayed and talked about herbs and life, but on the road we had to go. LeeAnne is very welcoming."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and quiet place! I stayed during an across country road trip and it was everything we needed to reset for the next day! It was a darling experience :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LeeAnn was responsive to me at my first inquiry and continued to be so through all interactions. Her profile states that she and her husband enjoy meeting new people, and this was accurate. They are warm, friendly, and conversational folks, who made us feel comfortable and welcome throughout our stay. Though it was only 1 night, I can understand the appeal to someone wanting a much longer stay. The townhouse is so easy to reach (we used our phone's GPS to get there from the interstate), and is conveniently located near through-streets for getting around Lincoln. The bedroom and bathroom were impeccably clean; the bed was very comfortable, and the temperature in the room was pleasant with a ceiling fan for use. The most obvious characteristic though, was the absence of street noise, guaranteeing a peaceful sleep. I encourage anyone looking for a well-appointed room with excellent hosts to check out this place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely home and sweet hosts. Such a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Love the antiques in the room and the ceiling fan to stay cool in the summer heat.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room. Very comfortable. Wonderful host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LeeAnne’s place is in a very quiet neighborhood about 15 minutes from any of the main “attractions” in Lincoln such as the University of Nebraska ( both main and East campuses), the state capital building, and the Children’s museum. The room, with private bath, was large and comfortable and spotless. We were welcomed to help ourselves to coffee or tea in the morning and invited to use any of the common spaces and to ask for anything we might need. LeeAnne was warm and gracious."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Comfy for short or long term!

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Lincoln or the area so stay with LeeAnne for a wonderful experience!"

You couldn't ask for a better single room. It had enough room for a reading chair, which I very much liked in the evenings. A great stay."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very gracious, kind host. Space was clean and entry was easy. Our room was right inside the front door so moving bags in was easy. There was a fan in the room, but it was a little stuffy. That was our only negative."

2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,LeeAnne was friendly but there was no lock on my bedroom door and my entire body has broken out in a ln itchy rash after only staying 2 of the 5 nights I booked to stay. I left after the second night.

The neighborhood is lovely and felt very safe.

If you wanted to sample a drink or food that LeeAnne made, you got it. If you had a problem, LeeAnne would help work it out! The room was amazing. The kindness was amazing! The feeling of being home was better than any hotel could offer! I have nothing but kind words to say to my wonderful hosts! You cannot go wrong by choosing LeeAnne's home to be a guest in when you need a place to stay."

Yet, we were close to major roads and every destination seemed to be nearby. Highly recommended!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place, great neighborhood, fantastic host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to get away. Our purpose was to rest and the Eden satisfied that goal perfectly. Located in the countryside, the Eden was easily accessed and was amazingly comfortable. The cottage does sit on the families property so it is not 100% secluded, but the peaceful area provided a serenity that we needed.
The amenities are wonderful. The kitchen was easily adapted to, the utensils were were clean and amazing for cooking our breakfasts and preparing our lunches. With tile floors the rugs were helpful and the bathroom floor is HEATED!!
Our interactions with Tom were sociable and friendly and he helped us feel welcome to explore the flowerbeds and green house.
Definitely worth looking into if you are in the Lincoln area!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really great place and so pretty!!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place was great! I really appreciated all the little details that went into the interior of the space; it was a well curated country cottage! Tom was quick to respond to a few issues we faced and fixed them immediately- for that we were very grateful! Also, the inside and outside were both very clean and fresh.
We found the wifi was not high speed and went in town to work on a few things online. This was not a big deal though, because we wanted the remote/secluded feeling anyway. We were disappointed, however, to find that the private residence and business were in such close proximity to the home. Some folks might love this, but as more reserved people, this was not the stay for us."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved the space! Beautifully decorated, peaceful, comfortable bed. We would love to come back when the flowers are in Bloom and walk around the grounds. Absolutely stunning place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Tom's cottage! It was the most relaxing stay & we appreciated the charm, style, & beauty throughout.

Each time I stay, I have a new favorite thing. This time, the heated bathroom floors and the Bluetooth vintage style speaker were near the top of the list. Great location, great hosts. Wholeheartedly recommend."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely gorgeous and just what we needed….peaceful! We only had a quick stay, but everything was more than we thought!

Check in was a breeze, the room was exactly as described, and the environment was very peaceful. The room was very intuitively designed: filters by the coffeepot, blankets by the comfy couch, even chocolates on the kitchen counter.
When there was an issue getting the wifi to work, the hosts were quick to respond and remedy the problem. They showed me around the farm, and even left a thank you note with a lovely arrangement of flowers on my departure.
Will definitely go back again. Highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Eden at West Mill was truly a 10/10. This place was BEAUTIFUL! Hands down the nicest Air B and B I’ve stayed in. The location was very close to Lincoln. Within driving distance of downtown yet secluded enough to be in a quiet peaceful environment. The amenities by far exceeded my expectations. It was very clean and well kept. I will absolutely be booking at the Eden in the future. I look forward to coming back in the summer when the flowers are in bloom!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very clean and well decorated. Owner was very responsive and accommodating. Only thing was We aren’t accustomed to basements so we were surprised that you can hear all footsteps. Also the upstairs has no door. So we all had to go to bed at the same time because noise travels in the house.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our stay in Lincoln. It was close to everyone and everything we wanted to visit.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough about this host, they were super responsive and so very accommodating when I asked if a 2-year-old staying in the space was appropriate. They really thought through what was needed in the space, the place was spotless, and they even set up little extras to accommodate the baby. Wonderful."

Hosts are very quick to answer and provided baby gates for our stay, a pack n play and some toys. Home works very well for babies, toddlers and older children. Very comfy couch! Plenty of storage space for long visits. Uodated appliances and well worth the stay vs a hotel. Great location, close to stores, food, mall, etc. Very happy with our stay and will keep in mind for our next visit if available!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kali & Eric were so helpful and accommodating with an allergy to fragrances. They communicated well and quickly. The home was bright and comfortable. Our group of volunteer leaders consisted of three couples and this home gave us our own spaces as well as a place to gather together. We all agreed it was a great choice. We especially appreciated a path being shoveled in the snow to get from the driveway to the sidewalk. It meant we didn’t have to walk in the road to carry luggage and supplies in. The location doesn’t seem to have noisy weekend traffic which was awesome. We felt we could ask for things if needed. Thank you, Kali & Eric for being great hosts!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This old farmhouse has been made over beautifully whether you look up at the ceiling or down at the floor. The kitchen is beautiful, they did a great Job. The place was spotless clean. It was great for us because we were visiting Nebraska Wesleyan University, and it was only two blocks away. The downstairs bedroom has its own living area, but it definitely still feels like you are in a basement. It is done beautifully though. The room in the attic does not have a door at the top of the steps and you have to walk with your head tilted to get to the bed. It’s kind of a fun space though. But as she mentioned, make sure you bring your own shampoo and soap. It is an overall nice place."

I appreciate and truly value the clear communication, accountability, transparency, and responsiveness to everything question and concern that I had from Kali and her team. I definitely would stay again and would recommend to friends and family."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 7 stayed overnight on our way to Colorado. We'd never been to Lincoln and were a little nervous at first that the house seemed to be off of a busy-ish road. Ended up being absolutely a non-issue. House was gorgeous; very clean and comfortable. The kids loved the upstairs space, and we were close to restaurants and stores. We had great time and would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family was just passing through town while on a road trip, so it was a really short stay. I must say this is a beautifully remodeled home!

This summer the city is dealing with an issue with springtail bugs and there were some present in the basement area that necessitated my son sleep in a main level bedroom. Host responded right away and explained the many steps that have been taken to keep the springtails out (they are harmless) and was immediately on the phone with her pest control specialist. I would stay here again when traveling through Lincoln.

The beds, bedding, and towels were nice and the house smelled very nice. The backyard is well kept up. The house sits off a busy road but was pleasantly surprised to not hear much inside which was very nice! Gas stations are nearby and less than 10-minute drive to Walmart and Target. Kali had great communication and was very professional. :) *The only advice I have to those staying here, is that if you are a light sleeper, choose the main level bed or the upstairs bed vs the basement to avoid hearing people walk around. But even with that said, it is very cute and cozy down there!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Kali!! This house was beautiful, comfortable, and clean. We easily slept three and had a lovely stay thanks to their impeccable attention to detail. We would definitely book again!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! Photos are very accurate. Plenty of space on all levels and just what we needed for our 3 day trip! And Kali was SO SO helpful and very responsive -she was great!
However the cleaners we dont think did a very good job. We found some hairs on the bathroom counters in the kitchen cupboards on dishes. And we have 2 small children, and they were playing and finding a lot of trash (wrappers, an old vape, chapsticks, old food) in between couch cushions.
I dont think the cleaning aspect directly reflects the host. Kali was great just wasnt too keen on the cleanliness!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cute, very clean space!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Newly remodeled home, awesome basement and attic space. Walls are thin, house is on intersection so there’s some noise. Dirt driveway too, so tracking in dirt was difficult.

Enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and relaxing in the living room with the smart TV. Thoughtful touches throughout the house. Very useful to have laundry room to wash clothes during a long trip. We especially enjoyed the downstairs room and bedroom: super quiet and cool on an unexpectedly warm Spring/Easter trip to visit family. Very enjoyable experience and would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kali's place was super clean and comfortable. It felt like a home away from home. The house was designed well and was really cute.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an advertised home. Small but adequate for our purposes and priced appropriately. Nice, well-decorated home with all the amenities advertised. The fenced-in yard was a nice touch too. If you are looking to stay a few days in Lincoln and want a more homey atmosphere than you'll get at a hotel, this is perfect. It borders a busy street, so there is some traffic noise but nothing that was annoying. I would definitely stay there again if I get a chance."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Kali's house was totally remodeled and very well done. All the furniture and appliances were new or near new and in great shape. Seven of us slept there very comfortably. The patio and fenced yard would be wonderful in nice weather. It was easy to find. I would recommend this house for anyone going to Lincoln for a Husker game or any event.
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Our overall stay was great! We are from here and enjoyed being able to plan a staycation without the kiddos. The only thing I wished would have been different was the beds. Each morning was pretty painful because of the springs in the bed. That made our sleep pretty difficult. It wasn’t the firmness but the springs. Everything else was FANTASTIC! Super clean, love the kitchen and style and natural light that comes through. Hopefully beds are updated so we can come back and stay again!"

The city is very safe and the town is super clean. This location allows you to to take in the sights and sounds of the area. It is a beautiful home. Host even leaves treats for their guests.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When traveling I’m always so cautious of where I’m going to be staying like is it in good neighborhood? will the place im staying at be like the photos? Should I stay at a hotel or do an air bnb?
So I saw Luke’s air bnb and was like woah! This place looks sweet! Then saw the price… and instantly booked it!
The thing is when I got there, Luke was outside and we conversed for a bit and I could tell he was a very nice and trust worthy guy.
After our conversation, I went inside and I was honestly amazed by the the attention to detail that was put into that place, like by far the best bang for my buck I think I could ever ask for.

Everything in the house was just what we needed from bags to pick up after the dog and a cute water bowl and food bowl to a comfy living room and plenty of linens and towels. The house is a historic home so the hardwood floors creak, but everything has been done nicely including the front porch where we sat and read. We loved the neighborhood and walking to Woods Park!"

She has treats and toys for fur friends tooo."

We loved Laura’s place - the kitchen is well stocked (we shopped to Lincoln Trader Joe’s and made a simple meal) and the bathroom is large. The bed was comfortable and it was cold out so we enjoyed the central heat. The location was excellent - we walked to the parks and Sunken Gardens nearby and it was a quick drive to downtown and the Capitol. Laura was a great host - proactive and with clear instructions.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of 4 with two young kids and a dog enjoyed a nice one night stop over on our cross country road trip. The area was very quiet, the fenced in yard was big, and the house was cozy just as described and pictured. We had a slight hiccup on check-in, but Laura answered our call right away and we were able to get the correct door code. We would definitely stay again on our next road trip."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,I wasn't excited about having to strip my own bed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Laura's place was just terrific. We stayed here for our fourth night on the road of a cross-country move. The fenced in backyard was a life-saver. We were on the road for eight hours (or more) each day, so having a place for our pup to run around and stretch his legs after a long day in the car was just terrific. And the house was just terrific—clean, cozy, and stuffed with all of the amenities the we could need. Just an excellent place to stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the first time we took our two dogs to an airbnb and it was a great experience. Laura obviously knows dogs! She has dog towels and bowls and toys, and even left our pups some treats. The yard is securely fenced and easy to access from the house. But there is no 'doggy smell' in the house, and no dog hair anywhere. The house really is impeccably clean. People without pets would be comfortable here - it's sunny, nicely remodeled and decorated, but not fussy. The bathroom is roomy and the shower is a treat. There are a few nice touches that show Laura really does care about providing a welcoming experience. She's also a good communicator. The bedding is comfy but we did find the pillows to be uncomfortably over-stuffed and ended up using rolled blankets as pillows. The neighborhood is peaceful with people out walking dogs and kids walking home from school. Staying there was a nice homey Nebraska experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Laura is an incredible host, from beginning to end was super helpful and the location/home was spotless and even prettier than pictured. Thank you again for a great stay!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect and charming place for my 4 day stay with my dog. The large fenced yard was mowed and very clean. The house was spotless and the kitchen was extremely well appointed. Laura has thought of every detail, including designer dog dishes, toys, and even a string of bells for the dogs trained to ring them when needing outside.
Laura stopped to meet me, at my request, and shared the history of the house, the remodel and shared photos of the before and after.
There is a park 3 short blocks from the house and the spectacular Sunken Gardens are a 10 minute walk away. Love this property!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House in Woods Park was the perfect home-away-from-home while I was in Lincoln for a creative conference! Fully-stocked kitchen and so many extra touches throughout the home made it a very comfortable stay. Laura was always helpful and quick to respond.
Tip: While locking door, I recommend using one hand to pull doorknob towards you while other hand turns the deadbolt."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Clean, cute, and cozy house with everything we needed. Laura was flexible and worked with us on the check-in time.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Laura's house was just what we needed as a stopping point on our road trip! The house is clean and comfortable and easy to find. Our dog loved the backyard and it was nice to have a space for him to run around safely after a long drive. The next morning, I took our dog on a long walk on a nearby walking/running/bike trail, which was lovely.
The neighborhood is cute to walk through and there's a small grocery store within walking distance. Laura responded to questions quickly, and was proactive in communicating. Although we didn't get a chance to explore Lincoln, this house is a great place to stay and we would definitely stop here again!"

Extra towles and plenty dishes. We enjoyd staying in that house. Laura was a super host and responded emidiately. A perfect place to stay in Lincoln!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest bungalow ever and Laura was a great hostess and we communicated throughout the entire process. The place was very clean and comfortable. It was conveniently located within 10-15 minutes of almost everything. Very minimal amenities. Because of the very and dusty weather in Nebraska it would have been nice to have a washer and dryer. Especially having to take multiple baths during the day. We made it through.
We would like to recommend updating the bathroom lighting be switched to ""white"" bulbs in the vanity instead of ""soft"" lights. It's hard to get full coverage doing makeup for the events we attended. Also, you may want to consider updating the microwave - it's time.
Our stay overall was great and would definitely come back again! Thank you so much!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Little House was great. We have a small dog and it was perfect for him, great fenced in yard…no carpet in the house to be concerned about

Laura provided potty bags & tennis balls (so cute!) and we just thoroughly enjoyed our time at this Airbnb. We will definitely book this spot again!"

We all fell in love with the neighborhood which was perfect for walking our dog and the super cute house. The claw foot bathtub was amazing!!! The kitchen and bath were also well stocked with everything we needed to cook and be comfortable. By far the BEST AirBnB we have stayed at hands down. I just wished we stayed a few extra days.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can't say enough positive things about Laura's stay. We rented this house over the Thanksgiving holiday and we felt right at home. Laura is very communicative--anything you need, she responds very quickly. You likely won't need to reach her, because she's already thought of everything!
Things I really appreciate about Laura's home:
1. It's sparkling clean and Laura takes COVID precautions very seriously.
2. This home isn't just dog friendly, it's dog FORWARD! She provides cloths for cleaning dog paws, poop bags, ceramic dog bowls, and instructions for covering furniture. Traveling with our pup is normally stressful, but not at those home. The sizable, fully-fenced yard saved us!
3. The house doesn't feel like a rental, it feels so cozy. We felt so welcome and at-home.
Will definitely stay again next time we're in Lincoln."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The little house was just perfect for our family! We had two dogs, fenced in back yard was great. We had our 6 month old baby with us too and there was plenty of space for his travel bassinet. Lovely claw foot bath tub and the kitchen had everything we needed for a short stay. Highly recommended and we will be staying there again whenever we pass through Lincoln!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Laura's Little House experience is all that you want from an Airbnb stay. Laura communicates promptly. The house is clean and aesthetically pleasing. Laura has done such a good job of highlighting the original character of this quaint bungalow. It is a comfortable house to spend the night in. The beds are a good balance of soft yet firm. The sheets are so soft. The pillows are comfortable. The house heats up efficiently. You don't always find that in an older home. We slept well, and I enjoyed appreciating the beautiful wood features in this pretty house. I slept in the front bedroom, and heard no traffic noises at all. The neighborhood is quiet. Just a lovely stay."

There’s a park just a block away and it’s easy to find. The home itself looks like it has the original woodwork of what appears to be quarter cut oak and oak floors. The home is immaculate, you could eat off the floors. But we chose to have breakfast outside on the patio table in the spacious and green backyard. The bathroom is lovingly and appropriately updated with a tiled walk in shower and a claw foot tub. The beds are very comfortable, too. Fragrance free and comfortable home on a tree lined street. Dog treats and chocolate made us feel welcome. Best stay ever!"

As check-in time neared, Alicia reached out to me for my ETA so she could be there to greet me. As I arrived I found it to not only be secure, but it was the most peaceful setting I could ever have imagined to recover at after two full days of driving. What an absolutely wonderful property and such gracious hosts to have found for my second overnight. Alicia’s husband, Steve, provided a thorough orientation of the guest cottage and suggested local fuel and food options. Although the property seemed so remote and removed, I was happily surprised to find a Costco gas station so conveniently close as well as an abundance of popular dining options. I wish I had more time to enjoy the area and Alicia’s guest cottage. If I ever find myself in the Lincoln, NE area and in need of lodging, Alicia’s place will be the first place I look for to stay."

From the time I put in to book Alicia's place till we got there ,she was there answering my questions immediately and was VERY sweet and helpful. I would highly recommend her Airbnb as the perfect stay for a quiet getaway with just a few minutes from the activity of the city. The place was very clean and beautifully set up. The kitchen was set up with everything you needed and the bathroom was spotless. We felt right at home and had a wonderful time!!!

Alicia is so warm and inviting like a favorite friend. A sidewalk to the cottage provides ease with luggage and is well lit. It will renew your soul. Thanks Alicia and Steve for your thoughtfulness.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was very Easy to find. Was in the Country ButWas close to things to do. The shower was nice to have instead of a tub. As I am older and don't like crawling into a tub anymore period

The space is super clean, and Alicia provided everything we could ever need, including a kitchen fully stocked with amenities. We got a personal tour when we arrived, and their adorable ginger kitty Honey Bear also made sure we felt welcomed. :) We loved being in the country -- full of privacy and the sound of crickets lulled us to sleep at night. We also had the chance to check out the local park, which is beautiful and perfect for stretching our legs. We absolutely plan to stay here the next time we pass through Lincoln!"

We were way off target getting there and Alicia was very understanding about our late arrival. Steve and Alicia are wonderful hosts and have provided a WONDERFUL respite for travelers.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were passing through Lincoln on our cross-country drive from Seattle to New York. It was only one night but we had a lovely stay. It was clean and comfortable and we woke up refreshed the next morning. It was exactly what we needed.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Cottage was perfect for our stay. Greeted by the host and was shown around and tips for staying at the Cottage. Kitchen has everything you could need and then some. everything was comfortable and super quiet. Love the fresh air and it is close enough to downtown and yet still out of the city. The local cat greeted us everyday as we came and went. I will be booking this again if our daughter's event is back in Lincoln. It felt like home.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing spot to stop! We had our 6 month old with us and Alicia ran out to greet us and couldn’t wait to see the baby. So sweet and kind to welcome us like family. We would like to make this little cottage a part of our traditions when vacationing out west

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Alicia’s cottage to visit my Grandma in Lincoln. Alicia was very kind, communicative, and accommodating. The cottage is perfect for someone looking to get away from the city for a stay in the country, yet still be close enough to access the amenities of Lincoln. I would gladly stay again without a second thought."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic little spot in the countryside. Great open space, full kitchen, and is lit up when the sun is up.
My only small gripe is that the shower is a small 3x3 foot space, so it may be a little difficult for taller people to comfortably shower in that space. It is not, however, enough for me to want to dock any points for the rest of the space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable cottage! We loved everything about our stay. Hosts were very kind and helpful. Alicia has thought of everyone you'd need in a kitchen. The cottage was very quiet and on beautiful property. We hope to stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Alicia's place. Sadly, we showed up late and left early on a trip cross country. We would have liked to stay longer and explore Lincoln! The cottage is located on a beautiful property where fireflies lit up the night. A cat named Honey Bear greeted us. The beds were very comfortable and the cottage was well-lit. There was a reading light on every nightstand. The air conditioning and wifi worked great. You could hear the crickets outside. We would love to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home at this peaceful cottage! It has everything we needed for our stay. Alicia and Steve are great hosts. They were so friendly and go above and beyond!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Alicia and Steve’s place!! So beautiful with the massive cottonwood trees and the acres and acres of beautiful land - we enjoyed a nice glass of wine watching the sun go down in lounge chairs provided by the hosts (thank you). The rental is more beautiful and modern than the photos, it’s clean, fully stocked and comfortable. Alicia and Steve have thought of everything!! The rental is super quiet and the king bed is sooo comfy!! The space is tranquil and just what we needed after driving for over 8 hours. We appreciated the clean filtered water and the other offerings. The living-room was really comfy and the TV was awesome and had a big picture! The shower was wonderful, with good pressure and even water temperature. The A/C was perfect and welcomed with the heat, as well as the fan overhead of the bed when we slept. Waking up listening to the birds singing their songs was wonderful!! Thanks Alicia & Steve we recommend your rental 100% & rate it full on ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️’s 🥰"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Alicia's place was terrific. We sent a message as soon as we arrived and Alicia's husband was out in just a couple of minutes to welcome us and walk us into the cottage. Everything was comfortable, clean, and just what we needed for our daughter's wedding weekend (I especially appreciated the pitcher of fresh cold water in the fridge!).
During our stay, my husband had lost his wedding ring and we looked everywhere, or so we thought. After we checked out, we received a message that they had found a ring outside by the front door and it was definitely my husband's! I was hoping it was still back at our house so I hadn't ask them to look yet.
We coordinated the exchange with one of my daughters that lives near Lincoln and had a very pleasant messaging conversation as we set that up.
Highly recommended and would come again. Many thanks to Alicia and her husband!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Steve are great hosts and their studio rental is superb.
Had a very clear walk through of the apartment by Steve upon arrival and as they live on an adjacent property they were always reachable.
Everything we could have wanted was there; the location is convenient for the city or countyside.
Lots of places to see in Lincoln only minutes away and parks & trails galore.
Loved our stay here as part of a 30-day road trip mainly exploring Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Wish we could have stayed longer as this is an exceptional Airbnb. Thanks for hosting us."

It was nice being somewhat away from the hustle and bustle of town, while still close enough to get where I wanted to easily. Both Alicia and Steve were friendly and prompt with communication. I really appreciated the quick overview Steve gave me upon arriving, as well as the helpful information packet that was left for me. It was also very kind of Alicia to think of me when the weather turned to make sure I would be able to get the snow removed from my car. This was everything I could ask for with my first solo Airbnb experience!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. Great value for the money. The only thing I’ll note is that we were hoping for more of a secluded/rural feel. Don’t get me wrong the views are gorgeous but the cottage is pretty close to the host’s main house. It didn’t feel quite as much as a rural escape as we were hoping. But if that aspect doesn’t matter to you this place is a great pick.

Alicia and her husband (and their adorable cat) greeted us, and showed us everything we needed! We felt very safe, very comfortable, and we will be coming back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Steve are wonderful hosts, my husband and I only have glowing praise for our comfortable stay in their lovely cottage and for the ease in communication with these friendly hosts! The cottage is very comfortable and we have absolutely no complaints. We will definitely stay here again! Thank you very much!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Easy check in. Steve was very kind and had water in the fridge for us. Will definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you ever visit Lincoln Nebraska, and Alicia's cottage is available, STAY THERE!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay hosts are very nice and very responsive to any questions or concerns
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you appreciate tranquility and solitude, this is the place for you! The cottage is decorated perfectly with soft relaxing decor. The location and fact that it is detached and on acreage is a bonus!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay here, Alicia and her husband are excellent hosts and the cottage was perfect in a beautiful setting! Only a mile from a beautiful park with trails!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"1. We most certainly will stay here again. 2. The hosts are wonderfully friendly and super accommodating. 3. The setup at The Cottage is excellent beyond critique, especially if you are looking for a quiet, rural setting. 4. Having said #3 above, it is only a few minutes drive to a grocery, gas station, and other amenities. 5. It took 7 minutes (I timed it because I'm coming back) to get out to I-80 on the west side of Lincoln."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great weeklong stay at Alicia's studio cottage. So much space inside and out! Very quiet private rural location but with good access to city of Lincoln. Very clean and comfortable. Alicia was very responsive after I booked my stay and took extra effort to make sure my check in went smoothly. Good instructions were provided on how to use everything and it all worked flawlessly. Best equipped kitchen I have seen in a suite like this. Everything was very well maintained. I hope it will be available the next time I need to stay in the Lincoln area.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location, location, location"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Lisa was proactive and clear with where to park and check in times. A small issue that I had was the radiant heating. The days were mild to warmer days, and we were unable to control the heat temp. The bathroom was 80 degrees plus and the bedroom was well over 75 degrees. Not much to be done about that though. Thanks it was a great time."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was just the right place for a long weekend in LINCOLN. Very walkable area and excellent hosts. Communication was awesome. The place was so cute and very cozy.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place!! It was beautiful, elegant and had wonderful, unique features. The place was spotless!! Loved what they did with the space… touch of new in a vintage unique building. I will be back!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and great location! The hosts were extremely helpful and responsive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Lincoln!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Condo was cute, very vintage. Building looks to be a work in progress and there are a lot of stairs. It felt homey."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place with a responsive host!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place on the inside. The windows are old and it was hard to regulate the temperature. The location was good as far as being centrally located, however it was not a good neighborhood. The area and building are old and run down. Bring on the 4th floor was a bit inconvenient, but good exercise. All in all for the price it was doable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, simple, clean place convenient to downtown and UNL."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa was a great host and was very responsive! The Airbnb looked exactly like the pictures and was perfect for the little get away we had planned.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa was a perfect host. Provided excellent instructions, was very responsive, and the place was spotless and comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place and great location! Lisa was super helpful and responsive, will absolutely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and comfortable!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little apartment next to the Capitol. True to photos and was comfy!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, close to downtown so it's only about $8 for an uber ride. The place is very clean and brings a New York condo feel. I'd definitely stay again and totally recommend it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was very helpful from prior to selecting it to arriving to changing plans for weather to departure. She was very accommodating and very attentive. I would definitely recommend that people stay here.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Everything in Lisa's place was just as described and it had more than we ever need for a short stay. There was an odd smell that lingered throughout our one-day stay. Other than that, I have no complaints!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed here a few times while visiting family for the holidays. Great spot downtown with off street parking, and the perfect amount of space for two adults! Lisa was incredibly responsive and accommodating. Would love to stay again in the future."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was awesome being able to walk into downtown from Lisa’s place.
Parking is great.
Washer and Dryer are listed in amenities however they are not in the apartment which is on the fourth floor they are in the basement and cost money."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room description was accurate. I appreciate Lisa’s special effort to let people know there are only stairs to access the room on the 4th floor which was not a problem for me. The condo unit was very clean. I was surprised to find out the sheet and the blanket on the bed was somehow adhere to each other and prevent any contact between the blanket and person who sleep underneath. This is not the case from my stays at other lodgings where blanket and sheet separates which lead to the concern if blankets were sanitized between guests.
The condo was dated and can have some equipment updates and new paint. Everything in the unit works, nonetheless. Bathroom light could be brighter for guests to see themselves clearer from the mirror.
Overall, Lisa was a great host. She is honest and very helpful to meet my needs."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent hosts. Provided clear and helpful instructions prior to arrival, were responsive for any questions and are immensely hospitable. The place is cozy and they make a great effort to make sure you have everything you need. The 1 bedroom condo is clean, comfortable, and has a substantial amount surrounded by it within walking distance."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute, bright apartment with a cool view of the Capitol. Perfect for a weekend in Lincoln!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We went to a concert at the Bourbon Theatre. The location worked out great! Walking distance and felt safe both to and from the theatre.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for everything we needed to visit my friends daughter at college, attend the football game and restaurants! We’ll be back next year!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a weekend in Lincoln
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and easily walkable to
Downtown!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is perfect and spacious for two people. Pretty views of the State Capitol Building and walkable to restaurants. Safe neighborhood.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s place was cozy, clean, and exactly what we needed for our stay. She was an extremely engaging host, quick to respond. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick night out in Lincoln, and Lisa’s place was perfect for us!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have gotten to stay in a number of AirBnBs over the last year. This has definitely been one of the best. I highly recommend it.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do not let the outside of the building deter you! It looks a little rough on the outside, however once you get inside it is such a cute cozy place. I loved the original sink in the kitchen and the tub was amazing to soak in. We went down for the husker game and it was perfect walking distance to memorial stadium. The little extras made it feel such at home. Like the board games and little question cards. Loved how they had a fan in the bedroom as we can not sleep without the fan noise. They also had earplugs next to the bed. My only complaint being a woman is I would have loved to have had a full length mirror. Also wish they could make the parking spot number a little more visible as you have to park sideways. Would definitely stay again when we come back for another game."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,comfortable bed
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is in a great location. It is a nice size with a great view.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great apartment to stay overnight in Lincoln in front of the capitol hill equipped with everything you need for a truly comfortable stay. Very detailed check-in and check-out instructions and Lisa is very kind. But I recommend self check-in with the light because if one arrives late it's not easy to identify the box with the keys.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very quiet inside apartment. It was a good choice!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to walk to Memorial Stadium. Parking was easy but the spaces could be marked a bit better. The actual apartment was clean and so cute!! Perfectly decorated with excellent WiFi for working. Laundry facilities in the basement. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great downtown location. Lots of stairs, good view. Place needs a little work from host but I would stay again.
I loved the place but host needs to replace AC in bedroom and address what looks like mold in bathroom around window. We got stuffy heads (mold sickness) whenever we were inside unit. Also small things like door handles were loose on a couple of doors.
With a little work this place will be amazing and I’m counting on host addressing issues as they said they would and I would love to stay again.
Other than the cons listed above the place was awesome, great views, kitchen was setup for cooking, host communicated well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lisa and her husband were extremely helpful and responsive when I had a question. The place was adorable and comfortable. It was a wonderful stay! Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Super cute place! It was great for the we were there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for two nights. It was the most affordable airbnb in the area, and the host responded to my messages very quickly. Nice and clean place, high up so lots of privacy even with the windows open."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was small but nice enough for the two nights I stayed. The area itself did not feel the safest, especially at night, and I would not have wanted to stay there by myself."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The place was clean and had everything we needed. Only draw back was the AC unit in the bedroom was not enough to combat the summer temps.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was beautiful. The location was ok. It was nice to be that close to the capital, but other than that, there is little in that area. If you have a car, then it is no problem, but I was on foot, and I was pretty far from a lot of things."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Lisa's apartment was lovely! Light, clean charmingly decorated, super comfy bed, well set-up kitchen. It had everything I needed, & lots of storage space (a huge walk-in closet). Very quiet too.Coin-operated washing machine in building's basement--I didn't use it.
Lisa is an exceptionally kind, helpful and responsive host--she even left a Pilates mat out for me :) And all instructions were very clear.
One caveat: If you are a more ""vulnerable"" traveller (I was a lone-travelling woman, no car), the neighbourhood may not be the most convenient. I needed to walk everywhere, and didn't always feel comfortable; it was quite a walk to Haymarket (groceries, restaurants, cafes, bars) but an easy walk to UNL campus, & The Mill cafe is only a 12-min. walk--but again, through not-the-most-salubrious neighbourhood. The building is not the most salubrious either--take Lisa's advice and use the external stairs to take you direct to the apt.
But the apartment was delightful. Lisa, a perfect host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything that was described was spot on. It was perfect for us. Thank you for a great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Clear instructions and everything was as described. Would stay again next time we’re in town. Thanks!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! We only stayed for one night. Lots of charm.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an adorable little place right across from the capitol. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is super cute, great light and the bed was really comfortable! We were a little confused on parking, but Lisa was very communicative and answered all of my questions right away. I struggled to get the lockbox closed for the keys but again, she helped me with that. Really like this place and would stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa's apartment is located just across the street from the capitol, and only a short walk to restaurants for dinner, and a coffee house/diner for breakfast. Everything in the apartment was in perfect order: clean new linens, super comfortable mattress, kitchen supplies (coffee, coffee maker, dishes and glassware, utensils, etc.). The furnishings were inviting, comfortable, and somehow both new and vintage...just perfect! Thanks, Lisa, for being such a great host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was a nice cozy place to stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa’s apartment was perfect for a weekend wedding get-away! We enjoyed time with our friends and family that still live in NE. It was close to the downtown life. Walkable to local restaurants and bars. Quaint and quiet building located next to the state capitol. We LOVED the NE sunsets!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I stopped in Lincoln during a cross-country road trip and found Lisa’s place very clean and comfortable. The building itself was a bit dated but it reminded me of my studio apartment days so no worries there! Lisa was very proactive in explaining how to check in to the space. It was also fun to have the state capitol building practically in the backyard. Thanks for an easy stay!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place! The building is older but I was genuinely surprised with how clean and neat the room was!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here. Very charming little historical apartment. The unit is thoughtfully restored, keeping the 1950s kitchen and bathroom. The bedroom was very relaxing. The furniture and decor add a nice touch. Perfect for anyone that craves stylish comfort on the road."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was clean super nice. Close to the PBA and a quiet place to stay! My favorite part was the super deep amazing bath tub! It was absolutely perfect for my daughter and myself. Lisa was great to communicate with and was quick to answer all of my questions. Will definitely stay there again if I find myself in Lincoln.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredibly impressed with this listing! First off, the location was perfect. Views were nice, and it was walking distance to downtown, which is why we were there. The space itself was very modern, clean, and cute. Great vibe. Even fun little (drinking) games. Perfect for a couple or small group as there’s an air mattress provided if needed. The complex was super quiet, we didn’t see anyone at all, which is great in my book. Everything we needed was provided. The bed was super comfy, too. Lisa was easy to get ahold of and super communicative and accommodating, as we did have the option to check in early and did a late checkout. Definitely 100% recommend staying here and will likely take advantage of this listing again for more concerts in the future!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best spot if you want to explore Lincoln. You are right next door to the Nebraska State Capital and a short distance away from both UNL and the famous Haymarket District with shops, resturants, and bars. Highly recommend!!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Lisa gave clear checkin instructions with photos with early checkin available. Location was within easy walking distance to food and entertainment. Place was clean and cozy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place! The reserved parking spot was nice. Lisa gave clear instructions for entering, which was very helpful. We were in Lincoln for a few days and it worked great for us."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Lisa's place! It was clean, cozy, and chic. Lisa made check-in so easy and seamless, anticipating questions before we even asked them. We definitely would book again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was so clean and it had everything I needed for duration of my stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Cute, affordable, clean, and well-appointed fourth-floor apartment that was way more comfortable than I expected given the price point. All of the facilities worked, and the furniture was attractive and comfortable if you like mid-century modern looks and firm cushions and mattresses. Lisa was super communicative and helpful; made everything easy with checking in and out. Will definitely stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is a great host. She responded to my questions very fast. Her apartment is beautiful and very clean with great details. If you don’t mind climbing 4 floors this is the right place to stay in Lincoln. Great location with parking.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was neat and comfortable and we had a great time!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was amazing. The place and the view was nice.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great, relaxing stay. Great view from the apartment."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and nice space.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa was very responsive. The listing was accurate. Lisa provided multiple photos regarding parking and lockbox. It was helpful and made for a smooth check in process. The neighborhood was great and close enough to campus, bars, restaurants and coffee shops. The bed was super comfy and the place was clean. I would recommend Lisa's place."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute little space to stay in. I enjoyed being near the capitol building, and the views were nice out the window. The decor was cute and it had everything I needed. This was my second stay here and will consider it if I ever come back to town!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place is perfect! Exactly as pictured. Bed is comfortable and water temperature is great. Parking is easy and check in directions are super clear. Location is close to a lot of places. I would recommend!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little appartment easy check in would stay again
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. Host communication was great.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay for game day in lincoln! walk was under 30 mins to the stadium & got to see lots of downtown.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was absolutely charming! It has nice retro furnishings and was extremely clean. My favorites were kitchen sink, deep bathtub, and built in ironing board. Since it is in an older building the walls are thick and I didn’t hear anything. It was right across from the capitol and in a beautiful neighborhood. Oh, the room spray in the bedroom smelled fantastic! When I come back to Lincoln, I’ll definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So convenient to downtown and the decor is darling.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute spot on the 4th floor of an apartment building. It had a nice location. The setup and decorations were very cute. It had everything you would need for a stay except for a washer and dryer. It was quiet and clean and I didn’t have any issues during me stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa was great to work with and super responsive and proactive with communication. The listing was just as shown and very clean. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in Lincoln and less than a mile walk to the downtown area!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Pristine clean. Great location.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute stay! Apt life and the top floor! Well stocked, very comfortable.
Lisa is a great host, easy to talk with good directions."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, had some safety issues out first night. The building got the locks changed quickly and easily on their own accord. No major problems"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and nice space
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Clean, well-furnished, affordable condo a block from the capitol building and close to the rest of downtown. The unit was clean and well furnished. The kitchen has everything you need. Lisa is very communicative, kind, and helpful host to her guests."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS. I learned the hard way.
We loved the interior layout of the Airbnb, but didn't realize that there was only a small window air conditioner for the entire space. It's the heat of summer, so the space was warmer than we were comfortable with.
We ended up getting a hotel room instead, because it was uncomfortably warm, and we were unsettled by the building itself. There are several flights of stairs and you have two options - interior (which is as unsettling as other reviews suggest) or the fire escape. I've recently hurt my knee and didn't realize what we were signing up for lol
I'm terrified of heights, and the ""back staircase"" was a contributing factor in our decision to not remain at the Airbnb. I didn't see anything in the listing about it, but it's on me for not reading through all of the reviews beforehand. There are also a few other reviews, regarding parking, host communication, and rodents that freaked us out."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The check-in instruction was clear, and the parking was convenient, just in front of the outside stairs. The communication with Lisa was easy, and I got quick responses.
The unit is very clean and cozy, but I developed severe contact rashes/ itchy from the comforter each time I touched it. Since it was hot and so we didn’t need it anyway. The building is old and smelly; hence, we mostly used outside stairs which was the most scary part for my son.
When we stayed in Lincoln, the weather was hot (over 100) even at night and humid (~ 60%), there was only one small window AC in the bedroom which could barely cool down the bedroom, and so the living room was hot all day long. Lisa offered to bring another window AC, but due to our crazy schedule, I didn’t see that message until the end of our stay, which was a bummer. If you are a hot intolerance person, you may want to give Lisa a heads up before you arrive."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little spot in Lincoln. Would stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy place - very comfortable bed. All of downtown is walkable from this location, and the capital building is literally next door - very impressive building!
Our only criticism is that the hallway is a bit dark and smells of cigarettes, but once inside you won't notice. 4th floor walkup from the outside is not for those afraid of heights!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place on the inside. Great access to downtown and easily walkable. I enjoyed visiting the capital and moseying around!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and food within strolling distance (breakfast at Cultiva was stupendous). Really loved this place. Be aware it does have just a window air in the bedroom 👍🏽🧡
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A really beautiful little space to stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! The location was great and the area was super walkable. There was a sign in the hallways that the building only became a non smoking building on June 1, 2022. The hallways did have a smokey smell that might be a problem for those with severe asthma or allergies but the apartment itself did not have a smokey smell at all. Overall, I would stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice condo in a great location. When you walk out of the front of the building, you are staring at the beautiful capital building and its nice lawn/gardens. The location is great for walkability, as others have pointed to. Lisa has provided all necessary accommodations, and the communication was clear and prompt. The apartment has everything you could need, and some additional nice touches (board games, nice cookware, nice furniture).
The downsides: The building itself has slight issues, and seems to be older with primarily student/young residents. It has a variety of smells throughout and does not feel very clean. Smokes smells do permeate into the condo. With young folks residing here, conversations/music persist through the night and walls are thin. There are a lot of people coming and going late into the evening, which did make me feel slightly uncomfortable."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night on a cross-country roadtrip and this was a great location for exploring Lincoln. It is right across the street from the capitol, which seems like the tallest thing in the state so it makes navigation very easy. Near bike trails, coffee shops, restaurants etc. Lisa was very communicative to make the whole process easy.
To address some of the negative comments I saw in other reviews: Parking is super simple, just look at the photos Lisa sends you. Depending on how you get into the lot it's the first spot that you see. Yes it's oriented differently than some of the other spots, but hopefully you can figure it out anyway. There also seems to be plenty of street parking.
The exterior stairs felt super safe to me. I hauled all my luggage up and down plus my bike and it was fine. If you're not used to metal exterior stairs, you can go around and use the front door. If you don't want to do four flights of stairs at all, you probably need to look elsewhere.
Some of the reviews called the unit ""run down"", which is not true at all. It's not new construction, probably from the 1920s, but the unit is well kept, nicely appointed, and 10% functional."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to downtown Lincoln, very accesible to where you’d like to be if it’s your first time in Nebraska. The space is perfect for two people. Bed is comfortable, open space, great lighting and nice view of the State Capitol. Decent size kitchen with everything you need for cooking. There are games for inviting guest over. Bathroom has beautiful sunlight coming through in the morning. Comfortable bed with enough space. Closet is HUGE, has a lot of room for anything. Living, dinning area are super cozy and comfortable to enjoy.
Super cute space! I recommend it."
2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Once you get inside the apartment it’s decent it’s actually really cute. I would say cleanliness is mediocre just because there’s nothing you can do to a building like that to make it 100% clean. I almost decided it would be safer to sleep in my car when I pulled up and walked in to a smell that I can’t even describe. It is definitely the most disgusting apartment complex I’ve been in and it comes to an Airbnb. Personally I wouldn’t pay a dollar to stay there it was so disgusting walking to the apartment itself that I felt like I needed to shower four times. Not to mention the next-door neighbors were up all night long smoking some type of drugs. I think meth. Be careful. if u need to stay there , bring mace"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay for 2 people in a cozy downtown apartment! We loved how close it was to downtown with various dining options. You will have to go up 4 flights of stairs to get to the apartment.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A real comfortable home base for a visit to Lincoln. It has some wonderful old-fashioned touches like a huge closet and an ironing board that folds up into its own wall cabinet (anybody else remember those?), but the kitchen and bathroom are totally updated. There was nothing I needed that wasn't there. Photos are accurate. Within 48 hours, the Lincoln temp ranged from 40s to 90s and the apartment temperature was always comfortable. Do be aware that the washer isn't in the unit."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A clean and comfortable place. Every time I thought to myself that I needed something (a light right here, a throw blanket, a cup of coffee), it was there. Plus there were some great old-fashioned touches like a huge closet and an ironing board that folds out of a wall cabinet. (Anybody else remember those?) I was visiting friends and family in Lincoln, but the apartment would be good as a place to work too--good table and wifi. Note that the washer was not in the unit (I didn't need it, but you might)."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute historic apartment right across from the state capitol building that is really worth seeing. Do notice that the apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator (as described by the host). Clean and well furnished.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am happy to have booked the Capital Condo. Nice to be centrally located in Lincoln, and it was a good value for the space/features.
A word of warning though, you may get too hot up there (it's on the 4th floor) in the summer months, because there is only one A/C unit, which is located in the bedroom. I had trouble getting it to cool the whole place when it was 90 degrees out."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice apartment surrounding the capitol. Easy access to downtown and the college campus!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a super cute and cozy apartment on the top floor. GREAT view of the sunrise and of the Nebraska State Capitol. Close to downtown and the university. We really enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Lincoln!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Building is close to downtown and within walking distance of several restaurants. The apartment is clean, neat and well decorated. Bed is comfortable. Building reminded us of student housing , which it probably is (food smells in hallways, some noise) but the apartment is adult living. Lots of exercise climbing stairs to the fourth floor unit."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is in a great location in Lincoln, close to the capitol and about a 2-5 min drive to downtown. the pictures are all accurate ad we loved the character, personal touches, and the bed was very comfy! (it's a firm bed and I loved it) Lisa was very thorough in the check in and out process, making it very easy to get in. It is a walk up a few floors to the apartment, which we didn't mind. We would stay here again anytime!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! Located within walking distance of O Street bars and restaurants and still very close to the Haymarket and Railyard where it's a very quick drive. The unit is very clean and cozy. It can be a bit noisy since it's an old building and there's a heavy exterior door that will slam. Most people slowly close it though. Bed is very firm which was nice.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very pretty well appointed apartment. Walking distance to many restaurants.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our first Airbnb experience and it went smoothly! Lisa provided clear check in/checkout instructions as well as sent pictures to simplify the process/eliminate any questions. Lisa responded very quickly anytime we reached out. Downtown activities are within walking distance from the apartment.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This places is in the center of it all. Right across the street from the capital building and it has great parking. You can walk to UNL and food options. I would stay here again. The decor and set up fits exactly what the description offers. I'll be back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable! Close to everything. Check in was super easy. Awesome communication. Would definitely stay again
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved it.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is a great host and wants to make sure you enjoy your stay. She was very accommodating and communicated with us through the entire stay. Great location and a quick walk to the Haymarket. Place was very cute and cozy. Great value as well!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable accommodation at a convenient location.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and comfortable place. Close to downtown, this very retro apt is clean and relaxing. It’s on a fourth floor with no elevator, so plan on lots of stairs. But it’s worth it."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is super clean inside and an amazing value!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time staying at Lisa's! The place was super cute and had everything we needed. Slept great in the comfy bed. Great location. Would absolutely recommend.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place right across the street from the Capital. Close to lots of food/drinks.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa's place was cute and fun and a great location. Her games were great and the place felt so cozy. The sun coming in the space was quite lovely! I would come again for sure! Thanks, Lisa!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa's place is lovely! Agree with other reviews - don't let the building itself tell the story. Her place is clean and quaint. Nice linens and comfortable bed. Great location and price.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really liked the minimal/retro decor in this place. It was just what I needed on this trip!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, natural environment with a good choice of furniture. Kitchen is small but does the job and the windows provide a great view"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The building itself isn’t the nicest, but the unit was spotless and aesthetic. The unit had everything we needed. We enjoyed our one-night stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Condo, warm and cozy and Lisa is very helpful and amazing with directions. Would definitely rent again for future trips to Lincoln, NE."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay. Board games and close to the down town area. Quick communication.Truly enjoyed are stay. Apartment is a little loud in the wind but fine other than that.
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I was looking for a place to put my head down during a road trip, but especially a place to do a little laundry.
I am not faulting anything for the stairs, I just missed the information, but…
The lock box is precariously hanging from a ladder over the 35 foot drop to the ground. The stairs are transparent, so anyone with a fear of heights beware! And, finally, there was no washer and dryer. I am sure there was a facility somewhere on site, but I don’t think that is what anyone is looking for when the ad says the unit has a w/d. Also, we had to use the photo of the parking spot to figure out the spot because the painting was so faded. If it were not for all the photos the host sent, we would have been lost. I was also unsure if I needed the parking pass in my car. I assumed so, so add an extra run up and down the stairs to put the pass in the car and to put the pass back in the apartment when leaving. One quick fix would be to put the lockbox at the bottom of the stairs instead of the top. Finally, a $64 room cost me over $120. I am new to Airbnb, but this is ridiculous. Am I paying resort fees or something? Hiding extra profit in “cleaning” is bad faith, like a $5 eBay auction with $30 shipping."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space is great! And in an awesome location! I had such a nice time here in Lincoln. The only downside was that I was only there for one night! If I ever swing back through again you know for sure that I’ll be wanting to stay here :)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a very smooth and comfortable stay in Lincoln. Would stay at Lisa’s again!
Lynn"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was the perfect little stop in downtown Lincoln - very walkable, tidy, bright, and comfortable. We'll likely be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great for me!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place in a great location!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cute little condo was perfect for an overnight getaway for my husband and I. It is decorated mid-century, had many thoughtful touches, the bed was comfortable, and the entire condo was very clean. Lisa does a great job of communicating and even sent pictures ahead of time to make check-in a breeze. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the building, hallways, and stairs to get to the top floor. We recommend the outside stairs at the back of the building during nice weather since the condo is very near the top landing. This is a great value!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice little apartment. It's clean and walking distance to downtown.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The good: Lisa’s home was beautifully laid out and had just what we needed for our short stay. The instructions were clear, and she was fast to communicate with us when we needed assistance. No complaints.
The not so good: This isn’t on the host at all- it’s more my lack of foresight in my planning (which is why I still gave 5 stars). The apartment is on the fourth floor as is noted in the description (with no elevator)- and we were traveling cross country with a toddler- so not only did we have a few bags and things to bring in, but it was really cold with 4 flights of stairs to climb, plus fumbling in the dark over the lock box, a door that swings toward you to open, and a mostly student-occupied building which made the check in process an overwhelming one. I think if I was traveling alone or with one other person it would be fine, but this mama was at the end of her rope carrying a fussy toddler up a zillion stairs with heavy bags. We ended up leaving a lot of what we had originally planned to bring in in the car because of the stairs situation. Again, this isn’t on the host- the description was accurate. This was just my experience. I wouldn’t suggest it if you have a baby or toddler- or if you’re not a light packer, like me.
Would be happy to come back all alone though! Haha!"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute apartment! Comfortable bed, nice style. Helps to think of this like a college apartment, because the place itself is super cute and clean, but the building where it is located definitely leaves something to be desired. The hallways are very dirty and smell like smoke and marijuana. I couldn’t smell that from within the apartment though (and I am super sensitive). Again, it was comfortable and cute once inside and quite comfortable! It’s not surrounded by downtown or a really cute neighborhood, but definitely able to walk to restaurants."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute space and very central location. Love the vintage feel!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great Airbnb if you are needing a place in Lincoln! Not bad Ubering downtown and easy for Husker game day! Lisa has great communication when I had a question and a great host! The place was spotless when we arrived and lived up to the photos!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice little AirBnB in a apartment complex. Location is great for anything downtown.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great air bnb for a weekend in Lincoln! Walking distance to downtown and Memorial Stadium.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as advertised!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a really cute condo and a step back in time. I’m pretty sure my mom lived in an apartment like this when she attended Lincoln School of Commerce in the late 40’s.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an adorable, well-cared for and well-designed 1 bedroom condo with an amazing view of the state capitol building and very convenient to downtown / UNL city campus."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean and enjoyable, as depicted in the photos. However, the apartments around this Air BnB is another thing. Each floor smelled strongly of smoke, cannabis, and urine. Once we were inside our rental, we didn’t smell any of that, so kudos to the owners. However, if you’re expecting an apartment situation similar to what you’re seeing in the photos, be prepared for something else."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. Building reminds me of my first apartment in college, so be open minded and if you have mobility issues for stairs it’s not the unit for you. Bed and pillows were also comfortable. Uber to pinnacle bank arena was $7, very close to where you need to be!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I HIGHLY recommend Lisa’s apartment. She was very communicative and also flexible. I had to change my stay several times due to my work schedule and she accommodated wonderfully! Her explanation of check-in was so detailed and we had no problem. Also the internet is fast, rooms are spacious and very clean. I would definitely come back and stay at her apartment whenever I stay in Lincoln!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Apartment was perfect for a longer stay. Full kitchen and lots of space. Excellent communication with host.

Overall cozy and comfortable!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's apartment is great! The kitchen works well, and the place is well air conditioned. The comments about the stairs are real—there are a lot of them—but it's manageable. Lisa was extremely good at communicating and arranged for me to have an early check-in, which was very kind. I definitely recommend it!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location - within walking distance to downtown Lincoln.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Be prepared to walk through an unattractive hallway all the way to the 4th floor.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa was absolutely wonderful to deal with. She was quick to respond and very helpful. The unit is clean and quiet, and the location is awesome. Even though it was in the 90s when I arrived the room was cool and comfortable."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Lisa puts great effort into the details in this beautiful apartment.

She was great with communication, the apartment was clean and smelled fresh, the decor was beautiful, the bed was comfortable... I could just keep going on about this place. Thank you Lisa!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very clean and adorable! The location was great, just beside the Capital building!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place for a short stay. Lisa communicates promptly and accurately.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Capitol Condo! Lisa’s space is very clean, charming, and tastefully decorated. It’s close to downtown and the UNL campus. In summertime, it’s easy to bring a bike and use that to get most anywhere in town, and access to Lincoln’s bike paths is close by. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa’s place was great. We were just in town for 1 night- needing a place to rest on a cross country road trip and Lisa’s place was perfect! Communication getting in was thorough, the apt was clean, and had everything we needed. Definitely recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful on the inside.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa was very specific with her instructions which made check-in and check-out a breeze. Her place was quiet and cozy and lovely.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful stay in a great location near the capital! I was able to bike for most of the trip and came back to a cozy and clean apartment.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice unit. Clean with a very comfy bed.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do not hesitate to book this apartment. Well-decorated, quiet, modern space directly across the street from Lincoln's Capitol building (walk inside the Capitol for a look!). Most hot spots & restaurants are a fast 5 minute drive or easy-to-walk 20 minutes away. Lisa's communication and trouble-shooting were top notch. Thanks so much for hosting us!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was perfect for the night. Convenient location! Would stay again!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Easy check-in and good communication!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Condo was warm and charming with a fun mid century vibe. Close to downtown for restaurants, and night life. Had everything we needed, and Lisa was quick to communicate when we had a question. If we are ever back in the area we’d definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Located in a pretty well traveled part of town, but in a good way. The parking area is a bit confusing, but luckily there was a gentlemen in the lot who informed us parking in the exactly right spot wasn't a big deal either way. My wife and I stayed here for a night and had to bring bikes up to the room with us...not ideal as the room is on the top floor and there is only stair access, but the host was gracious enough to let me know about this ahead of time which made me happy. The building is a bit older and with that comes the smells of an older building. Once you're in for a bit, you get used to it and overall, it's pretty good value as far and my wife and I were concerned."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay was very clean and very pretty. Super convenient location to visit the capital. Had a great weekend trip.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The apartment itself is quiet and quaint right by city hall. Good price for a quick nights stay. The host was very communicative and provided excellent information for a smooth check in.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was amazing, and well-stocked! Lisa thought of everything! I was very impressed. The location was fantastic as well!
Note to future guests: if you're afraid of heights, use the front entrance!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Okay, so this was my first time using Airbnb and my goodness, this was a great first stay. I want to point out mainly the communication. Lisa provided the easiest check in with directions, photos for reference and much more. The place was so comfortable, and very clean. The bed.. omg the bed is so comfortable. The tub is deep so you can actually have a relaxing bath. The entire building is quiet.. as well as the area. No issues ❤️"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So nice we stayed here twice! We used the condo as a landing pad on our way out West, and on our way back. Great location, nice place. Would definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at this apartment. I was in Lincoln for a week-long workshop, and I loved having this little oasis to retreat to. It was comfortable, clean and quiet, and just as adorable as in the pictures. The kitchen was well equipped, too. Other reviewers aren't kidding about the rest of the building. The halls are dingy and it looks a bit run-down. That said, I never felt unsafe, and the contrast between the sad halls and the perfectly decorated apartment was sort of entertaining to me. I would stay there again if I'm in Lincoln again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was awesome and in a great location
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute place! Don't let the building out outside hallways fool you Lisa's place is very cozy and well decorated. I would recommend Lisa's place if you're in Lincoln.
,,,Everything was fine until we came back to the room after enjoying a night out. It was warm when we left so we turned the window ac to the lowest setting and it never cooled down! Could not sleep in that heat! Definitely would like a refund!
,,,"The halls are filled with cigarette smoke. This location is convenient for downtown, but there are a lot of homeless people around and sketchy people who live in the building. No elevator. Nice decor.
Parking issues: My car was confused with another car and got towed. So I only stayed one night.
Lisa was not helpful about the tow situation and only reimbursed for half of the tow, although it was her property managements mix up.
I would Not recommend staying here but especially if you have kids. Not a kid friendly place."
,,,"Upon moving into this place I started hearing noises, scratching and the sounds of fur rubbing against the walls. She has a piece of paper and painters tape seperating the outside from the inside. I go to the window unit and saw a rodents eye looking back at me, as it was scratching up against the paper. I kindly notified the host and she apologized and stated she understood and she recommended me to cancel and she will give me a full refund and have her husband take a look later. I canceled and Lisa is now playing Casper, the unfriendly deceiving ghost. The place was quaint though. I advise you to stay if you like quaint spaces, small tv and the chance rodent eye and friends may join you in your stay."
