2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a few days to visit Haley and the greater Sun Valley area. Such an amazing and beautiful location with friendly people.
The cabin was very close to the bike path, which we rode to Ketchum, was part of our reason for choosing the cabin. It was also easy to walk to downtown Haley for a great couple of dinners at CT‚Äôs.
Marie was super communicative and left us clear instructions for both checking in and checking out. She also offered some great suggestions for activities and restaurants."

Great host"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Took a friend for a weekend get away from our own stressful lives... A wonderfully peaceful place to relax outside in the sunshine! It's a very quaint little cabin in a cute little town. The mountains in the are a gorgeous backdrop from the backyard, which my dogs and us humans enjoyed thoroughly. A walking/biking trail is just on the other side of the yard which was very convenient. I highly recommend this cabin."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second time staying here. Fantastic little cabin that has everything one would need for a week in the snow. Next time I‚Äôd love to bring my dog. The location is so quiet, reminded me how noisy cities can be."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,had a nice weekend
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place, on a fabulous lot.
To be totally honest, when I first walked in I thought‚Ä¶‚Äùwell, I can make this work, a little spartan but it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. The place grew on me though! I will say there isn‚Äôt much in the kitchen. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, sugar. A couple of pans, a couple of pots. I was there b/c our house is not livable at the moment, but because our place is in the same town I was able to bring my own water cooker (there‚Äôs an electric coffee maker but it‚Äôs too big for 1 person who has 1 cup of coffee a day!) and a few other things (foil, Saran etc) to make it work just fine.
Over time, I really grew to love the place. It is perfect for one or two people, it‚Äôs in a great location, it is cozy. It is not fancy for sure, but with 2 dogs fancy wouldn‚Äôt do anyway!
I truly enjoyed my stay! Marie was easy to communicate with, and when I needed something she was quick to respond.
A gate in the back fence would be nice to have since the property backs up to a park."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our favorite Airbnb, hands down! We look forward to each visit, and there have been many to date. If you're a hiker, you'll love the surroundings and the access to trails. We just can't say enough good things about Marie and her get-away. It's perfect for us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my favorite place to stay! Marie is the perfect host, the house is cute, the kitchen well stocked and the yard and patio is so peaceful with amazing views! The bikes are perfect for a stroll around town. The perfect getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and found it more than we expected. Location was ideal for our visit to Trailing of the Sheep Festival.

Bikes were in great condition and even had helmets to go with them. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our most favorite house we've stayed in ever! The house had everything we needed and our dog loved the backyard - so spacious and private! The park behind the house had a beautiful walking trail close by that we enjoyed daily. Marie left us a kind welcome note and treats for our doggy - best host ever! Thank you Marie for sharing your beautiful home with us! I was crying cartoon tears not wanting to leave this beautiful house! ;)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable cabin in a great location close to shopping and restaurants and right off the bike path. LOVED it!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay, just what we needed. Perfect for what we were doing in the area of Hailey. There was a walking path very close to the house and a hug beautiful fenced in back yard. The house was clean and as soon as you walked in you felt like you were at home. If I needed to ask Marie anything she was very quick to respond and answered all my questions. We will be back hopefully next trip to Idaho!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I love this cabin - and so does our dog! It‚Äôs a great location in Hailey and the yard is a wonderful place to pass the time. We‚Äôre planning to stay again soon!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay! The space was perfect for us and gave us a spot to regroup and rest between activities. We loved that we could easily walk around Hailey and seeing a herd of elk out the windows was a bonus!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I‚Äôve stayed here before and just love it. The location is handy to restaurants and shopping, as well as outdoor activities. The cabin is cozy, clean and has all you need, and her yard is perfect for my dog. Marie is a lively and gracious hostess."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love staying at Marie's cabin. It's peaceful and cozy. Our dogs enjoy the large fenced yard, and we enjoy watching the elk."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Marie‚Äôs cabin was the perfect peaceful getaway. Parking was 10 steps from the door. Once inside, the layout and amenities made for a perfect place to come back to after a day of skiing. The place was always warm, quite, great views, plenty of hot water, and a nice little basement to wash your clothes and wax your skis. Very enjoyable stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin feels very private while also just being a few minutes from shops and restaurants. Beautiful area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is right on the edge of Hailey, so you get deer and elk walking behind the house and up on the hills, but you're only a few blocks from the main drag. It's a short walk from the multi-use trail that's great for dog-walking and also for Nordic skiing (groomed for classic and skate). The cabin is comfortable and plenty big enough for two adults and two kids. The beds are particularly nice.
Marie was easy to contact and very helpful. We hope we can stay there again soon!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I just returned from an amazing 2 weeks spent in this delightful cabin, surrounded, the entire time by elk and deer. The perfect neighbors! This is my second year and once again, I cannot sing praises high enough for the owners and the manner in which they manage the property. They run a very tight and tidy ship! I always leave feeling inspired for a similar and more easeful/simple way of living. The cabin is ideally situated within minutes of the Quigley Farms Nordic Trails, the Wood River Trail for dog walking and Atkinson‚Äôs market for one their hot and delicious soups for an apres ski lunch. The drive to Ketchum is an easy one if you are looking for more skiing, whether on the slopes or on one of the many, perfectly groomed nordic trails managed by the BCRD/Sun Valley Resort. Plan ahead to secure your reservation!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying at this location was amazing and beautiful surrounding. lots of access to wildlife.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was in love with Marie‚Äôs cabin from the minute we walked in the door and am already thinking about when we can return. The place is very clean and charming with a great bed.
The location is great, you are in the middle of things but out of the bustle. We went hiking and cross county skiing right out the door without getting in the car, and if we needed something at the store, it was a quick walk.
I cannot express how much we enjoyed our stay and recommend staying here!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay over the holidays at Marie's place in Hailey. Great location , walkable to town. Woke up to elk in the field every morning. Perfect location for our fur babies. Cabin had all the necessay amenitites. Cannot wait to come back!
Felt like a home away from home."

2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice stay at Marie‚Äôs place with our two dogs. The location is great ‚Äî quiet and private yet easy walking distance to downtown Hailey. The space is pretty simple, which is part of the charm. We stayed during single digit temperatures at night and found it hard to keep the cabin cozy; the two small space heaters couldn‚Äôt quite keep up. Each morning there was a quarter-inch of ice built up on the inside of the front door sweep and the door was frozen shut. Otherwise, it was a good spot ‚Äî clean, wonderful yard, and good access to the outdoors."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We‚Äôve stayed here several times, and it‚Äôs always amazing. Marie is super helpful and the place has everything you need, in a beautiful location."

The property is the perfect place for our pup and a great place to bask in the sun and soak up the surrounding views. And Marie is just terrific!! We can't wait to get back"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy and comfortable cabin with all the amenities you might need! Loved the porch and also the fire pit! A special perk was the two bikes to ride during the beautiful fall weather!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Marie‚Äôs cabin so much, we won‚Äôt stay anywhere else. If you‚Äôre looking for a place where you need some quiet and for all your stress to melt away. This is the place. You can walk or bike to downtown Hailey and Ketchum/Sun Valley is just 12-15 minutes away. We personally come up for all the thrift shops which are amazing.
Marie is so easy to work with. She really wants you to enjoy your stay!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a great place to stay. Very close to the center of Hailey but very private. I have stayed there before and have already booked my next stay. The cabin is perfect for a couple of people and offers a great yard if you have a dog. The cabin is small but very cozy, and offers everything you need for your stay. Marie, the host, is very responsive to questions or needs, and is a lovely person."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The pictures don‚Äôt do justice to this charming spot. It actually took my breath away. Words can‚Äôt express how much I loved this place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Marie's cabin was an ideal place to call home for our stay in the valley. It was extremely private and well-appointed: everything you need is provided. The backyard was lovely and had a great view.
Would book again in a heartbeat."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Marie‚Äôs cabin. Great location and an amazing yard. Our dog Theo had the time of his life. Hailey itself was the perfect home location and we‚Äôll absolutely book again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Setting was perfect for our dogs. The yard is immense, fully fenced and shaded. There is quick access to a park next door and neighborhood trials. The indoors is clean and comfortable. The house stayed cool even w/o ac during the hot weather. The outdoor table was great for meals. The kitchen had plenty of tools and supplies. We were so busy we didn't use the tv. We went to Tundra and Power House for dinners and ate-in couple of times. Hiked to Baker Lake.
We had a fabulous long weekend. Host is quick to respond. We would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to explore Hailey via walking and biking (bikes are provided by Marie). Although the temperature was hot, the cabin stayed cool because of the low nighttime temperatures and the surrounding trees. Hiking trails are nearby and walking the neighborhood was enjoyable. We look forward to returning."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, big yard and great location!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin with everything we needed for a quiet getaway.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place to stay! Definitely coming back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin. The yard is huge and backs up to a new park, which my dog loved! And I loved spending sunny days in the hammock and riding one of the bikes around town."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin! Our pups loved the backyard, and the location was perfect. We would definitely stay here again"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin does not disappoint in any way. It was clean, adorable, AWESOME fenced back yard and anything I could have needed. The location was close to hiking trails, town and overall just perfect. I am picky about bedding and I can say it was a near perfect sleep. The cabin has great lighting filtering in the morning, so it felt peaceful. I am a frequent visitor to Hailey, and I have now found my ""go-to"" cabin!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a cozy cabin at the end of a street. It has a nice yard. Kitchen is well stocked

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our third stay here was better than ever. We love this Hailey getaway!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is fantastic, and Marie was a wonderfully communicative host! The cabin was clean and had everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect for enjoying Hailey by just walking around, and close to incredible trail running too! The firepit with the view and the beautiful yard made for relaxing evenings. I enjoyed sitting out in the adirondack chair, and my senior dogs enjoyed just laying in the sun in the yard and watching a few passers-by in the park beyond the fence. For me traveling with just my two dogs, I felt I was in a very safe space. We hope to visit again some day! Thank you!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful cozy cabin! Marie was great in making us feel at home. Great restaurants at walking distance. The yard was spacious and absolutely perfect for our furry friends.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This cabin is charming, cozy, well equipped and great if you have a dog. It has a large yard that was snow covered when I got there but open, green grass by the time I left. On the edge of town, the area around it is open but you‚Äôre just blocks from downtown Hailey. Great location. Already booked it again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This quiet cabin exceeded our expectations. We stayed here for 4 nights in February during brutally cold weather and were so cozy and warm. The super-clean cabin has a really well-stocked kitchen and bathroom, comfortable bedding, and there were special touches added because we traveled with our 4-legged friend (cookies and pup bowls were awaiting our dog upon arrival). We loved how light and bright the cabin was - lots of windows to take in great hillside views and the snow coming down. When the sun came out we even sat in some chairs outside! Marie's communication was fantastic - simple check-in, great instructions for using the heaters, hints about wildlife (we did see a group of elk in the neighbor's yard on our last day), etc. We'd absolutely stay here again, and are already looking at booking a longer trip in the autumn. You just can't go wrong. :) Thank you, Marie!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We (and our dogs) love Marie's cabin! We've stayed multiple times will stay again. The location in town is quiet but close to restaurants and grocery stores.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the cottage was great. We were close to trail heads and restaurants but still had privacy. Elk visited and bedded down one afternoon just to the east of us. With the fenced yard, we could let our dog out without worrying about him wandering off."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, very cozy! Perfect for a weekend ski trip! Definitely will be booking this for future Sun Valley stays."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful and welcoming location - we will absolutely stay again when in Hailey. Easy access to Quigley Nordic Center. We didn‚Äôt bring our dog, but would have felt welcome doing so. Marie communicated well, but left us to our privacy. Excellent experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I recently returned home from the most delightful 2 week, winter stay at this ideally situated and perfectly appointed home in Hailey. If it weren‚Äôt already booked, I‚Äôd be returning next week! The evening of arrival I was greeted by 2 HUGE elk resting in the field just on the other side of the fence. Yet, the next morning I realized I was a stone‚Äôs throw from the center of town. So, super easy access to everything and everywhere I wanted to be and at the same time, it felt as though I was living in the middle of the wilderness. It couldn‚Äôt possibly get any better. The owner is just as delightful; super quick and easy with communication. I hope to visit again in the summer, but if life gets in the way, I am already making plans for my next winter stay at this sweet little home."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great cozy cabin, wonderful location and very friendly host. We would happily stay here again with our two Golden Retrievers."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly what you need to relax in! I stayed there 3 nights and it was all I needed and wanted. It‚Äôs in the best area, by walking paths, dog parks, nature, and plenty of shopping! I took an incredible bath each night and fell asleep easily with no noise. I can‚Äôt wait to come back in the spring! Marie is amazing!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Marie‚Äôs place is great and she is very responsive. The location is super convenient to downtown Hailey and the bike path and just a short drive to Ketchum/ Sun Valley.

You will love it!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at Marie‚Äôs. Everything was as advertised. Marie was communicative and hosted me on short notice with relative ease. I would stay here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is fabulous cabin. So comfortable and cozy. The attention to every detail covers anything you might need. It certainly becomes your little home away from home immediately!!!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie‚Äôs cabin has a such a special vibe. Calm, peaceful and rejuvenating. For me the minute I see the house I‚Äôm able to leave all my cares behind and just relax. It‚Äôs our home away from home."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was truly our own private Idaho!!! There's nothing better than being in nature surrounded by extraordinary beauty all around us! This cabin is the coziest, and perfect place for us to stay! We were right in the middle of the woods, yet downtown Hailey was a walk away, which we did just that! We were no more than 5 minutes away from our family that we were here to visit. The cabin provided all of the essentials anyone would need, and more! The backyard was absolutely tremendous, and our little Yorkie had such an adventure discovering all of the new found space out there!
I recommend Marie's cozy, comfy, cute cabin for anyone that loves Hailey, Idaho, and just loves being surrounded by breathtaking views!!!
We'll be back next year for sure!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the cabin in May 2021 and had a great time. The location is awesome, and tons of great places to eat are within reasonable walking distance. The cabin itself had just the right amount of space for us and seemed bigger than in the photos. The only issue we had is the construction behind the cabin ‚òπÔ∏è sadly this is everywhere you go in Idaho now, it was a bummer to see and hear construction equipment and workers, even on a Saturday. However, this did not ruin our stay at all, and the rest of the views from the yard are spectacular. We definitely recommend this amazing little cabin."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the pleasure of staying at the cabin during the winter. With the snow gone for the season, we had a great time relaxing in the backyard. The large area was wonderful for our dogs. Marie has been a super host!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Hailey. There are trails a few minutes away from the stay, amazing food around and the property is gorgeous. We'd definitely stay again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here and so did our pups!! Cute spot close to town and Sun Valley/Ketchum. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a getaway! We had 4 guests and two dogs, plenty of space for all of us! Dogs really enjoyed the yard and we felt better knowing it was fenced in, we could relax in the sun while they just romped around. Close to the rail trail and other hiking trails. Nice, quiet location at the end of the street. Much better accommodations than the condo offerings of Ketchum, especially with dogs! Thanks for the great visit, we will definitely book Marie‚Äôs place anytime we are in the area!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is a gem- great quiet location in Hailey and has everything for a stay of any duration. The fenced yard is a huge plus if you have a dog and everything was extremely clean. Perfect
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was SPOTLESS. Great location, easy with a dog. Perfect Hailey getaway."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie's place was actually better than the pictures conveyed! There were crisp new linens and the kitchen and bathroom were really clean. We were able to cook several meals in the kitchen with no problem- plenty of amenities in the kitchen. When we first arrived, the fridge was a bit warm so we turned the temperature down in the fridge and left our food in the coolers until everything was the right temperature. The place was very clean and cozy and had many personal touches. The whole place was quite warm despite the snow on the ground, and the yard was perfect for letting our dogs run around. The house is very close to town but also was further removed from other houses in the neighborhood- this allowed for privacy and made us feel especially safe during the pandemic. It also helped my dog who can get overexcited with seeing a lot of foot traffic walk by. Marie was responsive and great at communicating. Marie also had a drawer with suggestions regarding where to eat around town. I'd highly recommend staying here- the location and amenities were perfect for us! We will be coming again in the future!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Marie‚Äôs place was the PERFECT spot for my dog and I to rest our heads while we were fly fishing in the area. It‚Äôs ideally located within a stone‚Äôs throw of downtown Hailey, and it provided us with some serious peace and quiet. I highly recommend this Airbnb experience!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and homey feeling house/cabin. Appreciated how clean it was. We liked its location- quiet, at the end of a street, on a nice fenced lot (great for dogs), and the elk herd in the field next door was a bonus."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was a perfect home base for our family of 3 plus pooch to stay during our winter Sun Valley vacation. We were walking distance to adorable downtown Hailey and a quick, gorgeous drive to the ski hill. Marie‚Äôs space is thoughtful and the large yard and views close to the Wood River Trail into Ketchum. Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place. Two bedroom that has plenty of room! Kitchen had everything needed but the pots and pans were very old and extremely beat up. Could definitely invest in a new set. Not very costly but would go a long way. The location is approx 15-20 minutes from Sun Valley ski resort. Neighborhood was quiet and right next to a park. The heating situation isn't the best. You have to utilize an electrical ""show fireplace"" which is pretty much useless, and then a plug in mobile heater that did work ok wherever you placed it but the rest of the house was freezing where it wasn't. Should consider improving on that. The house was very clean and the WIFI worked great. TV had only very very basic channels, doesn't cost much to add more of a selection for guests. Or consider Apple TV or a smart TV to stream Netflix. The place is VERY difficult to find at night. No map system will get you to the address so you need to hunt around. Owner could communicate much better. I called her twice at night b/c I was completely lost and I received no call back. Not even the next day to check on what I needed. Overall the place is very nice. I would stay again if I was in the area."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marie's cabin is amazing. We've stayed there a number of times. The location is perfect and we enjoy seeing the elk every year.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is a cute little two room getaway. Very close to the wood river trail, two blocks for cross country skiing or you can drive out of a town a ways and get on there, it was groomed often on the sections close to Hailey. The yard was great for our doggies and the house has no close neighbors so if they barked I didn't have to worry about bothering anyone. The house had all the cookware we needed and other amenities like coffee in the freezer and a few spices, the stove is small but it worked great for the two of us. We like to eat in because of Covid. The store was close by, Atkinson's Market delivered in a snow storm for $10.00. Wow. Instant hot water in the shower. Excellent WIFI too! Marie was very responsive with our questions and helpful. Thanks for a great stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marie's cabin was absolutely perfect! The location, space, and dog-friendly policies helped us to relax and enjoy our time in Hailey, ID. Marie was quick to respond while also providing us the privacy we needed to relax. We will definitely look to stay at the cabin during our next trip to Hailey!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marie's place is a great getaway if you are wanting a quiet place near town and Sun Valley. Our labradoodle especially enjoyed her huge fenced backyard. We will enjoy it when we revisit in the summer!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best stay at the Hailey cabin! It was even more than we expected. The yard was huge, covered in snow which our pup absolutely loved playing in. I can see how in the warmer months it would be fantastic to grill and hang out back there. The cabin is at the end of a street so it‚Äôs super quiet and we had a herd of elk that passed through every evening we were there. The cabin was more than enough space for my husband, pup and I. We opted to sleep in the open alcove because it had a queen sized bed and we slept great! Shower got super hot, kitchen had everything we needed to cook, the place was super clean. We took the snowshoes out one day, that was a major perk to not have to worry about renting them. One day my husband went winter fly fishing on the Big Wood River (caught/released 3!) while I took our pup on a long walk on the Wood River trail which is only a block and a half away from the cabin. I would love to come back when we can take the bikes out on the trail! The cabin is only a half mile from the main area of Hailey with plenty of stores and restaurants- we had Thai food and KB‚Äôs burritos, both delicious! The cabin made it so easy to get outside and adventure and then come back and relax each day. We especially liked the quieter vibe of Hailey when compared to the Ketchum area. It was the perfect ending to our monthlong road trip, thank you Marie!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Better than expected. I booked last minute and really lucked out due to a cancellation. If you are traveling with a pet you couldn‚Äôt find a more perfect place to stay. Location is super! üòä

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen‚Äôs place is the perfect little spot for a getaway in Sun Valley. Great location just outside of town, but an easy drive anywhere and on the bus line.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for two people! Located right off the 9th hole of the Elkhorn Golf Club and a short 5 minute drive to town!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen's place is exactly what is advertised. It's basically a second bedroom at the end of her condo with it's own entrance, foyer, bathroom and bedroom. She has even made a little nook to house a mini fridge, microwave, coffee pot, and mini electric kettle complete with coffee, tea, granola bars, sugar, creamer, paper products, plastic utensils. Although you can't cook a full-on meal, we were able to piece things together from the grocery store like sandwiches, salads, yogurt, cereal. There is also a grill restaurant on premise within 5 minutes walk. The space was sparkling clean with a comfy bed. Although there is no air-conditioning, and we stayed in late July, the room is incredibly cool with the window open as it sits in a shady location. The location of the condo is also in a great spot close to town by car and a bus runs multiple times daily. We will be back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small but stylish bedroom, modern , comfy space. No senior will figure out TV. Hire an 11 year old. Too bad. Beautiful pond nearby. Short walk to parking. Fridge, microwave. Desk.
Everything I needed except for TV- too complicated for me. Over all very happy. Hey, without TV I did not get any terrible news."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen's place was perfect! The location and clubhouse spa/sauna could not have been better at such a reasonable price for Sun Valley. Very comfortable bed, and VERY clean room and bathroom. I've seen hospitals that are not that clean. Jen is a great host. She was a big help in making sure I knew where to go for my late arrival. Even Remy, her perfect mountain dog, made me feel welcome. The skiing was amazing; if only they could have ordered an extra foot of fresh snow it would have been beyond epic . . . I recommend Perry's in town for breakfast/lunch or the Konditorei near SV Lodge for trout benedict and artistic Austrian pastries for breakfast. The historic Ram restaurant near SV Lodge is an experience for a fancy dinner. Have the piano player share some of the memorabilia and stories he has collected over his 40 years there. I hope to return someday and would not need to search beyond Jen's for a place to stay. My wife (a fair weather skier) may join me next time, but she was happy with the Idaho smoked trout and Sun Valley Mustard I brought her for souvenirs . . ."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room was everything I needed and more! This was my first time visiting Sun Valley for a few days of snowboarding, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. Jen was a great host and answered all my questions, but also respected my privacy. The room felt completely separated, with its own entrance and key. The space was clean and functional, and the bed was very comfortable. The hot tub was amazing and very convenient, you should definitely take advantage of it! I was concerned about the location being so far from town, but it actually worked out great. The bus stop is close, and runs frequently and late enough that I never had any concerns going to town at night. Driving to the resort was also no problem, there was plenty of parking available every day I went. Overall I think this is the best value I could have found for my visit, I had a great time!"

Perfect little room with everything you need, and Jen made sure to add some extra hospitality touches to make it feel like you were staying in a hotel. The location couldn‚Äôt have been any better. Right on the bus line or a very quick drive to the mountain or town. She also provided great restaurant and bar recommendations for our visit. Outstanding place for the price, I would definitely stay again!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen is AWESOME! She was responsive, personable, and extremely hospitable.
The private bedroom and bathroom is the perfect size for two people and luggage. There is space to hang your clothes, and a very comfy bed to lay your head. The (free!) bus picks you up right past the parking lot and takes you to the village, downtown Ketchum, and transfers to the mountain bases.
Great location and a peaceful experience."

The location was conveniently located right in downtown Hailey, walking distance to everything. The host was so responsive as well. Thanks for a great stay!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic stay in the center of Hailey. Condo was new with modern furnishings, very clean, awesome private rooftop hot tub, and plenty of space across the 3 floors. The agency was very responsive and super helpful with little questions as well. Would absolutely stay there again. Only one note - the garage was a bit tricky to maneuver and ended up that our car didn‚Äôt fit (we had a Thule box on top)."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We all thoroughly enjoyed the townhouse accommodations. We were the first guests in the new unit. All the beautifully selected furnishings made the unit feel very cozy and comfortable. On two occasions, there were inconsiderate loud neighbors at late hours of the evening, but the issue overall, did not affect our enjoyment and satisfaction of the accommodations. We would definitely stay at the townhouse again. Management was very communicative and responsive to questions. Great experience!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, easy to check in and check out.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we absolutely loved our stay at Don and Brooks townhome in Hailey. Unfortunately, we were in town for poor circumstances and they were very flexible and accommodating with early check-in prompt responses and recommendations. There was plenty of space for three of us to have our own areas and have workstations and get what we need to get done and feel very peaceful and quiet and walking distance to town with great restaurants. We loved our stay. Thank you so much."

We were there to ski Sun Valley and the ease of coming and going was so appreciated-park your car in the garage, then dump your ski stuff off in the large entryway, head upstairs to sit by the fire, cook a meal in the well equipped kitchen, soak those sore muscles in a tub or sit by the fire and relax-what more could you want?!

I like how one bedroom is upstairs and the other is downstairs. It‚Äôs also nice being able to wash and dry your clothes. They even provide laundry detergent.

It is conveniently located within walking distance to everything in Hailey - grocery stores, breweries, restaurants, and shops -. Like many others mentioned, the neighborhood is tranquil, surprising since it is only one block from busy Main Street and only five minutes from the airport. The townhouse itself served us well. It had everything we needed for an extended stay. The main bedroom downstairs is comfortable.The townhouse was immaculate and pleasant.
Ketchum and Baldy Mountain are easily accessible by car -20 minutes drive- or bus. The bus stop is half a block from the townhouse, and there is no cost to it.
The best bar/brewery/restaurant in town is the Sun Valley Brewery. Great food, great beer and the best ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù like environment you will find anywhere.
We loved this place and if Hailey/Sun Valley comes up again in our path, we will definitely want to stay again.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My niece and I had our first trip to Idaho to do some hiking. Beautiful area for that. And our stay at Don & Brooks' condo helped make the trip perfect. Perfectly clean, very well organized binder, quick and easy communication, good location just two blocks off the main street. Bedrooms on separate floors and living area is on 2nd floor. Extra special nice touch was homemade cookies delivered by their granddaughter. This is why I rarely stay at hotels anymore- just prefer to find great hosts like Don & Brooks and get more value for my $. Can highly recommend."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice clean place!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I prefer Hailey over Ketchum as it is less busy, less crowded etc. This townhouse is a great location just off the center of town and we were an easy 5 minute walk to a different restaurant every night.

2018-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Walking distance to everything you will need; store, restaurants, brewery, shopping, coffee! The house was clean and comfy, beds were excellent. One thing to note is the main living space is on a second story so if you are traveling with folks that are challenged physically, this might prove difficult. I was traveling with my 83 yo grandmother and she saw it as a challenge to keep fit going up and down the stairs and made the best of it, it might not work for everyone. Other than that, I would say don‚Äôt hesitate, it‚Äôs a great home and Brooks was very available when I needed her."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay in Hailey. Don & Brooks were so accommodating & communicative. The condo is such a treat for a most pleasant stay. And the location is fabulous!

We also enjoyed the area - hiking in Hailey, x-c skiing at Galena, and skiing in Ketchum. We'd definitely stay here again!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don and Brook's townhouse is fantastic! ... clean and spacious with a fully stocked kitchen made our stay perfect. Beds were comfortable and the location was walking distance to restaurants. Special bonus was the heated title floor in the Master bedroom!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This townhouse was in a great location, super clean and perfect for our weekend stay during Trailing of the Sheep Festival.

2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and fully furnished house in a quiet residential area in Hailey, and within walking distance of downtown with shops and restaurants.

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Gem
Business/pleasure trip with our two adult daughters. The home is in a row of townhouses two short blocks from the main street in Hailey. The entire block is well-kept and attractive. The home exceeded our expectations. There is a large master suite on the main floor with a very large ensuite bathroom. Upstairs, and you have to be able to navigate a full flight of stairs, is the main living area and second bedroom. The living areas and kitchen are spacious and have updated furnishings and appliances. The kitchen is well-stocked and maintained with abundant counterspace. The upstairs bedroom is also quite large and one of my daughters used the queen size sleeper sofa and was comfortable on that. There are lots of thoughtful touches in the home that made our stay comfortable and pleasant. We never heard the neighbors on either side. The garage is clean and easily accessible
I would definitely book this home again. Most of our activities were in Ketchum and Sun Valley and further up towards Stanley. It is only a scenic 11 mile drive to Kechum. This Home would be ideal for an extended stay in the area.
Thanks Don and Brooks"

2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place right off the main drag through Hailey.

Brooks was very sweet to deal with.

2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The listing description was very accurate. I reserved Don & Brooks' place a few months back for a family Christmas getaway and they were very good about responding to me over the months leading up to the stay. The location itself is just off Main Street, which made wandering the town on foot easy and inviting, even during a snow storm! The amenities were more than enough for a family of six, the sleeping arrangements of the two beds plus the fold out bed in the couch, made things very comfortable. Hailey is a fun town and I look forward to returning. I highly recommend Don and Brooks' townhouse for a stay in the Hailey/Ketchum area."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this condo. It was very quiet but close to our family and all the amenities in Hailey. We found it very clean and well stocked and while we didn't spend a lot of time there during the day, we enjoyed our nights in the couch watching TV and relaxing at the end of a busy day. The king size bed was very comfortable and we slept well. Thanks again for your hospitality!!"

2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Hailey at this beautiful townhouse. The photos do not do it justice, it was very spacious, had every amenity we needed and was perfect for a group of three or four people. The place was spotlessly clean and we were delighted to find that Don and Brooks had left us a little care package of a bottle of wine and some local cheese. Perfect! We were in town for a wedding in Sun Valley and we were only 20 minutes down the road in Hailey which was a cute little town. We never watched TV because there were lots of board games to keep us amused!

Don and Brooks were excellent in communicating from the very beginning throughout the trip. They responded fast and were very helpful and friendly."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brooks and Don were great hosts. Their place is immaculate and well located in Hailey. Communication was great and they got us in on short notice.

We had one phone call to them and they responded within minutes. The condo was set up very nicely for our family! Having the one bedroom downstairs allowed us to put the baby to bed and continue visiting with our nephew and his wife as long as we wanted!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel to the Sun Valley area several times a year & have stayed in various places, but this was our first experience with an Airbnb. We couldn't have been more pleased with your lovely townhome. Our only suggestion would be to provide additional photos, so that renters can truly appreciate the beauty of your home."
2016-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication from Don and Brooks, and the lodging was quite nice. Master bedroom was particularly impressive but since we were in Sun Valley to ride mountain bikes the best amenity was the large garage, accessible through the alley. Perfect for storing and working on bikes."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Don and Brooks were so easy to work with and helpful when booking our stay in Hailey. The condo was perfect for our family. I highly recommend a stay in their condo.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time in Hailey. The downtown was fun and we were in walking distance of everything. It was only about 29 minutes from sun valley which was also the perfect distance. The townhouse was beautiful and homey. It was a great weekend getaway and the hosts were wonderful.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don and Brooks were excellent hosts. Their townhome is comfortable and warm with all the amenities. We stayed with our 15.5 month old daughter.

This townhouse is cozy and very conformable with enough space and bedding supplies for five people. The location is very convenient and easy access to Ketchum and ski areas. Some fancy restaurants are within walking distance. I definitely would like to stay in this place next time."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sun Valley area is paradise and Don and Brooks' townhouse in Hailey was perfect for my family for a holiday ski vacation. The place is well kept, clean, and very comfortable. A 2 car garage means cars and gear can also be stored safely. Our hosts were more than accommodating. As a resident of Salt Lake City and a frequent visitor of Sun Valley, this place is on my list for our next visit."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the townhouse! Brooks made a real effort to stay in touch with us once our reservation was confirmed. Since our trip was scheduled over the Christmas holiday, she made sure we knew the weather and road conditions and that we knew we could call with any questions or issues. A few, small glitches were handled quickly and graciously by our hosts. The location made Hailey completely walkable which, considering the snow pack, was a real plus! We also enjoyed the easy access to the Ketchum area and all the snowplay opportunities! The townhouse was cozy and comfortable with plenty of space for having our kids stay for dinner and board games around the fire, or to have them pop over for breakfast! We would happily stay with Don and Brooks again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed by myself at this apartment. The apartment is in a perfect location. In a private residential neighborhood, but only two streets off Hailey's main drag. Everything is clean and in great shape. Very comfortable bed. Kitchen with eating area and bathroom with a shower. Washer/Dryer are also located in the bathroom. Living area with TV to relax in. With all the things to do in the area I did not watch much of it. The apartment temperature was very comfortable. Easy drive to River Run Lodge to ski Baldy at Sun Valley. I think it took me about 15 minutes. I left early to be in the parking lot by 8:00 am. I stayed last year in another apartment above garage in Hailey. The other one was newer. and I liked straying there. This apartment is every bit as nice and comfortable with a far superior location. I will definitely stay here again.

I really enjoyed the Pendleton accents with the bedspreads and cups. The unit has a very clean, bright and modern feel to it. if I am ever in the Sun Valley area again, I would definitely stay here. I can only imagine how beautiful it is in the other seasons."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely would come back here again. This little renovated barn was perfect for a few days visit for me. I went to ski at Sun Valley which is amazing. Hailey is just outside of Ketchum and about a 20 minute drive to ski resort so very convenient! The property itself is so peaceful and serene. I did not feel compelled to lock my door so didn‚Äôt. I got In later than I expected due to thick fog driving in and Denise was so sweet to wait up for me and make sure wi made it in ok. The snow was gorgeous on their property though well plowed. The stars in the sky at night just added to the peaceful surroundings. The entry way to the little barn has a fridge and an area for skis. The room itself beyond the entry way is cozy and warm and worked perfectly for my needs. Denise and Ron met me on the slopes one day and gave me some much needed and helpful critique on my skiing as they are excellent skiers so I practiced while I was there and am using those tips at Steamboat Springs now!

The area is so quiet that we were able to enjoy seeing the deer in the fields at dusk, walk the trail behind the house and star gaze at night. The entryway with the refrigerator and table is unfinished and not heated so it was too cool in the morning to eat breakfast in there. But the bedroom and bathroom were warm, cozy and comfortable.

Also, I highly recommend Enoteca (in Ketchum) for dinner. Yum!!"

Both were available and receptive to my inquiries. I loved the privacy of the barn, as well. They were there the I needed them but still removed. I had my small elderly canine companion with me and he fell in love with Luut, my host's dog. Luut was gentle and very friendly as was the neighbor's dog. I'm very protective of my little guy but he had a blast with his new friends. The carpets and towels in my room were the plushest I've ever felt, literally, so nice. The kitchen was minimalist but it worked and I had what I needed. I don't know if it was planned in their remodel but my clothes in my room and bath towels were situated so they were warm and toasty when I got dressed. It was a great value for the price. I hope to come back."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an Idaho gem! The ‚Äúbarn‚Äù was even better than expected, nice and comfy and cozy with a great location, and the hosts couldn‚Äôt have been nicer! Enjoyed walking the nearby tails and visiting the two ponds with our lab who was happy to have a 4-legged friendly buddy to run around and play with as well. And Denise filled her bird feeders and Ron suggested where I could possibly see a Belted Kingfisher once they realized I was interested in birds. And yes, I did see the Kingfisher :-) I highly recommend staying here; we booked a longer stay in December before we even had left."

Additionally they have a great walking trails out of their backyard. I would LOVE to stay here again. They made my visit truly wonderful!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an awesome stay in ‚ÄòThe Barn‚Äô. The space was much better than expected, as the unfinished area that‚Äôs referenced is much bigger and nicer than we expected. It probably wouldn‚Äôt be very useful (except for storage) in the winter, but in June it was a great bonus. We have a younger daughter, so it was a great area for my husband and I to hang out after she went to bed. Denise and Ron were awesome hosts. They even had some toys for our daughter to play with in the yard. Their dog was super friendly and was a great playmate for our dog. Even though the barn is in their backyard, we still felt like we had privacy. Overall, a great stay!"

The description accurately portrays how the barn will be but there is SO much more! The beds are comfy, it has the softest and plushest rugs, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking! I walked the trails behind the barn many times and it was one of my favorite things from the entire weekend. Denise was exceptional in helping with recommendations as well! Lutz however, is the real star of the show! Goodest boy ever!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ‚Äúbarn‚Äù and it‚Äôs location was exactly what we needed. Very clean and well done remodel. Our dog had a blast playing with their dog, Lutz. We‚Äôll be back!"

I met Ron as I was leaving and he was quite nice, and they were good communicating during my stay as well. It was nice being out in the country, though do note if there's a big winter storm coming through to be sure your car can handle that. (I had no trouble in a 4x4 with regular tires, but that was just a few inches of snow.)"

Whether you wanna read a book, watch shows on your laptop, nap, take long hot baths(water gets very hot), or step outside and enjoy the wildlife & one sweetheart doggy named Lutz, it will be the perfect place for you. I dont have pets but if I did this place would be the perfect place for that. It's about 15 min south of ketchum, and 10 min north of hailey nestled back between a mountain and in a beautiful valley. Its peace & quiet and Denise is very easy to get ahold of and very hospitable. You wont regret staying at ""The Barn""."

The entire place was incredibly clean and well stocked and they have everything you need to make your stay comfortable. The beds were great and we were very pleased with every part of our stay. Also their dog Lutz is adorable and made a good friend for our dog Logan who loved running around their beautiful front yard and playing around. We look forward to staying there again the next time we are in town visiting family.
Thanks again!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a good place to stay in Sun Valley, if you don't mind being a little away from town. However, the barn is only 15 minutes from Ketchum.
It offers a room on the small side with the basic amenities, microwave, coffee maker and fridge. And access to a private dining area. However, the dining area is unfinished and uninsulated. The room is not fancy, but it is clean and tastefully arranged. And it is private, away from the house.
The perk of being far from town is that the place is delightfully quiet."

Denise and Ron were kind enough to accommodate us on super short notice when our other travel plans got thwarted due to weather. The location is a little ways from the main area of town, but it‚Äôs very quiet and peaceful. Though we visited in the middle of a pretty major snow storm, Denise and Ron kept the driveway and path to our door plowed, and even let us park in their garage. Great hosts and an awesome little spot!"

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn is a quiet and cozy place to stay. The bed was comfy. Linens clean and soft. Denise was quick to respond. I liked having the space outside the bedroom to put our skiing and fishing items. The refrigerator and freezer had plenty of space too. The room space is not ideal for cooking large meals, but the microwave, tea kettle, and coffee maker worked well for breakfast. The dog, Lutz, is sweet and quiet."

We loved the privacy of the room and our attentive hosts, especially their German shorthair. The room is separate from the main house in a converted barn. It's quiet, cozy, and brand new. We couldn't imagine a more perfect weekend (or month!) long getaway. We'll be back this winter to check out the skiing on Baldy."

‚Ä¢Matches perfectly with the description provided.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little overnight stay. Enough common space to stretch out on the rug and I like that the bed is tucked into a nook for coziness. Love all the counter space in the bathroom.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at this cabin while skiing at Sun Valley! It was super cute and cozy and had everything we needed. We enjoyed the local restaurants close by and the 25 minute drive to the mountain. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a place to stay to visit our son in Sun Valley. The location was very accessible to Sun Valley and the cabin was perfect for our little venture. It was a very cozy get away.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nolina was a great. She responded quickly and was very kind. Our cabin was cute and quaint. We would stay here again and highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for everything I needed.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stayed at Nolina‚Äôs cabin #3 while visiting family in Haley. The cabin is very clean and practical. All amenities were provided including coffee and bathroom soap and shampoo.
Nolina provided good instructions and was very proactive with her messages.
I would gladly stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nolina‚Äôs place was perfect for a weekend getaway to Ketchum with my sister. The cabin was so cozy. Would definitely stay here again :)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay in Nolinas beautiful cabin!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little cabin just a little road noise but otherwise awesome
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and clean space. Exactly what we wanted. Host was kinda and accessible.
Thank you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy and comfortable cabin! Cooking is microwave only but the kitchen area has a sink and a small fridge. Even though it's located just off Main Street which has a lot of traffic, when the windows were shut we had very little road noise. It's just a short walk to the beautiful River trail and right behind the cabins is a bike trail. It's close enough to Hailey / Ketchum / Sun Valley to be convenient but far enough away to be less busy and more peaceful. Host was super friendly and responsive and everything was clean and in good condition. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again if we're in the area."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The small cabins are very nice, clean and cozy. Nolina is very friendly and let us check in when we arrived a little earlier. The small mini kitchen makes it quite possible to make breakfast and cold food.
Not to be seen in the pictures that you look at the highway from the terrace and a somewhat unpleasant parking space. And unfortunately, the highway right next to it is also much louder than expected. Even if the weather had allowed it to sit on the patio, it wouldn't have been very pleasant due to the volume of the passing trucks. Unfortunately, they were also so much heard at night that we left already at 6 am because sleeping was no longer possible from 4.30 am (despite Oropax). In addition, however, we felt quite comfortable in the small cottage. For the transit it was ok for us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely book the room again,even though we had trouble ith the code not working when we arrived at midnight.
We were tired and cranky after a 9+ hour drive,so not being able to get in the room and just go to bed,almost put me over the edge with patience.
No apologies were given,either.
Air bnb customer service was able to finally get someone to remotely unlock the door for us. We finally got to bed around 3 AM.
Other than that, the rest of our stay was wonderful.
I know things happen, but asimple apology really goes a very long way when it comes to customer service.
Anna from Montana"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"I had been on a long road trip camping and living out of my car for a couple weeks, so it was nice to find somewhere clean to shower and rest my head. The truth of the matter is that it was overpriced for what you get. I also arrived an hour earlier than check in and was hoping to get in a bit earlier, but I never heard back from Nolina to confirm if that was possible or not. I may just be bitter at people on Airbnb capitalizing off of people in the most lazy/cheap way. All in all it served its purpose."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Pros
Clear instructions, easy access, smelled clean on entering, clean bedding and towels, comfortable bed. Quick hot water and heat. Quiet at night even though close to highway.
Cons
Cabinets, tv, couch and coffee table had noticeable smudges from across the room. Enough so we spent 15 minutes cleaning them several times to feel comfortable using them. Should never have to clean a place before using. Shower curtain was tearing out of tub surround and laminate flooring had noticeably swollen water damage and a big chunk missing by fridge. One of the bed lamps was just a cord with the plug cut off. Coffee in need of refinishing or replacement."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabins are so cute and have everything you need for a comfortable, quiet stay. Super close to Sun Valley and right by the Cutthroat Club which was delicious!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an awesome space. This was my second time staying here and it did not disappoint. Very well appointed and comfortable.
There is a bike path half a block behind the cabins which is a bonus.
Nolina is very responsive.
I highly recommend these cabins."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very cute cabin with thoughtful extras. The bathroom had generous surface space to spread out, as well as a night light. The living area is comfortable, has plenty of outlets, lots of lighting, a luggage rack and bench for suitcases, as well as a full size coffee maker with plenty of coffee. Hot cocoa mix and tea were also available. The location is convenient, but on the main drag with a lot of traffic. We slept well, but road noise started fairly early in the morning. However, that would not stop us from staying again."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great for a quick stop.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location to stop on our road trip through Idaho! Private and close to great things to see and do.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome! Great location, easy to walk to restaurants. Would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious, comfortable bed and very well kept. The cottage had all the amenities that we wanted. Bed was very comfortable. We liked this cottage and will definitely stay here if we are in that area again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Close enough to Ketchum at a fraction of the Ketchum prices. Very clean. Great little spot overall.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location weather you are staying in bellevue, exploring hailey, or driving up to Ketchum! Nolina provided great recommendations and places to visit. Great visit, and perfect cabin (clean &organized)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nolina was a fantastic host! Cabin was just as described. It was clean, well furnished and centrally located for all of the exploring we wanted to do in the area. We have been recommending The Long Horse Cabins to friends travelling through the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin with comfortable bed and quiet at night. Would stay again if ever needed to be in Bellevue again üëçüèº
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a peaceful and restful evening in the cabin
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabins were lovely! Very clean and a beautiful location.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nolina was proactive in reaching out to be sure I knew how to get in. She quickly responded to my messages.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute little log cabin, the photos were spot on. Loved sitting on the porch in the evening with a glass of wine and the beautiful mountain views."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you! Comfortable bed clean room!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,all good
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Host/Co-Host was very responsive and easy to work with. The place was generally pretty clean. Nicely decorated and had a charming feel. Air conditioning worked great.
Cons: Trash was left, but as mentioned, host remedied the problem quickly. The bed was a bit cramped, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of room on the sides of the bed to get in and out.
Overall, pretty decent stay. I‚Äôd say it was a good value and the proximity to Hailey and Ketchum was really nice. It was also a short and easy drive to Craters of the Moon."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were only there one night but felt very comfortable. Instructions for check-in, care of the space and amenities were clear and complete. It made for a fun weekend getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place with a fantastic host! Lovely area!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love staying here. The cabin is pristine and comfortable. While it‚Äôs right next to Main Street, once inside, we never heard traffic. And it‚Äôs a great place for one or two people. It‚Äôs small but has everything you need for a couple nights stay. We only ate breakfast there and went out for other meals. It‚Äôs about eight minutes to downtown Hailey where there are lots of dining options. We liked staying in Bellevue because it‚Äôs much less crowded than Ketchum. We will definitely stay here again. Nolina was quick to respond to our questions. Have fun."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay! It was a clean, quiet, nice cabin. We thought there would be a bigger portable fan as it was hot the first night we were there, but nevertheless, we will definitely be back again üòÄ"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in cabin #3 on our Idaho road trip. Despite being right off the main highway it felt rustic and private. We could barely hear the occasional truck or airplane passing by, certainly nothing distracting. The cabin itself was roomy, clean, and comfortable with everything we needed. Other than saying hello to another guest when we arrived, we didn't hear anyone in the other cabins. We grabbed a late dinner snack at a local pub in town, and enjoyed a great breakfast at Lucy's just across the street. I did have to unplug one of the lamps to charge up our devices as there were only a few outlets in the cabin, but that certainly was not a problem. Nolina responded quickly when I contacted her a few hours earlier about checking in. Overall we had a great stay and I highly recommend the cabin if you're in the area."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nolina was super friendly and helpful, always responsive. The cabin was a bit more rustic than I expected and the location is on the main drag through town, which can be quite busy at times. Bellevue itself is not someplace I would book a stay again. It was fine for one night on a long motorcycle trip and there are a couple of really good restaurants. I loved Mama Inez's place. The location is also right beneath the flight path for the nearby airport, which is a hub for the private jets of people going to Ketchum and Sun Valley.
Nolina's place will definitely appeal to a certain kind of traveler and she is top notch to interact with. I found the other guests there were very friendly to chat with. Were I to make this trip again, I would go on to Ketchum for more upscale lodging and restaurants."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. Clean, peaceful and accommodating. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is very clean. Nolina respond right away. Highly recommend.

Nolina responded to text quickly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this little log cabin!! The bed is very comfortable- slept great! Loved the charm of the little cabin. Sitting relaxing on the porch was great! It is right o the road, but a bit off and you dont really hear the traffic. It still felt very relaxing. Would definitely stay again! He eat for a night or 2 when exploring and hiking around Sun Valley."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy Check In

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was clean and cozy. The bed was comfortable and we slept well.
There is a fantastic restaurant across the street with American and authentic Mexican food. We had fresh watermelon juice along with it.
The location worked well for visiting Craters of the Moon, Minidoka Intermnet Camp, and Haggerman Fossil Beds."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,the bed was a bit more on the firm side. also not all the outlets next to the bed worked. otherwise it was perfect.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host! Communication was great and she responded promptly to my questions. Check-in information was detailed and clear. The cabin was exactly as listed and was perfect for our one night stop on our way through this area. You can see the extra effort and little details the host put into this cabin to make it special. I especially loved the kitchenette area.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!

The location is perfect and the view of the mountains from the porches are great. I look forward to staying here every time I am in the area for work or pleasure.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay for us! The cabin is super cute, cozy, and tastefully decorated. Everything was very clean upon our arrival. Nolina our host was great with communication. Glad to have found Long Horse cabins!"

We'd definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little cabin with everything you need and nothing you don‚Äôt.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect stay for me to check out Sun Valley! The resort was only 25 minutes away and very affordable for a last minute pit stop. I had everything I needed and it was a lot of space. Wi-Fi worked great. I appreciated the tea and coffee provided (the to-go cups as well!) Nolina really thought about everything.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for us to stay while skiing Sun Valley. I loved how close we could park so getting gear in and out was easy.
I so loved the adorable cabin as well. It was so much more fun than staying in a hotel.
I thought it might be tough to not have any cooking in the cabin, but it was a piece of cake. We got microwave meals from Costco and it worked great after a long day of skiing. We plan to go back."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The coziest cabin!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great value and wonderful place! Nolina had an automated lock setup for entry and exit. Do communicate if you plan on coming early, as they are pre-programmed.
The cabin is in Bellavue, which is about 30-40 min from Ketchum. Still a great value and located near Atkinson's grocery and some other local favorites. For the price, this is a great place. Warm, clean and well maintained! Would love to stay here again!"

2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place! Only thing that I would suggest is to have the heat set a little warmer for when guests show up. It took a while to to heat up, but other than that it was a great little place!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to ID from NC to visit our son and daughter-in-law. We have seen the Long Horse cabins during past visits and decided to give them a try. It was perfect! Very cozy, quiet and comfortable. The kitchenette was supplied with all we needed. We arrived during a winter storm with lots of snow and the crew kept the sidewalk, porch and parking spaces cleared. This will definitely be our regular place to stay in the future! We can't say enough about this cute cabin! Thank you!"

Between the grocery store that's 1/2 a mile away and the fridge, microwave, and dishes provided, we had no issues with that during our week-long stay. Watch the bunnies and magpies hop around in the grass while drinking coffee on the patio in the mornings. If you see an opening, snag it!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin! Very cozy and cute! Not too far from Craters of the Moon NM and the Hemingway Memorial. Bellevue is a cute town and close to Hailey and Ketchum. Very nice stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and price
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was great. Very easy access. Very cute and ‚Äúcabiny‚Äù inside. Right off main road for easy access to get out and play, get to restaurants, etc. good location for fishermen. Roomy!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect escape from the city! We visited in April to celebrate our anniversary and enjoy some spring skiing at Bald Mountain. Everything was excellent!
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Clean and cozy. Would stay here again!
2022-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,That‚Äôs good for small family
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little cabin! Would recommend for anyone who‚Äôs going out there.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest, coziest, and comfiest log cabin that makes you feel like home the moment you step into it. For context, my partner had work scheduled in Ketchum, so we decided to make a mini, mid-week trip out of it. Since we don't ski, we were intentional in staying in Bellevue to stay away from the winter crowds and traffic.
The cabin itself is very clean, with the basic amenities readily available and more than sufficient for our two-night stay. The bed is very firm, while the pillows are extra fluffy, with extra bedding if needed--for those who are particular about their sleeping arrangement. As heavy coffee drinkers, I was thankful there was enough supply to last us.
Nolina provided detailed check-in and check-out instructions, which I always appreciate. Just an overall lovely experience. Would love to return when it's warmer so I can sit outside on the porch with my coffee and just marvel at the view."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a fantastic location for visiting Idaho. The cabin was very clean and everything is just as described!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute and cozy!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was my husband and Is first time in Sunvalley despitebeing from the Treasure Valley. Bald mountain was amazing, gorgeous, and luxurious. Keep in mind because the skiing is so great and the area is so desirable prices of everything in town are inflated even if they shouldnt be. The long horse cabin looked exactly as pictured inside and out. Toiletries were stocked (towels, TP, hand soap, shower soaps). Accounts for streaming movies were logged in and worked great. Bellevue was about 10 minutes to Hailey and about 20ish to Bald mountain. This cabin is conveniently located if you are trying to ski for the weekend. The process to get in the cabin is very simple and worked great. Some concerns are, the fridge was not cleaned prior to our stay (a cup of what looked like milk was left inside). The futon and bed were not comfortable, but maybe I'm just getting old. I also recommend bringing your own throw blanket, the ones provided/seen in the photos are a bit scratchy. All in all a fine place to stay for a night."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect weekend getaway with the family!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice little cabin near places to eat and right on the main road through town. A bit on the rustic side, but that is in keeping with the environment. Very clean and well-kept premises."

2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy cabin, conveniently located to all ski centers. There are coffee shops and shops nearby. If you are going there in the winter, bring slippers or warm socks to walk at home, because the floors are cold. Otherwise, everything is great! Highly recommend!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nolina was an awesome host. The cabin was nice and warm when we arrived. The parking area was taken care of daily with snowblowers and plows. Plenty of blankets and towels were supplied for our stay. We certainly will look this place up for the summer.

Annika was very communicative and super accommodating ‚Äî she let us have an early check-in when we were orphaned from our previous hotel. One thing to note: we were two couples, and the space is quite small for 4 adults. Access to the bathroom is through the bedroom, so highly recommend you stay with fewer numbers/stick to family or make sure you‚Äôre very comfortable with each other!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Close to downtown and cozy furnishings
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay in Hailey. Nice little place that was near town so you could walk around. Host Annika was wonderful. Very responsive. Quiet neighborhood with nice dogs running around in the snow. Will definitely stay again. Sharon

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and conveniently located. 5/5 stars"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Silver Fox is a sweet little cozy place right next to the valley walking trail. Parking was easy for 2 cars and entry was easy with a code. We had a surplus of heaters and only used three, one being an electric fireplace for ambiance. The coffee maker is a regular drip with a cone filter and the additional lift sleeping space is definitely not for young children but excellent for an additional adult. the space is not large but workable. The kitchen is well appointed but make sure you know how to use a convection oven, it is a bit different then a regular oven. All in all this is highly recommended for cozy comfort."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tastefully decorated and creative with design in a smaller layout. Kitchen was well stocked with quality cookware and dining needs. We walked to dinner and perused Hailey, visiting shops and buying groceries."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This sweet and quaint place was located close to everything. It was very quiet and a nice location.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay host was super responsive and helped when the dogs locked us out. also great we could bring the pups. We were glad it was a cooler weekend because it was a tad warm. Close to walking paths and restraunts, would definitely stay here again"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cottage! Perfect for 1-2 people. Only complaint is there wasn‚Äôt really A/C. Window unit is actually in the kitchen and doesn‚Äôt cool the place down. Couldn‚Äôt open doors in bedroom at night because there‚Äôs no screen door. So it was a bit hot to sleep in. Other than that, the place is super cute."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"nice place quiet
easy to get too
within a walking trail"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great little cabin (with plenty of room) just blocks from the main street in town. Accommodations were neat and tidy. It was in such a quiet, peaceful location. Most importantly, as a single traveler, I felt very safe and secure. I would recommend the Sliver Fox! I will definitely stay again if I am in the area!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Annika's place was in a great location and was perfect for my husband and I. We loved being able to cook and do laundry. The only small complaint we have is that the AC had not been brought into the cottage yet because the spring hadn't been too warm. However, communication with Annika was wonderful and she offered to bring us the AC unit the next day. We decided not to inconvenience her because it was decently comfortable, mostly just got warmer when we cooked. Overall, I would recommend Annika's place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Annika was always quick to respond and super helpful, specially when my mom got locked out of the cabin.
The cabin was clean and everything was very comfortable. I would love to stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of a local find ! We could not have asked for a better location with the Wood river trail only a 100 ft from the front door and a lockable utility shed to keep our bikes in at night. The neighborhood is very quiet and perfect for walking, with downtown shops and restaurants only a few minutes away
Inside we found everything we needed in near new condition.
We will definitely book again next time we come up to ride or ski."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun little space. Cabin feel with all the luxuries of being in town.
My family lives in the area and we were able to walk to and from houses easily.

My parents can walk into town and are close to the bike path to get to my place.
Annika is communicative about any issues. We‚Äôll definitely stay there again!
Thanks Annika"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,A great place to stay near to much of what Hailey has to offer!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay! nice bedroom and comfortable living space.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Annika and the Silver Fox. Place is exactly as described and very close to downtown Hailey. Kitchen had everything we needed, beds were comfortable and and the neighborhood is adorable. The trail next to the house was super convenient for dog walks too so that was much appreciated. We came for skiing at Sun Valley and found the convenience factor to be very high. Very likely we stay here again next year. Thank you Annika!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay in Hailey. The place was perfect and cozy. Annika was communicative and responsive. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a cute cottage with comfortable bed, quality linens and fairly clean. Good value for money during ski season. The front door does need to be adjusted as some force pulling it shut is needed for the lock to operate properly, and a few too many knick knacks lying around for my taste, but overall a good stay. We didn't have my problem with keeping it warm enough just using the wall heaters even though we stayed in winter."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic spot. The shower was really incredible
2023-02-01,2,Stayed over a week,"The Silver Fox is a charming space for a two person weekend getaway.
Although the description indicates it sleeps 4,
the low ceiling in the loft makes it more appropriate for children. I was uncomfortable using the ladder ( I couldn‚Äôt get it to not move) so ended up sleeping on the floor near the sofa
If you stay longer than 2 or 3 days this is considered an extended stay and an additional $50-$100 cleaning fee is charged over and above the $75 you are charged when you book
There is very little closet or drawer space if you do an extended stay as we did for 2 1/2 weeks. We ended up having to use our suitcases to keep our clothes
If you stay in the winter please note that portable heaters are used which we turned off while we were away or sleeping
Did make for a chilly return home or getting out of bed
Annika is very responsive to any questions you may have
It was very convenient to have a washer and dryer
Sent from my iPhone"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and great price. Easy check in and communication was effortless. Highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I wish I owned this place! It was in a fantastic location to walk around downtown Hailey and had beautiful views of the mountains. The place itself is well outfitted to cook-in and it‚Äôs such a cute spot. Thanks for a great stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at the Silver Fox cottage. It was exactly what we were looking for and Annika was extremely helpful. We loved being able to walk out the door and access the trail nearby. It was amazing to have a dog-friendly place that felt so cozy!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Annika‚Äôs place was just as described, a lovely place for us to stay while we were skiing in Sun Valley"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute and cozy cabin-like feel. Private. Comfy queen bed and loft bed. Kids loved sleeping the loft. Had everything we needed for our stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very nice place to stay, though it WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR REMOTE WORK due to internet issues (more below).
Pros:
-Extremely clean
-Comfortable beds
-Very cool loft!
-Great location - an easy walk to most things in Hailey, and an easy drive to ski Sun Valley
Cons:
-The internal doors are not solid. As a result, there is **zero** noise privacy. If you are using the bathroom, all occupants will know.
-We had major problems with the wifi. Over the course of a week, it failed several times (including during multiple business meetings). When it did work, it was okay, but on the slower end (10mb/sec, shared with the main house on the property). The host indicated that internet issues weren't typical, though the property uses small wifi extenders rather than a proper mesh system.
-The front door was broken, so it required significant strength to lock (my girlfriend couldn't get it shut). The host indicated that it would be fixed soon (though it wasn't while we were there)."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at the Silver Fox! The accommodations worked great for my partner and I, and we appreciated that it was pet friendly. Dog walks/xc ski outings were super easy and enjoyable on the adjacent bike path. There was quite a bit of snow in town while we were there, and Annika made sure the entry was well-shoveled before our arrival."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Silver Fox is a perfect little getaway in the Wood River Valley. We loved it so much, we‚Äôve already booked our next stay there!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks Annika! Great place, my wife, pup and I thoroughly enjoyed! Close location to get to sun valley / mountain access. Excellent spot by the walking trail with wildlife ( we saw moose and elk off the trail )
thanks !
Nick"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Super responsive hosts and a great location!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome small spot! Would definitely be a bit cozy with 3-4 people + ski gear, but for just me, my girlfriend, and our dog it was perfect! The main bed is super comfy and the bathroom is nice. The kitchen is smaller and euro style but with some good space management you can get plenty of cooking done! Access to the rail-trail a block away is perfect for taking the dog out on walks. A dedicated parking spot was awesome to have and right near the front door for easy loading/unloading. The hosts were also great working with me on making sure I got a package that was delivered. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great little nook! So cozy, perfect little hideaway, easy drive into Sun Valley. This is a great spot for those looking for something other than your average, run -of-the-mill, cookie cutter ski condo. We absolutely loved our stay and will be back! Annika was super responsive and helpful throughout our stay. 10/10 would recommend! Perfect for a couples retreat but you could do 3-4 people if you don‚Äôt mind close quarters. Thanks, Annika!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super clean and conveniently located. Excellent communication with host. Highly recommend üëå
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Annika for your great hospitality ! Everything was perfect
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was great. Super convenient location and great space.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended! The cottage was perfect for my vacation.
2022-10-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The place was accurate as described; small and included all of the basics. Good communication from host. There was a little bit of lack of privacy with using the restroom which is in the bedroom because the sliding door mostly wouldn‚Äôt stay closed. There were a few noise things that prevented us from fully relaxing with construction nextdoor and the neighboring dogs barking quite a bit. We know some of that comes with staying places, but worth considering especially if you plan to bring the dogs as we did. It was quiet for sleep at night. Check in and check out was very easy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the most adorable little cabin in a perfect location! The little space had everything we needed and was super clean and cozy. We were perfectly comfortable with our family of four, plus our two dogs. Our teenagers loved walking from the cabin into town and our dogs got multiple walks on the path. We cannot wait for another weekend getaway!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cottage in a great location. The shower here is absolutely divine and both beds were very comfortable. We loved the sheets so much, we ordered some for our own bed at home!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin. Perfect for two people. Can sleep 4 people but would be a little tight if spending much time at the cabin.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time during our stay in Hailey. Annika‚Äôs place was the perfect spot for us to crash after hiking and exploring the town all day. The location is perfect to where you‚Äôre just a short walk away from Main St. in Hailey, and also a short drive away from Sun Valley."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, quiet, and convenient to downtown.
Clean and well appointed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The house was comfortable, had everything we needed and in a great, convenient location close to town (but on a quiet street). We hope to be back sometime!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little place to stay close to trails and a walk away from Main St! Comfortable bed and great shower. Love that our fur baby is welcome. Thank you for a great getaway!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic cottage central to everything. It is even cuter than the photos show. I loved the keypad entry and appreciated how well everything was stocked with the comforts of home. Alissa was super responsive and made everything so easy. Would love to return!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Great communication and very clean. Lots of amenities and quiet place to stay!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Cute little place. Nicely decorated. I gave it 4 stars because we came across several 8-legged spider friends in the house. Which I guess makes sense for location but I get wigged out. Also we got locked out of the house because the bottom lock is tricky and it took a while for the host to get back to us. But otherwise a good stay. Comfy bed. Close to the town of Hailey.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place in a great location! Clean, comfortable and full of nice touches! Would recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cozy place to stay. Quiet and clean.

Thanks, Silver Fox!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here! It was clean and well maintained and the host had great communication. We wanted to get an Airbnb with 2 beds because we didn‚Äôt know for sure if another couple would be coming with us. It ended up just being us and I‚Äôm glad that was the case because I do think it would have been to small and crowded for 4 people. But it was perfect for just the 2 of us!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a lovely place for our family of 4 to stay a few nights in the Sun Valley area. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the city of Hailey beforehand but I absolutely loved staying here. First, I loved the location. Since the listing is so close to town, we walked everywhere for food. We loved KBs for their yummy burritos and fantastic margaritas and got breakfast twice at Cafe Della. There is also a bike/running/walking path right behind the house that goes for at least 15 miles.
Second, the listing itself was very compact but perfect for our needs. Our son loved the upper loft area. We also lucked out with the weather and ate most of our meals outside on the lawn/patio furniture. Also, Alissa was a wonderful host and was able to help us out of a unexpected situation. :)"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time at the Silver Fox for our long weekend. It‚Äôs a cozy little cottage right in the center of Hailey in a lovely historic neighborhood. We enjoyed being able to walk to the shops and restaurants in town since it snowed about 3ft while we were there and we didn‚Äôt want to drive much.
The kitchen is sufficiently stocked to be able to cook meals and the convection oven works well to heat up leftovers. I was a little worried about the microwave function being broken, but it worked out just fine and they have plenty of oven save dishes to use.
My daughter loved having the loft to herself and both beds were very comfy with nice linens and warm bedding.
If you go during the winter and it happens to snow be aware that the city snow plows do come through and completely wall in the parking space. I was thankful my husband was up for shoveling snow and the hosts did leave a shovel, so that was helpful.
We recommend this sweet little cottage for families and people who know each other well since the only bathroom is attached to the bedroom and there is only a sliding, slatted door between the spaces. ;-) Not an issue for us, but something to consider."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Silver Fox cottage was a great find for us! It was a perfect place to have as a base for exploring the Sun Valley area. We had a toddler and dog in tow and the setup worked fine for what we needed. The host was very responsive when we accidentally locked ourselves out (whoops!). The only drawback was that Hailey was fairly hot while we were there and without AC it did get warm inside. However, it cooled down enough at night that opening windows and using the fan and cooler worked fine. Otherwise it was a great stay. Would book again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"All-around great spot. Comfortable beds and bedding and nice, clean bathroom. As is shown in the pictures, renters should be aware that doors are not solid between rooms. In hot summer weather, folks should be comfortable opening downstairs doors and windows in the evening to welcome cool air in and reset for nighttime, as there is no venting/open window in upstairs loft."

The wifi was sufficient for both myself and my husband to work remotely as needed. As an aside, the bathroom is located in the bedroom and does not have a full privacy door or fan. The door is a slider with slats and could potentially create discomfort for some. The space was a great base camp for our adventures in Hailey and Ketchum!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cute and cozy apartment! Was concerned it would be too small but it worked well for 3 family members and a pet if a bit snug. Wood river trail is less than a block away and made dog walk easy and so enjoyable. Kitchen and equipment were excellent and we were able to cook most of our meals. Hope to stay again!

Overall I had a great stay. Only things that were less than optimal was the master bedroom bed, which seemed a bit soft or lumpy for my tastes. Other guests might also be aware that there is a limited amount of hot water -- 10 min or less in shower.
I would absolutely stay here again."
