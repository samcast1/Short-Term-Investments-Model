2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place looked just like the pictures. Loved the cheerful colors in living room and bedroom. It has easy access to main streets, close to downtown and a short drive to Hastings College Campus. This is an old property but newly renovated. The outside needs lots of work that the owners plan to begin this Spring/Summer. If in Hastings in the future, we would consider staying in this area again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at The Loft. I hope for more when I'm in the locale. What a find! Just as described. Beautiful setting, beautiful property. Thanks, Kara."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. If hotels had run their properties the way Kara does, airbnb would never have started.
I have traveled to all 50 states and stayed in many beautiful hotels and resorts. For lodging around this small city, I cannot imagine there is a better property anywhere. Totally peaceful. Totally private. Totally beautiful. Totally worth the price. I have already told Kara that I want their airbnb to be my home away from home when next I'm in the area. Totally satisfied."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Will def be back. Beautiful and comfy.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely love this Airbnb. Super clean and beautifully decorated in such a nice location. Already reserved for next visit.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved it! It was conveniently located since we were having a wedding reception at the fairgrounds! Kara was quick to answer any and all questions and flexible with check in and out! Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Kara‚Äôs home is very beautiful inside and out! Large windows for a scenic beauty of the countryside, feels homey and comfortable. Kara herself was very kind and responsive!
Another plus was her store! has a lot of nice things, definitely would recommend to check it out!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We always have a great time here!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a great stay at the loft! It‚Äôs a beautiful location and very clean and spacious inside! My son especially loved looking out over the farmland and seeing animals close by. Kara was very helpful and friendly and was available to us if we needed anything. A great choice for anyone looking to relax in a beautiful setting!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Loft was comfortable and spacious with so much light from all the windows! Kara was incredibly responsive and very gracious with a late checkout for us. The beds were comfortable, the water pressure in the shower was amazing, and the washer and dryer were handy. The moonrise out the front window was beautiful. The location has a building across the road and next door, so not as remote as I thought it might be, but it was a great spot close to Hastings. I definitely recommend Kara‚Äôs place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Loft as we were vendors at the The Barn Spring Boutique show. Can‚Äôt say how convenient this was!
The view is amazing. Kara has done a wonderful job with the Loft.
Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Who knew that my best Airbnb experience would be in Hastings, NE. Very spacious living space. Great hosts. You can tell they put a lot of thought into providing a great experience. Highly recommend this over a hotel if you need to stay around Hastings.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were greeted with a friendly smile when we arrived. The place was immaculate. Beautiful area and very quiet.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Loft at the Barn was a wonderful place to stay! Located just outside of Hastings, it is incredibly peaceful, and if you‚Äôre up early, the sunrise is stunning. The Loft is exactly as pictured and is perfect for a peaceful get-away."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Another fabulous stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott went above and beyond to provide us with everything we could possibly need. Exceptional host and a beautiful location. So very grateful for our trip and hope to stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time on the property! Amazing, (back to nature but yet has everything you need and more!) Host is amazing as well! We will be back and refer to everyone we know!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to get away from the city and relax
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great for dogs.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place tucked away in the country great place to unwind after a long day of traveling
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Scott‚Äôs place was a lovely, pastoral location that was very comfortable and pet friendly. Everything worked well, there was wonderful snacks and easy instructions! The place needs some updating, but that said, everything worked well."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in the area to visit family. We found this location to be a wonderful place to relax with our grandchildren. The house itself is well loved and comfortable. The property is beautiful with rustic charm. Scott was very responsive & helpful to all questions. Hopefully the house will be available the next we visit family. Would definitely recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful farm stay with beautiful historic barns! Not too far from Hastings, NE. Easy to run to walmart and grab what you need for groceries or a bite to eat. The beehives were cool to see. I definitely felt relaxed here. It was very calming!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's place was a little slice of heaven for us. He provided all the info needed for our stay in advance, and was very thorough. The house was roomy, clean, and a very comfortable and relaxing place to stay after a long drive and days full of crane watching. There were even some complimentary snacks and beverages waiting for us, which was a very nice little perk. The location was beautiful, set in beautiful farm country and had plenty of places to sit and enjoy the fresh air, look out on the soon to be wild flower field (have to go back to see that), and always greeted by 3 super friendly barn cats. It is off the beaten path but close enough to the area we spent time exploring. Ideal for what we look for. Quiet, peaceful, and unique. Scott checked in via text to make sure things were up to par and I felt confident that if we had any concerns, they would be addressed. I sincerely hope we are able to stay here again. Fantastic place, great price, and kind/friendly owner. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, quiet and cozy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful and peaceful place. Scott the host was great!
Would recommend to everyone! Thanks ScottüôÇ"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house ain't fancy. It's an old single story farm house updated to make it very comfortable by a host that goes the extra mile to make it a great experience. If you want to stay in a house in a former historic farm yard with lots of awesome old barns and buildings, where you can turn your dog loose and take a nice walk around the thirteen acres this is it. Deer, wild turkeys and songbirds will keep you busy watching wildlife. We have stayed in a lot of AB&B's over the years and this one has to be #1 on our list. The property and access to it coupled with a super great host who you can tell cares about you being there and enjoying it makes this place special. One piece of advice - if you love the outdoors and history of the people that settled in NE make room in your schedule to spend some time here instead of checking in late and leaving early. We did two nights and are so happy we did. And oh yeah, the cats are cool and will give your pooch a lot of distance."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful property and host.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott's place is so peaceful and cozy! My family really enjoyed it, and we so appreciated being able to bring my little dog. Scott went out of his way to provide us with some extras, and there was plenty of space. It is a great place to stay during sandhill crane season! You have to drive a little ways to see them, but it is a lovely drive and well worth it. I highly recommend staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect family stay - the house was so well stocked with games, books for kids, and snacks, but I think the real highlight were the friendly cats."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great stay here the place and property was amazing host Scott was great. Best place to stay if ur in Hastings Nebraska. Property is just beautiful
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed at Scott‚Äôs place while driving to Cheyenne, Wyoming. When we arrived Scott was out back with a big fire, we enjoyed the warmth, and learning the history of the place. He quickly gave us the best eats and breweries in town and was very friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was absolutely perfect for our needs. It‚Äôs exactly how described and went beyond our expectations. We will definitely be staying again when visiting our family in the area. It was the perfect spot to ride out a Christmas blizzard. We had all the things we needed and never felt like there was something we were missing. Definitely a spot to check out.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I really liked this place. Lots of nice little touches and a quite place off the beaten bath to take a break. Was just what I needed
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay. The house is on a lovely piece of land. We enjoyed the company of friendly farm cats, made dinner over the fire one evening, and felt completely at home. I was able to bring my dog, which was a definite addition to the experience.
Scott was a great host, checking in to see if we needed anything and answering questions promptly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,enjoyed the hospitality and the peace and quiet will be staying again when I return
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and will readily book again in the future!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"While traveling from Omaha down to New Mexico, this place seemed like the perfect place to rest before heading further south. We were so pleased with the ambiance and cozyness of the immaculately clean house. The highlight was the visit from two unusually friendly cats that we let inside the house for a few hours for feline entertainment and companionship. before they went back outside to return to the main house. We had to leave early in the morning, so didn't have time to tour the property (which the host encouraged) but hope to do so on a return visit. Maybe in the spriing when the native plant meadow that the owners are developing comes into bloom. Marty."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and family are great hosts. The property makes for a great relaxing visit with lots of nature. This was our second stay, and we plan to visit again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such an enjoyable stay at this property. We were given very detailed instructions prior to arriving and any question that we had during our stay, Scott was quick to respond. We enjoyed being able to walk around the property, sit on the covered deck or by the fire pit. We picked this destination to get away and relax for a few days and we were able to do just that. I would highly recommend this property to anyone and we look forward to booking again in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,would stay again for sure.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This location is beautiful! The description is spot-on and the house is spacious. There's convenient access to all the amenities listed by the owners. The place is roam-friendly for dogs and relatively private with the exception of a neighboring house that shares the driveway. And the covered patio out front is perfect for relaxing in the evenings.
If you happen to be traveling with reactive dogs, be mindful: the house next door has a dog and there were quite a few barn cats and kittens (super friendly) on the property at the time of our stay who weren't shy about trying to get into the car, house, etc. If your dog is cat-friendly, they'll get along great.
I highly recommend grabbing a cup of coffee and strolling out to the backfield at first sunrise for a peaceful and serene start to the day!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Two kids and two adults for two days had plenty to do at the Kleebstead. Kitchen and bathroom were well-stocked, and we felt right at home with the slippers, bathrobes, and snacks laid out for us. We made friends with the very friendly barn cats, enjoyed the fire pit, and loved exploring the farm. This is a great spot for a relaxing weekend getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I don‚Äôt want to wax too rhapsodic about this place, but we love it. Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for, but if you want a great place to hang with your significant, dog, family, etc. , this is the place. 13 acres, out buildings, fire pit, all the wood you need, and peace and quiet. The PERFECT place to separate young kids from their tablets!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful spot/location outside of town; very peaceful. hosts are very nice and helpful even to a city boy like me. if youre looking to get away and relax, i recommend this place. like they said, its the ""real nebraska""."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This was a very convenient place for us and it is so beautiful outside.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was okay, it could do with some simple updates/repairs. The outdoor space is what makes this place worth staying there. We enjoyed wandering around the property and relaxing on the patio after a long day of driving."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place to spend a night in a very well equipped cottage on our epic journey with our two Great Pyrenees moving from VT to Colorado! And Scott could not have been more helpful, including returning a computer cable left behind. . . Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,AMAZING STAY. This place is even better in person than the pictures show. Absolutely awesome views of a well kept homestead. Had a great time walking the pups around the area. Truly awesome.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here before in one of the two properties. This time we rented both houses and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Bathrooms, Cabinets, Pantry and Frig are well stocked with all the necessities. Beverages and candy were much appreciated. Wonderful garden space is beautiful. Love everything about the property."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're interested in a peaceful getaway, this is an excellent location. A small farm with two houses, barns, a modern pavilion with grill and firepit, a pumpkin patch, a creek-side walking path circling their field & ending in a wooded trail; this was a treat for the price.
The host was generous; providing wine, drinks, soda, tea, snacks, locally made soaps, robes, slippers etc. A pet-loving gentleman with a seemingly easy-going nature, he seemed intent on providing a quality experience. The real difference between 4* and 5*, was that, while sociable, they never encroached on my privacy.
The house itself was quite nice; a master bedroom, spare, and children's room, a lovely bath, home-chef worthy kitchen, and a front room w/ bay windows to catch sunrise. Everything in the house is stocked; they even included board games
The only drawback is that you are a decent drive from a city & you'll want to take that into account. Cell service can be spotty, but the internet is solid."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a relaxing trip to the Nebraska country side. It provided all the comforts of home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Scott‚Äôs place is modern farm house. It has lot of upscaled remodeling. Especially kitchen and bathroom. Lots of space for 2 of us and our dog. Beautiful surroundings very clean and comfy. It is short stay but we enjoyed stay his house. Definitely recommended to others!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing farm setting. I slept wonderfully, and Scott was very kind and full of information for a traveler like myself.
I would absolutely stay here again if possible."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott‚Äôs place was lovely, made to feel right at home after a long day of travelling. Enjoyed our stay, the place was lovely and clean and had everything we needed. Thank you Scott.
A++"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We were just passing through and needed a place to stay with our dogs. Scott‚Äôs place was welcoming and had so many wonderful extra touches. I would recommend this to anyone - my only regret is that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the top three Airbnb spots I‚Äôve stayed. The house is neat, homey, and extremely comfortable. You are on a family homestead that is in the middle of corn fields in the heart of Nebraska. Three friendly kittens entertained us during our visit and Scott and Jane rolled out the red carpet in every way. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this spot any higher. We just wish that it wasn‚Äôt just a quick stop for us on a long trip, I easily could have spent several days relaxing there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For anyone wanting a country get-away, this is an awesome place for a good price. A beautiful old farm with mature trees. Large covered deck, complete with a gas grill, lounge chairs and lights - we spent a lot of time there. Easy to get to Red Cloud to see the Willa Cather sights, and to Hastings even closer. Scott and Jane provided so many extras - wine, gifts, snacks and they were ready to answer any questions. We felt right at home. I'm sure we'll be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were later than we planned, and it was dark outside, but instructions were accurate and easy to follow, even with a detour.
The outside was well lit, and the home was welcoming and spacious. I wish we would have had more time to enjoy the patio and stars!
It was very comfortable, and Scott was responsive to our questions."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very quiet and cozy place! They have the place fully stocked with lots of snacks, drinks and plenty of things in the cuppard.
very clean place and the sheets smelled lovely.
we onlystayed one quick night but it was wonderful."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,I didn‚Äôt actually stay there but some of my family members did‚Ä¶ the patio/deck area was a big hit!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, Scott has done a lot to make our visit very nice. Just walking around on the paths they had was great"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful farm. Great house. Considerate host. Would definitely recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Off the beating path and quiet. Exactly what we were looking for after a long day of driving. Scott was a good communicator. Just wish we could have enjoyed the nice outdoors longer.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were pleased with our first stay at an Airbnb! We had a perfect overnight stay there with my mom, while she was in town visiting. It was a good road trip to get away from the city traffic and enjoy nature. We appreciated the place being dog friendly. We were pleasantly surprised with snacks and cold drinks available. Scott offered goodies from his garden, which we forgot to pick before we left. We are close enough to visit again! Next time I will look through the cookbooks! Great host and beautiful property!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful! Place was very nice, welcoming, clean & peaceful. Host provided lots of little amenities that was very much appreciated. Would love to stay here again and for longer."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This well-stocked home was great for our family! The ping-pong table in the basement provided hours of entertainment. The spacious outside deck was great for our family to gather while our son and his new wife opened their wedding gifts there. The ramp to the deck was wonderful for the grandmas who use canes to get around. The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful and we enjoyed the many birds, including a Great-Horned Owl, who made their appearance. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family felt right at home. Even the beds were amazing too in both the homes. Can't say enough great things about the host and both their homes on this property. The sunrise and sunsets and fireflies also made it extra magical!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott was very helpful during our stay and super helpful. Because of availability we were going to switch to the smaller second home on the property for our last night, but Scott kindly allowed us to stay in the larger home so we didn‚Äôt have to move during our stay. The modern farmhouse is spotless, private, and a lovely place to gather or enjoy the peace and quiet!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely enjoyed our stay. It reminds me of how much I miss living in the country. I would definitely come again and stay longer.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a comfortable house with the most serene outdoor space, this is the place for you. The host was very quick to respond and had lights on ready for my arrival. You can tell a lot of consideration was put into the amendments of the home. There are books and artwork throughout the home that tells the story of Nebraska and the people who live here. I will definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down one of the very best stays we have ever had. The place and surroundings were simply amazing. Home was fully stocked with everything you might need plus more. Host was on site and took us on a tour of his lovely barn, sauna, and garden. This place exceeded our expectations!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, heated, cooled with lots of amenities provided. Just don‚Äôt expect your vehicle to stay clean with the stone roads in the area, nothing a car wash can‚Äôt take care of. Beautiful scenery and plenty to do to stay entertained."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful property secluded and private. Loved having the space to let my dogs roam around. Only stayed the night after a long day of travel. Inspiring garden.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We stopped here on our way from Wisconsin to Colorado. What a peaceful stop after a long car ride. Great space for our family of five. They had lots of extra amenities like: drinks, shampoo/body wash, fresh fruit, cooking supplies and games."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott's place is a wonderful retreat from the busy world. The space was clean and very well equipped. We instantly felt at home. The grounds are peaceful, with birds singing, deer meandering through, and plenty of room to wander, sit and read in the shade, etc. We just got home and are ready to go back. Scott was very responsive and helpful. We look forward to going back to Ayr again soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A stop over on a road trip to Denver, Scott's place was wonderful and refreshing. They were super thoughtful, and after 7 hours on the road, we really appreciated how they anticipated our needs. Fun property too--wish we had more time just to linger..."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our fourth time coming to Scott's place. It is such a special experience and it's one that is growing with our family every year. He consistently is adding things to make this such a unique and beautiful time. We don't even feel like we have to leave the property to really have a full family vacation. This time I came with one more child, and next time I plan to come with another. This will be our consistent family vacation spot as so many of our loved ones live nearby. It also has become a blessing to them as many can't travel very far and it provides a bit of peace and beauty that they don't always get to experience. We absolutely loved his new deck and seeing the bees that he is now keeping. Along with the garden and how it has exploded. What a beautiful homestead. Thank you so much Scott for loving this place so well."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jane run a friendly getaway. And if you find the need to get away, this is is not bad spot. Ten minutes from charming Hastings and far enough away in the fields to feel like you're permitted to wind down. This place will feel like it's yours while you're here."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Scott and Janes place - what can I say? My girl Tina said it best... ""You're simply the best! Better than all the rest!""
We have been guests at nearly 40 Airbnb locations and I have to say that Scott & Jane's place is the most comfortable and beautiful that we have been to. We stayed for over 2 months and the time flew by! It broke our hearts to leave. This was our very first visit to Nebraska, and now we are seriously considering moving there someday.
We arrived in time for the Sandhill Crane migration in March - it was amazing! Scott's place is teaming with wildlife and loaded with beautiful song birds. It's was food for the soul and we can't wait to come back someday - Scott made us feel like family!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"For some unknown reason, our access code to the house wasn't working, and we had to wait a while to receive another code. Once we eventually entered the property, we were entirely satisfied. It was lovely and warm. There were snacks and a bottle of wine awaiting us. A nice hot shower washed away our tiredness, and we got a good night's sleep. Our dog was more than happy with the outdoor space. I definitely recommend it. It's beautiful and peaceful, just as described ."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is nice and cozy. We had everything we needed plus snacks and drinks. Nice and peaceful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Close enough to Hastings to get what we needed and to find restaurants, if we wanted. Secluded enough for peace and quiet. A perfect get-away. My daughter and I had some great walks, too."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Anybody who stays here will truly be blessed it was an amazing place and so peaceful! It was a great time for my family and I and both host are so kind and accommodating! After a long day of driving it was nice to be welcomed by the treats on the table. The beds were extremely comfortable and plenty of items my family had a blast and if we find ourselves in the area will definitely be staying again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place. While there are 2 places on this property (we had only reserved one building) it's very open and beautiful. Loved the firepit and outdoor area, even though it was chilly when we stayed, it was beautiful. Everything was as described. Beds were comfortable, and the house was spacious enough for us. Would love to stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,such a cute little get away!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay far enough away from everything to be quiet and secluded but not too far from where we needed to be. Wonderful place if your visiting hastings or just want to get away. Loved the comfort and space.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Omg the homE and property were beautiful perfect stay!! Thank you
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to be during subzero temperatures. We were never without warmth and HOT water. It was truly a home away from home. The bay window had no way to be covered, being an EXTREMELY private person; I would have felt better if every window offered a covering. Nonetheless, a great winter vacation."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I spent 2 days at Scott's place, and we had a most peaceful time! It was too cold to enjoy the lighted covered deck area or do a firepit but hope to be back again when the weather is not below freezing. Our dogs loved getting to explore some of the land, and we enjoyed walking around some of the original buildings on the property. Again, we wish to come back when we can spend more time outdoors. We loved all the little touches like slippers, robes, and snacks, and my son quickly went through the pennies for the gum machineüòã This home is so cozy and inviting. Each room has a portable heater and tons of blankets and LOTS of extra towels.
Thank you for sharing this property full of history and coziness to us üíú
Merry Christmas!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This is our home away from home when visiting central Nebraska. It is very secluded, yet only a few miles to Hastings. For us, it is a refreshing retreat. It is a very adorable rural property with an the amenities."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, awesome sauna"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time I‚Äôve stayed here and both times have been wonderful. Scott is a great host who does everything he can to make staying there peaceful and relaxing.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and Jane have something very special--their homes have it all. EMPHATICALLY FIVE STARS
We've always loved the Great Plains and have at times made compromises to experience an authentic life here.
Staying at Scott's and Jane's doesn't require any compromises; it's a perfect Plains experience. Blazing internet 10 miles outside of town under unbelievable skyscapes day and night (?!?). Soothing railroad soundtrack not too close, just right. Kind and soulful designs and amenities that encourage time together. A lovely, manicured prairie path to encourage steps and outdoor engagement. Great beds, easy appliances, and stellar climate comfort.
Everything hit us just right and we give a SUPER STRONG RECOMMENDATION .
Thanksgiving Day, the Nebraska wind was just howling, 30+ MPH, but those cedars and mighty elms shielded us and created a perfect calm around our gathered family. That's when I knew just how lucky we were to stay here. We were secure and protected and focused on good times together. It was just amazing and we are so grateful."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We already booked our next visit!
Scott was a phenomenal host - very responsive, extremely helpful and kind.
The house is comfortable, incredibly well-stocked, and exactly what two college friends were hoping for in a quiet weekend.
Hastings is a close drive and a fun town to explore (check out Odyssey for dinner).
Thanks so much for a memorable visit - looking forward to our next trip."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott went way beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.
This place has a very well equipped kitchen with everything you need. Three bedrooms and nice bathroom. Very large covered deck with grill. Scott is a great host and there when you need him. We had a great stay!
Thanks Scott and ""13 acres country get away"" for your great hospitality!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and Jane are great hosts and work to ensure your needs are met. My wife and I stayed a few days for bird hunting local public grounds, and we really enjoyed the homestead. The accommodations are comfortable, and well thought out. Internet, TV, games, books are provided if you want or need to spend some time indoors. The outdoor area is abundantly furnished, a great place to relax, enjoy a fire, and watch the sun rise over the back acreage. Great stay, Super Hosts, and just really nice people!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We're on a roadtrip to Georgia and this home was the perfect place for us to stop by for the week while we work remotely. Below are what we enjoyed and one thing that could be better (although definitely no deal breaker for us. More for awareness...). Thanks for the stay Scott and Jane!
We enjoyed:
1) the 13 acres of fenced yard (note that there are openings in the fence that our medium size dogs have escaped and they once went on the road so we had to keep an eye on them at all times).
2) fully stocked home with drinks, snacks, toiletry.
3) very kind and attentive hosts. Scott came quickly to fix the freezer being stuck and love the food recommendations from Jane!
4) the home location is peaceful and located amongst farms.
5) the walking loop trail in the fenced backyard made nice morning, afternoon and evening walks with our pooches.
6) Fast internet.
What could be better:
1) the home is on a dirt road where cars drive through fast. The windows facing the road could use an upgrade so that it seals completely to prevent fine dust coming in."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious place, clean, quiet, and pretty. There is a large yard for pets or children. Plenty of space in the home, also a ping pong table in the basement along with more than enough games. The WiFi was great. The pasture path was great for my wife and pup. Would definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, can't wait to go back! Plenty to see on the property: walking trail, covered patio, fire pit. This home shows off the natural beauty of the area so well and offers all the comforts of home for a great rate. You know an AirBnB is good when it inspires you to want to live in the state."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time! The country setting was just what we needed. We enjoyed walking around the field for a sunrise walk. The fire pit was a great way to end each day. Great supply of wood. The hammock and ping pong table were a big hit with our grandkids. The kitchen was well supplied with a variety of drinks and welcoming snacks. Great place for our family long weekend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,felt like home nice clean loved everything about it
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This airbnb was a great halfway point between Denver and Chicago. It was cozy and quaint in a quiet area and was just SO beautiful! There was a path cut around the pasture where I could walk my dog and she loved the area so much. There was so much for her to explore. There were snacks left out along with wine and some more goodies in the fridge which was an unexpected amazing touch. Host was there just in case we needed anything upon checking in and was very friendly. I'd definitely find myself here again for a longer period! I wish I could give more than 5 stars for this stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We can‚Äôt thank Scott enough for taking the time to meet and help us out on Saturday evening. It was a pleasure to meet him and his lovely daughter. Zeke and Bruiser (our dogs) loved meeting new people and their socialization is very important, so thank you for being so patient with them. They loved spending a little time with your daughter and could have let her pet them for only about the next 12-15 hours. üòÜ
1- Excellent facility and grounds, the country feel that it provides is familiar for us as we also live in a farm community. The difference is that the wide open space allowed our boys to run and smell and chase to their hearts content.
2- The special amenities that are provided are above and beyond what we have ever experienced before with an AirB&B location. The snacks were a godsend (sorry we pilfered so many üòä) as we arrived so late and hadn‚Äôt had any food since breakfast. We very much appreciated them. Also the red wine was very good. We only had a glass each as it was late, but have the rest of the bottle for tonight. Thanks again for that.
3- The deck/fire pit area was fantastic. The lighting was perfect and put us at ease almost immediately. We wish/ hope that our third stay will have something like this. It was a perfect setting for us to celebrate our faux honeymoon as we never were able to have one since we got married in 2011, just know that the 1st night of our trip is considered to be a perfect setting to start out this trip.
4- The home was immaculate and very clean. Judging from the clearly defined sanitary scent coming from the back storeroom, it is clear that Scott takes cleaning and sanitation as the highest priority.
Thanks again, and if we are ever passing through Ayr again you can be SURE we will be booking our stay with you.
Dennis üëçüèºü•É"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! Perfect quiet getaway. We will definitely be back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location and very clean. The host did an outstanding job with communicating and having the houses ready. Highly recommend!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with great views!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for one night during a cross country road trip and the place was everything that we needed to relax and recharge! Well cared for and accommodating with beautiful grounds.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The property was exactly like the link stung stated. Very nice place. Would be great for a family or a couple like us. Enjoyed it
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice place and location
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved, loved, loved it here! We were on a long trip and needed a safe place to park a trailer with a vehicle on it. It was this and so much more. Scott‚Äôs place was relaxing, spotless and stocked beyond belief. It was foggy the next morning and we took some amazing pictures of the farm. I love Airbnb because we would have never had this experience at a roadside hotel!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott is the perfect super host! If you are looking for a peaceful retreat from the city, this is your place! The houseis completely loaded with everything youwould need to chillax and just enjoy the peace of rural America. Modern updates, cozy furniture, comfortable beds, plenty of different pillows, and ceiling fans! The covered patio and fire pit were our favorite evening retreat. The place is farm like setting; barns, rolling hills, grass prairie, beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and the stars! Scott accommodated are specific needs, communicated exceptionally well, and made sure we were comfortable. The place has a sister house (bigger and more modern) thatwe plan on checking out next time! Perfect place for family reunions, or multi-family getaways. Thank you Scott and Jane!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is beautiful! We only stayed the night, as we had a long drive the next morning; but we would have loved to stay and explore the land. The hosts were incredibly kind, considerate and communicated so well with us! üòÄ They went out of their way, such as getting the pack n play and high chairs out for us prior to our arrival. (My wife and I were traveling with 3 kids under the age of 6, one being an 11 month old infant.) We really loved that not only was the kitchen well stocked (lots of spices and condiments) but they even left us a bottle of wine and snacks‚Äîit was very welcoming! Scott very much has the gift of hospitality. Our thanks!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice clean place
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We appreciated the snacks, the drinks, the comfy furniture, beds, pillows. Having a washer/dryer is a nice touch. Honestly, everything was nice. It is so much nicer than a hotel! The communication was excellent. The wine was a nice touch, we‚Äôd never tried Chardonnay before.. The outside patio area & the farm easily makes this a weekend trip and you wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to leave & go see other things."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was magnificent! The perfect pitstop for a cross country road trip. The hosts were fantastic at communicating and giving ample information to insure the check in process and overall stay went smoothly. Both the house and property were beautiful and exactly what I needed for my travels with two dogs. I would absolutely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wry clean place and very accommodating! Great views nice place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful!!!
Was so easy to relax after long day of driving.
It was so refreshing to have my morning cup of coffee and enjoy watching the sunrise on the property. Though we didn‚Äôt get a chance to use it, the sauna was unique and seemed like it would be nice to enjoy.
The hosts were so nice and responsive, would definitely recommend this stay to anyone looking for some peace and quiet."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is so wonderful you will not regret stopping for a few nights. the owners are very friendly, the place is well kept and clean, and there are tons of mindful touches. there are some nice trails to walk around the property and some great relaxing spots outside."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect spot to stay and be close to Hastings & Grand Island. The beds were the most comfortable & quiet ones I‚Äôve slept on yet at an Air BnB.
Breakfast was tasty at Back Alley Bakery.
The home is clean and cozy. This space is really phenomenal for dogs. Our pup could really run and play fetch. Would üíØ stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful and unique experience to spend a night out in the country of rural Nebraska. I was just passing though on a cross country road trip, so this was exactly the break I needed from days of interstate driving. Best part was that my traveling companion (a border collie) thoroughly enjoyed herself exploring the grounds and trails around the pasture. The place itself is well-equipped, clean, comfy, and rustic. Also has multiple great outdoor spaces for hanging out. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a place to kick back and relax, this is the spot. The 13 acres of ground were full of birds, small wildlife, and beautiful scenery. The house was super clean, well, stocked with all the supplies we would need, and there were lots of extras we weren't expecting. Scott and Jane were super hosts, always responding immediately. Great weekend experience!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are in the area and need a lovely home & peaceful grounds, just stay here. Taking my dog for a morning walk around the property was serene and relaxing. Someone goes to the trouble of mowing a wonderful loop pathway for easy navigation of the natural landscape.
We stopped over for the night during a cross-country move and the hospitality offered was 2nd to none. So many thoughtful touches for the guests. Really felt welcome and safe and comfortable in a most charming way. Could not have asked for a better experience.
A little bit off the highway to find the place, but well worth the small effort. The nearby town of Hastings is a hidden gem.
We loved our stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great quiet place to stay. My dog loved exploring the property.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott is a super duper host, great communication and so much extra care and detail to ensure we had the best experience. Lots of extra treats and amenities on top of a very clean and very nice house! The house and property are so cool and very peaceful. We‚Äôll definitely look to stay here and with Scott in the future. Hands down best Airbnb experience ever!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A hidden gem just outside of Hastings. The rental was simple, but when you have so much land to run around and explore it‚Äôs perfect for a long weekend stay. The house was easy to find and the communication from the time of booking to checkout was great."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"The most gorgeous airbnb. Beautiful property, extremely calm and quiet. The house is also lovely, it is very clear that Scott genuinely cares about the guests‚Äô experience! There are so many little gifts like snacks and drinks in the fridge. It was an absolute pleasure staying there, wish we could have stayed for longer."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If i could give more than 5 stars i would. Scott was a phenomenal host in every way.
We thoroughly enjoyed our family vacation/reunion.
Thank you so much for a wonderful week."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott's property is gorgeous and would make an absolutely ideal spot for a reunion or small wedding. Its absolutely worth the drive. Quiet, secluded with tons of patio space, comfy chairs, wifi, charming rooms, and plenty of kitchen equipment."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Clean rooms and responsive host! We didn‚Äôt care for low flying planes spraying chemicals so much as we couldn‚Äôt spend time outside. The host offered many nice treats and all the essentials we may need to be comfortable! Great for a family traveling!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Phenomenal - we loved everything about our stay here - I wish we had been able to stay longer! The outdoor space here is phenomenal - I enjoyed my morning coffee on deck and my loved the yard and the path around the pasture. Inside you'll find Scott and Jane have really mastered what it means to be an AirBnb Superhost. The updates are beautiful, the house is spotless and well stocked and your thoughtful hosts have left ample supplies and gifts. You will not regret booking place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our first experience at an air BNB and Scott set the bar high for our expectations going forward. The house had everything you could need during your stay -- all the way down to bug spray and makeup remover wipes. There was a storm moving in and Scott was thoughtful enough to reach out with weather alerts and let us know where the basement door was in case the weather became severe enough that we needed to seek shelter.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect quiet house away from it all, but still close enough to anything you need in town. It also has every modern amenity you could want, including EXCEPTIONALLY FAST WiFi. My wife and I were only here for one night with our dog, but this would be a wonderful place to stay for a while."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was fantastic! Remote and quiet. Lots of places to get out and walk.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a truly relaxing place: a first-rate house out in the country.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here. It was a beautiful location and Scott was very hospitable.
The house was clean and comfortably furnished. There were lots of little touches that made our visit more pleasant, from the games and books to attractive bedding for the kids to a basket of goodies waiting for us on the dining room table. There were plenty of cookware and utensils and even extra dog dishes in case we had forgotten ours.
But the real attraction was outside the house! The kids had so much fun exploring the barns and hammocks that we had a hard time getting them back in the car.
Scott also communicated clearly about how to access the property and other important details.
Overall it was a great experience. My husband was grumbling a little bit about having to drive a little ways off the highway, but when we got there he quickly agreed that it was worth the short detour! The peace, quiet, and comfort made a wonderful break from a long car trip."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Scott is a great host. We would definitely stay at this property again. It is a charming old house. With lots of character. All the amenities anyone could ask for. The surrounding property is well maintained. And perfect for anyone traveling with pets. Our two Labrador Retrievers loved the open space to run. The kids enjoyed it way more than any hotel we have stayed at. Very quiet and tranquil for a relaxing stay. Check in was flawless and very convenient. Thanks again for a great stay from the Lowe‚Äôs
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"great host...money well spent, and if you like, fresh mulberries in the summer at the right time. would make a wonderful ice cream if you want."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome and quiet out of the way place. This would be a good spot for a get away and not just somewhere to sleep but it's awesome for that too.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a great get away. We will definitely be back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay of 6 nights at this location. It was so peaceful and relaxing. There are hundreds of trees filled with singing birds and the old-time farm atmosphere brought back a lot of memories. We will definitely come back. Scott was a terrific host and very accommodating.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best Airbnb experience we‚Äôve had yet. Love the trees, the trail and field behind the house. Great appliances and amenities and everything smells great :-) We will definitely be returning!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful land, lovely house with nice extra touches of snacks, drinks, bathrobes. Fantastic outdoor spaces to sit, eat, lounge. Gorgeous old barns to gaze at! Hosts helpful and friendly!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is perfect!! Quaint, but not too small. The scenery is gorgeous and the best way to wake up was hearing tons of birds sing. Beautiful outdoor covered patio and nice walking trails. Nice 11 minute drive from Hastings! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and peaceful get away! Very clean and wonderful hospitality!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place exceeded all our expectations. The pictures look nice but don‚Äôt fully capture the serenity and rejuvenating energy of this property. After several days on the road this was the perfect place to rest and reset. Between the distant lightning storm at night and the bird songs and foggy meadow in the morning we felt so at ease there. The large property is fun to explore and our elderly dog loved it too. Thanks for being a great host!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I just love this beautiful location and it is even nicer since my last stay with lots of outdoor living. I will definitely be back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place exceeded all expectations of comfort and that feeling of home. Full kitchen, stacked with drinks and snacks was a first for us and we were blown away at the level of detail! Bathroom was one of the nicest I‚Äôve seen, wildlife watching section was amazing. Only thing I would change that would bring me back for a whole weekend is a hot tub. That‚Äôs the only thing I felt was missing from the ranch, especially cause you get so many towels lol
Stay here as soon as you can and stay on a real ranch!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is going to make you fall in love with Nebraska. This is the most beautiful, peaceful and heart warming place we‚Äôve ever stayed in. The hosts love this place, and it shows. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property, lots of amenities in the home. Quaint but close enough to Hastings which has more than what you need! A little lake to fish in about a mile away also!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a remarkably responsive host! Scott replied lightning-fast to all communication and was just extremely kind and helpful in every way. We arrived late and he had the house lit up and ready for us. There were snacks for us and the kids, a variety of drinks, and I was so happy to discover coffee and decaf coffee in the morning too. We were traveling with our 3 and 5 year-olds and really enjoyed all the special kid items! There‚Äôs a little table and chairs that they used, lots of kids books we looked through, and even kids plates and utensils. Thanks so much for that! At times, while doing online work, the wi-fi was a bit spotty, but it was also very rainy the whole time we were there. The DirecTv is a great setup, especially when traveling with kids. Thanks for such a pleasant stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is amazing! This was my second time staying and it gets better every time. Scott sent a very detailed note with check-in process, updates to the Airbnb, and other information a week beforehand. They have a new covered deck which is so amazing! Our first night there, Scott sent a message reminding us of some unique features like the paved pathway through the pasture since we had our dog with us. It‚Äôs a great walk and so fun for the dog to be off leash and explore. You feel secluded due to the trees surrounding the property and no close neighbors beside the other house on the property. Wifi worked great for the time that we needed it. They have everything you need on hand: toiletries, washer/dryer & detergent, dishes, etc.
Scott replies so quickly to any questions / comments and really makes it feel like you‚Äôre staying at a friend‚Äôs place. We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic place to stay! Stayed here on our way back from Colorado with our 2 dogs. The property was better than the pictures! Great spacious yard, awesome new deck, the dogs loved it! Not to mention the host was fantastic, and there were some nice snacks waiting for us upon our arrival. We‚Äôre already talking about visiting again! Our one night wasn‚Äôt enough!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Number one Airbnb I have been to. Super clean, lots of options for things to do (ping pong, camp fire, hammocks, bbq) and the host was great 10/10"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place very homey. Scott is an amazing host!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Truly a great, beautiful place! They‚Äôve thought of everything and it was very comfortable"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place a fantastic escape. The communication was timely and detailed and the place is extremely charming. We will definitely be staying here again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful setting! Nice large outdoor covered patio, only 3 steps to entry, then everything was on one level besides the basement that had a ping pong table for the young adults/competitors. Nice large bedrooms, comfortable kitchen and dining room. Very clean and homey. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt spend too much time on the property as we were in the area for graduations; however, we had the pleasure of grilling out & the experience was amazing. Our whole family wishes we had extra time to start & enjoy the little slice of HEAVEN! If you have children, they had all the amenities you would need! We would come back & recommend to all friends and family!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott was very proactive in providing information before my arrival, then helpful and understanding as my plans changed and I needed to modify my stay. The house is very comfortable and well appointed, with a beautiful outdoor covered deck area and lovely grounds."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was impressed greatly by how everything was set up and ready inside and outside. Can't get much better than this host!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect great communication, hospitality, cleanliness, and equipment. Dogs are allowed which was a great perk."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place to stay!! So many little touches for the children, the pups and the adults, alike. The host was super friendly. The beds were comfy. The setting was peaceful, quiet and relaxing. We left wishing we could have stayed longer!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute place to stay! All the comforts of home and then some! Communication was great and the special personal touches were wonderful. My dogs definitely loved running around on the property not to mention so many great places to photograph the beauty of the land. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome spot, great host, clean, and away from the everyday stresses of life. Will definitely be staying again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 Stars simply isn‚Äôt enough; Scott‚Äôs place deserves All the Stars!!! We seriously can‚Äôt express how lovely and magical our short stay was. Communication was perfect, fast & easy. The accommodations and all the little extras were so thoughtful and generous. This absolutely stunning property will steal a little piece of your heart. Comfortable, private, clean! If you‚Äôre thinking about booking a stay, just do it already!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little cabin on a farm. This place really has everything you would need and lots of extras. They left us snacks, drinks and even locally made hand soap. It was also very clean and comfortable."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,A great place for our father/son trip. We loved exploring the land and taking in all the country has to offer. Our dog had a great time as well. It definitely felt like home and all the snacks were an added bonus. I contacted him the night before and the host was very accomodating for an early check in. There's also Crystal Lake within a couple of miles if you feel like fishing. Will be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Scott's home was super cozy and the property is beautiful. Scott went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and we really were able to relax in the quiet and serene setting. Definitely would recommend staying at Scott's if you're traveling to the area!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great host, will definitely stay again"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing, gorgeous, peaceful place. The cottage is beautifully furnished and spotless. It looks out on a lovely field and barns, and there is a beautiful path around the field for walking. Our dog loved it too! Scott has been very thoughtful setting up a lovely experience. We will definitely be going back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This host is thorough and thoughtful, the house is clean and cute with a farmhouse chic feel. The property is beautiful and accessible by mowed walking trail. We were six people and slept comfortably (though one guest was a child who was comfortable climbing to the top bunk of one of the beds). Very fun!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The house and host had excellent attention to detail on the things that matter - very clean, soft beds and linens, and an abundance of kids toys and kitchen supplies. The grounds are beautiful. Even though it was chilly, we enjoyed exploring the walking paths around the property. Thank you for the extra snacks and treats; it made it feel like a vacation even when we had three little kids with us :)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to relax in the country. Scott was very good at communicating with us going out of his way with Birthday treats for my husband. The cabin was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our nights there while we viewed the cranes during the days.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, fantastic host! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Both the kids and the adults in our group were very happy! Seriously, Scott thinks of everything. There were snacks for the kids, drinks for the adults‚Ä¶ lots of towels! Everything you need whether you are staying in or going out exploring."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful. We only needed a place to sleep for the night but the house was very comfortable and the host was quite responsive. The only complaint we had was the disinfectant they used was incredibly strong and we needed to air the house out as we have little ones and are sensitive to chemicals. But then again, I understand that may not apply to everyone. Overall a very nice stay and we appreciated all the little things like the bottle of wine, snack basket, board games, and adorable children's room."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent quiet spot, just minutes from town. All we needed was food and clothes, Scott provided the rest. Property has great spots for nature viewing, and is truly a part of the areas history."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful property! The home is clean and well-stocked. Our kids had a great time playing outdoors, walking the mowed hiking path, playing with the costumes for little ones in the closet, and enjoying the little library of children's books. We slept like logs on clean, soft beds, enjoyed a home-cooked meal we made in the fully-stocked kitchen, and enjoyed a cozy night playing family games and cuddling up in front of the giant TV in the family room. Scott was friendly and attentive‚Äîhis communication before our stay was timely and comprehensive. This was our best Airbnb experience yet!"
2022-02-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The stay was good for us but it felt too much like we were in someone's home. When you walk in there are old, worn shoes and slippers on a shelf and at first we though we were at the wrong place. Half eaten bags of nuts in cupboard. The trash in the bathroom was not taken out and there were empty beer bottles in the mudroom. We really liked that everything was there for us, towels and extra blankets. There are games and a nice TV in the living room. Tons of cooking utensils and bath supplies too!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was lovely. Super thoughtful hosts, a lovely property and cozy space, just far enough off the interstate to have a quiet rest. Highly recommend."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott & Jane‚Äôs place is so special. The grounds are fantastic and the house is spotless and smells so clean. Everything you need in the kitchen plus tons of extras they have generously left out. The games are so great - wish we had time to play them, and the property is just awesome and so much fun to explore (especially the walking trail). Super close to Hastings for whatever you need (we were here for a Moderna trial visit). Scott is an awesome guy, super communicative and interesting- wish we had more time to get to know him and hear about all his adventures, but our paths crossed briefly when he was cleaning the other property on site. Secluded, quiet, pretty magical at night, and super comfy. Can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great hosts."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute house and perfect location. Beautiful property and would definitely recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous property with wonderful hosts! They made us feel at home which made for a very relaxing stay. We wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing to stay at! The cleanliness was definitely 10/10 and the presentation! They welcomed me with snacks and wine I absolutely loved it‚ò∫Ô∏è The rooms were very clean and it didn‚Äôt feel like I was staying in a dirty room like it would be at a hotel. The spot is amazing as well
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful, hidden gem. The house was clean and comfortable. The host, Scott, was fantastic with communication. I would definitely come stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott and Jane are excellent hosts. Their bnb is over the top for amenities. The snacks and drinks were very much appreciated. Wonderful property to explore. Would definitely stay at again when we are in the area.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a fantastic stay! The space is roomy, the kitchen is fully stocked with every tool you could need. The hosts even provide some drinks, snacks, and fancy soaps! We loved having a cosy fire in the fireplace, walking the trail around the property with our dogs and playing ping pong. A great place to stay for a relaxing weekend getaway!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third time at Jane and Scotts place and it continues to get better with each stay. We typically take a yearly pre-holiday charge up vacation and this is our favorite spot to do it. So calm, peaceful, and incredibly relaxing.
Scott and Jane are incredible hosts and have made this such a cozy and warm place to stay. If you are considering staying here - this is your sign to do it! Enjoy the walking trail, wildlife, and solace. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again for round 4!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved everything about this place. So hospitable, so comfortable, so clean, and so much to do! Every detail was thought of! We had wonderful stay. Tons to explore. Pet-friendly, and very kid-friendly too! We couldn't believe the value. Book this place now-- you won't regret it!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great stay at Scott's country getaway. It was the ideal location for us to stop for a night while traveling with kids. The home had everything we needed plus a sweet Christmas tree!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fianc√© and I stayed at Scott‚Äôs place with our two dogs while traveling for the holidays. Scott was very quick to respond and went the extra mile in having snacks and drinks available for us at the house. I would highly recommend staying at this house, especially if you are traveling with dogs as there is so much space for them to be able to run around outside. Thank you!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second year staying at Scott‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs such a peaceful spot and the house is equipped with everything a traveler needs to feel at home. Our only regret is that we haven‚Äôt gotten to stay longer!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very clean, the kitchen was more than equipped for us to prepare dinner, the extra treats were so appreciated by our kids. We will definitely be back if we stay in the area again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"wow- one if the best places we have ever stayed. this ""cabin"" was spacious, with literally everything you could need. it's really a standalone farmhouse stationed across a driveway from a very large farmhouse. perfect spot to stop between Des Moines and Denver with the dog. lots of unfenced space with grass to walk the dog on a leash, courtyard well lit at night. I felt very safe here as a lone female traveler and will want to stop here again on our next roadtrip out to see family in the Midwest. my favorite part was the living room with the Christmas tree in the front windows. it felt so homey to arrive there after a long drive."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really wonderful, quiet stay with plenty of room. A great road trip stop for the night!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice property. Would stay here again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jane's place is a sanctuary in the country away from the hustle and bustle of town. We visited for our first anniversary, and we had everything we could have needed or wanted there. We grilled, used the multiple fire pits, and explored the grassy trail around the property. This is a beautifully restored area that Scott and Jane are continuing to work on. I would highly recommend to anyone with kids (or without) who is looking for a getaway or somewhere to stop on a long road trip through the area."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cabin, a pleasant drive from Hastings. Very clean, great amenities including snacks provided by the host! The host was extremely quick responding to questions and very nice. The property was nice for walking the two dogs that we brought with us. We enjoyed our stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"A great host.
We enjoyed the snacks and drinks you left for us.
unique location with fire pit and peace quiet solitude
Very nice to have plenty of towels if needed and nice toilet paper ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Internet speed was amazing"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, peaceful getaway. Host is great and the place has a lot of history. Make sure to walk the trail."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. They have everything you could think of. They are wonderful host and hostess.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay very much. I plan to be back often. Perfect little get away by myself for the weekend!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott is an awesome host! He was very friendly to myself and my family that stayed on his property! He keeps his homes clean, sanitary, and expertly decorated! They are both beautiful! The property it self is something to explore. I would love to spend a week just walking all around the timber and next to the creek and lounging in one of the hammocks on the property during a cool evening night."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay. Cozy, clean, very peaceful. Scott was a great host, offering lots of nice touches, from snacks, to drinks in the fridge, to a kitchen stocked for cooking. We would stay here again if we were through here again. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They have thought of everything!
Walking in the side door, you‚Äôll find a porch filled with all of the extra things you might need (extension cord, kitchen gadgets, slippers), then you step into the kitchen, which was stocked with essentials. The dining room is a cozy spot for 3-4 people to eat. The living room is comfy and set up with ample places to set a drink and places to pile in for a cozy movie or a game night with one of the several board games. The bedrooms were comfortable and well set up (including the bunk bed room with toys and books). The bathroom was spotless and had everything you might need.
Outside was just as cozy, the trees, art, and barns made it feel like a real retreat. There was tons of room to walk and play outside, including a path cut around the field. Everything was beautiful in a cozy, simple, non-pretentious way and exactly what my friends and I needed for our mastermind retreat.
There is nothing I could suggest to make this place better!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott and Jane‚Äôs home was wonderful. This was my last stop on my way home after a month on the road. When looking for a place near my halfway point, this option looked perfect for some quick sleep and space to run the pup. It greatly exceeded my expectations, largely because of how great of a host Scott was. His attentiveness and suggestions for our stay, along with the comfortable home and area, made this spot one I should‚Äôve stayed at much longer. Will definitely have to come back for a longer stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect stop after a long drive. We enjoyed the fire pit, walking trail, and my boys loved the kids room. The games, toys, and books are wonderful touches."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Clean Stay! The house was awesome and had great perks.

We forgot a toiletry bag and he offered to ship it back to us at no charge. Awesome service!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was peaceful and a great cozy spot with lots of space to roam. The inside is decorated with a lot of thought and had everything we needed. Our dogs enjoyed the yard and we felt very safe.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had another great stay at Ryan's place! We've stayed here several times while visiting our son in Hastings. This place never disappoints!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place. It has a great out on the middle of nowhere feel but 2 miles off the highway. Plenty of room inside and especially out. 2 patios to relax on. Our dog definitely liked it, this is the only pet friendly rental we could find in the area. Lots of green space to roam and friendly home dogs. It was a little early for the pond but I'm sure we will be back."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful get away! Loved the trails and the friendly animals! Also blue hill tavern does have pretty amazing pizza and employees! The father on the property was so nice and inviting! Definitely will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place out in the country to stay. Very peaceful. The kitchen came stocked with everything needed. The downstairs bedroom is separate from the rest of the living area and you have to go outside to get into it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great place, our dogs didn't have to be leashed and everything was perfect"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's place never disappointes! My family and I have stayed here several times while visiting our son, who goes to Hastings College. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking to visit the area!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot to use as a holiday hub while visiting family. Space was absolutely beautiful and perfect for our needs. Kids enjoyed the board games offered and the little chalk table too! Would love to return when warmer to enjoy the other outdoor amenities! Ryan was very helpful and accommodating! Would recommend to anyone!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,A great AirBnB with great hosts!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lots of room for 2 adults a baby and dog. We certainly enjoyed it! Ryan was a great host and very reliable to ask for any questions we had. Would definitely come back again!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Ryan‚Äôs place was wonderful! We were close to Hastings, but the country setting was beautiful. We absolutely loved the walking trails, pond and swimming tank. Our family can‚Äôt wait to return to this serene piece of Heaven on earth!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay. We got lost when first arriving, but that was our fault. The grounds were awesome. House was awesome, and big enough for all of us. We would definitely book again!!! Thank you so much!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful peaceful place! Thank you!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, great location."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's place is a mediocre abnb to stay.
If you are going to spend the amount of money for two nights (which was required) then I would expect Ryan's place to be charming .
It is not. Very rustic and drab.. Curtain used to close off the bedroom. King size bed which barely fit in the area of the bedroom. One lamp for reading and flicked off and on . Bedding and pillows very old .
Furniture old and used. Lamp in living room was falling apart.
Bathroom shower unacceptable. Floor of shower stained. Stackable washer and dryer in Bathroom. Only place to put personal bathroom items was on the lid of the washer.
Curtains in living area old. Opened windows for fresh air and window sills full of dead bugs.
So who is Ryan. Sure did not meet him."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,We needed a space for family members attending a family event nearby. Ryan's place was exactly what we needed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this rustic and peaceful location. Our family absolutely loved fishing in the pond with our ultra light rod and reels, as well as paddle boating. We brought along our SUP and enjoyed boarding around the pond, too. The well maintained trails were a fun way to to explore the land. Our family will remember this holiday for years to come, and will be recommending this place as well as Ryan to others. What a great host! Checking in and out was a breeze."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We chose Ryan‚Äôs place because it was geographically central to various family members living in different states. We were able to spend a peaceful time together during a very hard year for our family. Thank you for hosting us and giving us a way to be together.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely peaceful rural retreat! Clean and comfortable, the home would be a perfect getaway for a couple or a young family. I particularly liked the outside scenery and decor of flower and antique tableaus that would make great photo ops/backgrounds. The only disappointment was that the 1st floor bedroom only connected to the 2nd floor (bathroom) through the outside stairs."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful location. Enjoyed getting away to relax and rest.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is what my dream retirement would be. Our family enjoyed the BEAUTIFUL and peaceful surroundings! Ryan's place is absolutely worth visiting if in the area, we will DEFINITELY be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time with my friends and I would definitely go again. Ryan and everyone else were very nice and respected your space. If you needed anything, they were on top of it in an instant."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are fairly local and had girls weekend here, and wow‚Ä¶ stunning property! It was so peaceful and honestly so fun to walk around and see all the beautiful landscaping and trees.
WONDERFUL amenities! Everything you could need to cook/bake/grill. Bug spray, kids games/chalk, books, extra pillows, blankets, washer/dryer, etc!
The only thing we thought would be different was the distance from the guesthouse to the stock tank pool and the firepit/pond. We couldn‚Äôt really tell by the photos that it wasn‚Äôt right outside the door/porch of the guest house. We ended up not using the stock tank or the firepit because it was a walk to get to both of them and we really didn‚Äôt want to lug everything that we wanted/needed there and back.
Overall, it was a clean living space. Very quaint and homey decor. GREAT SPACE for girls weekend. We had many laughs, slept great, and enjoyed the outdoors as well as the inside (the AC worked well for those 90 degree days!).
Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I hadn't left the city for a vacation in years, so when we decided it was long past time to do so we knew we wanted something that was ""away from it all"" and pet friendly. Afterall, what kind of couple would we be if we couldn't take our Aussie and Border Collie to the country with us. :) This gem was recommended to us by a dear friend, and it did not disappoint. The homestead was gorgeous, the skyline went on forever and the firefly show every night at dusk was equally as beautiful as the lightning show that could be seen in all directions.
Absolutely peaceful, quiet, adorable and plenty of trails to walk on the property. Only 15 min from Hastings made quick trips to the store easy peasy and to be honest, if the homestead owners were home, we never once noticed, let along saw them. I know we will be back when it's time to relax and rejuvenate again. Worth every penny."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderfully relaxing place to stay. The surrounding area and the yard were lush, green, beautiful. We awoke to the birds singing. So relaxing."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to relax after a long day of ball games in Hastings. Peaceful, clean, and spacious! Friendly animals the kids loved. Would love to stay here again when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful retreat in the country! The property is beautiful, the home is clean and has everything you could need during your stay, and a very responsive host! Wish we could have enjoyed the property more but we were busy during the day. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Home away from home! Our stay was peaceful and the location was beautiful. There was plenty of space for our family. Thank you again for sharing!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in Nebraska for my sisters funeral and staying at this place was exactly what we needed. Knowing we were coming here after everything to relax and unwind was amazing. It was beautiful, peaceful, and very relaxing. We will definitely be coming back and we highly recommend! Amazing host!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is a dream. So beautiful and peaceful and far exceeded our expectations! I couldn't have asked for a more perfect weekend. The property is lovely with so much to explore and the barn is comfy and inviting. We felt right at home while we were here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was a very beautiful and relaxing place to celebrate our 25th anniversary. Our girls (dogs) had a blast playing with the owners dogs. Highly recommended.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a relaxing, wonderful time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We knew this place was a little out of our way, but boy were we glad we booked it! Totally worth it! Pictures/description were exactly what we received/saw. The scenery/property was the highlight of our trip. Beyond peaceful and lots to do, without having to leave and spend money! The hosts were very responsive and even held conversations with us a few times. Their farm dog, Sully, was our favorite. Definitely don't recommend fishing if he's around (he loves to jump in after the bobbers) but our pup and him got along great! We played fetch with them in the pond for hours, and even left him a souvenir squeaky ball ;)
Very clean, quiet and comfortable. Anything you could possibly need, was stocked in the Airbnb for our convenience and use. Checking in and out was a breeze! Definitely will be back and highly recommend to anyone wanting a PEACEFUL & private getaway with all your outside activities at your fingertips with family, friends & your pups!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our stay. It was as described and will definitely stay there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All of the guests grew up in the country and now live in town. Ryan‚Äôs place was just like going home again. It was lovely to wake up surrounded by tree canopy and birdsong. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more serene and peaceful getaway.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, a little further from Hastings than we expected but worth it. Friendly hosts, fun place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I have stayed here multiple times while visiting our son at Hastings College. We love the property and the quietness of the countryside. Always look forward to our next stay!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little cabin, already booked again for the summer as my kids want to go back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so relaxing and peaceful. We absolutely loved this place and will come again and recommend to our family and friends. We loved being out of the city, our dogs could run freely on the trails gorgeous at night with all the stars. Tom was so friendly and helpful."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a peaceful country gem. The home is clean, comfortable, and offers several sleeping options. The kitchen is well equipped, and the washer and dryer were appreciated. The country setting provides clean air, breathtaking night skies, and a beautiful property to explore. City amenities are a short drive away, but life is better in the country. Thank you for sharing your rental home with us - we had a great stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My stay on the farm was great! The house was very clean and comfortable and set in a beautiful area. Very peaceful and quiet. I just wish i would have had more time to go explore the trails around the property.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stretch out and get away. Came for a fall mini-retreat with friends from out of state and had a great time as hunting season began. Appreciative of the hospitality and ease!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was quiet and beautiful. The site was just as described and shown.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan‚Äôs Red Barn space was amazing. We were in a pinch looking for lodging that would allow our dogs to stay. Ryan‚Äôs spot really came through. The on-site hosts were friendly and very willing to help. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is nice and it is so quiet. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet country getaway"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! A great place to rest and relax. We spent part of our first night sitting in the deck petting the friendly dog and the cats. A lot of great views on the walking trails. Will be back!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time here! There is so much to look at around the property including scenery and antiques! We saw something new every time we looked around! The place is amazing and something to do for everyone whether it‚Äôs hiking, lounging by the pond, or a dip in the horse tank. The amount of info provided in the guest book is everything you could and would ever need to know about the property and the surrounding area which was amazing!
There is a new young lab on the property that is probably the friendliest dog I have ever met and loves everyone and really, really wanted to play with my Mom and my dog. A lot! It was a bit much for my Mom (in her late 60s) and my small pooch, but we spoke with the charming couple at the main house and they kept an eye out immediately. Not a problem, but felt it worth mentioning and to also point out how attentive and awesome the property owners are! We ran into them a few times and enjoyed our chats!
Amazing property and wonderful hosts!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is so peaceful. We saw five shooting stars in one hour. Marci and Tom were great host. We loved the tour around the property. Never had to turn the tv on, too many other things to do and see."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and a very responsive host!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, and a nice quiet weekend. It was exactly what we were looking for."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,The cabin was comfortable. The area was quiet and beautiful. The hosts and their pets were friendly.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A little slice of heaven here. Beautiful farmyard with the pond, horse tank pool, and miles of hiking trails. So many stars! Just 10 miles south of Hastings. This was the perfect place to stay for a week while visiting family in the area. Hope to stay here next time I visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay and relax. Beautifully kept grounds with lots of space to explore! The bluff at sunset was amazing!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,we enjoyed our getaway weekend from the city. Ryan's place is secluded and quiet with lots of trees. It is also not far from hasting where you can get any supplies you may need.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we had such a nice relaxing time here. house was clean and had everyting we needed. even though it rained most of the time (or was too muddy to walk the trails) we still had plenty to do around the house and property. my daughter caught her first fish ever here and it will be a treasured memory for us all.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a fabulous time! Thank you so much!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic place to stay. There were so many different things for our family to do. We stayed here while visiting the Willa Cather home in Red Cloud, thirty minutes away, and I was VERY glad we chose a slightly longer drive to stay here--the activities around the barn were my kids' favorite part of the trip. We paddleboated, swam in the horse tank, explored the trails around the farm, watched the sunset from a bluff up over a creek, petted the very friendly cat, had a fire in the fire pit on the sandy beach near the pond, caught frogs at the pond, and played some of the games in the cabinet under the TV. Tom was very helpful and having so many different things to explore and try out while we were there was really nice."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic hosts and super dog-friendly, relaxed environment. Clean and well-equipped space. Would stay again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very neat barn design & cute setup! Love the scenery & the area! Out in the country where you can just relax & feel at home.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very cleans and comfortable accommodations! Very friendly and helpful guy (Tom) on site. Being able to carry things up and down several stairs is a must as main entry is upstairs. Also the pond is located behind the main house and requires a walk through their yard to access. Not complaining, just things I wish I had know ahead of time. Enjoyed our stay and made some great memories inside Easter weekend 2022!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a great visit in Hastings and we all enjoyed our stay with Ryan. Ryan was great with communication. Would definitely stay here again!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to getaway and breathe.
The trails were nice with a great view on the bluff. Quiet, peaceful. Next time would like to come back with my family."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a little get away from literally everything and this location provided it. Located off the grid in southern Nebraska - you'll find yourself surrounded by cornfields and a river.
We appreciated the ease of arrival and the comfort of the ""barn"". It was easy to sink into that ""home away from home"" feeling. The beds were comfortable, as was the ""living room"", and we appreciated the stove, microwave, fridge, and bathroom with shower. We took our own food and that made it so much easier for meals. We also appreciated the availability of games. We played a couple.
We adored the whimsical decor of the outside. Our dogs, who are very much city dogs, lived their best life running free along the trails around the property. That's not something they get to do in the city and we could tell they LOVED it, as did we.
The only thing that we found to be a little uncomfortable was the proximity of the pond and fire pit that are advertised to the home of the property owners. They're in the back yard, very near the house. We had planned on having a night of enjoying time around the fire pit but we didn't feel comfortable doing that as we didn't want to bother the family. That is definitely something that is just a personal feeling on our part - we don't like to feel intrusive. Plus, one of our dogs doesn't have good manners and barks and whines a lot and we felt bad about that.
Overall, this is a VERY neat place and we will probably visit again when we need some time away. It's so cool that this space is available in rural Nebraska."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The barn is a wonderful getaway and was perfect for watching the annual Sandhill Crane migration.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing quiet place, incredible host"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place. Very clean and Ryan is great at communicating with you.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at Ryan's place while visiting our son at Hastings College. We love the quiet country side and the peacefulness that this charming house has to offer. We look forward to many more stays at this lovely country side retreat!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and beautiful place to relax and unwind!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very pleasant experience. The place was cozy and cute. The property was beautiful and I wish we could have spent more time exploring on the trails. We were greeted by a friendly farm dog. Our only complaint was the very very low water pressure in the shower. Overall good experience!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely property! We stayed in the winter, but would like to come back in warmer months to experience the deck, pond, tank and walking trails. The place is perfectly serviceable, but the ""rustic"" in the listing title is warranted. The kitchen is very basically equipped so if you are planning to do a lot of cooking best to pack in equipment (pots & pans, cutting boards, knives, etc). The other thing to note is that the downstairs bedroom is *only* excessible from the exterior so you have to go outside and use the exterior staircase to move between the lower bedroom and the upper living/bedroom space. It works, but is a pain if the weather isn't cooperating. All in all, good quality for the price and a fun cabin-like spot to meet up for a rural retreat with friends or family."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"South of a main road and amongst fields of crop its a quiet barn by their house with pretty pond, cows and trees."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,great getaway!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! The accommodations were clean and just as described. Don‚Äôt miss the trails around the property. Go to the bluff overlooking the river at sunset, it‚Äôs beautiful!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for a weekend away
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a peaceful, cozy, homey getaway in the country, this is your place. The farm is beautiful and welcoming, with several surprise sitting areas and lots of flowers and plants along the driveway and around the property. You can do your own thing or visit with the family and pets if you‚Äôre out and about at the same time. I wish I had spent a couple more days just hanging outside on the deck or walking the grounds."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. We did a girls trip this past weekend. Group of 7 of us. The family was so sweet and accommodating and even surprused us eith a sunset tour of the property. It was a blast! We will be back
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"The place was very welcoming, and owners were so sweet."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful and cozy! Peaceful and quiet with plenty of land to roam. Friendly dog greeted us upon arrival.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a quiet, quaint little getaway! The location is very well kept and there were lots of little things available to help make the stay even better! (I.E. toys for the kiddos, lots of cozy blankets, and COFFEE!!!!).
The pond, paddle boat, and swimming tank were a HUGE hit with our whole family! We plan to return as we have had so much fun!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing get away for the family! Kids loved the fishing, hiking and swimming. Will be back again and recommend to others!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We celebrated my daughter‚Äôs sixth birthday by spending the weekend at this guest house. We thoroughly enjoyed the place and the nature around it. The highlights were the pond, paddle boat, and fire pit. Within 5 minutes of fishing my daughter caught a catfish. We loved the pizza from the Blue Hill Tavern nearby and thoroughly enjoyed Kool Aid Days in Hastings. The location of this house was perfect for us and Ryan was amazing to work with."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect place to be refreshed. Tom and Marci are great host and Ryan does a great job with the communication! The setting is beautiful- I loved the trails that Tom has developed and the pond and stock swimming tank were perfect. Kind of felt like I had stepped in God‚Äôs playground from my childhood! It was refreshing to my soul! Lavonne
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I wanted to get away for awhile before before school started back up and let me tell you this was an awesome peaceful experience. The property is absolutely beautiful and maintained. His parents were some of the nicest people I‚Äôve meant. We did a lot of fishing and a lot walking through the trails. It was really hot while we stayed and the stock tank was a great way to cool down. My daughter didn‚Äôt wanna leave this place. It was my first experience with an Airbnb and let me tell you it sat my expectations high. I would recommend this place to everyone!
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying at this adorable barn conversion. Very quiet and out in the country. It was clean and comfortable upon arrival.
We did a lot of fishing and swim in the horse tank too!
We attempted to use the paddle boat but there was a lot of dirty water in it so it was in need of being cleaned up. There was a fire pit which was nice too, but the wood that was left for it was wet and wouldn't burn. We made s'mores on the gas grill instead."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our accommodations. Cozy, clean, and cool (which was important in July). We will definitely stay again. Thanks for everything."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,very cute cabin
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful and lovely country getaway. Ryan's parents live in the main house next to the guesthouse and were very kind (they even shared some delicious pulled pork with us!). The grill at the guesthouse wasn't in the greatest shape, but we used the griddle inside instead. Our dog was very obsessed with getting to the farm cats but had a blast playing with the farm dogs. The firepit on the beach made for a perfect night, but I'd check in before swimming in the pond. We just stuck to the horse tank since it was chlorinated and it was great for the kids to swim in."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great short stay. It is off the beaten path which is what we were looking for. They had a walking trail, a pond and a stock tank fed by a windmill to cool off in which we really enjoyed. The family was very friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed the experience."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a perfect place to stay. The owner is very friendly. The house is clean.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place to stay. We had an amazing time at this beautiful home and would love to visit again in the future. Super accommodating and kind hosts and we had everything we could‚Äôve possibly needed. Thank you for everything!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a quiet getaway for the holiday weekend and Ryan's place was perfect for that.
It is located in the middle of several farms, has a lovely pond and plenty space to take a nice walk.
Ryan's parent live on the property and were really friendly and nice.
Hastings is a 20-25 minute drive away and has restaurants, shopping and a few things to do."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, very cool place to stay. Would definitely recommend to others"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Little bit of everything and anything you need. Rain with chilly temps kept us inside more then planned.. the kids books and toys, play pen, and washer for wet clothes were very helpful."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hattie 1898 Homestead is a great place to stay during our state bowling weekend. Jeff is a great host easy to communicate and we got some snow with ice on Monday morning which Jeff was right there salting to keep us safe. When he was finished, we asked him to step inside and explain to us more about the homestead house he designed through his hard work. He definitely created a wonderful Airbnb in the countryside. Everything about our stay was great. The house so clean,
beautiful and relaxing.
We highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre going to be in the Doniphan NE area. (located between Grand Island, Nebraska and Hastings, Nebraska).
Thanks Jeff"

Bedrooms, living room and kitchen were all comfortable. The house was spotless clean.

We would return for another visit and would recommend this home to anyone."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse was a lovely slice of country living. The backstory and personal touches like naming the rooms after great-grandma and family members, charming decorations, and peaceful setting made it a real home away from home. Beds were very comfortable, kitchen was well-appointed, grounds well tended and the host was easy to communicate with. I will dream about the birdsong in the morning and cricket chorus at night enjoyed from both front and back porches. Hope to return to the farm!"

Hattie‚Äôs Homestead is wonderful in every way.
Clean, spacious, well stocked kitchen, beds are very comfortable and bathrooms are immaculate as is the whole house and grounds.
Our stay was perfect!
Our families that stayed there and guests that visited were very impressed with this home away from home.
The tranquility of the home is so relaxing compared to bustle of a hotel.
Jeff was very quick to attend to any and all requests; not that there were any. He just stopped by to make sure all was well and even cautioned us about possible severe weather one evening.
A little reluctant to post such a great review, since it may work against us for our next stay; but Jeff and Julie are SUPER HOSTS and deserve the credit.
Chuck and Teresa Ushio"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for the state trap shoot. Thank you!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jeff is a phenomenal host and the house was great. We really enjoyed our stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An ideal spot for a Trip to see the Cranes!
This farmhouse, recently remodeled, was built in 1898 and has been in the family for over 100 years. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms of nice size. The kitchen was great and well equipped with two dining tables or high table nearby. the living room was also nice and the TV was easy to use.
The grounds are your own, nearest house is about 1/4 mile away. The home is off a gravel road, 1/4 mile from a paved road. You can get into Hastings very quickly and we bought groceries at Russ' near the downtown. You can also turn right on the paved road and go to the Crane dusk/dawn viewing site within 10 minutes or so. (Fantastic viewing there evene in mid day. (we were there in early April (1-4). whooping cranes come in after the Sandhill Cranes have peaked. One whooping crane was seen on Platte river road just east of the viewing area on April 4. there were also deer, and Blue winged teals (6) on the pond at the riverside viewing area 9same one mentioned above. The Crane Trust is just one mile farther north and worth a visit, this is Alda road. taking Alda to the south takes you to Juniata.
We enjoyed Ozzies rest. in Doniphan. Looks like a rough place but is not. Very nice staff and decent food, though the vegetable are not much. We also went to the Plainsman in Juniata. It was ok.
But in Hastings, there is a great lunch spot - the Backyard Bakery, on the south side of 2nd street near Denver street. VEry good sandwiches and soups, pastries and breads too. Pleasant staff!
The museum in Hastings is also worth a stop. And the college has open house at their observatory once a month near new moon.
Back at the house, it sits in a little depression behind and an intermittent creek runs across the street. So views are good out front. there are several squirrels, two are black ! Red tailed hawks were around for two days. You can ask to turn off the pole light out back and view stars (Bortle scale around 4.5, i would say) IOW, Milky way visible but not bright.
the home was very quiet and nice and we say Cranes all up and down roads only a few miles away. It is a great place to relax and enjoy the Crane viewing ! and the host is superb!"

The house is situated in a very peaceful location and is easy to find. We found plenty of parking space and room inside for our party of eight people. The host was incredibly hospitable and kind, communicated in a timely manner, and even stopped over to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable one night stay. As soon as we walked through the back door, the cleanliness and quality of the house were our first impression. We would have happily stayed for another week in Nebraska because of the high quality of the property, the first class service provided by the host, and the serene location! Excellent Airbnb experience!"

The floor is very uneven in spots, and there was an extension cord taped down the hallway into the living room, which seemed odd and like it could possibly be a hazard (but really wasn't big deal). The bathroom is very small, and with it being the only bathroom in a house that ""sleeps 10"", it seems very insufficient. The kitchen was very nice, open, and there was plenty of counter space ."

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a relatively small house by current standards but about the same as the other homes in the neighborhood. The house is clean attractive and comfortable--our overall experience was positive. All appliances appeared to be new or nearly new, and spotless.
A few drawbacks you might want to know about. 1) The description of the steep driveway is accurate. Our Accord scraped a little on entry but wasn't damaged at all. Once you're off the street, the driveway is pretty level.

2) It wasn't an issue for the two of us, but if you're bringing more you should know that the one bathroom is accessible only through the bedroom.
Again these are very minor issues and we would stay here again if we had an occasion to stay in Hastings. Good and safe travels to all."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I can't say enough great things about this house! I stayed here for 3 weeks while in town to be with my sister who is undergoing chemo treatment, and it was the perfect retreat after some long, hard days. It was not only immaculately clean, it was located in a pretty little neighborhood where I felt comfortable getting out to walk by myself in the evenings. The couch was comfy and there were throw blankets so I could cozy up and watch a movie on the big screen TV, and the bed was probably more comfortable than my bed at home! There is a big closet with extra hangers, blankets & pillows, and a well-appointed kitchen, which made cooking a breeze. It's been recently remodeled so it feels like a new home! Crystal was a wonderful host... she went out of her way to leave me a wonderful welcome gift & was super helpful when I reached out to her for some information on the local area. This little town is a gem and so is this home! I will definitely stay here on my future visits to Hastings!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"it was an old farmhouse pretty much exactly like you'd expect an old farmhouse on Airbnb to be. It was clean for a 100 year old house. It was remodeled nicely and the hosts made everything very easy. For a lifelong Nebraskan that's been in old farmhouses before it was well appointed and nice, but not much novelty to it. The bathrooms were especially nice and the farmer on the adjacent land working the field until dusk was a more enamoring than annoying."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at this property for a few days to unplug from city life and just relax. We had the BEST time while we were there. Everything about the house was wonderful! We spent days sitting outside on the deck and in the evening there were board games that kept us entertained. We loved the peace and quiet and will definitely book this property again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a large group of people in town for my son's confirmation. Nobody left disappointed and all day people continued to bring up how incredible the house was. My dad's comment, ""I want to come stay when it's warmer (to utilize the deck more) and we can stay a couple of days!"" We loved the 'country' feel of it! We've already started discussing renting it for my daughter's graduation!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at the farmhouse! Our group of 4 found the kitchen to be incredibly well-equipped, allowing us to cook our own dinners with ease after picking up groceries in Hastings. The cleanliness and spaciousness of the place were impressive, and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring the area on foot, particularly walking along the creek bed. For bird enthusiasts, there were plenty of sightings to enjoy. The addition of beautiful kitties from the barn greeting us was a charming touch. We also had a blast playing air hockey - a great bonus! Overall, the farmhouse provided a spacious and comfortable retreat for our getaway."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a lovely, peaceful place to enjoy Thanksgiving with the family. Cooking supplies were everything we could hope for and the open floor plan made it easy to enjoy one another's company during meal prep and clean up. The kids (and adults) loved the game table upstairs and the many board games. We had several walks over the property and enjoyed the company of the barn cats who made sure we didn't get lost. Sunrise from the porch was a chilly delight. Thanks for a wonderful holiday in a beautiful spot!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The whole place was even better than described. The house is great, the deck is awesome, & the views are amazing! We will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the bigger house this time around. Such an awesome environment. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Kitchen was large and well equipped. Bathrooms were pristine and welcoming. Loved the orange cats that would come keep us company on the deck too. The air conditioning was great as well as you could control temperature downstairs and upstairs.
Overall, this is a beautiful house to stay in and would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jane provided an amazing stay!! My sisters and I had a wonderful time. The personal touches, including the welcome tray and the local soaps were so thoughtful and very much appreciated! The beds were super comfy and the showers were amazing! It was a peaceful and relaxing stay. Scott and Jane were wonderful and attentive hosts!
P.S. the outdoor kittens were adorable!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow!! What a great place!! Upscale appliances, great location, great value, and great communication!! If we are in the area again this will be our place!! Thank you!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time at one of Scott's properties, and it was even better than the last! Our first stay at Scott's was the smaller cabin and everything was perfect then just as everything was perfect at the bigger farmhouse now. Scott and his family are the perfect hosts!! We were arriving around dusk, so Scott made sure lights were on for us. Everything in the home was easy to find and easy to use. Scott was super quick to answer any questions, though we didn't have to ask for much b/c it seemed everything had already been thought of! The property is beautiful. I enjoyed my time sitting on the deck, relaxing and listening to the cicadas. We even made friends with a little family of farm cats. With two vacation homes on the same acreage, we never once felt a lack of privacy. There is plenty of space between the two homes, and private rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms) do not face the other home. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and cannot wait to be back again!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another magical stay! This is the second time my family has rented this house and there will certainly be a third visit in our future. The house is so clean and cozy. It literally has everything you need, especially the kitchen. We made the most delicious meals here with the help of the beautiful vegetable garden next door. It is so peaceful and quiet. The star gazing is great from the driveway and we were lucky enough to get a clear night to watch a meteor shower. Scott is a great host - very friendly and helpful. He knew we were in for the meteor shower so he gave us some tips for how to best view it from the property. Thank you so much again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the moment we drove onto Scott‚Äôs property my mind was excited by the beauty around us. When we walked into their home we were greeted with a bowl of goodies and a bottle of wine clearly saying ‚Äúwelcome! come on in, make yourselves comfortable!‚Äù The kitchen & pantry was the most well stocked kitchen I had ever experienced before. In the fridge there was butter, beer, juice, pop, & condiments. In the pantry you had practically any spice needed to cook a gourmet meal plus items like olive oil, coffee, canned goods, a few paper goods, quality higher end silverware, plates, cutlery and so much more. It was refreshing. Nothing worse then having to suffer through with subpar cutlery & spices as you prepare your family a meal. I mean we were not in want of anything here from start to finish. The grounds were manicured and beautiful to walk and take in. We came for a night but wanted to stay forever. Definitely will look them up for a family reunion."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an amazing farmhouse stay with lots of amenities! The appliances were all very nice. The porch is amazing and the outside is gorgeously lit at night. The decor is so cute. We had a lovely stay. Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! This secluded farmhouse and property were spectacular and suited our needs very well. Scott communicated clearly, and we‚Äôd love to return."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you would like to feel home and cozy, so Scott's home is your destination."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect place to getaway. Scott was a fantastic host. They literally thought of everything you might need. If you visit, you have to walk the trail to the left of the house. It was so beautiful to wake up with a cup of coffee in hand and view the 13 pristine acres of peace. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved this place and Scott was an amazing host! We've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs, and this is has one of the best-equipped places we've seen. Scott's thought of everything. We enjoyed playing games together, walking the farm, and seeing the sunsets in this little slice of middle America.
Scott was great to talk with and has a wealth of information about the National Parks and other travel-related topics. He is generous with his property and time.
We highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,An amazing homestead and set up well to host a gathering on the covered deck.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Scott's place was even better than what we expected! The photos don't do it justice. It is beautiful, peaceful, comfortable, and Scott and Jane have thought of all the little details to make it feel like home. This was a beautiful place for our family to stay during our son's wedding. There was room for the groomsmen and their families. The fully-stocked kitchen allowed us to make many meals there - which made for great family bonding. The supply of games allowed us to have many laughs together during this special time. Scott is a superb host and responds almost immediately to any question. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough great things about this airBnB and Scott. He was such a gracious host and we were so thankful for his help making our wedding/4th of July weekend a dream come true. Our family and friends that enjoyed it with us, were all in awe of this amazing place. We were able to include our animals as well, which made it even more amazing. Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts for allowing us to enjoy your slice of heaven! We will never forget it! And we hope to return one day with the family again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, great indoor and outdoor spaces."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled from Indiana and were in the area for my daughters wedding in Blue Hill. We rented both houses and this was a great place for extended family to stay. Very relaxing, beautiful property. Two large covered porch areas with lots of furniture. Fire pits for relaxing evenings. Houses very clean ; comfortable beds. I have rented lots of vacation homes and this is one of the best. Scott is a great host"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We LOVED this place. I wish we could have stayed longer. Immediately felt at home and calm. It was dog friendly, easy to access, and comfortable. I especially enjoyed sitting out on the porch. Scott was so nice and welcoming. He has a fantastic garden and was nice enough to let me use two huge bulbs of fennel for a recipe I wanted to make that night. We were driving from NYC across to North Dakota and this was such a nice restful place to stop. Scott was great to talk to, especially about National Parks, and his property. I would highly recommend this location and I hope we get to return in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time at the Modern Farmhouse! The large covered deck is perfect for morning coffee, supper from the grill, and watching the kids roam around. We loved sitting out there listening to the passing thundershowers. The kids and grownups had plenty of active entertainment options to unplug and interact. Scott even provided the fire pit and firewood for our s‚Äômores ingredients! With completely modern appliances and basic pantry items we were able to enjoy preparing meals together for our group of ten. Scott gave clear directions and descriptions, and answered all of my questions promptly as we were preparing for the trip as well as while we were on site. This is a great place to escape the chaos of city life and/or family schedules for a few days."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay at ""Kleebstead"" and just like the last one, it was a great experience for the three families that gathered there with kids from age 8 months to ten years old. Comfortable, well appointed, very private, and very, very relaxing! We highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"had a lovely time while there, enjoyed the patio and lights, very welcoming"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, quiet, relaxing property that was perfect for my family! Scott was a very responsive host, I would highly recommend a stay!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved everything about house. awesome showers
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"5 friends with western Iowa roots met to have a Sandhill Cranes experience. Scott's place put us within 30 minutes of the action on each end of the flyway.
The home is well maintained, well stocked and was perfect for a late spring adventure.
We also enjoyed March Madness games on his big screen TV.
It was great!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our visit to Scott's farmhouse was wonderful. The space was well appointed, stocked over and beyond most similar units we have rented in the past and it accommodated our needs fully. Driving to Hastings, Grand Island and Kearney was easy. Each was about 30 min away from the farmhouse. I would recommend Scott's place to any larger group traveling to the area. You won't be disappointed!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks Scott, we had a great time Judy"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is absolutely beautiful. I was really liked that I didn't have to do full cleaning of the place. Scott was very kind and responded quickly when we had questions. I definitely received this place.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect spot to stop with our dog. Lots of room to run around.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don‚Äôt think twice about staying here, just do it! Everything was absolutely amazing here, so comfortable, clean, kitchen items, a snack ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù basket, and so much more. Above and beyond on every front and amazing communication if we had any questions. We can‚Äôt wait to go stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The farmhouse was beautiful and very comfortable. We had a great stay; Scott was very welcoming and had everything ready for us when we got there.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I cannot say enough about the stay at Scott‚Äôs place. If you like staying in the country with a view this is the place. Inside and out this place was amazing. My kids enjoyed the fast internet service . The family enjoyed games each night provided at the house. There‚Äôs not a lot to do but that‚Äôs how we like it. The local restaurants were very hospitable. I will definitely be staying there again! Scott was very informative with the duck hunting around. He went out of his way to be on the lookout for us since we‚Äôre from Bama. Thanks Scott for everything. Roll Tide and Happy Holidays!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay at Scott‚Äôs beautiful home. It was cozy and inviting and Scott was an attentive host. We look forward to returning in the future.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a blessing it is to have Scott share this beautiful home. From the fantastic walking trail to the outdoor fire pit and sauna, it was the perfect chilly fall weather retreat. There is nothing like spending time with friends or family in the quiet natural beauty of Nebraska. Scott is such an amazing host. The house is inviting with fun little extras all around. The large table is perfect for sharing fun, food and a lots of laughter. Scott is always will to help out to make sure your stay is perfect. He even took time out of his weekend to get the sauna ready for us to use and gave us the perfect history lesson on saunas to add a little insight into the fun. I would highly recommend booking a stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying here and it continues to surpass expectations! Every amenity you could possibly think of plus then some. Scott and Jane are the best hosts. It‚Äôs clear they truly care about their guests. Highly recommend visiting in the fall - the property is absolutely gorgeous! It‚Äôs the perfect escape if you are looking to relax and recharge. It‚Äôs quickly becoming our ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù and we can‚Äôt wait to be back. Thank you for this place, Scott, and for all the wonderful memories we‚Äôve made here."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such an amazing place. Will definitely book here again when we‚Äôre back in town and there is availability.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend!!! This place was so gorgeous and very clean. The host Scott was outstanding at communicating and going the extra mile to make our vacation fun and relaxing.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Scott and Jane have a beautiful ‚Äúcountry‚Äù retreat!!!!! We thoroughly enjoyed the peaceful environment! Scott was very attentive to all of our needs! We found the house well stocked, clean, and beautiful! We had 3 couples in our group, and the house was perfect for us! You could easily add kids, or other guests, as there are other options for sleeping! Speaking of sleeping, we all thought the beds were wonderfully comfortable!!! Overall, an amazing stay and we can‚Äôt wait for another visit!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Very relaxing. Great house and loved the large deck. It was a wonderful place to spend a summer evening.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this listing pretty far out as we were traveling for a wedding. This was our first time using AirBnB, but we have used other home share sites. We chose this listing for several reasons, one was the proximity to the wedding, which was in Hastings, the other was the privacy surrounding the home.
Almost immediately after we booked, Scott reached out to us letting us know he received our booking and would give us details about a week prior to our stay. He also said if we had questions to feel free to reach out. About a week prior I reached out just to confirm because I worry and hate last minute suprises. Scott was super friendly and kept in contact with me until our arrival date (and after). He even gave us a link to the exact directions to the home. Upon arrival, we were so excited to see this listing was exactly as pictured. There was plenty of space for my husband and our 4 kids (18, 16, 13, and 10). The boys stayed in the room with the air hockey table, which they loved. There were plenty of games (card and board) for us to play as a family, even a few we never heard of.
My husband and I enjoyed our coffee on the huge porch while we watched our children play in the yard.
The location was only about 15 to 20 minutes to Hastings, depending on what part of town you wanted to get to and easily accessible from the highway. If we travel back to Nebraska, we hope this farmhouse will be available as it truly was our home away from home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If i could give more than 5 stars i would. Scott was a phenomenal host in every way.
We thoroughly enjoyed our family vacation/reunion.
Thank you so much for a wonderful week."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Accommodations were wonderful! The property is beautiful and well maintained! Loved the extras provided like the welcome snacks, robes, slippers and the extras found in kitchen and bathrooms. Scott was flexible with our plans, and it worked out so well when we came for our son's wedding! Definitely recommend!! Thank you Scott!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to get away from it all and just enjoy the beauties of nature.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home with a beautiful location! Modern old farmhouse that is well stocked and well cared for. We wish we could have stayed longer. Many extra little touches that make the stay enjoyable!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time. We were there for two reunions. He had plenty of games and outside toys for kids. My grandkids loved it. It was beautiful sitting on the deck at night with the lites. Inside was clean and plenty of supplies
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place for families to unwind and reconnect with each other. Scott has created an atmosphere of peace, quiet and renewal. This Airbnb and the beauty of rural Nebraska feeds your soul!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was amazing! Scott really made us feel welcomed and pampered. He really went above and beyond. There was snacks and drinks. The most amazing soap! We walked some of the property and loved all the barns, his garden is beautiful. Those bathrooms made you feel like you're at a spa. My teens loved the upstairs bedrooms and enjoyed playing air hockey. We stopped here on our way to South Dakota and Wyoming. We'd definitely stay here again. Only wished we could've stayed longer."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were hoping for a quiet, country retreat and our stay here exceeded all our expectations. Scott was an unbelievable host, and incredibly helpful before and during our stay. The house is absolutely stunning and the property is gorgeous. Every time I turned around, I found another amenity, detail and touch of home to marvel at. The amount of work and love that has gone into this place is apparent in every square inch. The kitchen is incredibly well stocked with high end appliances and every kitchen gadget you‚Äôd ever need. The bathrooms make it seem like you are staying at a luxurious resort. I think I will miss the gorgeous spa-like shower most of all. The bedrooms are cozy, comfortable and beautifully decorated and furnished. But the absolute best part was just having a place to unplug and slow down. Sitting on the deck, with my dog, watching the fireflies and the fire in the fire pit as the sun set and the sky turned purple is a memory I will cherish forever. Thank you, Scott, for this beautiful place. It was perfect and we hope to stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family stopped through on our way to Colorado and it was the perfect place to each some time out of the car. Our kids loved the games and hockey table upstairs. The snacks and drinks left was a wonderful touch. Communication was excellent!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place will stay again!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,It is a great place to stay if you are in the Hastings area 3 bedrooms with plenty of space for the whole family
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was so cute. All the extras were a bonus and Scott thought of everything. I‚Äôd go back any time I had a chance.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family, ranging in age from 70-11, thoroughly loved this place. It slept our family of 8 very comfortably and the outdoor space and acres to roam was exactly what our teenage grandsons needed after a long roadtrip. It is out in the country, very quiet and peaceful. The house was older and had been restored beautifully and was very clean and cozy. We would definitely recommend this place to everyone who is willing to travel off the interstate a bit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved my stay here. The house is beautifully renovated, very comfortable, and has everything you could need. It is in such a peaceful and relaxing setting. My dog and I loved walking on the path around the property. Scott is a wonderful host!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Scott's country house. We knew we were in the country when we heard bobwhite quail when we got out of our car. The house was spacious, wonderfully decorated and very tidy/clean. Very charming and exactly as represented. We can't wait to go back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at our fair share of airbnbs that describe themselves as rustic or rural. Many if not most tend to rely heavily on this particular aesthetic to compensate for a lack of cleanliness or value. Be assured, traveller, this is not one of those airbnbs.
Scott did a great job of making this airbnb appealing on the inside and out. It sits on a property with another rental and several farm structures and gardens. The rural farm vibes are very much present. There is also a large front port with string lights and plenty of furniture (note there are several steps to gain access to the only entrance).
Inside is where we were especially impressed. The kitchen has high-end appliances (ge cafe and moccamaster coffee maker) and cookware, a gas stove, and a pantry that is well stocked. Scott also left several snacks and drinks out for us.
There are two beds and a bath upstairs but we spent most time downstairs in the kitchen/living area. There is also one bed and one bath downstairs. The bathroom is large and well designed. There is a walk in shower with multiple shower heads, double vanity, backlit mirror, etc. The owners clearly put a lot of time and money into making this place feel premium.
Hastings is a 15 min drive to the north and is the place to go if you are looking for restaurants or a Walmart.
We would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone staying in Nebraska.
There is a lot of pressure to leave 5 star reviews on this site. This is one of the rentals that I feel truly deserves it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful accommodations! We enjoyed our stay very much! Exactly what we were hoping for when we reserved the Airbnb.
Scott was a great host!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We plan our road trips around Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄúField of Dreams‚Äù farm house. He hits it out of the park ever time when it comes to hospitality!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a very lovely serene place. Just a Great place for all around enjoyment.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Scott goes above and beyond! The house looked amazing! So many things were provided, anything from bathroom necessities, to robes, slippers, air hockey table and anything else you‚Äôll need! So much attention to detail, and a great little welcome basket! :) I got ready here for my wedding day, and it was the perfect place!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"I am already wanting to book this place again. I would describe it as staying at a good friend‚Äôs family home in the country. It has everything you‚Äôll ever truly need. I feel like a lot of Airbnbs boast about being well appointed and paying attention to all the little details, but this one takes the cake. I am very high maintenance, and even I found everything I could anticipate needing - robes! slippers! a fully stocked (and organized) kitchen! Even a curling iron. I could go on and on... It‚Äôs so cozy and quiet and comfortable, and also meticulously clean. Scott is super friendly, thoughtful, and very responsive. I can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"I picked this place because of the gorgeous photos and the spectacular reviews, so I had high expectations‚Ä¶and every single one of them was exceeded! My family of 8 met up there for Easter weekend. The property was gorgeous and giant and perfect to explore‚Ä¶.ideal for Easter egg hunts with seven year olds. The history of the land is incredible and we loved all the structures and outbuildings. The house had everything you could need and so many incredible touches, from the art and design to the ideal kitchen perfect for family entertaining. Scott was so easy to talk to and took time to show us around and share stories about the place with us. His hospitality is seriously unmatched. We can‚Äôt wait to be back. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another amazing stay at the farmhouse! We have been to Scott‚Äôs farmhouse multiple times and it never disappoints. He always has the house clean, ready to go, and is available should we need anything. The property also continues to have many great additions every time we come back. The garden was our kid‚Äôs favorite this trip. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Scott for hosting us in your amazing farmhouse. We appreciated every little detail you put into each area of the property and house. We're grateful for your energy and your friendly nature. We wish you a magical and prosperous 2022!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was absolutely amazing! We stayed with our four girls (ages 7, 6, 4 and 4) and they LOVED the room upstairs with the air hockey table, playing outside with the toys that were provided in the little white outbuilding, and walking the trail that goes around the edge of the property. We also loved having s‚Äômores with the supplies provided! This Airbnb has EVERYTHING you could need: snacks, wine and local soap as a welcome gift, all of the spices, condiments and kitchen gadgets you could need, robes and slippers (also a huge hit with the kids) and plenty of towels and toiletries. Our kids didn‚Äôt want to leave! Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott was a friendly and organized host! He was communicative and willing to do anything to make our stay pleasant and comfortable. His family's property is tranquil and bucolic, exactly what we were looking for during our weekend trip--rural Nebraska at its finest. Best experience I've had on Airbnb!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing home! Thoughtful and kind thoughts are strewn about. We felt so loved and pampered from the moment we arrived. A basket of goodies awaited us as hungry travelers, the friend was stocked with condiments that helped our grocery budget stretch. Drinks of all kinds were left for our party in the fridge, sweet notes helped us understand other fun things we can do at the house.
There were fresh artisan soaps left as a gift for us to take with on our journey home. Pet friendly location but no evidence of hair and other pets before us. The place was nicely cleaned and well cared for.
Loved the property lay out and over all beauty of the home. Need to figure out a reason to come stay here again. Such a treat!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Holy cow, this house and the property it is on are truly incredible!! From the moment we all walked in we immediately felt comfortable! It smelled amazing, was INCREDIBLY clean, every little detail was so thought out, a well stocked kitchen and bathrooms, and amazing communication with the host! This is probably the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve had!! Thank you so much Scott!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is phenomenal! We stayed 2 nights and wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. The property is gorgeous and we really enjoyed and took advantage of wandering around and the incredible walking trail Scott & his family created through the grounds. The house has everything you could ask for and has been beautifully renovated. Loads of games, a big swanky tv, and super comfortable beds (with incredible showers). We loved all the extras too like snacks, soap and wine. Such a great bonus. Wonderful hosts, wonderful house, and the porch is magical. Thank you again can‚Äôt wait to be back in a month!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,You desire a stay in the country with a beautifully remodeled modern home with all the right amenities and beautiful outdoor space to explore and roam. Our kids loved it. Then when you add an awesome host that is most accommodating. We would definitely recommend this space and we will be back!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Good Host. Alot of attention to detail on the house. Beware of the Neighbors driving 60mph on the dirt road in front of the house. It's Nebraska, that's how the locals roll!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay near Hastings. Would recommend for a girls weekend or visiting family.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay with family! The host Scott is wonderful and very quick to respond!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were traveling across the country and were road-weary. Scott's farm was the perfect place to stop and rest.
The farmhouse was more modern than the typical farmhouse, by far. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathrooms were spacious and the showers worthy of luxury hotels.
Scott is very gracious and the setting is idyllic, as expected on a Nebraska farm!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We have been to several Airbnb's, this house and the host, Scott was the best we have stayed at. The house was gorgeous, it has everything you need, it was well stocked and it's in a beautiful secluded location. Scott was amazing, he was very welcoming with the snacks he had waiting for us to arrive, he was very responsive and he always answered my questions immediately...I would definitely recommend, we can't wait to go back...Thanks, Scott!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Spacious and clean. Lots of outdoor space to play. Fantastic customer service.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott is an awesome host! He was very friendly to myself and my family that stayed on his property! He keeps his homes clean, sanitary, and expertly decorated! They are both beautiful! The property it self is something to explore. I would love to spend a week just walking all around the timber and next to the creek and lounging in one of the hammocks on the property during a cool evening night."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a diamond in the rough! Scott has thought of everything to make his place one of a kind. His pride of ownership is apparent throughout the property. The back porch was amazing, the walking trail around the property was spectacular and the accommodations were perfect. This was by far our favorite AirBNB stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this farm house! A perfect place to take a break from work and families to just listen to quiet farm sounds and relax. The kitchen and porch were amazing for relaxing meals, the beds were cozy and the property, beautiful. Easy booking, great communication with the host, wonderful off the beaten path location."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing home! The porch is the crown jewel of this property! Plan on sitting, relaxing and catching up with family and friends. That is if you can pull yourselves away from the outstanding game collection or hot relaxing showers. Scott‚Äôs place is perfect and not to be missed!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and property!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second year staying at Scott‚Äôs place during Junk Juant. We really enjoy the farmhouse and how quiet the location is. We were also only 5 miles away straight down the road from the Barn Festival near Hastings. Thanks for a great stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 6 loved this home and property -- hands down the best place we stayed at during our travels between California and Illinois!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"The Farmhouse was absolutely gorgeous. All the beds were very comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, and filled with extras. We loved the property, and the deck as well. We cannot wait to return. Thanks Scott!!!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family enjoyed our stay so much that we are already making plans for our next visit! Scott and Jane are exceptional hosts and have really thought of any and everything to accommodate families staying here. We got to meet Scott in person during our stay and he was so kind and generous. The house itself is amazing, open concept with all the perfect touches! The property is beautiful and we loved walking the trails with our kids and having lazy time on the hammocks. You won‚Äôt regret staying here :)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the single best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in, and I‚Äôve stayed in some really cool ones.
The house is perfect. Huge tv, huge showers, plenty of rooms. The real gem is the outdoor space. It‚Äôs huge. I mean like a farm huge. All overgrown with wild flowers and brush‚Äî with a path cut around and through the woods back to the house. It‚Äôs beautiful. Beyond beauty, it‚Äôs peace.
I wish I could stay in Nebraska forever."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this house! Clean, plenty of amenities, and all the hospitality you could dream of. The outdoor spaces are dreamy, and beautiful as well. The host Scott was friendly and quick with his responses. We have family in the area and plan to stay again!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had an incredible stay at this lovely rural home. Scott was an wonderful host who thought of everything. The property is private, peaceful, and absolutely stunning. I would highly recommend this place!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow!! This is such an amazing property and charming home! Everything in the house was renovated to perfection! We stopped here for the night on our drive to Tennessee and we would 100% recommend staying here and would stay again!! The property was perfect for our two dogs to walk around and explore too! Also, the snack basket and bottle of wine on the kitchen island was so sweet of the owners to leave for us.. thank you! :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott was a fantastic, helpful host and his home is absolutely lovely.
The yard is beautiful and set up for fun outdoor hangouts with pretty lights and fire pits.
The house is cozy, clean, and spacious. It‚Äôs clear that they have put a ton of effort and attention to detail into every little thing. We had everything we needed and more to make our stay comfortable and fun - Scott has thought of everything from the snacks and wine to the first aid kit!
Our only regret was that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer, but we‚Äôll definitely be back for another stay in the future!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Y'all. This place. It is an oasis, a slice of heaven -- hands down, it is the best place I have ever stayed in when making a reservation on AirBnb.
The property is secluded and private -- perfect for a family getaway or an intimate weekend away. The house is absolutely gorgeous, and it could suit a variety of guests: a couple looking for a romantic trip, a group of college friends who want to catch up, a small family reunion, or a bachelorette party. Really, anything you can dream up, Scott can cater to it.
Scott thought of EVERYTHING in anticipation of our visit. Check-in and -out are keyless, which makes coordinating arrival and departure a snap. The fridge was stocked, and the kitchen is the best I've ever seen as an AirBnb guest. The beds are so, so comfortable, the showers are spacious and stocked with anything you could need (hair tools, even a diffuser; premium soaps and shower products; comfy and fluffy towels), and the place was SPOTLESS. The welcome basket (full of candies, chips, healthy snacks, local artisanal soaps, and WINE!) was so, so thoughtful, and the place was incredibly well-decorated.
Again, an oasis. Plenty of parking. I could keep going -- but, all you need to know is that you have to find a reason to visit Ayr to stay in this incredible place. It was the perfect stop on our cross-country move from Boston to Denver, and the gorgeous home and incredible service made it an unforgettable and relaxing evening after days of stress and driving. I cannot thank Scott enough for such a wonderful experience and every need and desire was fully anticipated (even the ones I didn't know I had!); I cannot imagine I'll ever stay in another AirBnb that was this fantastic. Many thanks, Scott -- already looking at dates to return; this is a special place now for my family."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Scott‚Äôs place was fantastic! The property is gorgeous and the stay is luxurious!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was a wonderful stopover for us on our 14hour drive home. A great, remote location in the country and the house and amenities are just amazing! We loved relaxing on the deck with a beverage, our older kids loved walking around the property and checking things out. The house is beautiful and has so many cool touches and updates to it. Lots of games and extras. Scott left us an amazing welcome basket and beverages which was so unexpected but totally appreciated! We had a really great time!!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,10/10 would recommend this place to anyone!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"DO NOT MISS this incredible place!! It‚Äôs by far my favorite Airbnb I‚Äôve ever been to. Scott has created a magical and unique oasis in the middle of the Nebraska cornfields. The farmhouse is sparking clean and full of any cooking staples and cookware you may need. You are also greeted with a generous snack basket, and there are robes and slippers to make the place seem extra cozy. Scott also went out of his way yo show us around the property, tell us the history, and even help us to use the sauna he built by hand. It was truly a wonderful experience for my family, and we hope to make it back!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the best stay, it was amazing! We were in town for a cattle show up in Grand Island, this was a great place to lay the calves over for a couple days. The property is amazing, with a shady spot for the calves. The hosts are so friendly and nice. I would like to come back just to enjoy the property and house."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a quiet, secluded stay in rural Nebraska then this is your spot.
A superb host will welcome you to an immaculate home . Outstanding kitchen in every sense of the word‚Ä¶..well stocked, beautiful appliances."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The owners of this property had a vision of what this gem of a spot on God‚Äôs earth could be. Their belief in this investment and their innumerable hours of work, their taste for good design and amenities, and their exceptional management and communication, make this the spot to yield treasured memories for so many families. We are one of those and we will return. Truly an Airbnb to experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The farmhouse was absolutely perfect. Scott is great host.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There is not enough words to describe this great stay. Beautiful home and location. Scott was one of the best hosts we have ever experienced. The peaceful location is so relaxing. Great place to visit with family. Don't hesitate to enjoy Scott's place.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Wow, we were blown away by this unique modern farmhouse. Well designed for a group of 10. We loved spending time outdoors on the porch, walking the trails and country roads, sharing meals, games and making memories while sitting around the farmhouse table. We had a great 3 day stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We rented this lovely farmhouse for a surprise girls-night away. It was absolutely perfect. From the gorgeous scenery outside and porch lights for late night chatting to the spacious house with games, comfy beds, resort-worthy showers, and stocked kitchen. What makes this place perfect is the attention to details. The scent when you walk in is heavenly and the small things that you wouldn‚Äôt even think until you see them truly made us feel pampered. 10/10. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Perfect."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"The farmhouse was gorgeous, well stocked for anything you might need, and we all wished we could stay beyond the weekend! The host (Scott) was great and we give 6 stars for the horse trailer sauna!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This rental is amazing !
Beyond the charm of the location the property is outstanding.
The space is clean, accommodating, and beautiful.
The host of this property could not be nicer. We will absolutely be rebooking this space ."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott's place is extraordinary in a truly serene setting. If you enjoy nature and listening to birds, this is the Airbnb for you. The home is very special. It is a clean, modern, and tastefully decorated farmhouse . The beds are extremely comfortable and the pillows are perfect. We only spent one night but luckily met Scott briefly as we arrived. He was warm and hospitable and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We communicated several times and he always got back to me very promptly. In summary, this is definitely a really wonderful and unique place to stay in Nebraska and I would highly recommend it."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous property and it was perfect for our group. Scott and his family could not be more accommodating, and the thoughtful touches throughout the house were amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone considering staying within an hours drive (or more). Whatever extra time you might take to get here is more than worth it. Especially if you get the chance to have dinner and drinks on the amazing patio.
Thanks for everything, and we will definitely return again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our go to whenever we are up in the area. The location is serene, the house is cute and clean with modern amenities, and Scott is a wonderful and welcoming host."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott is an amazing host! Always quick to respond and available if you need anything. We have stayed at the farmhouse a couple times now. It is always clean and we really enjoy the experience out there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful space. Lovely porch and view. Thoughtful touches and wonderful amenities. One of the best stays we‚Äôve ever encountered. Highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott is a man truly living his dream. If you get an opportunity to stay on his farm I highly recommend you do so. The vision he has for the property and the amount of hard work, sweat love and soul that his family has poured into the farm can be felt throughout.
Everything about the farmhouse is comfortable soothing practical and efficient, with a sense of pride instilled into everything from the deck to the kitchen to the walk in showers and beds. You can rest assured you will be happy with your stay. There is a respect and honor for the land and sustainability that I truly appreciated.
Scott has really inspired me to build my own sauna;, he has very creatively reinvented an old horse trailer into a luxurious mobile wood burning cedar oak sauna with panoramic windows and Bluetooth speakers/led lights that is just fantastic and if I must say genius!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jane are amazing, gracious hosts who want you to feel at home in their beautiful, historic farmhouse. Their restored home is modern with a well-appointed gourmet kitchen and everything you need for a summer picnic or Thanksgiving dinner. But I really love the themed rooms with fun artwork and plenty of games for the kids. And what I love most is that it offers a quiet escape from the hectic world. I love walking the creek and the fence line along the perimeter of their patch of prairie and then sitting on the porch all day. So book this place already!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was exceptional, the response and service was outstanding. Would highly recommend if you are looking for some peaceful rest and relaxation.
The sauna is a must!! The deck and fireplace are perfect for a morning coffee or night time gathering. Scott was fantastic!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This a beautiful house and property to rent for the weekend or longer if you can! My husband and i came here for our wedding anniversary and it was so special! Scott is so nice! There was alot more stuff at the house than we expected like hair dryer, shampoo, body wash.robes plenty of towles ect. Also alot of stuff in the kitchen that is helpful. We will definitely be going back there with our kids this summer. Also the overhead showers were my husband's favorite :) and the house was extremely clean"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely outstanding
Warm welcome
Very thoughtful and kind
The best place for relaxing"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want the perfect getaway, this is always the place to go. I‚Äôve visited this property multiple times now, & Every time I am so relaxed & restored. The property was already beautiful, but Scott has gone above & beyond to add a beautiful deck with the most comfortable furniture, and of course the house is beyond beautiful. There is no better air b n b. :)"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely rural setting to enjoy slowing down. Listening to the birds was a special delight. Very clean and Scott was a great host.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for a trip to Central Nebraska. The farmhouse setting was private and a good taste of the country environment. The house was accessable, completely sanitized top to bottom, and comfortable. The kitchen and bathrooms were amazing. The host was very responsive and friendly. I recommend this place for anyone who is considering a stay outside of a city."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our third time staying with Scott and as always, the place was amazing. Scott is an amazing host."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Scott's property on our trip up to South Dakota from Texas. We had 9 in our group and there was more than enough space for everybody. Between all of the space, the air hockey, and the abundance of games and activities, everyone had a great time.
Scott was an amazing host that stayed in communication from the time we booked until the time we checked out. He answerd any and all questions and gave reccomendations for local places to check out. He also provided an amazing selection of little extras that went over very well like local soaps and an assortment of lotions and bath amenities as well as wonderful gift basket with snacks.
We will definitely book here again if traveling through Nebraska. It was my first Air B&B experience and we couldnt have been happier."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a place! Beautifully restored farmhouse that made a getaway really feel like a getaway. We came here to be close to the Sand Hill Crane migration and to be far from home for a recharge and Scott and Jane's place absolutely did both for us. Everything was clean, the bathrooms are fabulous, the air hockey table was a real win for our teens and the general sense of calm and quiet helped us all. The covered porch is enormous and on warmer days I could see spending many hours just relaxing there. Communicating with Scott was clear and timely - we will definitely be coming back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home with an amazing host. A perfect place to get away from the city noise and relax in a home that‚Äôs welcoming, comfortable and clean."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I would have rated this place 10 stars if the site allowed me. It was everything we needed and SO much more! So blessed we found this gem. And Scott was sooooo easy to work with!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is awesome! We needed a spot to stay on our way back north from Santa Fe. This place is exactly what we needed and we only wish we could have stayed longer. It was very nice and private and cozy. The showers are amazing too!
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"With the pandemic we needed a change of scenery (our house) and decided at the last minute to head east (from Colorado) for the long weekend. So, we chose this farmhouse just outside of Hastings, NE where there is a liberal arts college and a cute downtown. Unfortunately, it was too cold to randomly walk around town so, we mainly stayed inside the house with another family who joined us for the adventure. And, that was just fine. The house has been remodeled and is decorated very tastefully. No complaints about the beds. The game room/bedroom upstairs with a large tv and air hockey table was plenty big for 4 kiddos, and they seemed to appreciate the space. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you could have possibly needed, and Scott was thoughtful enough to have beverages and snacks available. There were also a variety of games for all ages, which was also appreciated given the low temps during our short stay. Circling back to being thoughtful, Scott swung by the 13 acre property while we were there to snow blow the driveway...good dude! We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves heading across Nebraska. Oh, Pacha soap co. was born here, and they have a manufacturing warehouse in Hastings. They don't have an actual shop you can visit, but they do offer tours during non-pandemic times!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the best place we‚Äôve stayed. Everything was amazing from the sweet welcome basket to the cleanliness of the place. It had plenty of space for our family to spread out and be together at the same time. It felt like you were home while at the same time the great feeling of being away from home. The host, Scott was amazing throughout the whole process! Very responsive and helpful! We can‚Äôt wait to go back again and stay, next time in the Spring/Summer to enjoy the incredible patio!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you‚Äôre traveling through Nebraska YOU HAVE TO stay here! I‚Äôve traveled a lot & have not been to a better Airbnb.
The host was so kind & welcoming! He was working on something when we were there and gave us a tour of the property. The property is immaculate & is an original homestead!
They have absolutely everything you‚Äôd need.. food, appliances, (feminine products!), every & any board game, a bottle of wine, anything that‚Äôd be in your house is in their‚Äôs! They even left a gift basket for their guests.
We had three kids along with the 6 adults and they accommodated for all of us! Even bringing a high chair & baby gate over for us.
Oh.. and the SHOWER! That bathroom someone could live in. It makes you feel like you‚Äôre in Hollywood. It‚Äôs beautiful!
This house should be Chip & Joanna certified. I can‚Äôt say enough about this place.
Book it now!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. Very well thought out. It has a Farmhouse feel but modern. I‚Äôm a big fan.....host is great and the place far exceeded our expectations. Would love to stay again.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The quintessential AirBnB...fresh flowers, beautiful art, great place to cook and host a family getaway. Cozy, too. The outside area was fantastic with a huge deck. Even in the winter, we had a warm-ish day and had lunch on the deck. The personal touches of a welcome basket, drinks in the fridge and lots of pantry items was like no AirBnB I‚Äôve visited.
A true gem! We hope to come back when the sandhill crane migrate in 2021."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fabulous in every way! If you drive through Nebraska and don't stay here for a night or two, you are missing out on a great experience."
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"We were amazed in every aspect of Scott‚Äôs place. We received outstanding hospitality from the time we starting looking (before even booking) at his place all the way through checkout. The house is located close enough to a major highway for convenience, but far enough away to really relax. There were several unique touches in the decor that shine through in both an informative and entertaining light. We found the house to be immaculately clean and extremely comfortable. The amenities available to our group were way above what was listed and beyond our personal expectations. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a peaceful getaway. Thanks again Scott, we will be back."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. The house is very accommodating and Scott is a great host. We will definitely be coming back all the way from Vermont.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, extra amenities, many family and kids games available and large area to explore and play!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Scott's place while traveling between Colorado and Iowa. It was very comfortable and quiet. The property is in the country and we enjoyed walking around the property and looking at the different buildings in the property. Great place for family reunions or just someplace to get away.
We enjoyed the stay."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful, super clean and cozy in gorgeous surroundings away from it all. The hosts thought of every special touch. I wish we lived closer to come more often! By far the best AirBnB we‚Äôve ever stayed in! Adore!"
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"This spot is a wonderful getaway from city life. They have completely renovated an old farmhouse to have all modern conveniences. Scott & Jane have included all the amenities, so all you have to do is show up and relax."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I have ever stayed at!! Every room was cute, well designed, and very very clean!! The hosts were also INCREDIBLE! They were always very quick to respond to messages and to accommodate any needs. Will be coming back to Hastings just to stay here :)"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So many little details that we did not expect. Fresh flowers throughout the house, comfortable beds and pillows, great showers, upgraded appliances, large covered porch with huge grill, so much more! Quick response to questions and needs. Good room layouts, lots of space, great for family gathering. Can' say enough good things about our experience!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This farmhouse has been very tastefully remodeled. It's beautiful and comfy, plus, Scott is a fantastic host. This place is a true gem."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful property! We had an issue with Wifi & Scott was on it right away. Just an FYI there is no cell phone service for Verizon, so that's why we were so concerned with needing wifi. We are already thinking about our next stay! Thanks so much!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a truly special place on a beautiful piece of property, and Scott is an exceptional host. We loved everything about our visit."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! We loved our stay and all the special touches. Would definitely stay again!!
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"If we could give this place 6 out of 5 stars, we would. We have stayed at many AirBnB locations around the world and this one is truly world class. The location is about 20 minutes outside of Hastings, Nebraska off a dirt road on a tranquil farm. Let‚Äôs start with the owner. Scott was so responsive, helpful, flexible and generous. The attention to detail was incredible with a welcome basket when we arrived, fresh flowers, slippers and robes, wine, not a detail was missed. Hastings is the home of Pacha soap company so we were gifted a few bars of this wonderful, soap as well. We are truly grateful for all he did. The farm house still has a few reminders of the original farmhouse like exposed fireplace and then everything else was modern, immaculate, beautifully designed and appointed. This place could be featured in any design magazine for an example modern, farm house. Everything seemed brand new. The kitchen was well stocked and the little things like salt, pepper, oils, spices were all there which makes it so much easier to cook and not have to remember all those details. The beds were so comfortable and then the two walk-in showers with ‚Äúrain‚Äù style shower heads added to the spa feeling. At night it becomes magical, because the old fashion windmill outside is lit up and the front porch is strung with bulbs as well. The front porch is a perfect gathering place with comfortable sofas and tables. We had a family gathering and are so appreciative of the space. Across the dirt driveway is a second house, we had more family staying in that property too so between the two houses there are 6 bedrooms, perfect for family reunions. The grounds are well maintained, a photographers dream with a beautiful white barn, rustic wood haybarns, metallic grain bins and fields of grasses as far as the eye can see. Staying here was a gift to our family. Thank you Scott!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott‚Äôs little slice of heaven was the best Airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had. Scott didn‚Äôt miss a single detail and was so thoughtful in making sure we had everything we needed. He went above and beyond to make this such a cozy stay. In terms of cleanliness and covid safety, which we are very concerned with, it was top notch. We felt so safe, clean and comfortable. We are taking notes on all of the amazing decor for our house. We also were traveling on a road trip with our dog and toddler. Scott had everything we needed for our son and our dog loved roaming on the pasture. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Scott's farmhouse is a lovely, sparkling clean, rural retreat. Our family especially loved the large covered deck which is where we chose to have our meals and hang out to enjoy the fresh country air. Thanks again Scott!"

We wished we could have spent a week, or just moved in! I cannot recommend more highly. Definitely stay here!!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is SO BEAUTIFUL. Its a hidden gem a few miles outside of Hastings, NE. This house is our dream house, and the esthetic is top notch. Its a smart house, so everything is updated accordingly. They had eveything you could possibly need. They thought of everything. The decore, thier personal notes left around the house, the bath and body works wallflowers, snacks to eat, and wonderful smelling soaps, it was all so personal! I can not stress how incredible our stay was. The host was very accommodating and had great hospitality. It was also perfect for our puppy. She had her own space in the mud room. We will stay here again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Beautiful place on such unique and open land. Scott is a wonderful host! Place was sparkling clean!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"Scott‚Äôs home is charming with all kinds of touches that make it feel like home. This is our 2nd stay and we really enjoy the home as well as the porch/ grill and the property. You have room to relax and visit. I also appreciate the board games and game table and top of the line coffee maker. Every detail adds to the comfort of the stay. ***If you‚Äôre reading this before you book, also order some Wagyu steaks from Scott. Grill them while you‚Äôre there or get some to take home. #protips üòÄ"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse is an amazing, peaceful place to stay. Scott was a lovely host and everything exceeded my expectations. Had an excellent time and would absolutely stay again."

Scott & Liz have thought of every little detail, the kitchen is well equipped, even with a coffee bar and games for the family and kids. The covered porch was the perfect place for a drink while we watched our dogs romp in the beautiful back yard. We will definitely be coming back in our way back across the country in a month!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely adorable Piece of calm and quiet! Great amenities! Host was very personable and went above and beyond to to provide what we needed! Very cozy! Would definitely recommend for a weekend away!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place. Scott was very prompt and courteous! Would highly recommend staying here
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott‚Äôs place was beautiful inside and out! If I ever find myself in Nebraska again, I will be stopping by!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! The house is absolutely gorgeous, and I can't say enough about how wonderful Scott was as a host. We expected a nice place to stay, but honestly I think this is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in a lot, throughout the US and Europe)!
The house is fully stocked to keep children and adults entertained. My daughter instantly gravitated towards the game shelf, which was quickly abandoned when she saw the air hockey table. We had plans to play every game, but who can stay inside when there is such a beautiful area to play outside? We were able to explore the farm and buildings and go for nice walks around the field. Our time there was too short to experience it all. We will be back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott and Jane have created a sparkling clean beautiful oasis on the prairie. They are amazing hosts and have thought of every detail to make the home comfortable and welcoming, down to the awesome blow dryer, yoga mat and hotel-quality towels. They offered very clear communication in booking. We stayed with our two children, who loved exploring the beautiful and inspiring property and had a chance to experience a Nebraska summer's freedom to roam around, catch fireflies, make s'mores on the fire pit, play on the deck, pick mulberries and learn about the incredible variety of birds that live in the nearby trees. The house itself is absolutely gorgeous (and, for this working mom, the coffee maker is top notch!) with the most beautiful bathrooms and very comfortable bedrooms. The kitchen is a dream. It is pristinely clean and Scott takes extra steps to keep it sanitized during the pandemic. We enjoyed every minute of our experience on this property and cannot wait to return. Our children cried genuine tears when we left and we spent the morning of check out taking photos of various trees and barns for their scrapbooks so they wouldn't ever forget -- at their request (they are 4 and 7 years old). I would give Scott and Jane 10 stars if I could for what they have so lovingly created and restored. It is worth whatever extra miles it takes you off the Interstate. The experience of this place is a gift."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott's stunning, modern, rural retreat is one of the best Airbnb's we've ever stayed in! There isn't a single thing that Scott hasn't thought out when setting up the space and we were blown away by the fully stocked pantry with everything from s'more supplies to a variety of coffee and teas. Then there was the amazing selection of games and kids colouring supplies that our children dived on and were happily distracted by while we unloaded. The house was also spotless and the design and layout were thoughtful and stylish. Then there is the property...such a special piece of land with incredible beauty and history and now a wonderful veggie garden that is taking shape. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else when we're in Nebraska."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house offers many incredible amenities and was cleaner than any place we‚Äôve ever stayed. In this time of global pandemic, that really means everything to us. The home easily and comfortably housed our family of seven and the surrounding property offered breathtaking country views. And our children loved the air hockey table and the Google Home smart speakers!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing! I had never been anywhere in Nebraska before and I don't know what I was expecting but I have a serious soft spot in my heart now for this place and for Ayr Nebraska. Energetically it's just a very uplifting zone, and the house is so sweet and really spacious and clean, and it just felt so cozy and I literally spent the entire day in the field in the back. Absolutely gorgeous. Would highly recommend!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"What can I say except for AMAZING! Not only is the house the perfect getaway if you want some relaxing time with nature but Scott is an amazing host. All of the added touches in the house make you feel right at home from the comfy beds to the awesome showers to the luxurious towels!! As a group, we had a few special requests, and Scott was more than willing to help us out and allowed our fun ideas. Would definitely book again in the future!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott‚Äôs farmhouse was amazing! The house was super clean, tasteful touches throughout every room, cold drinks and snacks. The yard, deck, and grill were also wonderful. Scott was great with communication and we felt at home from the moment we stepped into the farmhouse. You will not be disappointed if you stay here!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is an absolute gem. I would highly recommend staying here. Scott is a fantastic host and the place is beautiful.
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"I can‚Äôt tell you how lovely this place was! We were only in for a night but we could have a mini vacation here just for how great of a place it was. Super clean, super updated, so many games and even drinks and snacks! Can‚Äôt say enough good about this lovely little farmhouse"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is the perfect way to relax and unwind in a bucolic setting. The house is adorable with a beautiful kitchen, large porch and comfortable beds/ bedding. Did I mention the killer coffee station? This place has all of the touches needed for a perfect stay. Enjoy!"

2020-04-01,5,Group trip,"Scott's place is impeccably clean with an eclectic style. The rooms are all spacious and comfortable which was perfect for our large family. The renovated farmhouse has amazing craftsmanship, and the property has the feel of an upscale retreat."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is by far the nicest place I‚Äôve ever stayed at. I can‚Äôt say enough about how breathtaking everything is. Tons of creativity and hard work went into this home. We had an amazingly restful, peaceful stay which was just what we needed after 20+ hours on the road. Thank you sooo much! We want to live here!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Took a little bit to figure out the front door (A little tight - have to use some force). The private room had a separate lock and there was a shared area with a hot plate and a microwave and some cooking dishes. The bathroom was big, standup shower, jacuzzi, his & hers sinks. The minifridge had six water bottles in it which I went through. The only complaint would be a weird running water sound coming through the ceiling vents. Not sure if that's a normal issue with the type of heating that was present in the building or not. Overall the house was clean and met my needs."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Will definitely stay again!

Joan is one amazing host who has a passi√≥n for hosting people! She made me feel at home. If I need anything she would do her best to help me!!
If you are in Hastings please consider Staying at this wonderful B&B!!!
Love, Love, Love üíï üíñ"

Our room was comfortable and very clean and the private bathroom was nice. The house is beautiful and decorated with lovely antique pieces. Breakfast was really tasty and Joan is a great host. I would highly recommend and stay here again!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joni is a wonderful and warm host and the accommodations couldn't be more comfortable, clean and complete. Not so sure we were supposed to get a breakfast, but we did and that was great as well. We highly recommend staying here."

2021-09-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This is a great short-term place to stay. I stayed for 6 weeks which was too long in my opinion to go without access to a kitchen. There is that ""homey"" atmosphere which is nice. I would just check beforehand to make sure that breakfast is in fact included. The only other drawback is that you can't lock the bedroom door from the outside."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Skip the hotel and stay here. Lovely old home, sparkling clean and gracious host. We left early and missed breakfast. Will plan better next time. Hastings is a nice place to explore, close to I-70 and the shortcut to Colorado Springs if you enjoy getting off the freeway like we do. Seriously, it‚Äôs a great place to stay. One flight of stairs but the use of the living room and the coffee station make up for it."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was nice and host was fantastic. Breakfast was delicious. When you want to get away from a hotel this is a great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool historic area! Enjoyed the walking tour around Hastings that included this beautifully restored home. Comfortable bed. Apartment sized refrigerator in room was very convenient. Hot breakfast in the morning was AMAZING!! Would definitely stay here again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joni‚Äôs place is very clean. The outside temperatures were extremely humid and warm. Joni had the house at the perfect temperature. We were in town for a wedding, and our schedule did not permit us to fully enjoy all of what Joni had to offer."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I have stayed at Joni‚Äôs bnb twice! It‚Äôs very clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was delicious! I would definitely stay there again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,the cutest airbnb/bed & breakfast! She was the sweetest and breakfast was amazing!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joan‚Äôs place is located in historical district, with quiet surroundings and nicely manicured lawns.
I arrived fairly late, so I didn‚Äôt explore Hastings, but it was a sizeable town with many shops, banks, and even a DunknDonuts.
My upstairs room was spotless, as was the adjacent bathroom. I sleep hot so the ceiling fan was an added bonus!
A hot breakfast with a nice Keurig coffee bar was included, and that made my day! Outside the room was a microwave and mini fridge in case you brought your own.
I highly recommend Joni‚Äôs place!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joni‚Äôs guest room and nearby shower/WC, the Living/TV Room and hearty breakfast, made the stay in Hastings a wonderful success. Coming and going was very simple and accommodating. The potted plant that I traveled with spent the night in Joni‚Äôs yard and had a good drink, to boot."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and convenient charming home in picturesque quiet setting. Delicious breakfast served.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joni was a wonderful host and her B and B is a pure delight. Very clean and nostalgic. She went above and beyond to make certain I was taken care of. Hopefully, I will get an opportunity to stay again for longer! Also, Hastings is a quaint little town I would love to spend some time enjoying as well! This stop was just a quick stay over on the way through."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Omar‚Äôs Place was warm and inviting, we felt at home with every little detail including the new socks in a basket to be comfy in a shoeless environment.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was spotless with a very well stocked kitchen with every item we needed. Clean and comfortable beds. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival.
The bathroom is extremely small but that‚Äôs how older homes are.
Plenty of linens and towels. Omar, it would be good to add towel hangers, perhaps in the bedroom as you enter the bathroom. Not a big deal‚Ä¶. It was one block. From St. Cecelia‚Äôs Church which is where our event was . This would be perfect for wedding guests at this church.
Highly recommend!!! Nice job, Omar on making this older home beautiful and cozy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I had the best time and the space was amazing! We would love to come back next year !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Omar‚Äôs place was great spot for my friends and I. We came into town for mini reunion from our time at Hastings College about 20 years ago, and this was a nice, clean, and comfy spot to land after spending the day out and about with friends that I hadn‚Äôt seen in quite some time. Thanks, Omar!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay would stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful experience at Jacque‚Äôs rental which is perfect for a short or long term stay. Fantastic location and is within walking distance to many of the areas attractions. I look forward to my next stay here!
Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Gods for the money, we had everything we needed."
2024-03-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Definitely Overpaid. You pay more than for the best hotel in town (Hampton or Holiday inn) but you get worst than the cheapest motel in town.
They claim not to charge cleaning fee (they‚Äôll make you do it) - wonder why? Maybe they don‚Äôt clean properly‚Ä¶"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were a little nervous pulling in with the curb appeal but pleasantly surprised by the inside. It was warm and homey. The beds were incredibly comfortable with the softest sheets and blankets ever. Lots of board games and stuff to do. Only 2 chairs at the table but it worked out ok. The bedrooms are all attached but very spacious and doors to seperate them. Host was incredibly helpful and even offered to bring a pack and play for our baby. Would definitely stay again if we are ever in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jacque was very responsive and helpful. I‚Äôd definitely stay at this place again if I was in the Hastings area.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,the only thing holding back from a 5 star review is air conditioning unit could not keep up with both sides of the home. we were quit warm and had to borrow a fan from the family we were in town to visit. other than that everything was superb. we will try to use this house again next time we visit Hastings.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay. The upstairs was very private with a private entrance. While there was no kitchen, Brett had a stocked refrigerator and a microwave, plus coffee. We did not need a kitchen. The rooms were generously large with comfortable beds. The linens were new.
I loved the charm of the place--older home, great character, teeny, tiny bathroom. If you like older homes with unique architecture, this is the place. It was really close to the college, so perfect to get around and enjoy the events with our daughter.
Very safe and quiet neighborhood. Good parking. Beautiful setting!"
