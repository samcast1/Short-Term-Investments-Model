2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It was everything my boyfriend wanted and more during his escape from the hustle and bustle of hauling concrete in DFW. My son had NO ANXIETY which was a blessing he is a 3yr old with ASD. The pictures, the decor, it feels like a home that was steeped in love throughout the years, truly. We wished we could have spent more time enjoying the home than visiting family. Amazing hosts! Amazing job! We are still in awe at how it checked every box on the list of things we wanted and needed for our short getaway. Thank you Beverlee and Keith your home was truly a home to us."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I opened the side door off the car port of Killgore Cottage I was in awe. Attention to decore, ambience and cleanliness were immediately apparent. On a stifling Louisiana day the house was enticingly cool with AC and ceiling fans running. As I moved through the house lamps provided a dimly lit path revealing a collection of vintage treasures and the overhead light switches. It was apparent I was both expected and being invited in.
As a lone traveller I felt safe in Killgore cottage and in the residential neighborhood I temporarily joined.
I found it ideally situated for my purpose and during the hottest part of the August days a welcoming retreat.
From condiments to soaps and cleaning supplies so many extras were provided.
I left Haynesville contentedly knowing I have a cozy Louisiana home to return to on my next visit.
Beverlee and Keith are amazing hosts; they‚Äôre friendly and welcoming, very responsive to communication and considerate of guest privacy."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cant say more! It was a pleasure to come back to the cottage every day! This place was the second best part of a miserable trip and weather! (Seeing my son was first best!). I‚Äôm from Ecuador, and had sticker shock daily on this trip! But the cottage felt worth the money during a trip that I may not be able to make again! I‚Äôm 76 yrs old, and the trip from Ecuador was really hard. But Beverly and the good people of Haynesville gave me peace and comfort‚ù§Ô∏è thank you! Thanks to Jimmy Dale Williams too ü•∞

It was truly special to stay in Haynesville, the home of our ancestors, and being able to stay in this wonderful home with all the amenities one could ever think to need, with the additional feeling of true Southern living, well, it doesn't get any better than that! So any other descendants of Haynesville or anyone visiting Northern Louisiana - this is a must stay! Beverlee ... you 've done your town proud! Thank you from all of us - we will definitely be back!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a super cute, recently remodeled, fully stocked for a long term stay, three bedroom home, located about 2 blocks from a park and almost in the middle of the tiny town. The front porch is perfect for sipping your favorite beverage and watching the neighbors drive by. The screened in back porch is shaded by a large tree and presents a relaxed place to contemplate. The large back yard, shaded by the same tree is a wonderful place to do yoga & watch the neighborhood birds. Basically everyone is friendly and will wave at you as you sit on the porch, walk around town, or talk to you if you run into them at the Piggly Wiggly. There are a handful of restaurants in town one can support. The downtown area has great potential. I personally feel that if the town had a few festivals during the year, perhaps a farmers market (not sure if I missed one), got the downtown spiced up with perhaps local artists, farmers, beekeepers, lemonade stands..whatever the peoples talents are, this town could be even more amazing. From this cute home to the church bells ringing throughout the day to the trains that slowly pass thru town, occasionally blowing their whistles, & the wonderful people. You may just want to stay longer. : )"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, comfortable home, wish we could've stayed longer. We evacuated Ida here, and feel blessed that this beautiful home was available to stay in for the short time we did. All amenities present, the beds, super comfortable, quiet neighborhood, and nice, generous host. Thank you again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,10/10 southern charm and hospitality! The house is wonderful and so comfy! The town is a great place to be with church bells to be heard and everyone is so polite and helpful! Friendliest place we have been to in a long while! This house is a must stay if your in the area! Absolutely outstanding!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming, quite and comfortable little home in the middle of nowhere! I would drive out of my way to stay! If you need a cozy home feel, this charming little spot will brighten your day!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to gather our family over Thanksgiving as our cabin on lake Erling was too small for our entire family.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A very nice place. Quiet and peaceful. We were in town for a family funeral. It was very nice to get away from everyone and have a whole house alone. The house is not far from restaurants or town, but far enough that you feel like you are away from everything. The house is clean with plenty of room. The toys and games provided where wonderful for the two youngest children and the wifi was fast and kept my oldest occupied. Would recommend to anyone visiting from out of town needing a place to get away and be their own for any trip."

Before we left, my husband and kids were able to explore a little of the yard. There are neighboring dogs (fenced) that were very friendly. My kids loved on them through the fence. Simple instructions for when checking out, common courtesy expectations. Take the trash, turn lights off and place the thermostat back to the starting temp."

Hosts were very communicative, and even though I didn't have any needs, I feel they would have been extremely available if I did."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful jewel to find near downtown Magnolia. Cory and Christie have everything you need. The house is inviting, comfortable, and easy to find.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for Family Day at SAU and were not able to secure a hotel room so we decided to check out Air B&B in the area and we are so glad we did. The Rafters is exactly what we needed! Cory and Christie were such wonderful hosts! We had six people staying so we brought our own air mattress to use as an extra bed (there are two bedrooms, each with a queen bed) but upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find that Christie had put up an extra twin bed as well as a queen size air mattress and had made the beds for us as well. The kitchen was well equipped with coffee, creamer, sugar, etc. which was also very nice. The apartment was conveniently located, very clean and cute. Our 14 month old grandson also enjoyed watching the chickens out the back door. We will definitely be staying here again when we go back to SAU to visit our granddaughter."

Cory and Christie are great, friendly people.
It‚Äôs a cute private place. Covered parking and entry in back. The house is as described and pictured in the ad. It‚Äôs reasonably priced but a deal if you split it with a second couple.
Backyard bbq is good food. One brisket sandwich would have been plenty for the two of us. We‚Äôll have to try the ribs next time.
We will stay again."

We wanted to get out of town and sort of randomly chose Magnolia. The place is easy to find, the only downside to that is that you'll hear road noise.
The kitchen was really well stocked, I made a mini Thanksgiving meal easily, then we chilled out in the recliners.
Logoly State Park had nice trails and the stop at The Flying Burger in the way back into town was a good pit stop.
The beds were comfortable, lovely bedding, etc."

We never ran out of hot water even with 5 showering. They have everything you need for your stay and then some! I was thankful for the extra touches like cold bottles of water and laundry soap. They had games and dvds plus Netflix, cable and I think Amazon prime. They had a contactless check in that was nice since we arrived late that night.

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled to town to participate in an organized bike ride held in Magnolia as a fundraiser for a local non-profit. I was very pleased to find that the Rafters was available as it is just blocks from my event location, enabling me to ride my bike to and from the event without having to load up the car and park, etc.. The space is very clean and modern, with all the amenities you might expect such full kitchen and bathroom supplies. Beds were very comfortable as well as the living room furniture. Parking was private and covered away from the street, which is very nice during the hot summer, sunny months of south Arkansas. If you're seeking a nice place to stay in town, this is worth your consideration."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cory was great in communicating with us the day of check-in. There was a notebook once inside that contained basic information about the area as well as menus for eating establishments in town.
Beautiful property with a well thought out floor plan. It‚Äôs close enough to the square you can walk to the area and it‚Äôs an easy drive to SAU as well. The property is quiet, clean, and cozy. It‚Äôs obvious the owners put in a lot of love and attention to the property."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our trip could not have been better. We were in Magnolia for our youngest sons wedding. This was our first experience with AirBNB and it was wonderful. Instead of a hotel room for several days I booked our stay at this great apartment. It was a fabulous place, it is super clean, fully stocked with great linens and a washer and dryer and the bed was ""absolutely the most comfortable bed I have slept in away from home"". Cory and his lovely wife were very accommodating as we had extra stuff to drag in for the wedding. We were super busy while we were there and were constantly in and out, everything in town is very convenient, even made a quick trip to have the nails and toes done, about 3 mins from the apartment. We had family & friends that dropped by for a visit and it was so nice to be able to relax and visit instead of being in a hotel lobby!!! I would definitely give this place 5 Stars, it is A Wonderful Place to Stay. We will be back and certainly will book with them again."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very stylish and close to most things. The only thing to think about is it has thin walls so you an hear a lot but overall it was a great stay and I would definitely recommend it to others.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Cory and family were very friendly and communication was great. Within walking distance to shops and restaurants in the town square. Short drive to SAU campus where our son goes to school and I lays football. Would definitely recommend to anyone and will stay there again. Thanks for a great stay Cory.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cory‚Äôs place was perfect. We were I. Town for a wedding and I am so happy with my choice to stay at the Rafters. The host was so gracious and kind. The accommodations were perfect and the WiFi was fast and the AC cool! Everything we needed was provided including water in the fridge. I can‚Äôt tell you how many rentals I have checked into to only find nothing to drink that first night after a long drive. I could not have been happier with our stay! Thanks again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience at an Airbnb and it was great! The Rafters is very clean, there are plenty of linens, and the kitchen is well stocked with dishes, pots and pans, and utensils. There‚Äôs a dishwasher as well as a washer and dryer. The Rafters is walking distance to charming downtown Magnolia and an easy drive to SAU. Cory and Christie are excellent hosts. Highly recommend!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well kept and clean space. Easy check-in and check-out process. Cory was easy to communicate and very timely in his responses.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cory‚Äôs place was absolutely the best!! It was super spacious and exceptionally clean. The location is perfect. Only a few minutes from campus and just a few blocks from the square. All of the amenities were perfect!! Plenty of towels, cooking utensils, and extra blankets. The place was perfect and I can‚Äôt wait to come back for a longer stay!! If you are deciding between this place and a local hotel...don‚Äôt pass this up!! The price is great for the space you get and it‚Äôs just a overall great place!! :)"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Came up for the weekend to see our son who is freshman at Southern Arkansas University. Never booked through Airbnb before. I give everything about it five stars. Cory was fantastic, as was his property. He made everything effortless from check-in through check-out. Will definitely stay again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,this place was so cute!! The beds were super comfy and it just felt like home! We would definitely stay here again.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Corey and Christie's place was perfect for our family of 5 (this includes our 2 fur babies)! We also had our 7-month old niece over for a night. Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Check in was a breeze, communication was effortless and the home was much more spacious than we'd anticipated. Matter of fact, we were expecting an apartment but what we got was more of a duplex-two-family home, and quite stylish with lots of thoughtful extra touches. There were plenty of comfy plush towels, and the place was immaculately clean. Normally, I don't book Airbnb stays where the owner lives on property due to my desire for absolute privacy. However, I never would've known the owners lived next door had they not mentioned it. We were given all of the autonomy needed to enjoy the space as our own. The outside seating area was a fantastic plus with a basketball goal our 7-year old son and his 6-year old cousin thoroughly enjoyed. The waterfall and Zen garden were perfect for our morning mediations, and the guidebook provided by the hosts was extremely helpful and saved us lots of time when ordering in.
The only thing I'd say is the car wash next door can get a little loud throughout the day and late at night. However, traveling from the city (New York) to the south, you don't consider that real noise. Needless to say, we slept right through it! Someone looking for a bit more silence may not feel the same.
We loved our stay so much that we extended it for another night and would undoubtedly return for another visit."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A comfortable stay. Like being home away from home!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed. Cory is extremely nice and very accommodating. The home is beautiful, clean, and feels like home. My family and I will definitely be staying there every time we travel to Magnolia."
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,This place was AMAZING!! Cory and his wife are amazing hosts and gave us a bunch of suggestions of things to do while we visited. The layout of the rafters is super unique and the cleanliness was immaculate. I would definitely recommend staying here!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cory and his family were incredibly kind and thoughtful. From giving us a heads up on the best Mexican restaurants in town to the fresh zucchini bread given to us, they were very intentional and helpful.
The place itself was fantastic. It was very clean and comfortable. The bedrooms and bath had nice individual touches that made them distinct, but were still functional and very comfortable. Shower pressure is a big deal to me, and I was not disappointed!
The kitchen and living area were open and allowed us to talk while one was preparing dinner and the other relaxing with Netflix.
Also, being a southerner, AC is essential and the home stayed cool on the 90+ degree days were were there.
Cory and his family have created a pleasant and peaceful place to rest, relax, and enjoy a bit of small town life and hospitality."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Also, located in a great central location in Magnolia."

Highly recommend for a short or long stay in Magnolia!"

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really well done and by far the best Airbnb we've stayed in. Nothing was overlooked: iron and ironing board, coffee maker (with coffee), cold water waiting in the fridge, washer and dryer, tons of towels... It's slightly higher priced than some places I've stayed, but you're getting what you pay for. Since I've rated other Airbnb locations 5 stars, this one should be a 6."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb has everything you need to feel ‚Äúhome‚Äù when you‚Äôre away from your home. This is near many different food options and was very clean. Will definitely stay here in the future !

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable stay, and really charming!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's very rustic bed & breakfast vibe minus onsite owners. Has 4 separate rooms with own bathroom with one being a family suite. Little kitchen and family room. It's like a shared apartment where you feel like it's ok to not lock your doors. Two flights of stairs, easy to manage. Heather is amazing and helped my family when visiting from OH for a family funeral when there was a mixup in our reservations with another hotel. She was able to book us a room and relieved of us a very stressful situation. She may not have realized she also booked other family members from out of town as well. We enjoyed our stay and if ever back in Magnolia will definitely try to stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If in Magnolia, this is the place to stay. Great location on the town square. Felt safe!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was very nice and accommodating. The location was great. Easy to get in, and if needed would book again.
There were a couple of dirty washcloths overlooked, and the bathroom did not seem to get a good cleaning, but nothing we couldn‚Äôt wipe down. There were a couple of stains on a couple of the blankets, but again, just an oversight I would think. The kids and I had plenty of room and it was nice to be about to walk around the square without having to drive anywhere else."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place to stay. Perfect location to walk to shops downtown. I will 100% be back here to visit again. 5 stars

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Older home, but super clean and comfortable. Quiet peaceful residential area.
This was my first time using Airbnb, and I was not expecting the addition of a cleaning fee or Airbnb fee. Obviously this is not the Host fault but with the way the App advertises the properties. Airbnb should show all fees associated with the rental at the beginning of the search.
I would definitely recommend this host and property to any future customers."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to relax and have family together. Loved everything about it. Thanks Patricia for sharing your home. We had a great time. You are the best host üòò

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to town so my husband could take paramotor flying classes at the airport and the little house in Springhill was exactly what we needed. Extremely convenient as we could walk to downtown, grocery and a few restaurants. With few options in town for hotels we were very pleased to find a place that was so clean and pleasant and comfortable. I really enjoyed sitting on the porch swing and listening to the high school band practice or reading while my husband was at school. I was even able to ride my bike the 3 1/2 short miles to meet him at the airport at the end of the day. I would absolutely stay here again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"For my friend and I, Patricia‚Äôs home was the perfect place to be. We had travelled down from Washington, D.C. to learn how to fly paramotors from Kyle O‚ÄôGlee. It was close to the airport where we would be training and centrally located to everything we would need. We shopped at the Piggly Wiggly and Walmart, but there is a Brookshire grocery store just a block down the road. Her home had a kitchen where we would make our meals, a washer and dryer where we would do our laundry, and WiFi so that we could access the internet. Also, in the family room, there was a TV attached to some streaming services where we could watch movies after a long day of training."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay very nice loved the house! I will be back again for sure!!!!!
2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Bit of a creepy house. I know it's an older one, which is totally fine, but there are 2 areas of just crawl spaces that have furniture covering them. I wish that was made known before my stay.
It honestly felt like the perfect place to murder the guests and then sell their belongings at the auction house across the street.
It really smells awful inside. We left a thing a fabreeze for the next guest. Not to sound dramatic but I had to wash my clothes twice back at home before I could get the lingering smell out of them.
Generally cleanish, but not the type of place I would pay for again. It is definitely better than the 2 motels in the town though.
I'd suggest upgrading the house, putting a bathroom near the main bedroom, and getting a professional cleaner to clean everything thoroughly. It was clear the owner cleans it themselves.
Please please cover/get rid of the creepy crawl spaces."

We then had to make arrangements elsewhere to shower."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is a must see. Ms. Peggy and Mr. Paul did not forget a thing when preparting this little beauty. The decor, snacks, and just plain presence of this cabin speaks peaceful. From the moment we arrived, the busy hassle of everyday was not a thought. Our boys wanted to be outside. In our electronic world, this makes a mommas heart smile. We lit a fire, made smores, and the kiddos played horseshoes. My little one was sad to leave. The cows are a beautiful off the front porch. And to say the least, I have never had owners have so much communication with you. They made us feel like family! Thank you so much for sharing this little peace of heaven with us."

My sons favorite part of the trip was playing in the tub while watching tv. My daughter loved all the fun and unique decorations. I wouldn't consider it a longer rental than 2 or 3 days, the fridge is small and there is only the tub in the main bedroom. But for our 1 night trip it was perfect. We decided to watch them feed the cows at feeding time and Peggy and Paul are just the nicest people. Would love to go back!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Omg this place went above and beyond all my expectations, to my fire pit loaded up with wood to my late night snack or supper ready in the freezer! My bath had bubbles waiting on me and s‚Äômores ready to be cooked and ate! I got to pet Molly their friendly cow, and check out their amazing ranch! My tip to staying here is stay much longer than you expected because you‚Äôre not gonna want to leave!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Quite little bunkhouse on back of property with an amazing view. Will be returning here for a visit. It was a short stay but everywhere i looked there was something drawing me in to see what it was. If your looking to escape this is the perfect place. Although I didn‚Äôt get to use the fire pit. It was set up nice.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Quiet and peaceful.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place is so amazing. So cozy and very unique.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Some friends and I decided fairly last minute to take the trip to see the 2024 Solar Eclipse in totality, and finding a decent place in the path was difficult. I feel like this place was meant for us because it was the perfect driving distance away from the path of totality. The amenities are beyond what we expected. The decor, the layout, the goodies, the coffee bar, THE TUB.........the cedar closet in the 2nd bath was an expected and pleasant touch, too. We hope to stay again in the future!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian came just after we got there. He was very helpful to show us around and give us instructions about the thermostat, light switches, etc. We are from Springhill and grew up there. So we played the ‚Äúdo you know ‚Ä¶‚Äù game for a while. We have lots of friends and family there, so we were happy to see them again. My 98-year-old mother was with me & is handicapped, but she was very comfortable! Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint and immediately feels like home the minute you walk through the door. Super clean‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and the decorating skills are top shelf! A lot of time and creativity was put into making this house feel cozy.

This old house has been beautifully redone and if you look around, you can see some of the old woodwork and other features of the old home that have been preserved. Very very clean and safe and you won‚Äôt starve because Brian has goodies that would fancy anyone‚Äôs craving until you feel like going to the store‚Ä¶"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Farmhouse is a beautiful place. It‚Äôs easy to get to & close to everything that Springhill has to offer.

Brian went above and beyond with communicating to insure everything was in perfect working order and we were comfortable. The house is well furnished with comfortable beds, livingroom sofa, chairs-recliners, nice luxury linens especially the towels! Very spa like! The full kitchen just like home! A huge backyard with chairs to relax in and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. We didn't have the opportunity to use the grill and picnic table but oh we sure will on our next visit! Thank you so much Brian for your hospitality and for creating this beautiful home for visitors to enjoy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Born, raised, and graduated from here. The trip was business and leisure. The farmhouse was a very cool place to stay while visiting relatives and finishing business on my parent's estate. When we return to visit again, we will stay at the farmhouse.

We had to stand to eat. Other than that, this place is amazing. We will stay again during our trips to see our son play ball at SAU. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best airbnb we have stayed in throughout our decision to transition from hotel to airbnbs.
This will be our new airbnb of choice when traveling to Minden.
Everything was exceptional!
We have never had a host to give such personal care.
The host had everything you would need, everything!
Total comfort and the beds were amazing."

The home was beautifully decorated with a country/contemporary style. We felt like we were being pampered! Not only did our host greet us and conversate with us, but he stocked the house with breakfast foods, beverages, and snacks. It was so clean and refreshing when we walked in. The only drawback was that we were there for a funeral and didn't get a chance to enjoy having a place away from home. Thank you Brian for taking great care of my family and me during a difficult time. You're the best!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my husband said this is absolute favorite so far on Airbnb. Very spacious, lots of room to spread out. All the convinces of home, up-to-date.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michelle‚Äôs home was so beautiful. Felt cozy and peaceful. It rained during our stay so unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the outside but that‚Äôs ok bc we have plans on staying there the next time we come back. Highly recommend. üôÇ
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay, peaceful and relaxing! Would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Worked perfectly for what we needed! A base spot to explore lots of things within 2 hours. We came for the eclipse so we took the opportunity to also go see Louisiana and some Arkansas state parks! Very clean and well laid out if you want to meet friends. Bedrooms are nicely sized and spread out a little so there‚Äôs a little bit of privacy, while also having good sized living areas to hang out in. Beds were super soft too!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great and responsive also the kids loved seeing all the cows. Would recommend and book again in the future!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy place to find. The atmosphere felt like you were in a movie. Everything was coordinated well in the house.

We will be staying again, hopefully for longer than a weekend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful home in a serene area
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place with an even better host.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Staying here was incredible! I booked it for my bridesmaids and I over the weekend because it was close to the wedding venue. Michelle not only provided a beautiful place for us to stay but a cute little gift basket with all sorts of goodies for the girls and I. I have stayed at many Air BNB‚Äôs but this was by far my favorite.
The master bath is beautiful, the living room is nice and cozy and the entire house is in a private but beautiful little part of land. It was the perfect place to sit on the front porch and have a cup of coffee while doing a devotional. 10/10 stay for sure."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I own a small home and have no room for guests so I booked this home. I would definitely book again. Very nice and clean. I loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing!!! We were looking for a country place for a peaceful weekend....this was it!! The surroundings were beautiful and the house was so comfy. I felt at home the second I walked in. We couldn't have asked for more. Michelle had even decorated for Christmas. Loved this place!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and felt right at home. To all of our surprise, my kids survived the weekend without tv üòÇ 10/10! We hope to stay here every time we visit Texarkana."

2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Average stay overall.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, very helpful and responsive. Place was great and very accommodating."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved Dana's little cozy tiny house! It was close enough to Southern Arkansas University for me to get to and from for my daughters track meet. I stayed alone, but it would be enough space for 2 people if needed. Only thing I would say is if there is 2 people, you might want to make sure your comfortable going to the bathroom in front of them üôÇ as there's no separation between bathroom and open area/sleeping area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dana is a great host! She‚Äôs very kind and reaches out to make sure everything is going well. The place is perfect for 2 people, and our dogs felt right at home too! It was perfect for a weekend getaway."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a super cute tiny house. Dana was extraordinary and even helped me out by lending me a charger for my phone. We would stay there again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place. It was a described. The host was very nice and always checked in. She was helpful with recommendations for places to check out. I would definitely stay there again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We decided to stay since we were in Magnolia for the weekend for our son's baseball game. The tiny house was about 15 minutes or so from SAU's campus and was easily accessible right off the main road. The inside of the house is warm and inviting, but since it was our first experience in a tiny house, ever, there was some initial shock when we pulled into the driveway (you know, it's a tiny house). That wore off pretty instantly as--just like the pictures suggest--the house was inviting and comfortable: the interior design was well done. We slept exceptionally well. Since it was a quick turn around for us, we didn't have to cook while we were there. Our options were to stay in a hotel or Dana's place, and we made the right decision."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at this tiny home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Working nearby on a multi-day rural site investigation just east of Magnolia, the location was convenient and a welcome change to my usual hotel stays. This tiny home was clean, the listed amenities were accurate, and Dana was friendly and quick to respond each time I reached out. When I needed to extend my stay by one night, she was very helpful in making it happen. A convenience store is within easy walking distance, as is 'The Smokin Bull' restaurant (Wed-Sat lunch and dinner at this time) and another place (missed the name) that sells ice, breakfast, and lunch. I work in this part of the state regularly and will keep Dana's tiny house locations on my list of options for overnight stays."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"When I'm back in the area, I will definitely plan on staying here again. Very clean!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and just as described.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed here while working in Cotton Valley. This space was perfect for us! It was very clean, check in was easy, and there's a restaurant walking distance from the house. The host was very helpful and kind."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place to stay where I could be close to SAU for a few days and this was perfect. It is so cute and Dana was so easy to communicate with. I only had one little hiccup with the Wi-Fi, but she got it fixed up so quickly. If you stay here you have to eat at The Smokin Bull. The food is delicious!! It is a quick and easy drive into Magnolia."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Small but cute. Perfect for me while traveling.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"It doesn't look like much from the outside but It is a beautiful place inside. It was comfortable, warm and clean. It rain alot which caused plumbing issues that was fixed when the rain stopped. She responded quickly to the issues and emails. She was a very nice person. The only thing is, it is close to the road so hear the trucks and cars going past all day and night. I would recommend CiCi tiny house if you are in the area. If the noise from the road isn't a problem."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorably cute on the inside! Dana was an incredible host! There was a problem and she came over immediately to address it very late at night. She was quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed. I think Dana might be super woman honestly.
The location was a lot closer to the highway than I thought, but overall not a huge bother.
I was incredibly surprised by the food in Emerson and Magnolia. You have to go to the Smokin‚Äô Bull and get their grits! Delicious!
Magnolia was the cutest little town only 15 minutes away and did a tiny hike at the Logoly Park nearby. Overall I would 10/10 recommend! Thanks Dana for being a wonderful host and creating such a cute place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, Dana was a great host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a last minute booking and we couldn't have been happier with where we stayed. Clean, cozy, and looks exactly like the picture."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Dana‚Äôs little tiny town is a perfect little place. My husband and I just stayed for the night but we were very confused about where exactly it was because the directions had us across the other side of the highway. She helped us so much to get their. Thank you Dana ‚ù§Ô∏è much love

The outside is a wonderland from the dock to the huge back porch to the lounge area and fire pit areas. Beautifully landscaped and a lot of parking space. We enjoyed the beautiful sunsets from the dock and back porch.
The host was very helpful and reached out to us during our visit to see if we needed anything.
We highly recommend renting this property and would consider renting it again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great. Good for a family trip, great kitchen. Disney plus was already loaded on the TV so the kids could easily jump right on when we arrived. Beautiful surroundings. My wife forgot her work notebook at the house and James gladly mailed it back to us, which we were so thankful for. Overall a great time."
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"Very clean house with comfortable beds. The house is very pretty and the location was right on the lake. The only thing to be aware of is that there is only one bathroom so if you are traveling with a group of several adults, that might get a bit tricky, but not a deal breaker by any means! The host was also very gracious about early checkin/late checkout with great communication."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay! The views are wonderful & can be seen from almost anywhere in the house. The house is nice & cozy. We will definitely be back.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Patricia place was perfect. We typically stay in a hotel when we travel to Bossier city ‚Äúyes, I said Bossier City‚Äù. With Covid-19 I wanted to stay somewhere that was clean, plenty of space for our dog, 2, 11 & 17 year old. Patricias place allowed all of us to sit as a family or separate for alone time (11 & 17 year old lol üòÇ). Our oldest had her own room away from the boys. The bed my husband and I slept in was so comfortable, I wanted to take it home! The ‚ÄúFULLY‚Äù stocked kitchen was absolutely fantastic. I could go on and on about how great this little cottage was. We would definitely stay again!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Expect a older home in an established, quiet neighborhood close to major roads and with convenient shopping. It's an old home with a single bathroom so visitors with children and couples should plan accordingly. The kitchen and living areas are large and with 3 bedrooms you will be able to find a good night's rest for everyone in your party. The hostess is extremely responsive and will be there to help if you encounter any issues. Would stay again!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I've been in several airbnb's, but this place exceeded all my expectations. The house was super clean,and she provided things such as a fire stick, muffins, bottles of water, and other items that I never expect a host to provide. Her directions were perfect and she touched base a couple of times make sure everything was good. I was traveling alone and had the entire house to myself, but this place could easily accommodate an entire family. I will probably travel here in the future and this will be my first choice assuming it's not already booked. This place is extremely popular, so much so that I had to seek other arrangements(less accommodating)as it was already booked the final two nights of my trip."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The space is amazing. It is definitely a home away from home with all of the amenities
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"After being displace from Lake Charles by Hurricane Laura, we were looking for a place that was closer to my MIL, we were a family of 8 (5 Adults, 3 Kids). My MIL found this ‚Äú Little Patch of Heaven‚Äù called Home Away from Home. At first I didn‚Äôt think it was going to house all of us comfortably, upon arriving we noticed that there was a grocery store that was within walking distance from the home ( a + because I love to cook). Then we arrived at the house. Getting out of the cars after a long drive felt as if we were visiting grandma‚Äôs house. The swing and rockers and on the porch really made the house inviting ( if you‚Äôre a morning coffee drinker you‚Äôll love it here..... I DIDü§£). We had access to the Whole house, walking into the house I wanted to cry because it really felt as if I walking into my grandma‚Äôs house, it was very clean and cozy. It felt like I grew up there and Ms. Patricia‚Äôs hospitality was immeasurable, very kind hearted, an all around Amazing personality. She made our 2 Wk stay worth coming back. By the time we left here home away from home. We felt like we were a part of her family. I know she‚Äôs definitely become a part of ours."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Ms. Patricia was a wonderful host. My family was displaced during hurricane Laura but with the help of this Super Host she made our family feel right at home. After being without lights & taking cold showers for a week elsewhere, we found this comforting home to rest. We thank you and it was a pleasure meeting you. Hope to visit again!!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stop scrolling, this is your sign. You need to stay at this Airbnb. Ample amount of beds and space for the whole family. It‚Äôs an adorable older house that was sparkling clean smelled fresh and plenty of amenities to accommodate. Patricia was very prompt at responding, even into the late hours to help us with any questions we had. There‚Äôs a grocery store just a block down the rode and a Walmart. A lot of places were closed by 8:30pm though. I don‚Äôt know if that had to do with the times were going through currently or if it‚Äôs just the towns way, so I‚Äôd keep that in mind if you plan on checking in late. Other than that our stay was very satisfying and we‚Äôll gladly stay there again."
