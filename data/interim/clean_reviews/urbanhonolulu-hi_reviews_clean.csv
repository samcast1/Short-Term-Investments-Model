2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Better than expected!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, friendly staff and nice location"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful hotel that is within walking distance of Waikiki beach. The staff is friendly, the room was clean, and it has a great restaurant on site, as well as a snack shop. It's a perfect spot that I would definitely stay in again. I will say there is a lot of road noise at night and so the room was loud and it could be hard to sleep. But the location, price, and staff mean I will stay there again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool spot and close to everything
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy check-in and check out
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay - everything was spotless and clean! Lots to do around the area and very walkable, would definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay! Relaxing vibes with great amenities!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time at Wayfinder! Very central and a lovey location near the canal. The room and hotel itself are clean and very cute!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place has been completely redone and it’s super cute.
The pool is really private and has the perfect tropical vibes. I don’t usually like pools, but this one was really beautiful and the chlorine wasn’t strong. *(It would be even better if it was saline.)*
Theres even free tea and sunscreen at the towel counter!
The service at the pool bar, restaurant and coffee shop were excellent, and the front desk was super helpful and courteous.
The location is perfect- just 2 blocks from the beach, and right across the street from the Ala Wai which takes you to Kapiolani park for your morning jog or walk.
Very spacious rooms, and even a private lanai with wall hooks to hang your wet bikini and towel to dry. That’s hard to find at most hotels!
Excellent boutique hotel for a great price!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an amazing stay here. If we ever visit Oahu again, this is where we’ll be staying !"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, felt very welcomed and cared for. AC worked and was quiet. Would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s very nice cute and clean and I would stay again. Don’t forget to eat at the outside patio. Avocado toast is the best I’ve had. The staff is very nice :-)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wayfinder had really nice and welcoming staff. Always very attentive and maintained a clean room and hotel. Would recommend for anyone visiting.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyable overall. Tasteful updates.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay when in Waikiki!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay !
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay here! Staff was so friendly and accommodating! Everything was nice and clean each day as well. Lots of things walkable for entertainment and also easy accessibility to highways for visiting other beaches around the island!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hotel, probably cheaper to book directly with them. Overall, a nice place to stay for our 3 nights in Oahu. Walking distance from everything in Waikiki and had a good restaurant downstairs
I would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the pool area!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Wayfinder. Beautiful pool with an on-site restaurant, pool and pool bar. The room itself was beautiful. Can’t believe what we got for the price. Definitely would recommend & we will be back!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Clean and nice place to stay. As it says in the description of the place they have valet parking but we arrived by 8:30PM and it was full. We found other parking about 2 blocks away for $50 a day at Lilia Guest Parking garage but I got the last spot. They have other recommendations at the front desk for parking that range from 2 to 6 blocks away with a range of $30 to $60 a day. The hamburger and fries at the hotel restaurant was amazing. We walked 10 min to Liliha Bakery and had breakfast and it was great too.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice hotel
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super place with stylish decor - super nice reception lady who even lent me her umbrella when I still had to park the car in case of a rain. 10/10!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,nice staff and food was also good! one of your male staff members at the pool one of the days was abit rude when collecting towels for the pool loungers. but apart from that very enjoyable stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. Great swimming pool and amenities. I especially loved the location, not too noisy and close to everything."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean downtown hotel. Coffee maker would be nice
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Wayfinder! The hotel is as described and in a great location just a short walk away from the main streets, beaches, and restaurants. Pros: the two free drink tokens at check in, the conveniently located restaurant and coffee shop in the lobby, location, pool, and comfy bed. Cons: the loud AC that randomly makes noise, the sand in my sheets/floor (we didn’t go to beach), and the slippery shower (we both almost fell a couple times). Other than these small things, we did enjoy our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, modern room with great facilities in the hotel. Very welcoming and in a good location. Parking was full when we got there so had to park at a different hotel."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wayfinder had a great location at a very reasonable price. You need to pay additional for parking, but still it was very reasonable for a clean room to stay, access to a pool and nearby beach, and walkable to much more if you wanted to shop or sight see. Highly recommend and would visit again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful place with great staff! Very close to the beach!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good if you are trying to spend time at the hotel/pool/bar due to resort fees, but if you are just needing a place to stay and aren’t spending time at the pool or gym the resort fees feel like a waste"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable hotel. Super helpful valet and front desk. Great location. Would stay again.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was very good, close to the beach and the river for walking. The hotel has a good gym and kindly offered a welcome drink. There were some inconveniences such as the parking that was full and we weren’t advised that would depend on availability, some woman at the reception weren’t so kind and food was left in our fridge even after cleaning.
But the majority of the staff is kind."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It was great, except for the wifi not working"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Wayfinder Waikiki. The location is excellent and only 10 mins walking from the beach. The room was very spacious and clean. The pool area is super nice and they also have a restaurant and a little cafe down at the lounge. Would recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles was the man
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Friendly helpful staff. Convenient location
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Only thing I'd recommend is asking for a higher floor if you'd like a better view from your balcony. Staff and amenities were wonderful! Two free welcome drinks, 24/7 gym access, free waters etc. Solid deal."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute hotel, friendly staff, but the room was a little bit more minimal than expected and there was construction that wasn't communicated before hand. Note, there was some loud ac noise that almost sounded like someone using an electric drill in on our door or in our room. Woke us up several times throughout the night."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The staff was so nice and friendly. No problems with them. However, when you look at the hidden fees for amenities and parking (had to valet because there wasn’t any parking near by - I drove around for 15 minutes looking for a spot) you could stay at one of the nicer beach front locations that includes parking. The shower head was calcified and the shower curtain did not appear clean due to staining and tears. The room had a very odd smell, I could not place the chemical. The restaurants were good. I did not have anything I did not like!!! Again, staff was great but pricing is not accurate to what you get when you see what your friends get right up the street for the same price after additional fees were added."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hotel. My wife and I loved it all. From the room to the pool to the whole area , all was great. We are not picky people at all but we will say something if it’s wrong. And nothing was disappointing. Everything was walking distance and staff was always so nice and happy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely come back! Great location!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The decor is cute and trendy, and the bed was very comfortable. The pool area is nice, and the hotel's location within walking distance to the beach is a definite plus. While there were minor cleanliness issues in the bathroom and with the sheets, overall, it's a fantastic budget option. I'd give it 4 stars."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When searching for accommodation in Waikiki, we narrowed our options down to a couple of locations. Originally, Wayfinder was one of these locations which we then found cheaper on Airbnb. We arrived to the hotel at 9am and unfortunately our check-in was not until 3pm however we were able to leave our bags at reception and spend the day around the pool until we could check-in. We were not disappointed with the place and thought that we lucked out getting such a great place for a very reasonable price. Our flight coming home was cancelled and we had to stay an extra night at a different hotel which the airline put us in. Out of curiosity, we compared pricing of this hotel to Wayfinder and noted that the price was very similar however the other hotel was far inferior, so we are really happy with our choice and would recommend the Wayfinder to anyone travelling to Waikiki."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super fun vibe! Lovely pool area. Great location, walking distance to beach, mall and restaurants. Only thing missing is a coffee pot in the room."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute and comfortable room, the pool area is nice, it is good to stay at least 2 nights to enjoy everything.
The only thing we didn’t like was the parking. They just offer valet parking for an extra 45$. So if you forget something at the car or you need to go out quickly, you need to wait for someone to bring your car and depends of the hours it’s takes time waiting there. But the people are super nice (except one old guy that looks always angry haha) but must of the guys at the valet parking were nice with us.
We would definitely repeat our stay at this hotel. Despite the parking, the hotel is very well located and with excellent services."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at the Wayfinder Waikīkī! My room was very clean, and the view outside was beautiful. I loved that they had different events each day, and the drink tickets were a great plus too :)"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. limoted street parking. Charges a resort fee.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend. It’s like a little oasis within the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Very stylized and convenient. Espresso bar on site. Bar is legit. So is the pool and Jacuzzi area. I just hope they keep prices reasonable.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Waikiki Beach within 5 min. walking distance. Many restaurants and cafes within walking distance. Beautiful indoor area around the pool. Great food in the Redfish.
Accommodation is more of a hotel than a single apartment!
Resort fees of ~ $35/ night are added to the AirBNB price. Price is still perfectly fine then, but here it would be good to include that directly in the AirBNB price for more transparency and fairness."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value in Waikiki!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mother and I loved our stay here! Amazing food, staff, coffee bar. Highly recommend if you want a relaxing stay and not the hustle and bustle of a huge resort."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lake by the side was nice, nearby abc shop and nice grocery store, made it convenient. Walkable to where the actions are, beach, shopping, restaurants…etc.
Reception had a great atmosphere.
Staff were polite and friendly.
Though the lock to big glass door leading to the balcony was broken and didn’t lock properly.
Note, no laundry service on site and the nearby was out of service due to renovation."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very lovely little hotel. We got upgraded to a better view. A nice little room in a decent location. Good view of the Ala Wai, very close to Waikiki proper. Walking distance to basically everything on Waikiki. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend if you are ok with a hotel stay!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely hotel, the staff were great and the location is excellent!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with walkable access to restaurants, shops, and beach. Room was clean. View was ok for the price paid. Lobby and pool areas were very pleasant. Only negative was poor air conditioning in the room. Would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, just a 10 min walk to Waikiki beach. Pool and hot tub was definitely a bonus!
Bed was comfy and the room was nice.
Only cons: they didn’t really do a great job cleaning the floors and bathroom. They left a bundle of hair from the previous guests in our bathroom. Additionally the AC unit sporadically makes a loud noise which can disrupt sleep."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Conveniently located and easy option for a one night stay after a late flight. Most affordable I could find. Unfortunately there was a very loud vent that would intermittently blast air throughout the night, about every 2 hours. I couldn’t sleep well at all, waking up every time the vent went off. It might have been a one-off issue and the front desk said they would send maintenance to check it out, but we were only there for 1 night."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wayfinder was a good place to stay for 2 nights. The price was fair and the location was excellent and super walkable. Our checkin host was pleasant. The drinks at the pool bar were tasty. The room was cute and charming and matched the photos. The AC unit, beds and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom amenities smell divine!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute boutique hotel. Friendly, flexible, and accommodating."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved the retro vibe and the amenities. Awesome restaurant and pool area. Great location! Will definitely be back asap!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t get fooled by the picture - there is no “breathtaking” views. They may even keep the worst room for this airbnb booking I’m not sure, but I got a low floor (lots of noise from street) and right in front of the elevator. Asked to switch room but “there is not other available rooms”.
The hotel is ok, but if I ever decide to stay at wayfinder I will probably book through the hotel, but not here from someone managing the list from Florida and keep asking me to talk to Airbnb support when I reached for solution."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Great location for walks to the beach, along the canal, restaurants and shopping! The room was clean, bed was comfortable with clean, crisp linens. Welcome gift of water and other goodies appreciated!
The hot tub and pool area is beautiful…a little oasis in the big city! Was given 2 tokens on arrival for free drinks at the poolside bar. Beer on tap selection was small and the non-alcoholic selection was great!
Corner room on the 12th floor had an l-shaped balcony that was not very wide but the views were beautiful!
The AC fan ran constantly so not very quiet but didn’t take away from our overall experience!
Had coffee and a muffin from the on-sight coffee shop…delicious!! Breakfast at the restaurant was very good!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved Wayfinder Waikiki!
PROS:
-Amazing location! Walking distance from everything you could need
-Your room was cleaned daily!
-Nice pool location and food/drinks (includes 1 free drink!)
-Super friendly staff
CONS:
-Parking was veryyy limited so we had to park at a hotel down the street for $55 a night
-There’s a $45 nightly “resort fee” that added a large expense to the stay
-There was a REALLY loud (A/C?) unit that would turn on periodically throughout the night and wake us up
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider it again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible time during our honeymoon at Wayfinder. The convenience of being close to everything in Waikiki and being able to walk everywhere made our stay even more enjoyable. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the hospitality and the amenities offered at Wayfinder. It truly made our honeymoon experience unforgettable. Thank you for providing such a wonderful place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great location. walkable distance to downtown Waikiki.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really had a pleasant stay here. I stayed at the monarch Waikiki before checking in here and let me tell you the wayfinder was night and day better. Friendly staff, very clean and comfortable"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay here! I booked through airbnb bc I thought it was cheaper but didn’t realize the resort fees weren’t included, I paid separately at the hotel ($35 I think?). I met up with friends later in my trip and stayed at another popular hotel nearby on Waikiki beach but I MUCH preferred my stay at the Wayfinder. Walkable to the beach but removed enough from the noise of the main strip. Clean, good amenities, friendly staff. The restaurant in the hotel was good too. Really no complaints and it was a good bang for my buck."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations! There is a 24hr gym that is clean and well-kept. The bar, restaurant, and coffee shop give great vibes + selection. Our room was clean and beautiful. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Centrally located. Can walk to many places. Friendly staff and service. Enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and truly considered prolonging our trip to hang out here!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great place in Waikiki. Only a 7 minute walk to Waikiki beach. So many great shops and restaurants within a reasonable walking distance. Such a cute boutique hotel. The thought of valet only parking was kinda something I was dreading to have to deal with going into this trip but upon arrival to valet. We were quickly greeted, helped with bags and got us in the right direction. Each time leaving and coming back to the hotel, we were always quickly greeted and helped in/out. And gave us a sense of security that our car was parked somewhere safe each night. Would definitely recommend this awesome find!!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The staff are very friendly and responsive. The hotel is on the walking distance to Waikiki Beach. The swimming pool is excellent. They even provide sunscreen and lotion. The reason I take one star off because the room we stayed was not quite clean. The drain in the bath tub was still blocked after I pulled a big lock of hair from it. So, It turned that I took a shower in dirty water up to my ankles. We reported to the front desk. A staff showed up very quickly. He delt with the problem over 40 minutes. But the drain was still blocked in some degree. Except for this issue, I would say it was a pleasant stay at Wayfinder."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at the Wayfinder for a work trip. There were fun perks like free museum entry and beach chairs that I wasn't aware of when I booked, so that was a fun surprise. The location was very walkable and out of the most congested parts of Waikiki. I would definitely stay here again. I loved the ways the hotel works to eliminate waste! There are refillable high-quality soaps, conditioners, and lotions in the bathrooms, refillable water stations, aluminum water bottles, and compostable cups and cutlery at the cafe. Loved the welcome drinks as well!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful room, great location."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As a first time visitor to Hawaii I was not expecting to have such a great spot. The area was quiet for the most part and the view to the canal was beautiful. The pool was great to lounge around and the pina colada was my favorite drink. I would definitely come back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent and beautiful stay! I recommend 100%. 5 stars!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hotel was clean and cozy, exactly as advertised. Would stay again with a great location and nice valet service!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, nice view, spacious hotel room. Not really an Airbnb. No coffee machine."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was incredible. Great property, great communication, easy check in & out. Truly an excellent experience & service. I will be staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, cute place, lots of places to do and eat! Definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hotel - good location, beautiful pool, and friendly staff!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, pool, gym, and staff. Would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,can't wait to come back!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice hotel in great location. Everything is easy to reach, beach, restaurants, supermarket and bus stations. The pool is beautiful. For quick breakfast there is a small cafe, for extensive breakfast or dinner a nice restaurant. We liked it all very much - we will be happy to recommend the hotel."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always Awesome
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It worked.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great convenient stay location and friendly staff
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very beautiful renovated brutalist building. Open floor lobby with restaurant and coffee shop. Only thing is their elevator is bit unresponsive, closes doors way too slow"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This was a very chic boutique hotel. Easily walkable to Waikiki Beach.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful hotel. True Hawaii vibes here. Our balcony view was amazing! Hotel room was so aesthetically pleasing. The pool was a true oasis. Location is great! Thank you for hosting us! We will be back soon!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've been to Waikiki about 10 times so I know what people want to know. It's clean and safe, very cute hotel. There is a bar and restaurant down stairs, Plus a coffee shop.
It's a 34 minute drive from the airport if there isn't traffic. The Uber was around 54.
So it's a 7 minute walk from dukes, so 7 minutes from the beach and umbrellas (they're in the same area). 4 minute walk from abc store.

I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location and enjoyed the room. everything was clean and loved the walkable location.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really fun and updated place in a great location
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hotel. I will be coming backZ
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay here but there were also a few things that I wish we would’ve known ahead of time. Firstly, our room was nothing like the photos. It was tiny, didn’t have a table & chairs or a closet, the TV wasn’t even in front of the bed, and was located in a hallway next to the maintenance closet so it was very noisy. Luckily we were able to switch rooms on the second night. Additionally, when we checked in we were told we would not be charged any additional fees since we booked on Airbnb. They only took my card for “incidentals”. However upon coming home, I found I was charged 3 nights of the resort fee. We have tried to call over 15x and emailed and haven’t heard back. Other than these two issues, Wayfinder was a nice and affordable stay. The decorations are cute, but the overall building is definitely old (loud noises from outside, very thin walls). The location is perfect if you don’t have a car though!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wayfinder is a fantastic hotel in a nice location removed from the craziness on Kalakaua Ave. The room was very nice and the pool area was a great spot to relax and hangout. Great to have a nice cafe and restaurant on site as well. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend Wayfinder, especially for the price! If you have a rental car the valet is a must, parking is impossible in Waikiki otherwise"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time in Hawaii, felt right at home at the Wayfinder. I would definitely come back here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay here! Definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was responsive after some prodding regarding being charged a second time for the room at check-in. The hotel was super cute with very friendly staff. You can check out beach chairs, towels and boogy boards. We figured that out our last day. Be advised if you are planning to park a car valet closest to at 10 PM and different arrangements will need to be made for parking if you are getting in late at night."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location in tourist Waikiki. Price level is high, acceptable for Waikiki."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was great! The amenities were perfect and it was only a 5-8 minute walk from the main strip! Not to mention the hotel is super cute. Me and my boyfriend only stayed for one night, but I wish we stayed longer! Will be booking again in the future! Mahalo 🌺"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The view was okay but everything else was good
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a Honolulu visit.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wayfinder was conveniently located, literally seconds from the main strip, but also tucked away enough to have peace and quietly enjoy the gorgeous Mountain views and comfortable atmosphere. All of the staff were extremely approachable and accommodating, no request went unheard and unaddressed to their BEST ability. The restaurant and bar downstairs were 10/10, bartenders were NOT stingy w the alcohol lol and the pool and hot tub that’s open late were beautiful, clean and relaxing. They were super accommodating for the proposal💍 I had planned with room decorators! We had a blast and will surely be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at Wayfinder Waikiki! The room was adorable and comfortable. The pool was relaxing. We loved the morning exercise class with Yvonne and free drinks by the pool.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, centrally located place to stay. Very friendly staff, great in-house restaurant. Unfortunately very noisy, bad windows. Would still come back"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The value was fair but the pictures of the room didn’t match the room
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were clean and we had a balcony. The pool and welcome drink is a plus. Location is great! Many restaurants and the beach are walkable. It was quite expensive but that’s Waikiki. The tourist tax was added after the payment. So keep in mind that you have to pay an additional fee of 35 dollars per day!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing staff. Great hotel. The pool is the best! You can walk to where ever you need in Waikiki. My only complaint is this hotel is loud, as in you can hear everything. Stayed here multiple times and that’s the only outstanding thing. Will stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wayfinder is close to everything you would like to see in Waikiki but is in a quieter stretch with a great view of the Ala Wai canal. The staff is helpful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing boutique hotel right in the middle of everything. I can't recommend this hotel enough. Definitely going back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Waikiki! You’re walking distance from literally everything ! It’s only a 20 minute drive from HNL. So many restaurants / shops nearby . The place is cute and comfy . Will definitely be staying here again !

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy peasy! Close to everything and everyone was friendly and accommodating.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is cute, rooms are clean but the sound of the streets feels like they’re happening in your room, with closed windows even. Also parking is $45 valet only, street parking is almost impossible. But the stuff and the hotel itself is great."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in and out. Great pool, bar, and restaurant areas. Amazing hot shower."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!! Wish I could have been there longer will definitely be returning! A great find in Waikiki
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hotel room looks exactly like the photos and is in a great location (very walkable around Waikiki)!! Will definitely stay at the Wayfinder again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place conveniently located on the quieter side of Waikiki! Loved the room, pool, restaurants, cafe and staff! Would rerun"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks for the stay. Reception is very friendly, the restaurant and bar looks great, and the pool is relaxing. I will definitely be back next time I’m in Hawaii."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice and looked as good as the pictures however I didn’t realize when I booked that I would be charged a extra 35 per night for resort fee and 45 per night for valet parking fee on top of the almost 700 I already paid taking me well over 1000. However I did enjoy the view the two free drinks and 15% off the menu at the dinner. Everyone was friendly however I did have to request for room service so I could get towels and trash service every day. The room included a refrigerator and lotion soap shampoo and conditioner which was nice
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room was rather dated, but it was clean and neat. The traffic noise at night was annoying!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful boutique-hotel with nice design and large rooms! Pool is nice and we had a wonderful dinner in the patio.
We will for sure recommend and rebook here!
Thank you 😊"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying at Wayfinder! Most relaxing accommodations we had all week. The pool and gym are amazing, Redfish restaurant inside the hotel was delicious and they gave us drink tokens for the pool bar and a discount at the restaurant for being guests."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, customer-centric boutique hotel. Very friendly staff; each member has their horoscope sign on their name tags! How cute."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! We stayed at Wayfinder two times this year and would recommend it to others!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, 5 minutes walk to Waikiki beach. Nice pool with hot tub & jacuzzi."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved the overall vibe of this cozy, breezy, brightly colored hotel. Amenities are fantastic and well located. Downsides include noise from the main street by the canal and the valet parking is very expensive. Besides that we had a wonderful stay and I'd recommend this place."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a cool, hip space with lots of amenities, but parking can be improved. It may be better to check in at an earlier time, whereas we flew in at 8:30 PM and could neither do valet or street parking at that time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean. Super great team of staff!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love the decor of the room and the hotel in general. The free drink tokens for the pool bar were a plus too! The area is super walkable and about 3 blocks from the beach. The only downside was that traffic is a little loud.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Hotel has recently been redone. It was a bit noisier than expected though.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although this place is newly renovated, in ways it still felt old. There’s an additional fee when you get there. If I knew that I think I could have booked a better hotel for cheaper. The place is okay. The people are nice and helpful. But given it’s not on the beach, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great deal for a beautiful room
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location and the price was a great value we felt.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location and being able to walk just 3 short blocks to Waikiki Beach, restaurants, and shops! Easy access to highways to get to sights and activities further out!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cannot recommend Wayfinder enough, it is my new favourite hotel! Absolutely beautiful, both the rooms and the lobby/restaurant/pool area. Spotlessly clean and in an amazing location with a great view of the canal. Beautifully styled and only refurbished recently. We didn’t want to leave! Every little detail is so lovely, fresh and vibrant. Spacious room, bathroom, and balcony too. We found the service to be amazing too. Especially by the pool, bar and restaurant. Will definitely be booking next time I visit Waikiki!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is perfect. I recommand to everyone.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute vibey hotel with a great location. Staff was super nice and communicative. The room was clean and the bed was soooo comfy. Loved our stay and highly recommend.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"2 large porches with views of the canal, hip decor pictures matched the room to a T! The location can’t be beat, especially for the price AND amenities: both the coffee shop and restaurant are excellent - friendly staff, good hours, delicious food and open air ambience. The cumulative property experience is 10/10…
It’s a small pool area, so there was never enough seating (common issue anywhere during Spring Break to be fair 😉) and it took a day or two for my key card to actually open the door for the gym consistently (the gym! also great and more thoroughly appointed than expected) or turn on the lights in my room. Once I found the right front desk person, they were helpful and resolved the issue while letting me finish my workout.
All in all, this is a fantastic option for “compact”, walkable, fun Waikiki experience. I will absolutely be back!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, close to everything and great staff, though the street noise was hard to sleep with, otherwise no complaints!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nicely decorated! It has a great location, you can quickly reach the beach and shops!
The Poke Bowl at the house's restaurant was delicious and there was a great welcome with welcome drink."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,close to famous Waikiki beach. nice!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The hotel is lovely and the room was very clean and very stylish. The location is excellent.
I was however a little disappointed with the fact that the front desk hosts were a little short and not always very helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The wayfinder was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend sitting at the bar and talking to Johnny, he is top notch!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute hotel!! The rooms are decorated so well with nice views, and the pool/hot tub was great. There’s two restaurants, a coffee shop, and a pool bar onsite and I really enjoyed all of them, particularly the pool bar which had very affordable drinks and snacks during happy hour. Nice and walkable distance to Waikiki, i went for a nice run down there."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute remodeled old hotel. My only complaint was that there was a very loud sound coming from there vents at night that kept us up.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just like the pictures! Gorgeous space very near all the shops
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I had an AMAZING time. It was so much fun at the Wayfinder, I hope we can stay longer in the future! We would love to come back :)"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great. Walkable to Waikiki beach and restaurants. It has a restaurant as well which we went twice, great food. It has water dispenser in the lobby and you can leave your luggage with them if your flight is in the evening. The room is decent, nothing else to ask for (the bathroom has soap, shampoo, conditioner and body cream). By 5-6 am you can hear noises from outside but we start our day early so it didn’t bother us. I would book here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great for the price. Pretty clean & pool was a plus. Staff was very accommodating.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and beautiful decor. The unit is actually inside a hotel that has a pool, a restaurant, and a bar. The location is very close to a bus stop that has frequent buses to go to the airport. It only costs $3 pp. It is also close to a supermarket. Definitely would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay in Waikiki!!

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall good place to stay in terms of location and value. Only complaint was it was extremely noisy. We were woken up by sirens multiple times and constantly heard hallway noise.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful and calm place to be. Beautiful rooms, friendly housekeepers and staff, beautiful amenities and super reasonably priced. I could walk anywhere, 7min to Waikiki Beach and 5-10min to any nearby restaurant or bar on foot. Perfect place to stay, I absolutely will be returning!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this place. Will definitely stay again 🤩
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wayfinder Hotel is a large friendly place with a lovely pool and several bars and a restaurant. It is very close to Waikiki Beach and many shops and restaurants.
Our room had a lovely balcony overlooking a pretty canal and the mountains were visible in the background.
The restaurant and pool were open very early till late.
I would definitely recommend this hotel."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay especially if it’s your first time in Honolulu ! Super walkable to everything and the staff is friendly !
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Super walkable to Waikiki beach and shops, and lovely room with friendly staff."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When booking, we saw lots of good reviews, and some extreme ones that I had a hard time believing. We really enjoyed our time over the 6 days we stayed. The room is cute (small but the bed is nice and big), the hotels food is amazing, the atmosphere is very lively and fun, and every one of the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed being here :)
A couple things worth noting that do confirm things others have said: this room is right next to the elevator, the atmosphere inside the hotel varies from quite loud to low grade noise that is tolerable, the location is on the outskirts of the city area and there are sirens daily (I'm pretty noise sensitive so this took a couple days to acclimate to), the AC works great but at times does make an extremely loud sound so bring ear plugs, and the toilet tends to making that running sound constantly if you don't fix that.
Overall would 100% suggest to anyone to stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We slept so well .. the ability to keep the slider open and sit out on the patio was awesome
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10! Loveeeed the staff 🫶🏽
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,It was a beautiful place! Would book again there! Made our stay better! Good staff and very helpful!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wayfinder Waikiki is a gorgeous, trendy hotel. We enjoyed our stay . Just make sure you're OK with city noise, or have a way of drowning it out to sleep!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! And cool spot.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lee and Gabrielle were wonderful hosts! It was a pleasure talking to Lee about local recommendations and the location is pristine! They have wonderful rules and guidelines to conserve a green environment, which we practice as well, such as composting and recycling. There are clear guidelines specified on paper after arrival so it is important to read those too and not just the ones on the AirBnb description."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. We would definitely recommend the apartment!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, and for the reasonable price this was wayyy worth the money. Couldn’t imagine staying in the city when there are places like this. Walkable to beach, and slightly further but walkable to restaurants and stores as well! Would 10/10 recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Gabriele’s Kailua studio very much! The neighborhood is very peaceful and only an 8 min walk to a stunning beach. Easy to drive to local restaurants and markets, as well as everywhere we wanted to visit. Appreciated her responsiveness and ability to accommodate our travel schedule. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I felt at home from the beginning. the place is quiet, at the end of a road, I would say it is a bungalow settlement. The beach is only a 5-10 minute walk away. the beach is a dream. Wonderfully clear water and you can take a long walk there right on the water. Parking available. Gabriele was always easily accessible, also gave me some tips for the area. The room was functional but lovingly furnished. Parking is right in front. Sun loungers, snorkeling equipment, umbrella and beach mats are provided. I was completely satisfied! 😊"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The apartment was excellent, very cozy, and clean. We had a great rest in a quiet and peaceful place, despite nearby construction (which the host warned us about in advance), but no one worked early in the morning, so we could sleep in. The location was perfect for us, a very quiet and tranquil place, with a perfectly clean and beautiful beach just a 10-minute walk away. The most beautiful spots on the island were not far from us if we took a car. If we come to Oahu next time, we will definitely choose this host because everything went better than imaginable. Thank you!)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a perfect stay at Dolphin Suite! There was everything you needed, even beach mats. The suite was very clean and the bed was comfy. Check-in and out went smoothly and you have your privacy.
Very many attractions, activities and hikes are close by and a beautiful beach within walking distance. We would definitely come back!
Thanks for the great time!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriele's place was definitely more than we could have asked for. Easy check-in and check-out. Perfect location. We loved waking up to birds chirping and not sirens wailing. So many close restaurants and stores and a short distance to the beach. Having convenient parking was amazing. We felt right at home, and Gabriele is an amazing host. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks again for our favorite Oahu stay yet."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed 8 nights here and loved everything, it couldn't have been any better :)
It was perfect, thank you so much!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Gabrielle is a wonderful host and very nice. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! Loved how close she is to Kailua beach and very close to shopping centers, within walking distance. This is a such a great location!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is amazing! Gabriele was a great host. She was very communicative, helpful, checked in with our needs, and is fun to talk to. The location is very walkable to the beach and downtown Kailua. The unit has a great kitchenette for preparing meals, powerful AC, beach toys/accessories, and is very private. The area is surrounded with beautiful native plants and flowers. We stayed for a month and would 10/10 recommend to a friend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Winderful stay no issues easy to get around
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such a wonderful stay! Gabriele is so nice, helpful, responsive and very understanding. The listing was exactly as advertised. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the appliances we needed to cook meals at home when we needed a break from eating out. The beach was a short 10 min walk away and there were lots of shopping centers nearby. The neighborhood was quiet which was so pleasant. We would absolutely stay here again. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host! Clean and just a 10 minute walk from the beach, stores, and food. We got a discounted price due to there being construction nearby, however we barely heard anything! Can’t complain! Highly recommend"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place and excellent location!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Gabriele’s place. Great location, quiet and close to the beach. Small kitchenette is a huge plus to have a quick breakfast. Will definitely stay there again"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem. This place is lovely if you don't want the hustle and bustle of Honolulu. The construction is not noticable from the room. I am dreaming of going back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gabriele was a great host. Although we did not meet in person, check in and check out was smooth and room was well set up. Great location in a quiet neighborhood walking distance from beach and downtown Kailua. Parking was free and convenient, very close to our room. The noise from temporary construction nearby was not a problem at all, especially if you close the windows. Room was cozy and bathroom was spacious. AC and fan worked great. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here the next time I visit Oahu."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place on excellent location. Everything's good.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was in a great location on a quiet street.Close to restaurants and supermarkets. Within walking distance to a nice local beach. 15 to 20 minutes from downtown Waikiki and the airport.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay its right in Kailua town within walking distance of food and shaved ice & especially the beach 🏖. Owner was very communicative property was clean, and ready for us upon arrival. This was my first Airbnb and such a great experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,studio was clean and spacious and the location is great walking distance to the beach and markets super convenient area will book again when back into town
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! So close to Lani Kai beach and away from the busy part of the island. The host provided excellent food recommendations in the area. Definitely recommend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Already thinking about my next stay! Such a convenient location with everything you could need! Loved everything about my stay here.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a pleasant stay,everything we needed and a great location."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Gabriele's place in Kailua during our trip to Oahu. The place was as described, very cute and clean with local art. I liked that there were basic cooking items (hot plate, pans) so that we could get our breakfast made and our days started early. We also made good use of the provided lounge chairs on the beach. The suite is attached to their home but we didn't hear any bothersome noise the whole time and I am a very light sleeper, I slept well the entire trip. The blackout curtains were a plus for me, I have them at home too! The AC has the whole room cooled down within minutes, we didn't keep it running the whole night and it stayed a pleasant temperature. Note that there are some requirements for tidying up (very minimal, taking out the garbage and compost) before you leave, this is something that doesn't bother us at all as we like to keep a clean environment even when on vacation but for some people it could be a downside. Kailua is a great town, easy to drive to the rest of the island and great eats and beaches right in town. We would stay at the suite again and recommend it to any of our friends."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect spot for a weeks vacation or more in Oahu near Kailua Beach . Wonderful town , and a wonderful host. Gabriele was very easy to communicate with and had all the nice little things you might need for the beach in the room ready for us . We would absolutely stay in Gabriele’s studio again !"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really want to give Gabriele a 7- star for everything! She is definitely a super super host! Your money has the best value in her Airbnb.
First, she offered everything you need for being relax in Hawaii! Beach towels, beach chairs, umbrella, and snorkeling equipment etc! She also offer all the cooking utensils. So the house itself has a lot of stuff and it’s more than what you need.
Second, the location is great. Since one parking is offered, you can go around easily. You can barely find free parking Airbnb if you choose to stay in Waikiki area.
Last but not least, Gabriele stayed in Hawaii for most of her life, it’s very meaningful to talk with her about the real life in the islands. We had a wonderful stay and it’s definitely our lucky to find such an amazing place!
Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved staying at this location. Beach, restaurants and shops are super close. I highly recommend this place."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely stay in Kailua. Cabin has everything you need with great location near the beach and shops. Gabriele is a great host, easy communication and very accommodating. Highly recommend!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriele and her family were super kind and accommodating with this last minute booking. In a frenzy, I never got around to reading the guidelines so there was a misunderstanding related to guests but we were able to talk and clear things up. Also note, there are little flies/ants. Honestly think it’s just the trade off of being on a tropical island. It truly didn’t bother me because the place is clean otherwise. I will definitely consider staying here again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay and would happily stay here again.Gabriele is caring and friendly. Can’t beat free parking. Grocery stores and restaurants are within walking distance. This place is a real gem, don’t miss out!!!"

Small but very efficient and perfect for those who are like us who just need a clean and comfortable place to come back to after a long adventurous day. Gabriele is an amazing host. She was very accommodating with our check in time and when we needed some miscellaneous items. Absolutely would recommend anyone to stay here, we will 100% rent again!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was clean and comfortable.
It was compact, but it was large enough for both couples.
I don't think there's anything else I can stay with parking in the Kailua area.
We were walking distance to the Kalapai Market and Kailua Beach, and jogged to the Lanicai Pil box!
Great value for money.
I want to use it again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely place - with walking distance to eateries and the beach. There were good facilities with both beach chairs, cooler bag and beach towels."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect for two ppl. Location was great, away from main city but also had a lot of stores nearby incase you forget to bring anything. Plenty of beautiful beaches you can walk or bike to as well as plenty of places to eat near by that won’t break the bank if you’re budgeting. Communication was great, they were always available to answer me whenever I had a question. I would recommend and stay again as well!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriele's place is where you want to be if you plan on staying on the windward side of the island. We had a great time there, and would recommend this airbnb to anyone!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay! 10 minute walk to the beach - 15/20 minute walk to a variety of different shops, restaurants and breweries. Gabriele was a fenomenal host - easy check-in, provided a map and local suggestions for activities, various cooking supplies, as well as beach going amenities."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small but nice. Has everything you need for a few days away. Clean and huge shower. Refrigerator, sink and sink, everything is available.
I'd love to come back."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gabriele & Lee were wonderful hosts. They left us to our privacy but were always there if we needed anything. You feel so at home and welcome! Kailua beach is within walking distance, beautiful neighborhood with good food and shopping nearby. Highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabrielle's place was just right for what we required on Oahu. Quiet, clean, comfy and a good location.
We were glad to have a car to get us out from the airport and around town.
Kailua is a good spot to step off to the north shore or Waikiki for a day.
The town of Kailua has just what you require for a nice Hawaii vacation. Beautiful beach just down the road, supermarket, shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed the Kona Brewing co. for meals a couple of times.
Gabrielle and Lee were so helpful when we needed. They even leant us beach chairs and snorkelling equipment.
We highly recommend and would return."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"For our trip to Oahu, we deliberately chose the East side of the island. Therefore, Gabriele's accommodation is ideally located for us. Many restaurants for dinner as well as Kailua Beach Park are within walking distance. The neighborhood is friendly and very quiet. The place was optimal for our trip (5 nights). Thank you for allowing us to be a guest!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place beyond expectation. 5 stars! Walking distance to the beach. Will recommend this place.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A clean space with an amazing shower. I loved the feel of the air dried sheets and towels. Gabrielle has coffee for you with a French press or a coffeemaker. There are some nice places in town to eat including the Whole Foods. The space was quiet and clean.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was very smooth.
The room is clean and there are enough towels.
Beach chairs are very useful at the beach.
I want to stay again.
Thank you very much,Gabrielle!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Dolphin Suite exceeded all of my expectations. I'm not even sure where to begin because I'm so happy with my experience. The place was VERY clean. After reading the other reviews we fully anticipated encountering some bugs, ants, or geckos in the room - but we didn't see one. The location is perfect! The neighborhood has an awesome vibe and it is in walking distance (a VERY short walk) from the beach and amazing food/coffee options. Gabriele provides you with beach towels, coolers, reusable bags, and basically whatever else you may need. She (and her husband) are very accommodating and friendly. They will be happy to give you great advice on things to eat and do. You get what you pay for, and more, at Gabriele's. I HIGHLY recommend staying here and cannot think of one negative thing about our experience. We will definitely stay here next time we visit. Thank you Gabriele!"
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A comfortable space with friendly helpful hosts.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean room close to beach and coffee shops!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here! Gabriele was extremely nice and gave us great restaurant recommendations. Definitely recommend.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying at the dolphin suite. It had everything we needed. The suite was quite cool and we did not need to use the AC at all. Gabriele always replied promptly and was very accommodating. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Gabriele‘s place was wonderfull. We were a little bit unlucky with the weather, otherwise everything was perfect. Gabriele was lovely and helped us out with some spices and olive oil for the kitchen. She also gave us great tips for visiting the island. The small apartment is located in a quite neighbourhood and only a few minutes away from the beach. We can highly recommend this place."
2019-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute beach studio within walking distance of Kailua Beach and several restaurants, also close driving distance to Lanikai Beach and Pillbox hike, which we enjoyed. There are also beach towels and beach chairs to borrow. Check-in/check-out was smooth, and Gabriele was very responsive. Unfortunately we found it hard to relax and enjoy being inside the unit itself. Being near the beach and old, the entire unit has a musty odor. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are ants and geckos/salamanders. We went in February and it gets quite chilly at night, but there are no blankets (only sheets) on the bed -- we found a quilt in the cupboard which didn't help much so we slept in our down jackets as sleeping bags. Lastly, as advertised, this is a very environmentally conscious home, and there are many reminders posted throughout the unit to remind you to keep Hawaii clean and beautiful!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was alright. I recommend.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Gabriele’s place is absolutely perfect! It’s clean, in a great location, and Gabriele was extremely accommodating and helpful when I needed it. I would stay here again and Indefinitely recommend it for others!"

2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable suite with adequate partial kitchen. Parking on site, walkable to the beach , also very close to town center. Very pleasant hosts."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the place is ""not much"" just a clean place to live and amenities that any travelers like us can think of, it's there... JUST LIKE HOME! and trust me, we are critical even when it comes to our own home and this place, again, it's just like home... we couldn't have asked for more...
and if you ask me about the host, Gabriele is also ""not much"" but she is also ""not less"" just right... and to me that is more difficult to find... mind you, this place was a second part to our visit in Oahu and the first part we were staying in Ali'i Hilton. and compared to Hilton, this is way better... as we are not the type that like over the top hospitality, what we asked for is only fair and genuinity... and this place and the host has given us both that! we are grateful ..."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as expected from the listing. Great location away from Waikiki and convenient to everything on the quieter side of the island.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nicely appointed studio in a great location just minutes from one of Oahu's best beaches and everything Kailua has to offer. We especially like the emphasis on living clean and green. We've been to Hawaii many times and would highly recommend Gabriele and Lee's place for a comfortable stay. Thank you!
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to the beach! The studio is clean and the kitchen has everything you need. Gabriele communicates quickly. Would stay there again."
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location plus free parking which is a must for a rental car. Had everything we needed and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. As with many private homes in Hawaii, windows are left open and open-air is encouraged. While this is great for the environment, there was an occasional ant or bug. Nothing major or gross but something to be aware of if you’re more high maintenance. Would still recommend!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved staying here! Much better than staying in Honolulu! Loved all the breakfast joints we tried every morning! Gabriele’s place was perfect for two people, he provided us with everything we needed! We would use his place again!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriele and Lee are amazing hosts! They respond quickly to messages and their hospitality is amazing. The place was clean, comfortable, and airy. All essentials were available for us during our week's stay. Plenty of towels and nice touches like the reusable bags for grocery and a drying rack for us to hang out bathing suits to hang dry out bathing suits. Location is amazing! Centrally located to shops, restaurants, and most importantly: the beach! Would definitely stay here again next time!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gabriele's accommodation is perfect for your stay in Kailua, a beautiful place with magnificent beaches.
Also as a base center to tour the island with a rental car.
It has a very large market nearby where you will find everything"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gabriele's place was perfect for our first trip to hawaii. It comfortably fit the both of us and had enough kitchen accommodations to have some meals in. It's walking distance from anything you could need as far as groceries, restaurants, and the beach go. It also was a quick drive to all our other activities including shark diving, snorkeling, and hiking. She was a very helpful host and provided everything we could need and we loved her neighborhood. They truly embody the Aloha spirit."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location of the exceptional apartment, beach 10min walk, same for grocery stores, shops and close to the bus stop to go towards Honolulu.
Quiet area."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well located and very cozy studio with everything you need. Easy check in and check out!
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Gabriele & Lee place was great! This location is ideal when staying in Ohau and we found it super convenient.
The studio is just a minute away from the beach and right next to a park!
Gabriele has been fantastically nice and understanding with us on all points ( check-in time, the fruits that she shared with us, quick response...).
We can only HIGHLY recommend.
Thank you again Gabriele & Lee."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great amenities, centrally located, and the beach is only a ten minute walk away. The best air b&b my husband and I stayed in yet!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was clean and as described. We really enjoyed our stay and can just recommend this place.
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was absolutely perfect in every way. Staying here was the best choice perfect location. Private yet felt included: Very kind friendly host. Very thoughtful, supplied so many amenities. Definitely felt at home. Will only return to stay here. Thank you for letting us stay in the dolphins suit! Everything was wonderful."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love this place. Would have been nice to stay longer. The walk to the beach or to the shopping area is close. I was greeted with the beautiful aloha energy.
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located. Close to everything. It was perfect for our babymoon!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very cozy place

2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"feels like home, h(away)ii from home"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,An incredibly peaceful place to be. Beautiful location!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a relaxing, peaceful vacation this is the place. Waking up to that view and falling asleep to the sound of waves is exactly what we needed after our wedding. Peter’s place is in such a great location right on the water and near so many great restaurants without all the crowds. We even got to see a turtle in the water right from the porch! It’s still not too far from all the tourists attractions but so nice to be able to stay out of the hustle and bustle of the city where you can just relax and still enjoy the water and beauty that Hawaii has to offer. Would definitely recommend and would come back! Peter was a great host, communicated quickly, gave some great recommendations of places to eat and had a lovely home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mokuleia House on Oahu! It was just as described with beautiful, comfortable furnishings and the perfect location for watching the waves and sunsets. Our host was easy to communicate with and gave detailed and helpful information for our check in and stay. Thank you, Peter for being a great host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures represent the place perfectly. Just an incredible location surrounded by all the features of the North Shore.
My family of four snorkeled off the beach, saw a seal swim by, hiked out to see the albatross’s at the state park, drove to other beaches, and enjoyed the restaurants in Haleiwa. Peter’s place is fantastic for accessing all the above."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved being right next to the ocean in a quiet community and being able to drive to other beach towns. The cottage was larger than the pictures made it look and was very comfortable. High waves were expected and friendly neighbors checked in, we checked in with Pete, and he was responsive and helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location location location! What a fantastic location! Beaches/hiking/shopping all right there!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peter’s place was peaceful and perfect for what we were looking for. Away from the chaos of everything O’ahu has to offer but not far away from it all of you want to go looking for it. The place was clean and great for two people.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place! Right on the ocean and we fell asleep listening to the waves crashing against the sea wall. Well equipped with everything we needed.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location cannot be beat!! A beautiful and peaceful stay on the North shore. The community was quiet and the neighbors friendly. We loved falling asleep and waking up to the sound of waves. We also really enjoyed walking along the beach at low tide. The cottage/bungalow was clean and well furnished. The only thing to keep in mind is that since the cottage is so close to the shore, there is a lot of moisture. I have sensitive allergies /asthma and had to take a Benadryl at night to keep them at bay. It really didn't take away from the trip but I wanted to warn other sensitive folks out there. Thank you Peter for a wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here, I hope for many more to come. This is a treat to live for a few days in a Hawaiian cottage."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Perfect Place with a Perfect Location. We have Never stayed closer to the ocean and to nature, Just living in Paradise"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Peter’s place was wonderful. It was the first stop on our honeymoon and it couldn’t have been better. Peaceful and serene are just a few words to describe Peter’s place. We saw sea turtles swimming out front every day and fell asleep to the ocean waves! We can’t wait to come back!!!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location on the north share away from the crowds. We loved hanging out on the spacious lanai and watching the ocean. Incredible!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Peter’s place truly is Oahu’s Best Kept Secret! We have been going for 3 years and we love it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aloha! Staying at Peters place made our first experience in Hawaii memorable. The view of the ocean was outstanding. Waking up to the beautiful blue of the ocean and sky was invigorating. Falling asleep to the soft sound of the waves was so peaceful and relaxing. The historic town of Haleiwa was so fun. We were just minutes away from all the attractions we wanted to see on the North Shore. Having the Breakfast Buffet at the Turtle Bay resort was such a treat. The food delicious and the view from our table was fabulous. The best experience was spending the majority of one of our days at the Polynesian Cultural Center. So great. All in all one of my favorite vacations. Thanks Peter for your hospitality. Mahalo!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We relaxed & enjoyed our time at the cottage. The photos don’t do it or the views justice. Simple place without fuss is our preferred stay and this had everything we needed ie cookware, utensils, dishware, blender, toaster, microwave, lots of ice trays for ice and a Brita. So grab a Jerry’s Pizza the first night and shop at foodland for groceries. We joined former guests & added to a basic seasoning drawer and a few staples ie sugar.
The tide was high so not much for beachfront right now but there are several beaches nearby within a quick care ride. Mom & pop places and food trucks aren’t too far a drive but best deal for sharing a lunch plate.
Mahalo, Pete, for sharing the cottage with us! It made our first trip to Oahu perfect!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great and comfortable place and a helpful and responsive host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The property was ocean front and very quiet. Perfect if you want a island getaway in countryside.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location by the water. Beautiful scenery. Enjoyed sunrises, sunsets and sea turtles! Lots to see and do nearby."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fabulous escape.... Could look at the ocean from this sport forever
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Peter was a great host. The property did not disappoint. It was the perfect unit for our family of four (two teenage kids). Our daughter’s first experience with the water of Oahu was seeing a sea turtle just over the wall when we arrived! Waking up and having coffee while watching the waves was so calm and relaxing. Everything on the island was accessible from the property. One of our favorite locations was “hidden beach”. I do not hesitate in recommending this property to others.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and Peter’s suggestions guided toward getting the most out of the place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing lodging and location! Beautiful and great beach access! Everything you need is provided with clear instructions and communication.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family especially loved Peter’s paradise! Beautiful sunrise and sunset viewings plus turtle spotting in clear water right in front of Peter’s place. We loved the sceneries and pool! Truly a gem. We will book this place again if we ever visit North Shore Oahu in the future. We truly loved our 5 night stay with this beautiful and relaxing home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Me and my wife spent our honeymoon here. It was absolutely gorgeous and we loved the area. It was quiet and everyone we met was super nice and helpful and had a lot of great suggestions on things to do. We really enjoyed walking in the national park down the road. We would love to come back and stay here again soon!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everythink was realy perfect!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at Peter’s and every single time it delivers! It is stocked with everything you need from grill supplies to water activities items to beach towels, ketchup, cooking oil and tea. I will never get over the natural white noise of the ocean waves right outside the deck. It is such a relaxing space that has it all. Peter was responsive and communicative and helped us locate the nearby private swimming beach (just a few steps to the left of the space) and it was a gem. We’ll have to come back to it next time at our third stay here ;)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay for a week in Oahu! Can’t recommend this enough!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this condo. Great views, tasteful interior, well equipped kitchen and super relaxing atmosphere.
Would love to come back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is as advertised - waterfront. Note there is a seawall in front of the cottage, so it is simultaneously awesome and loud. The beach super-easy to access during low tide, and stunningly gorgeous. Location is quiet and away from the touristy areas. The complex itself is older but well-maintained... some old-Hawaii charm gives the place a retro feel. Inside the cottage, louvered windows don't quite close 100% so the sound of the surf is a constant companion. If you need it to be quiet to sleep, this is not your place - ocean waves are loud! About 15 minutes from shops and restaurants.
Furnishing and equipment is average. The furniture is very low to the ground, so it might be tougher for folks with limited mobility. The mini-kitchen is nice, and the bathroom is retro-quirky. The toilet is smaller model. so keep that in mind if you're of the larger body type.
Overall this is a solid cottage in a beautiful area - a great place to stay for your north shore retreat!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Peter's place is awesome! It's in an amazing location with beautiful views of the ocean! We loved having all of the windows open and listening to the sounds of the crashing waves! We enjoyed the beach to the left of us everyday. It was an easy trek for us, but could be difficult with older ones or very young kids. We loved how vintage and quirky Peter's place is. We made many dinners and breakfasts in the condo, the kitchen is great and has every utensil, pot, pan and cooking gadet you'd need! The beach towels, cold bag and extra beach gear is appreciated and was used all week. Peter's place is quiet and everyone is so friendly that we encountered. We felt comfortable and at home! The colony pool is great, the laundry facilities are great and that outdoor shower is great!!!! We used it all!!! Peter's place is awesome and we would definitely stay here again!!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was AMAZING!!! would happily recommend this place. It had everything we needed and a view to die for. Thank you Peter for allowing us to stay at your property. It was perfect 🌺🌺
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely stunning
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The view is majestic!!
Everything was what we expected. It is a drive to everything so you would need a car to get around, which is what we wanted. The beach near by is weather dependent, larger waves make it almost impossible to get to the sand but when you do it was worth it! The cottage was damp but not smelly, we did not mind it being a little outdated & dark. Very comfortable bed. We loved adding our beach finds to the basket! Fun way to take stuff ""home"" but not off the Island. Overall absolutely amazing and everything we expected!!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect for us, we would definitely recommend it to our friends and family."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loves our week in the North Shore.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The toilet is temperamental. One minute it's fine the next when it is backed up. It was just me staying so I'm not sure what was going on but in the end it worked out fine. I just wanted to give you a heads up that it's going through some type of issue.....
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was an anniversary/birthday celebratory trip. The was a perfect romantic getaway! The laid back, serine atmosphere of Mokuleia Colony instantly put us in vacation mode. I will be frank and admit that having no air conditioning was a challenge by day three. But the nights were cool enough to sleep comfortably."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect place for a relaxing staycation!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location! Best beach time for all! Please take Peter’s advice to walk to your very own private beach. Having our waterproof bag for towels and other necessities was helpful. We also loved how it was so quiet and peaceful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with beautiful views.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Peter's place. The location situated right on the beach was phenomenal. Sunrises and sunsets were amazing and right there to watch from the patio! So relaxing. Would love to return. Peter communicated well and everything we needed was available.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for my wife and I to spend our honeymoon! Peter was easy to work with! Will be back in the future. Thank you
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stay here! From the beautiful view, to the excellent swimming, there is no better place to stay on Oahu!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely adored our stay here! Take Peter's advice and wade around the rocks to the right of the cottage. We had the whole beach to ourselves and had an amazing day! The cottages are very quiet and peaceful which was perfect for us! When we did happen to encounter someone, they were friendly. We would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family. Hopefully we will be able to return one day! Thank you for sharing your paradise with us"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you have the chance to stay here, I would take that chance immediately. This cottage was absolutely perfect and our favorite stay ever! It had all the amenities we needed, comfy king bed, thoughtful touches and the location was absolutely perfect, a nice scenic drive to everything. I will never get over the view and beachfront access! Peter was responsive and we felt safe and at home in this space. I will be returning again and again and am already dreaming of our next visit to Wailua. Mahalo!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this location right on the beach. Definitely made for a relaxing trip!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay in this colony and we loved staying in Peter's Best Kept Secret this time for our 25th anniversary. It really is all about location and if you want the most relaxing spot on Oahu, this is definitely the place. There was a very big winter swell during our visit so we weren't able to make use of the adjacent beach but we just made use of the stunning stretch of Mokuleia Beach Park almost every day. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location of this place absolutely cannot be beat. We got a lot of use out of the outdoor patio area overlooking the ocean. Peter’s communication was excellent and was able to accommodate us checking in a day early on short notice. It’s a quick 15-minute drive into Haleiwa from the cottage. The place was equipped with everything we needed. I would highly recommend booking Peter’s cottage for a relaxing stay on the North Shore.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s more spacious and nicer than the photos, great for family of 4. The bed was a bit too soft for me but wouldn’t effect the value of the rental, they offer pretty much everything you would need for vacation. Excellent location very close to Haleiwa town. We really enjoyed the stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the beach cottage! Truly everything you need is there. This is off the beaten path so expect about a 15 minute drive to any food options. The beach was beautiful but a lot of swell so couldn’t swim as we had babies with us. Peter’s communication was great!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An awesome spot right on the water... literally! Peter has excellent communication and I give it the most telling review comment possible... I WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I just spent a week here for our honey moon. Peter's place was perfect for us and has everything you need! The only thing to note is that there's no direct beach access on the property as the tide comes all the way in to the seawall. We enjoyed sitting on the deck and watching all the crabs! Polo beach has a public access walkway a short drive/15 minute walk away. We would gladly stay here again :)
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a great location on the north shore, gorgeous sunset and literally right on the water. Super cosy and very comfortable.
The place is a bit outdated and older, all sound from the property and people around comes through but the crashing of waves was a really nice sound to fall asleep to. The neighbours were quiet for the most part (it’s a residential community) and respectful when walking by the lanai (you can see into the place).
Make sure to keep the screen doors closed so nothing gets in. (We had some critters get in, luckily no mosquitos though).
Good wifi connection and free parking spot was really great."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is truly a fantastic “secret”. The location cannot be beat anywhere on the North Shore. Siting on the lanai is the most peaceful place as the waves come in, every sunset was photo worthy, and it’s so quiet…not overrun with tourists/crowds. For the location alone, steps away from the ocean, the price is well worth it. Listening to the ocean every night as we went to bed and every morning as we woke up was priceless.
The unit was perfect for us (2 adults and 1 child) and would have been fine with another child. Everything you need is there.
Peter said in the description you might see a sea turtle if you’re lucky; we saw them everyday! Not sure if it was just this time of year, but every evening around 5 pm we sat outside and would see a handful gracefully swimming. Also, we went to the small beach to the west of the community in the mornings to swim before breakfast, as recommended by Peter, and we were almost always the only ones on the whole beach! In the afternoon there were a handful of other people, but still mostly empty.
The North Shore as a whole is a great location and we will definitely stay at this place again! Bonus that it was next to the polo club and stables…my daughter loves horses and the fact that we found Scrabble in the closet!
Mahalo!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The best review I can give is we plan to stay here again the next time we are in Oahu. Just spectacular to be this close to the ocean in a quiet, very cozy and well-maintained bungalow. What a treat!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! We loved it here and it was perfect for the two of us to enjoy and nice vacation to Hawaii! Would recommend this place for sure!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location is excellent right on the water loved smelling the plumeria every morning and comfortable for a family of 4 , also right next to horses ;)
And near everything at the north shore
Has everything you might need while in vacation , beach gear , laundry soap , etc etc etc towels"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A true hidden private paradise! This gem was even more amazing than what the pictures show. Beautiful views and access to the ocean, so peaceful, quiet, relaxing, and private. we had an amazing time. Sleeping and waking up to the sounds of the waves was just what me and my family needed. The site manager Tom was kind, hospitable, and full of aloha. Owner pays close attention to detail, communicative, and great all around. We will definitelybe back. Mahalo nui for a great experience."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is such a great place to stay. It has the perfect vibe. Falling alseep
And waking up to the sound of the waves is probably the best thing ever. The location is perfect. Away from hustle and bustle bit a short drive to anything. The home itself was clean and a perfect set up. It was so perfect that after three days we realized we never turned the tv on. Peter was a perfect host answering any questions we had prior to the trip timely."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place - right on the water with pool access, laundry (bring your own detergent), stove, etc!
Sound carries insanely, but hearing the ocean at night makes it worth it!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Magical and relaxing place! You won’t be disappointed!
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for a family of four! We have two small children (age 4 and 2) and we spent a week at the cottage. The location is unbelievable and you can hear the ocean waves from inside the cottage which adds to the experience. The sunset views are unmatched. The use of the pack n play was helpful for our little one, and there was more space than what I thought there would be. Quick drive into Haleiwa and lots of shopping and good food available. Staying on the North Shore is much more of an ‘Island’ experience, so if that is what you are looking for this is a great choice!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Perfect location and lovely sunsets.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is much better than I expected. The place is really comfortable for 3 people and a fourth would have been fine. There’s a full kitchen, and full size fridge too."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is a wonderful little space in paradise. Everything was as expected from the description and photos. Our family had a nice time here.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a gem of a place. Pete is a great communicator and very helpful. The location is fantastic -- I've lived on Oahu and this is just the right distance from the North Shore crowds without being too far away. The place is clean, tastefully furnished, and a wonderful location. Highly recommended!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and view. Good value.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Peter is a great host and the location is outstanding. We enjoyed our stay very much.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved waking up and going to bed to the sound of the waves. It's a beautiful place. We missed having our coffee in the lanai watching the beautiful water. You will absolutely love this place. Peter is an amazing host.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location - quiet (except for the wonderful sound of waves), access to adjoining beach and terrific star gazing at night. Very restful."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Peter place was amazing!! Falling asleep to the sound of crashing waves every night was so relaxing. You also can’t beat the nightly sunsets and incredible water views from the Lanai ! My husband enjoyed fishing off the sea wall and my two boys loved the pool and beaches! The cottage has everything you need and we thoroughly enjoyed for stay! Highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely bungalow a few feet from the ocean - enjoy falling to sleep with the sound of the waves, and the lovely breeze, and eating breakfast in front of the ocean. It's located in a really interesting community self-described as a ""beach colony"" with a lit path to walk on, around large grassy lawns. Close to all the north shore attractions, including loads of food trucks. The interior is beautifully decorated, it truly felt like staying in someone's vacation home. Has a pool and a tennis court as well."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is incredible. Steps from the water, with beautiful views. The space was comfortable and well appointed, and very clean."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Seriously the best place that we have ever stayed. We will be returning as soon as possible. Peter is an excellent host and we couldn’t be more happy!!!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an incredible time at this place. Right on the beach, the views from the patio were amazing! We could see turtles in the water as we sat on our patio. Home had everything needed. We will be back."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Top
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great out of the way place to relax, if you want to get away from North Shore crowds . Awesome patio for hanging out!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, right on the water. Loved watching the sunset from the patio each night and being able to walk up and down the beach each morning. Showered outside every night as the open shower was beautiful and refreshing. Thank you for the stay."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and comfortable space. Enjoyed sunsets on the patio every evening, and visiting turtles round noon. Great swimming beach a short walk away."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Literally steps to the water! As a long time resident of the north shore who was returning in holiday, this cottage is definitely the best deal around. You won’t find ocean front for this kind of value anywhere else!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is unbeatable. You roll out of bed into the ocean. Each morning we swam before breakfast, and later took a dip before heading to bed. Outdoor shower was a great feature. We were worried that our family of four would feel cramped but we didn’t at all. Great stay."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place right on the ocean...beautiful views, quiet, peaceful location and only ten minutes into Hale’iwa. The house had everything needed for an extended stay...I’d love to return and stay for longer. Very comfortable, very clean, easy place to hang out and enjoy the quiet solitude of the North Shore."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place, great location! Great communication with owners!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay and the suite was perfect. The location is amazing with the beach only steps away. We’ll definitely be booking Charle’s airbnb again when we return to Hawaii.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location and view are amazing - definitely the highlight of the condo. Has an amazing view of the ocean and can see the sunset from the balcony. Located right on the beach and walking distance to tons of restaurants/shops.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place is amazing, beautiful views and lots to do around the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best Location. Walking distance to nearly everything. An amazing place that is packed with all the amenities and even better views . The host was great with responsiveness and also taking the time to explain all the details we needed for our stay. Could not ask for anything more for our small family of 3.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I spent wonderful days in Charles and Tha condo.
The view from the condo was spectacular we couldn't ask for more.
The condo is in downtown Waikiki and you can walk to everything. A plus is the parking.
We highly recommend Charles and Tha's condo.
Thank you for everything
Mahalo"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view and location make this condo outstanding! You won’t find a more beautiful view in Waikīkī. We also enjoyed this location because it’s on the beach yet also next to a quiet park, so it was more peaceful and less crowded than other areas. The bathroom could use some updating, but otherwise we found it very comfortable. Charles was helpful and responsive too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and nice place. Washer and dryer a plus. Free Parking across the street. Lanai had amazing views of the beach and Friday night fireworks!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Charles’s place in Waikiki! The view was absolutely beautiful. The beach right there was so nice! And everything was walkable, which was great. Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our host met us in person which was nice. The condo was spotless and well appointed and stocked with some necessities. The wall to wall view patio doors overlooking DeRussy Park and the beach are spectacular. I loved staying here, first day back home and miss it already. Thank you Charles and Tha."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a total gem. You just exit the building and the beach is right there! There are a multitude of restaurants and shopping centers all within walking distance. This was also close enough to other attractions like snorkeling with the sea turtles, hiking to waterfalls, Kualoa Ranch, etc. The location is fantastic and the place itself was very clean and well organized. We witnessed a double rainbow AND fireworks right from our balcony. My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charles and Tha were nothing short of spectacular, they were very sweet and responsive. The view from their place was fantastic, we enjoyed meals on the expansive lanai watching the ocean and planes go by. It was well equipped and had everything we could need. There was plenty of room for my family of four, we couldn’t have been happier and were very comfortable. Sadly, we only stayed for the first portion of our trip as it was booked. We were so sad to leave!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time being the beach was in walking distance, shopping and restaurants. There was private parking which was a huge bonus. The sunset view on the 8th floor was spectacular. I wouldn’t mind booking it in the future."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in the condo. The location was absolutely perfect. We did think the bathroom could use some updating but otherwise we really enjoyed being able to walk to the shops and restaurants and sitting out on the porch.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was beautiful! Better than picture. The view was amazing. Love the open concept of the unit. Host was very thoughtful and had a bunch of necessities for the beach ready to use in the unit (beach umbrella, chairs, sunblocks, etc.). Would recommend this place to friends and family. If I come back to Oahu, I will try to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles and Tha have a wonderful Airbnb in an excellent location with great views of the water. The place is modern and very comfortable. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful stay in Waikiki!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful sunsets from the lanai, coffee in the morning on the lanai was peaceful listening to the waves and watching the water. The rainbows were every day, looked like a postcard. The parking across the street was perfect and easy to access. If this is your first time in Waikiki then you should stay here. Easy to get to the beach, food, and driving to hikes or other attractions was very easy. We would definitely stay again or recommend it to friends and family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this Airbnb stay was a fantastic choice, providing a home away from home. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delightful and comfortable travel experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a great place in Waikiki!
The view is just breath taking, espacially at sunset. You're next to a park and beach volleyball fields, which we really appreciated.
You will find everything you need in the condo, even chairs for the beach, beach towels, a sun umbrella and stuff to do snorkling. You can't ask for more. The parking space is another must to the condo.
Overall a great experience for all the family and if we go back to Waikiki we would choose the same condo without hesitation.
To note: Charles was always quick to answer to our questions.
Mahalo!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, surroundings, amenities, and atmosphere with the great host Charles! We definitely come back and stay at this condo next time. Thank you so much for hosting us Charles"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Can’t say enough about Charles’s unit, it was everything advertised and then some. I brought my grandchildren with me and they loved the location!! So much shopping and beautiful beaches all within walking distance. I even felt like the area was safe enough for them to venture out by themselves. I promise if you choose this property you will not be disappointed. Thank you Charles for letting us stay in your unit and we sure hope to return some day.
Cindy"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Better than advertised! So much to do within walking distance. We spent so much time on our lanai during day and evenings it was so beautiful! We really enjoyed the Army Museum next door too…a must see since you’re staying right there. Unit was clean and beds were so comfortable. We all commented on how well we slept listening to the waves and feeling the wonderful breeze. Loved it all!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, awesome views, next to walkway path along Ocean, and close to restaurants."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charles is so communicative and was supportive throughout our stay. Truly I feel their place is the BEST stay we have had in Oahu!!
His wife clearly has great taste as does he! Why do I say that? Staying at their place it is clear they wanted it to match the vibe of the beach. Truly it does with the interior layout and everything. Most Airbnbs furniture is dated and you can tell they took pride in their place. Will be staying again and I definitely will be referring more folks as well."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great place to stay in Waikiki. The host was so well organized and easy to contact for questions. The condo was clean and spacious with everything we needed. We’d highly recommend.

Thank you very much."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The views alone are the best in Waikiki. The location is central to everything. The free parking came in handy and was so close to the condo.
I will definitely favorite this place and will rebook again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful condo with an amazing view. Check-in was easy and Tha was very sweet to show us in and give us some notes. Location is unbeatable and we will definitely look to stay here again on our next trip to the Island.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this condo was amazing. From the view to the walkable location it was great. Charles was extremely responsive and helpful through the whole process and during our stay. Anything you could need for the beach was supplied which was amazing. Parking pass was also provided for parking right across the street which was super convenient.
Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, super friendly host. we would definitely stay here again when we come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an open floor plan with sliding doors for both the bedroom area and large veranda that gave us a wonderful view of the ocean and city lights. Condo is on a nice beach. Beautiful, modern condo. Responsiveness and helpful host."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot beat the location. Amazing sunset views. Host is helpful and responsive. We loved our stay .
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had an amazing tropical vacation in a very wonderful home. Charles and Tha were extremely welcoming with Aloha spirit. It was a beautiful home in a wonderful convenient setting that met all of our needs! Such a pleasant experience for everyone. Would definitely recommend because it is as amazing in real life as the pictures.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with beautiful views! We enjoyed are stay and looking forward to visiting again soon.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such an amazing stay at Charles’ condo! The location is perfect as it is steps to the beach and just minutes away from great shopping and restaurants, but in a less busy part of Waikiki. The parking lot is convienently located directly across the street and we never had trouble finding a close spot. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony with a great view of the beach and watching the fireworks on Friday night. There were so many great restaurants in the area so we didn’t really use the kitchen much but it was well stocked with everything you would need if you want to cook a meal. There was also beach towels, chairs, umbrella, snorkeling gear, boogie boards and other beach items available to use which was awesome. Accommodations were very clean and comfortable and check in was easy. Tha was very friendly and gave us a tour and local recommendations. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my third visit to Hawaii since my honeymoon 10 years ago. I would like to say that it was the best accommodation I have ever stayed in. Next time I come to Hawaii, I definitely want to come back here. thank you"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a amazing place!! It was everything me and my family could of ever dreamed of, the sunset views from the balcony were incredible, almost everyday we stayed we woke up to rainbows over the ocean it was amazing. Charles was awesome very helpful with recommendations and very responsive couldn’t ask for a better host. So many restaurants close by, You can basically step on to Waikiki beach off the elevator , Hilton Hawaiian village was about 10 min walk and the shops were all you could ever ask for they had everything! We will def be using Charles place again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles is a great host! Very responsive and proactive. The unit was absolutely gorgeous and breath taking!

Very nice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This condo is a must-book if you are a family of 4 looking to stay in Waikiki. We stayed for a full 2 weeks with our two teen kids (each got a pull-out couch) & it was perfect. Charles and Tha communicated throughout and we knew just what to expect. They even accommodated our ever-changing arrival time and Tha gave us a personal tour. We had access to all the amenities as described plus boogie boards, snorkeling gear, beach chairs and tide pods for washing clothes. The in-room washer/dryer came in handy for packing less and especially after our frequent beach visits. The parking was easy to walk to and we made a lot of use of the in/out privileges travelling all over the island. It was an easy walk to restaurants, the beach below and a down the boardwalk to the Hilton Hawaiian lagoon too. Whenever we could we slept with the lanai sliding doors opened and feel asleep to the sound of the waves, trade winds and woke up to little birdies in the morning. Such paradise!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location of this condo is fantastic! Charles was quick to respond to the few questions we had….would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay. Right on the beach. Many places to shop and choose from to eat within walking distance. Gated for security. Beautiful scenery from the balcony. Parking was easily accessible. Host was very responsive. Nice bath towels & Beach Towels! Loved having the washer and dryer! Fully equipped kitchen! I can’t think of anything we needed that wasn’t there! AC unit kept the room very cool as well. Definitely recommend 10/10, would book here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment right by the beach with beautiful views including sunset. Well appointed spacious kitchen. Can be a wait for the lift but wonderful apartment in the heart of Waikiki, great views and peaceful. Clear communication from Charles the host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Don’t think twice about booking, you won’t regret it! The ocean view from balcony is spectacular. Location is perfect, close to shops and restaurants. Super clean. And plenty of space for our family of 4. Highly recommend grabbing a quick bite at the Steak Shack for the Friday night fireworks. We can’t wait to return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! The view is unbeatable! Everything was easy to walk to, especially Waikiki beach! Definitely will stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great time during our stay. The pictures are what you get and more, the place has everything you need for a fun and care free getaway. The free and available beach gear made it so convenient to get out and go without having to go rent or buy. The parking is also a big perk since it's included and it was a pleasure dealing with Charles and Tha. We are recommending this place to friends and family who are planning to visit and stay in Waikiki. Thank you, we made some fun memories."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay so much! You could not ask for a better location, and the View was Amazing! Our family of four stayed comfortably and we can't wait to come back! Charles and Tha are gracious hosts."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were extremely pleased with the condo for its comfort, views, and location to restaurants, all while still feeling very private. The condo was exactly as pictured and described, with the added bonus of parking for our rental car across the street (very convenient). Charles was very responsive and made our stay feel effortless. We would definitely come back to stay in this unit."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic condo. Stunning views. Close to everything. Charles was always responsive and helpful!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely few days in Waikiki. We have stayed in other areas but we loved the location of Waikiki Shore. Tha was very helpful showing us the condo and getting us settled. The parking across the street is great, but we didn't need to drive anywhere because this unit is so walkable and close to everything we needed. The view is spectacular."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spot in Honolulu! Space is exactly as represented and Charles is easy to communicate with. Wonderful views and spectacular location with walkable access to restaurants, shopping, beach, etc. For future trips to Honolulu we will absolutely look to book again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and great patio.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charles’ place was impeccable and very thoughtfully done. The location is a 11/10. My family enjoyed our stay and the endless activities nearby. It’s a minute away from the beach and some delicious food.
Charles was very responsive, friendly and helpful. I’d recommend his home to anyone visiting the Waikiki area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can’t say enough about how wonderful this condo was. It was located right on Waikiki beach with a place where you could rent chairs and umbrellas at an affordable price. What I loved most was that everything that you normally have to go to the store to buy was already provided. Laundry detergent, paper towels, toilet paper. He provided easy instructions on how to work everything. We couldn’t figure out how to work the air conditioning and reached out to him, and he told us how to work it immediately, and it was perfect. Every single thing he wrote in his description was actually there and provided, including lots of beach towels and water toys. It’s refreshing to find that the description actually meets what you see when you arrive. I would absolutely recommend renting this condo. It was amazing!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very Nice Place, walking distance to shopping, dining and beach. Beach towels and laundry were a plus. Parking was easy. Enjoyed our stay and the view from balcony was beautiful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"In sum, this is a gem of a place. This is a fantastic place and Charles/Tha were super hosts. The place is the perfect location for exploring Waikiki by foot and exploring around Oahu (by rental car). The place is literally on the beach and the views from the apartment is better than the photos. The place has all amenities needed....including beach towels, snorkels, toys, noodles, boogie boards for the beach, etc....that was a very nice touch. The apartment is super nice and the balcony is super nice, facing SW.....often, we got take-out (restaurants all super close by) and had dinner on the table on the balcony....watched the sunset and fireworks on Friday night (one of the best views IMO). Charles/Tha are super hosts. When we had an issue with the parking pass or the lock, they were so quick to respond and get these resolved. We really appreciated this and a big thanks! Parking came with the unit (key for Waikiki), it is super close across the street in an open safe lot."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best airbnb experience ever! Has almost everything you need in the condo. Supper convenient location, 10 minutes walk to everything. Breathtaking ocean view from the balcony.Reasonable price for such a spacious room in this expensive area. Bonus: We saw the fireworks from the balcony on New Year’s Eve. Thank you Charles and Tha for your host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location with a beautiful view of everything. I can only recommend them.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We absolutely loved our time at this accommodation. Charles was very responsive and proactive when we lost internet. We fully recommend this place to anyone. Thanks for such a great stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time as two adults and a 4 year old. There were plenty of beach toys, towels and even a life jacket for kids which was a life’s saver. It was perfect for us, and the view was fantastic."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and close to all activities - nice clean place will stay again
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location, location, location! A walk down to the beach, you couldn't ask for better than that! Charles had everything a family would need stocked in the condo! So many towels and family beach supplies. It really felt as though they knew exactly what we needed. The view is beautiful and the ability to walk everywhere was vital for us as we did not have a car for this portion of our trip. With that being said we also had to figure out what to do with our luggage until check-in and the host was unable to help nor suggest a solution. Luckily our family extended their rental car in order for us to keep our luggage. All in all, this was a great stay for us, the place had plenty of room for the 4 of us, and it is beautiful inside and out!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice apartment, we especially love the big balcony and ocean view, the sleeper sofa is a lot more comfortable than I expect. We have four people and each of us can use a bed."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The views were amazing. Charles was easy to communicate with. The instructions were very clear. The location was close to everything. Highly recommend staying here!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have found a more perfect location for our stay in Oahu. Our family planned to rent a car and drive around the island during our trip, and this apartment was the perfect home base for us to rest and relax between drives. The included parking was a huge plus - if you plan to be outside of Honolulu during your trip, I can’t reccomend this place enough.
The apartment had everything we needed and more, and Charles was a wonderful host who responded immediately to any questions that came up. The view is spectacular and we had the best seats to see the Waikiki firework show from the balcony. Next time we plan a visit to Oahu, we’ll definitely plan to stay here again (if it’s available!)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles was easy to communicate with. Pictures of the unit are accurate. Great location and view!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charles and Tha gave best supports and quick responses when we move-in. This luxury Condo is spectacular view to water, sunset, and fireworks every Friday night. It is clean, nice, and specially has 4 beds that make 4 people can peacefully sleep individually. You will have everything you need in this little Condo and Tha/Charles decorates it in such a nice-looking contemporary way. We will check with Charles/Tha again if we plan to come back in the future. Thank Charles/Tha for sharing the stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This room and location was absolutely perfect! The pictures in the posting don’t do it justice! The room is very modern with a quaint layout.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! Was very comfortable. Located on beach and super close to several upscale places to shop. There were many places to eat too with a great selection, all within walking distance. Having the kitchen was so convenient, especially with teenagers. The view was amazing and the firework show from the balcony was top notch. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Pics don’t do it justice! Absolutely stunning inside and out. Perfect location and best we’ve stayed in Honolulu. Beach and little area were perfect. Close to everything. Fireworks and view in general breathtaking. Hosts wonderful. Will be our go to when on Oahu! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charles was a GREAT person to deal with and very good with communication/questions. He also let us checkin a bit earlier since the room was cleaned quicker then normal.
Thanks!
Much appreciated!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved the beach in front of the condo. The room was nice and was very clean and had everything we needed. We can see fireworks from this room on Friday. The parking is also nearby the condo. The host was very nice and friendly and the check-in was smooth. We have everything we needed to play on the beach. There was a bodyboard, floating tub, and a snorkel. The location was very great. We want to go to this condo again when we go to Hawaii."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the stay here. Charles and Tha were incredible hosts with immediate response time. The condo was beautiful; very nice kitchen, tons of space for the 4 of us....even 4 beds, and, most importantly, incredible views. We will for sure stay here again, thank you for your hospitality."

No complaints…….all was beyond perfect!!!!!!’"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles was a great Host proving realtime communication from the time we arrived to the last minute of checkout. The unit was special in both location and spactacular views of the ocean. We definately would stay at this location again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This may be the first airbnb stay to exceed my expectations! The location was perfect, felt private, the linens and bed were some of the nicest we’ve had and can’t beat the sunset view and beach access!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic, Wish i could have stayed longer !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Paradise! We loved the privacy and the beach was incredible. Doing yoga on the back lanai with the birds singing and the sun rising over the mountains, choosing which of the three day beds to read on, rinsing off sand in the outdoor shower after swimming in the gentle waves and all of this in complete privacy… for us, this is what a vacation should be."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate to stay here! Absolutely incredible and your own little paradise. Beautiful location on north side, right on the beach and Perfect place to relax for our babymoon. Had a little issue with the place but Rose and her team were quick to respond and resolve it. Hard to leave and Would come back in a heartbeat"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A sweet place to de-stress! The home is serene with lovely outdoor seatings for reading/writing/art. Loved gazing at the night sky in the lounge chairs! And the beautiful beach was perfect for floating!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was such a beautiful place in paradise! we definitely want to come back some day!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous cottage within metres of the sandy beach. Beautifully decorated with creative ideas. On our first day we saw whales breaching and also a turtle whilst sitting relaxing on the shore.
Thoroughly recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Rose was exceptional at communicating. We had no problems finding it and parking was never a problem which I appreciate. Easy accessible unit. Absolutely spot on accurate descriptions and photos. Loved that quality brand shampoo and conditioner were available and a huge bag of ice in addition to purified water. We had no problems at all whatsoever.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome house, beautifully designed. Great spot to get away."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place on the North Shore of O'ahu right on the beach. Stayed there for 4 nights and enjoyed it a lot.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Rose's beautiful cottage. The property is lush, private and right on a small beach. The cottage has high end finishes and everything you could possibly want...except a microwave. It was a lovely stay with friendly hosts in a spectacular location. If you can go there, make it happen!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay at a special place. Beautifully and intentionally built and in a fantastic location. We look forward to returning!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very enjoyable time at Rose’s place. Rose was very accommodating and very quick to respond to any questions. The cottage was extremely clean, comfortable and had all of the necessities of home.
This isolated piece of paradise is right up our alley! The small community and animals are absolutely lovely. Simply put… we want to stay here forever.
We will definitely be returning,
Mahalo for welcoming us into your home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, Beautiful cottage in a precious area of Oahu that is not overrun by tourists and affords the ability to enjoy Hawaii with a little bit of quiet. The cottage is modern and appears as advertised and was incredibly serene. Very comfortable bed. plenty of place to lounge. The beach is a small piece of paradise.
As noted in other reviews, The rental is in a shared property with several other residences. we did not find this to be bothersome, but there were other individuals who were sharing the beach, the chairs near the water, etc.
The only downsides were the outside locks were not functional to enter and exit the cottage. We had to go through a complicated strategy of opening or exiting doors that actually locked. There were many mosquitoes due to the proximity to a creek. the kitchen lacked a few things that would make it completely functional like measuring cups or tablespoons. but these are small gripes for an otherwise wonderful place. We would love to come back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible property and location. Right on the water, you have the ocean as your own playlist. Pure relaxation."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical place! Hope to be back someday!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem! The Indonesian vibe, high end renovation and meticulous design does not do it justice. We cannot say enough about this magical cottage nestled along a shoreline of amazing wave watching and private beaches.
We had no other neighbors (we do believe that rose owns other properties on the lot) and only stayed one special evening, but, once we walked in, there was no way we were leaving until check out. This cottage is the perfect place to leave your worries behind (and your cell unless you’re taking pictures of the amazing sunset, waves or stars so close you feel
Like you can touch them).
Definitely worth the money and reality check out."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ahhhhmazing! We absolutely loved it!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful, pristinely clean and in a lovey location. As some other reviewers stated, it is located in a compound of houses behind a locked gate on the ocean. You cannot see the ocean from the house, but can hear the waves. The outside sitting area was comfortable. The house is all glass doors around the front as shown, and people did walk by our glass walls.
The chairs shown in the photos are around the corner in the front yard and look onto the beach and palm trees. Multiple times, there was another couple sitting in them, so although the photos make them look like your secluded chairs, they were often occupied at dawn or dusk when we'd like to be in them.
The beach was beautiful and there were rarely more than 2-5 other people on it. There's a swing off one of the palm trees on the beach. Can swim (if a decently strong swimmer, waves were strong), the house has body boards to use as well.
Would definitely come back again, but would be glad to know the above."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for our honeymoon, and it was beyond perfect! Quick drive into town for great food, and an incredible private beach right off the property to start off the morning and close the day out with a sunset. I hope to make it back here again for my next getaway."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don’t hesitate to book! This place is so beautiful and peaceful. We will defiantly be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed a great time with our family. Peaceful and safe.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 days and wished we could’ve stayed for longer! We will definitely be back. The location is private, not too far from Haleiwa, and set on a beautiful semi private beach. We loved the open set up, and everything was super clean and comfortable! There’s not too much by way of privacy (toilet has a privacy curtain but no door) but this didn’t bother us much, but thought it’d be good to know for future guests"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay in a quiet area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don't do this place justice! It was magical and exactly what we were looking for. Can't wait to stay here on our next trip to Oahu.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a beautiful stay at Rose’s place. The quiet setting and serene location really set the tone for our stay. Loved having the beach access and the outdoor shower in Hawaii was very cool. Can’t wait to come back and visit again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We can’t put into words how much we loved our stay. It was zen and peaceful and just what we needed. We enjoyed being steps from the sunset on the beach - we even canceled all of our plans our last night just to stay there and enjoy the place some more. The outdoor shower is AMAZING. Rose responded quickly to all of our communication and left amazing recommendations for local food. This place and Haleiwa town has a special place in our hearts now. Wish we could stay forever. We will be back soon!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Me and my husband celebrated our elopement here and it was beyond perfect. Rose gave us permission to take my pre bridal photos here as well which was soo nice of her.. star gazing at night (you can literally see the milky way) watching the sunsets, soaking in the tub, outdoor shower, swimming at the beach that is literally steps away (I saw a turtle swim by) it felt soo luxurious, and I truly felt lucky to be there and so grateful we picked this place ! Who wants to stay in a tower at some hotel and go down elevators when you can stay somewhere like this, 10 out of 10 ! We will be back one day for a anniversary trip for sure. Look no further this is the place you want to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing cottage in a superbly secluded spot 20 yards walk to the beach - if you want a getaway from it all beach holiday free of crowds this is the place- we loved it and hope to be back….
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING. We stayed here 10 days for our honeymoon and I definitely cried when we left.
The house is thoughtfully built and eco-conscious. The water is a few steps from the house and is like your own private beach! The kitchen comes with everything needed to make meals (except microwave). There is washer, dryer, detergent, hairdryer, iron, even pods for the dishwasher! The outdoor shower was so nice, it’s has been hard adjusting back to a boring normal shower. The bed and pillows were super comfortable and there are curtains to add privacy from the living area. No TV, but we brought a laptop and streamed using Wi-Fi, which was excellent. Every morning, we’d walk the beach to watch the sunrise and look for sea glass/shells. One of the mornings, there was a HUGE seal swimming by- it checked us out then made its way back to deep.
The resident cats are super sweet and hung out with us few times while we baked in the sun. Overall amazing vacation we can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway for 2. You have your own little slice of paradise. Beach view/access is semi-private and is accessible to other members in the small community. Overall, beautiful place and would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and daughter and I stayed two nights at the end of June. The location is like something out of a movie, picture-perfect beach and lush tropical gardens that were well maintained. The house was comfortable and we loved the host's eco-friendly approach. We loved meeting some of the local wildlife (cats, chickens, geckos and fish), but others (mice in the kitchen, and cockroaches). We know those pests come with the territory, but worth mentioning for anyone thinking of staying here. The master bed and linens were beautifully comfortable. The sofa bed was not as luxurious but was acceptable. The outdoor furniture was plentiful and comfortable. We enjoyed the outdoor shower, and there were plenty of clean towels as well as beach towels. There are plenty of appliances (washer and dryer, air fryer, bbq) and accessories (boogie boards, beach umbrella). There was no TV or music, but wifi was good. Overall, we had a wonderful, restful stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rose’s place is exactly as it is shown in the photos, and as another commenter mentioned, actually better. Appliances are all top quality, the villa is beautifully designed and decorated, and its beachfront location quite unique for the North Shore. Worthy of the considerable praise given by other reviewers, and exceeds all expectations."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had great stay!!
Rose met us when we arrived and showed us around. She had great recommendations for dining including Killer Tacos, a sourdough pizza place, and a nice restaurant!
But the key positives were the peaceful nature of her place, the palms, the birds chirping every day, the water-planters with budding flowers and fish swimming through the foliage, and the pretty, almost private, beach just steps away in the backyard - not to mention the miles and miles of other beautiful beaches nearby. We already miss being there and we’ve only been gone a few hours! We will also miss Bingo, the property dog. He spent time with us each day, either quickly checking up on us - or taking a nap on the floor. He was as relaxed as we were.
Memorable all around!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Rose’s cottage. There is a very grounded, peaceful energy on the entire property, and you feel it the moment you drive through the private gate.
The grounds are lush and well cared for, and the beach is absolutely magical. My husband, my son, and I had it to ourselves the majority of our weekend stay. We woke up early to watch the sunrise and literally swam with a rainbow one morning.
The cottage is extremely well designed and well crafted…every detail is
intentional. There are plenty of bath towels and even beach towels, chairs, and an umbrella to use. The king bed is extremely comfortable, and then sheets were divine.
We loved the little private library, and the books were right up our alley. Wish we could have stayed longer to read the full collection!
Please stay at Rose’s cottage. Swim with the rainbows, read their collection of wise books outdoors, enjoy the sunsets over the ocean waves, and shower in the moonlight. You won’t regret it."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Super nice, peaceful, and beautiful."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the most serene and beautiful spaces we’ve stayed in. The location spectacular. It’s right on the beach and only 15 min drive to restaurants and tasty food trucks. The bed was very comfortable and home so peaceful. The host is very responsive.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect beachside cottage for some quiet time and sun. The cottage itself is impressive and well furnished. The beach was beautiful, quiet, and we basically had it to ourselves anytime we were there. Short drive to Haleiwa town for food, drinks, and entertainment."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! Wish we could have stayed longer. The property was beautiful - location was breathtaking. We had such a peaceful time. Loved every bit of our 2 nights here. The cottage is cozy and well decorated.
It is private but there are several other houses in the gated community so just be mindful of other guests walking around - everyone was very friendly.
The town nearby was easy to get to and had plenty of shops and restaurants.
We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we find our way back to Hawaii!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rose's place was exactly as described and looked in the pictures. We especially appreciated the beautiful beach nearby and the peaceful environment. One morning was rainy and we were in need of some rest and we greatly enjoyed having the covered patio with very comfortable furniture to enjoy the rain and outdoors. Rose responded in a timely fashion and was helpful with any questions we had.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home and location are absolutely fabulous. It’s even better then the pictures. One of the top locations on the planet.

Stay there .."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely gorgeous and unique bungalow right on the Pacific Ocean. The location was clean, organized, and easy to find. The open bathroom configuration took some getting used to, but overall I would highly recommend this location and would visit again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cottage absolutely blew us away! The check in was flawless and we instantly felt more relaxed. The space had such a beautiful clean and fresh smell. Every single piece of decor was beautiful and we could tell it was all thought out. Being eco conscious ourselves we loved that this cottage was as well. The outside shower under the moon and being able to hear the ocean was an experience I didn’t know I needed. This was the best stay of our whole trip! We can’t wait to be back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rose is an excellent host who was kind and attentive to our out of the box requests! The place is gorgeous, stylish and serene. The beach is 10 steps away and the views are sweeping! 6 stars!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly special place in a beautiful environment. We have done dozens of Airbnb stays and this one ranks at the top.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous space near North Shore. The home is absolutely beautiful & has so many amazing touches. There is beach access from the home & waking up to a walk out on the beach was incredible.
Very relaxing & safe space. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Will absolutely come back to stay with Rose next time back on Oahu!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rose's place was absolutely stunning. We stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon and it was romantic, private, and felt like our own little oasis. We loved the outdoor shower and big, deep bathtub. We would absolutely stay here again and will recommend to everyone that's looking for a beautiful stay on the North Shore."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space with thoughtful touches and peaceful garden and beach.
Beach not totally private but shared with people renting from properties in same community but was private enough.
I loved the bathtub! The outside shower was lovely and the bed was comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked but no microwave. The only thing I’d mention is the toilet isn’t private from the rest of the open floor plan (no door)
The AC didn’t seem to work but we slept with the door open which was perfect as we could hear the rain and the ocean.
I definitely hope to stay again."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved this property.
The view is great, the beach, everything.
Just don’t expect privacy.
The compound you’re in is full of surfers.
They’ll be there at 7am.
ATV’s and surf boards.
It’s a glass house.
Just be ready.
And the family.
A one year old, four year old, and seven year old.
You can hear them all.
Otherwise, it’s amazing."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely unbelievable. Better than the pictures.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stop looking, this is it. Rose's place is awesome, relaxing, and gorgeous. As a host she was extremely responsive and came over to apologize when the lawn maintenance showed up unannounced.
The views are breathtaking. Oftentimes, I had the entire beach to myself. Honestly, I was sad to leave!
Hope to be back soon!
Thank you for a wonderful home base for our honeymoon!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! We had our Elopment here and it was so magical and special. Rose was so sweet and helpful throughout the process. We were able to go on the beach and the backyard was beyond beautiful. The kitchen and amenities are all beautiful. This was such a special place for us. We will definitely be coming back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay! It's exactly as pictured if not more. We definitely hope to stay there again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is absolutely stunning. From the modern Balinese style architecture to the gorgeous front lawn to the serene and almost private beach in front. A perfect place for us to take our infant in Hawaii - our only regret is we wish we booked it longer. Highly recommend!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best place ever !
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything you have read in other reviews is spot on. The beach is probably a little better than the photos even show. We spent 10 spectacular days here and will be back!!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words that come to mind for this property: peaceful, serene, therapeutic, beautiful and heavenly. Bird songs, ocean waves and sandy beach are amazing. Open air everything makes it feel like a yoga retreat."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was absolutely beautiful - the perfect beach getaway. It was quiet, clean, and expertly designed. Rose was available and helpful during our stay. We can’t wait to return!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, right on the beach. The sliding glass walls (made up of 3 doors on two of the home's 4 walls) were amazing! We opened them the day we checked in and never closed them until we left! The ocean breeze was great! We never even needed to use air conditioning, although it is available. I would highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was incredible! The studio is very modern and romantic. It is essentially right on the ocean. Having access to a private beach really made our trip. 10/10 I would stay here every time I come to Oahu.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, very clean with a great private beach! We enjoyed our stay here very much and highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Not sure what to say other than book it if you can. Absolute perfection for a couple or 1 kid family like ours. Hosts are fantastic (including Bingo) and you get basically your own beach. We feel so blessed to have stayed here. Easy drive to all the North Shore has to offer but you’ll have to talk yourself into leaving this place anyways.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect with our stay!!!! The cottage was comfortable, quiet and the views were unforgettable. One of the best parts of this cottage is the location. We absolutely loved being away from the noisy hotel district but also close enough to the historic town just a short drive away. We will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was beautiful. Communication with Rose was excellent!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rose's place is simply breathtaking! It was the perfect combination of quiet, luxurious, private, and comfortable. She has thought of everything in creating a beautiful and functional space just steps from the ocean. We only spent the first half of our trip here and wished that we had planned to spend the whole time! I can't recommend enough."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Magnificent spot, amazing host & remarkable experience! 100% recommended"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay for our family! Beautiful cottage on a nearly private beach. Very peaceful and unique. Away from the hustle and bustle but short drive to town, other beaches, and some cool hikes.
Rose and Carlos and their family were great hosts.
Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location. Highly recommend for a peaceful getaway on the north shore. Rose was a great host.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put, Rose's property is absolutely breathtaking. The location is perfect in that it feels remote but is only 15 minutes from a solid grocery store and restaurants. The unit itself is one of the best appointed AirBnB's I have ever seen: high quality appliances, pots/pans, dishware, towels, bed sheets, etc. It is truly a 5 star experience. The 2 Adirondack chairs perched just above the beach is where we found ourselves every day. On clear nights the star gazing was phenomenal and the only sounds we heard were the waves crashing on the beach. Bingo, the dog on the property, was such a welcome treat. He loved to stop by and say hi and relax on the cool concrete floor when we let him in. Any time we had a question on what to do or where to go we just messaged Rose and asked. If you're looking for a place to stay in Oahu, stop, you've found it."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was our favorite part of our honeymoon! We tried a bed & breakfast and a resort, in addition to this airbnb, during our honeymoon and this truly took the cake. We wish we had booked more nights here. It has the vibe and quietness of a bed and breakfast, with an even better beach access than you get at most resorts. We basically had a private beach, just steps out the door. And the star gazing on the beach at night is phenomenal!
This place was also the most well stocked of any airbnb we have stayed at, with spices, paper products, laundry detergent, beach gear and more. We felt right right at home.
It was really great to meet one of the owners, Carlos, and we loved getting to play with the property dog, Bingo. They even dropped off some fresh picked papayas for us!
We felt that it was mostly pretty private and there was never anyone walking around outside, but people who are particularly privacy conscious might not like that 2 walls of the cottage were entirely made of glass. Though there are curtains you can use to close off the bedroom area, there were gaps between the pieces. Thats about one of the only things we could possibly complain about though.
The neighboring town of Haleiwa had some great shops, restaurants and food trucks that we really enjoyed walking around in! We would definitely recommend checking it out.
Overall, the cottage was fantastic and we are hoping to come back next time we are in Hawaii!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a PERFECT stay, in fact. We loved the location by the sea, the modern house and beautiful interior, a very friendly host etc. It was so comfortable, a little off the busy north shore of Oahu, but still near enough to reach all the things to be seen.
It was definitely the best choice for us and we had an amazing time there!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is amazing. 15 on a 10 point scale.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was an absolute dream! Perfect accommodations, secluded beach, communicative hosts, picture perfect location ….. can’t wait to return"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Truly a private oasis! The place and grounds are amazing with the beach just behind some plants. The is a large dog that roams around so if you are scared of them, just be aware. The studio isn’t “sealed” so small bugs and lizards get in everyonce in a while. But we had the giant glass doors open at almost all times, so I didn’t really matter to us! Ha would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent a delightful 5 nights here and wouldn’t have changed a thing. The beach is just steps away and the house was fully equipped, making it a perfect getaway with our 3-year-old. The house is stunning and the design elements are exquisite. If you’re in search of a truly unique stay, look no further!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rose’s place is beautiful. It has all the amenities needed. Very peaceful and serene location and lovely beach! We enjoyed playing with Bingo the dog and watching the sky divers parachuting down from the sky right above us!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The perfect place hands down....i will go no other place but here nxt time in the island
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and Awesome area! However, we had two issues. Everyone is not a dog lover. To have a dog freely running around is not great for customers who aren't fond of dogs. My wife had a terrible experience the last two days because she is very afraid of dogs and was scared of coming outside for the rest of our stay.
Also, if it is a private location with glass pane windows, it is not good to have maintenance workers who can see your privacy. If you aren't afraid of dogs or occasional maintenance workers around, then you will love it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were literally awestruck when we walked into the cottage. The photos do it no justice at all. Every amenity imaginable was in place and the only thing we had to supply was the food. The open layout was phenomenal. The open air design of the sliders was dynamic; walking out onto the lanai with the oversized tables and couches, the lighting, ceiling fans, eating area, and grill... everything you could need/want was there. Beach accessories (boogie boards, chairs, etc), grill & utensils, loungers. We were greeted immediately by the local resident dog Bingo who was welcome to make himself at home, LOL. The first view of the beach was stunning, and literally just a few paces away. It was pristine and the closest to private as you can get. We travelled the island to other beaches but always found ourselves asking ""why are we going elsewhere when we have our own beach?"" and always headed back early to the cottage. We always felt like we were the only ones on the island to enjoy the serene, manicured grounds with coconut palms and mango trees. The few residents in the colony were so friendly and always willing to address any questions, while at the same time giving us 100% privacy. We could literally go days and see only a few people but usually no one at all. Rose was always immediately available by phone to handle any and all of our needs, although with everything provided there was nothing we needed. Rose and her family were phenomenal in assisting us with a specific accommodation to make our wedding stay perfect. Morning swims and evening sunsets were remarkable and the nighttime skies were mind-blowing. The kitchen appliances and utensils were perfect and provided us with everything we needed. The outdoor shower with private entrances and direct entry into the bathroom was extraordinary. Storage was plentiful, the washer/dryer was a handy touch, towels and bath supplies were abundant, AC and wifi, kitchenware, spices... the place had it all. Being only minutes from Haleiwa was convenient yet far enough away to leave us with a sense of remoteness once we were inside the gate. Both my wife and I were speechless with the flawless accommodations and property. We're now spoiled for life, knowing that we'd be hard presssed to ever find anything as picture-perfect as this and we knew right away that this will be our yearly getaway."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A prefect get away place
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place that has everything you might need. Lovely beach, nice quiet location. I would definitely come back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of our best stays! Excellent place!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,the house was beyond perfect. communication with rose beforehand was seamless and couldn't have been easier to check-in. husband and i stayed for a week. the house looked just like the pictures. the indoor space was serine and peaceful (cleanest place i feel that i've ever stayed). outside space is beyond usable and the chairs that overlooked the ocean - used every morning for coffee and sunrise. we felt spoiled staying in this oasis. steps from private beach. about a 10-15 minute ride into super cute beach town w/ lots of great eats and cute spots to shop. loved this place. already dreaming of when we can come back.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful memories that will last for a lifetime is what we made here. Our stay was short and sweet (as we split our vacation up between North Shore and Waikiki) our biggest regret is not booking more days at this location as there’s just still so much more we want to see and do and people and neighbors we’d love to meet and have more conversations with. The home was incredibly beautiful although we got a little confused coming in (probably more our fault though because we didn’t arrive until evening) luckily a friendly Carlos helped guide us the way in :) Every detail is thought of for the home and someone staying there. If you plan on being there for a few days you can easily post up with no need to leave as the house has everything you need except the food and coffee. But if you come prepared with all of that you have no reason to leave unless you want to~
The bed was so incredibly comfortable I had my best sleep yet! All of the appliances towels bedding is top notch all details they truly try to think of what a guest would want and need. The house is on the edge of The outskirts of town but just close enough to still drive in and eat a meal shop around and sightseeing Or keep going past it and you’re at the edge of the island with beautiful hikes to explore. The things we saw alone in a matter of one hour on the practically private beach was incredible. In the one hour we stood there absorbing every last moment before our departure we saw a sea lion come to shore, a turtle swimming by, a whale breached 3 times and even saw skydivers jumping from the sky and wemet some more even incredible neighbors whom our son loved running and playing with. Our biggest regret was not staying longer to really just more time at the property so our goal next time is less sight seeing more just sitting and enjoying. We cannot wait to return :)
Mahalo for everything True Ohana right here in this family, community, and home~
We will be back ~"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Relaxing, quiet, peaceful. The beach is just steps away and usually empty. Our toddler loved the chickens and the very gentle dog that are on the property. We’ll be back."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, private location on the North Shore. Hope to come back someday."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible oasis on the beach! The cottage was immaculate and Rose is a great host!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was the most perfect Airbnb we could’ve chosen! The cottage was steps from a private little beach that was perfect for watching sunsets. Will stay here again!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My finance and I ended our trip to Hawaii here and it was absolutely amazing ! The beach was clean and private! The house was better then the pictures. We wish we booked more time here. We will 100% be back. (If you stay here a trip to surf N salsa is a must)
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A slice of paradise is the only way to describe these accommodations! My wife and I stayed for a few nights for our wedding and I must say it was exactly what we needed. Relaxation and just good old time together in the most beautiful of places! We had no cares in the world!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hard to beat a superb vacation with an unbelievable space. Would book again in a heartbeat.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous place! Came here for the first two nights of our honeymoon and it was the perfect place to relax. Beautiful, clean and comfortable space steps from a gorgeous beach. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed, plus there were chairs and a few things for the beach. 10/10 will be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice! Would definitely choose the Oasis again
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, secluded beach cottage steps away from the ocean and easily accessible to the rest of the island. Would absolutely recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Oahu. Hoping to stay here again next time I visit!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is THE SPOT to stay on North Shore. Beautiful space with open floor plan and amazing lanai (w/comfy loungers and day beds!). The outdoor shower and giant soaking tub were very cool. The house is close enough to town to pick up whatever you need (food to go, groceries, coffee etc) but far enough from the crowds that tend to come up that way. The best part is definitely private beach shared with a handful of neighbors. We can’t wait to come back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place filled with tranquility and peace. The ocean, beach and bungalow provide the ideal setting for the ultimate getaway. We will be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views in a modern, eco friendly home! Rose and Carlos have a magical place on the North Shore, we will definitely be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you have to go anywhere to stay on this island-this is the place! We cannot wait to return. A piece of paradise in paradise...it does not get any better.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A Tropical Dreamscape Hideaway
The core of this experience - THIS HOUSE IS AN “Experience” - for us, is that - it’s the equivalent of a high end Mercedes convertible. If it could drive by, the top would be down, everyone nodding as it passed.
I say convertible because the ocean facing 8 foot iron framed glass paneled walls retract and turns this place into a majestic Himalayan yoga studio, complete with a mini-sauna available on request. The shower hides outside just off the back where a romantic bed sits across from the dude ranch bathtub and the sink is stunning, actually its a wood lovers paradise. Most furniture pieces and over-sized, antique and gorgeous. The space is clean and spotless!
The rain gathering symbiotic cisterns housing tiny cute fish and vibrant purple water lilies are grounding and encourage Tai Chi, yoga and meditation. You connect with nature here the way surf culture has touched these islands. Closing up the “convertible” after a day on the nearly private beach with the absolute coolest neighbors, the space becomes a kitchen-centric Italian villa with top of the line appliances and a great-room feel.
The mystical beach and ocean beckons surfers, skydivers and kite magicians 24/7. We ran on it every night under the brightest of full moons.
North Shore Mokuleia Hawaii, in this oasis is best enjoyed exactly as the superhero hosts have intended. Trust them. WE WILL BE BACK. THANK YOU for an experience of a lifetime.
Our mom rented the adjacent unit to join us for Thanksgiving, it was perfect! It had an even better ocean view (nearly impossible) and it was a similar experience. This spot blew us all away! 1000 foot thank you to Rose and Carlos. DO NOT HESITATE in considering this paradise, for this space is a GIFT NOT a rental."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Such a beautiful setting and property! Quiet, secluded, easy to find, close to stores and restaurants but totally private too. Minimal, modern decor and everything you'd need for cooking, which we did daily. Only thing missing were measuring cups and spoons so we estimated and did just fine. I loved the outdoor shower and good quality soap, shampoo and conditioner. The sand was soft, and the beach had literally no trash, no seaweed, no broken shells, just soft white sand. The unit has AC which was helpful because there aren't screens on the doors or windows and they need to be closed at night because of critters or bugs, but it was totally comfortable with the AC running. Thank you Rose."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage has everything you’ll ever need and more. Pulling into this community was so amazing. Walking up the house was breathtaking. The open floor plan is phenomenal, and the kitchen is to die for. You have spices, oils, pots, pans, just about everything you need to cook. Rose gave recommendations on grocery shopping, foods, etc. The cottage has an open porch that is surrounded by greenery. My son was obsessed with the pots that were full of little fish and plants. Once you look out off the porch, you are greeted with the ocean. The ocean and beach is beyond all expectations. You have a private beach that those around you use, but overall very private. There’s a swing that we used continuously. I was able to work and drink a glass of wine on the porch in complete peace and tranquility. Honestly, it’s unlike anything I’ve experienced. The kitchen I used for every meal, didn’t want to leave to get food because with a kitchen like that, ZERO reason to go grab food.
The bathtub. I’m a bath person. So is my child. This bath was everything for my family. I know that sounds silly but taking a bath with the ocean breeze coming in was AMAZING. The bed was equally as amazing. Comfortable, and inviting. I was a little worried about no TV (i have a kiddo who needs movie time before we go to bed) but honestly, we didn’t even realize it was missing. By the time we got into bed, we talked, looked out the windows at the scenery…and we were out! It was that peaceful.
This house has it all. It was perfect for my family of three and we will 150% be back. Thank you so much for sharing your space with us. ❤️"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rose was amazing to communicate with. We were nervous about our trip because of COVID restrictions (we booked pretty early in advance) and Rose was so understanding, kind, and flexible. I cannot recommend this place enough. It was absolutely beautiful and felt better than a resort because of the amount of privacy! We loved and enjoyed every minute of our stay. 1000% worth it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This property is gorgeous. All the furniture, fixtures, linens, appliances, etc were all high end while still being eco-friendly. This property has other rentals on the property which also have access to the pictured chairs/beach/swing. But really, we only saw a couple one time- so it still felt very private. And there’s large hedges all around THIS particular cottage so all glass windows and views are still very private. We loved that its also a gated property- we felt completely safe with our belongings and leaving doors open. Loved the provided snorkeling gear, boogie boards, umbrellas, beach chairs, etc. There’s also a labradoodle, (Bingo) who roamed around freely. It was obvious he was trained and he is so SO sweet-Personally we loved his company whenever he showed up! The chickens roaming the property are also pretty fun. You can tell they’re used to people so we were amused by them. Loved the recommended places to eat. And my husband chatted with one of the property managers who was so friendly with tips and also kind enough to offer us to enjoy all the coconuts we wanted from the trees. We will be recommending this place for years to come and hope to come back someday! Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and Rose is the best! Very zen and peaceful. Steps from a private beach that is the most beautiful teal color. The visiting chickens and dog were the cherry on top!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not as private as the posting made it seem, but the place and view were amazing! Saw some turtles swim right up to shore."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place is perfectly designed in a beautiful way The location is perfect Great experience Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful escape for anyone traveling to Oahu. Virtually private beach, beautiful home, and not far from plenty of amazing restaurants and other beaches to explore too! Can't wait to come back to the island and stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! We will definitely stay there again. The beach was private and peaceful. The house had everything you could possibly need. There was snorkeling equipment, beach chairs, luxury appliances and even an array of spices in the kitchen. Don’t hesitate to book this house!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is the best place to stay hands down. Everything was perfect! The place is beautiful and the location is absolutely serene.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and secluded studio. Close to lots of great food and activities but quiet and relaxing!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Exceptionally clean and well designed…our stay couldn’t have been any better. Very relaxing and private, we never left. Our favorite stay so far!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A real gem - secluded high end bungalow despite being in a small gated community. No clocks or television (but of course WiFi). Great location between town and country and huge private sandy beach. Plenty of towels, snorkel gear and sand chairs for 2. Can’t go wrong. Hope to return some day. Great memories. Thank you Rose for making this available."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location and modern cottage with top of the line appliances. Everything we needed. I wish it was longer.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rose’s place was exactly as pictured, a beautiful and quiet oasis just perfect for unwinding, quick dips in the ocean, mesmerizing sunsets and calm evenings taking in the sounds of the ocean. Kitchen was equipped with all the items we could want had we had more time to cook. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing north shore cottage in a small gated community. We loved everything about this place. Plenty of space for lounging and right on a secluded section of beach. Even though we ventured out all over the island, Oahu is small enough that we had plenty of time to enjoy the space. We stopped at a fish market down in China town in Honolulu and we were able to get groceries in Haleiwa to utilize the grill and kitchen. We also went in to town for coffee both mornings which was great - Brew & Foam and Coffee Gallery. We would highly recommend Rose’s cottage for a romantic getaway!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous. The appliances are top of the line and you are just a couple steps away from the beach. It is a quaint little place with a very open floor-plan that can be expanded more by opening the large windowed doors.
It is good to note that the only shower is outside, though the bath has a shower handle.
Also, the space in front of the listing may be used as a partial thoroughfare for other people in the complex to get to the beach.
The beach is very pretty, and has some small waves that can be played in, but has a strong undertow and a pretty quick drop, so be prepared if you have small children or aren’t a strong swimmer."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay I will absolutely be returning!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is beyond amazing. The location is perfect…literally just steps to a private beach. We never saw more than just a handful of people on it. My boyfriend free dives, and the reef just beyond the beach was such a fun playground for him. It was so good he never dived anywhere else. The cottage itself was so clean and has any amenity that we could have wanted. We will definitely be back, and will recommend this property to friends and family."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value!! Rose and her family are really nice and friendly, and the home is absolute gem! Prime location and gorgeous views. Will definitely book again next time:)"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"CANCEL ANY OTHER OPTIONS AND STAY HERE!! This is THE BEST place to stay in Oahu. Gorgeous, private, SAFE, friendly.. this is the only way I’ll do Oahu now on. Rose and garret are beyond helpful. The beach is basically private and it’s perfect. We saw a few turtles and met some of the locals pups that were super sweet. Me and my fiancé would give this 10 stars if we could."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis and Emi's place is perfect for me. I enjoyed my stay very much before my work conference kicks start. Mahaka beach is just 5 min away. There are beach chairs and canopy, which you can take to the beach. The in-unit laundry and kitchen made my stay veey enjoyable. I highly recommend this place.
Not directly relevant, but if you are looking to buy bento or sushi from the supermarket. You probably want to grab some before you drive up. The local supermarkets don't seem to have a deli section."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean place to stay and the neighborhood where the house was at was very secure. We did find ourselves driving more to the north east side of the island though.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great experience!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic hideaway as described - perfect if you’re looking for somewhere less crowded. Their place is new and beautifully appointed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful spot in Mākaha valley! Very nice and safe neighborhood and felt right at home. Extremely clean and comfortable stay. Would definitely stay here again if I ever return to the island!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and really great studio. The area is quiet and restful. Really close to beautiful beaches. We had a great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great back to be in my Hometown. Away from the concrete jungle, peaceful and clean. My hanai sister and I really enjoyed our stay & if this place is available on another one of our business trip we’d be happy to stay here once again. Mahalo kākou Travis & Emi🤙🏽"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property! Very comfortable bed and amazing views! A little longer drive time to some of our activities than expected, mainly due to heavy traffic near Honolulu but we appreciated the peace and tranquility of Waianae."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is magical and the hosts are spectacular. If you want a feel of old Hawaii with modern conveniences, this is the place for you. Makaha and the Leeward coast are full of culture, community, and natural beauty. The actual space is clean, comfortable, and the bed is the best I’ve ever slept in. What a great find!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place! Beautiful views, very clean, well thought out amenities and felt very safe! Definitely would recommend and stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect cozy accomodations for 2. Everything was as shown/stated in listing. Furniture was comfortable, everything was very clean, safe environment, pretty views. Hosts were very proactive & friendly with communications. We would stay here again if fortunate enough to return to Oahu."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated Travis' responsiveness to whatever was needed and their communication before, during and after my stay. Their place is very beautiful. I'm sensitive to my bathroom cleanliness and with a little more attention to this between guests, there would be nothing to stop me from giving the highest review for this property! Thank you Travis and Emi. It was a comfortable stay nonetheless."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a couple. We didn’t need a large space because we spend our time doing outdoor activities. We used the BBQ for several meals which was very convenient. There are many beautiful beaches in the area, especially if you like to watch surfers. There are also a few hikes near the airb&b. If you like to snorkel Electric Beach is not to be missed! 15 min drive. The surrounding hills are very beautiful! The hosts were great."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the location between the mountains and with a view of the ocean. Makua Beach was incredible, I saw a sea turtle, dolphins and a whale. Will definitely be back!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Waianae it was easy to get to and our place was very clean and we enjoyed walking around the neighborhood. It was fun to explore that side of the island. Cindy and Bob
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a very nice place and I had a great experience.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! A home away from home! Had everything I needed and more. Clean, organized, and spacious. 5 star AirBnB"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and it was an excellent place to stay
Enjoyed whale watching the beach and the view. Also enjoyed a new restaurant called Lanterns"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place. Amazing location. Mountains behind and ocean in front. Quiet gated community. Everything was spotless and as described.
We’ve decided we’re more Leeward Coast than Waikiki people. Great hiking, beaches, and restaurants all nearby. Their recommendation of the Boat House was great.
Wish we had stayed here our whole trip."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was pristine, private, and quiet, and made for a restful getaway. Loved the fenced backyard and grilling set-up, and the ocean view from the backyard was gorgeous. The private community felt very safe, and was only a short drive to some nice beaches. Travis and Emi were great hosts; very proactive and responsive."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a good stay for a weekend. Travis was easy to get a hold of when we had a couple of small issues. Overall a very good stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will stay again if I make it to Oahu. Place was very warm and clean and in a great neighborhood with beautiful views. Has everything you need.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place with an amazing view specially, at sunset. They were very communicative every time I had a question their response was very quick. My husband and I already talked about coming back in the future!
It’s a very comfortable little place :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Travis & Emi were terrific hosts! The place was beautiful, nicely furnished, and had everything I needed for a multi-day stay in the Makaha Valley. It is a 15-minute drive to Waianae with a scenic view of the ocean and a 30-minute drive to Kapolei depending on traffic. You will find restaurants and stores nearby, and if you want to hit up Honolulu, Waikiki, or the North Shore, it is less than an hour away. It was a perfect stay for me to visit my girlfriend for the first time!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis and Emi are some of the most gracious, accommodating, and friendly hosts I've ever met using Airbnb. Enjoyed the beaches and hikes nearby as well as beautiful sunsets right from the back patio. Book without hesitation and enjoy an excellent stay"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here. It was very spacious and clean. The view was even better than expected which was a nice surprise. If you’re at the place at sunset you have the perfect view. 🌅 Travis was very nice, greeted us when we came in and we ran into him on a hiking trail and offered us something to drink if we had ran out of water/forgot to bring some which is very kind and appreciated."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a wonderful time at Travis and Emi’s place. The room (or studio) is exactly as shown on the photo, and it is perfectly equipped. It is in a quiet area on the Western side of the island, away from the big city. The view of the sunset from the garden is stunning!
Travis was very reactive and always ready to help and give some recommendations.
Mahalo!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"With attention to detail, timely responses, cleanliness, quality finishings and overall comfortable stay.. a place like this is what we are all looking for on Airbnb."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean place and peaceful community
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis is one of the best hosts we have ever had. The hosts went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed.
The space is wonderful with lots of thoughtful touches. They provide beach chairs, towels and an umbrella. The washer and dryer are convenient. The views outside are wonderful.
Notes:
- This unit is below a home rented to other people. We heard noise, babies crying, and people walking above us. It wasn't bad, but if you are sensitive to that, it's good to know.
- This is not to be judgmental, just honest. The towns of Waianae and Makaha are run down, crowded, and don't feel safe. Signs everywhere warn about theft from cars. Homeless encampments ala Portland/Seattle line most of the beaches. It's not the Hawaii you want to experience.
All along the North Share near Sunset Beach are quaint little beach towns, little communities of food trucks, and wonderful places to snorkel (Shark's Cove). Absolutely stay there for a relaxed, chill Hawaiian experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my quiet vacation. I was able to drive to and from with ease and the fact that it was a gated community really made me feel safe.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay. Very responsive host. Unit as lovely as pictured. Very comfy setup. Laundry a huge +. Location a bit out of the way, but I knew that! Would definitely re-visit."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is in a also rented house with a separate entrance. It is very nicely decorated and new. We had everything we needed. We also received good tips in the area. Communication with Travis and Emi was always very friendly.
It's in a different fenced-in community. The pool will probably not be completed until next year, which did not disturb us. The house is very close to the ring, you could hear the families in the house.
We personally didn't like the area so much but the Airnbnb is really great and we can recommend it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Travis and Emi were great host and very responsive. Place was clean and quiet would stay here again in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and functional space in a quite and safe neighborhood.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place and location beaches on this side of the island are calm and the sea life was great! Travis and Emil’s place was beautiful and well kept they also provide beach necessities chairs umbrella and towels! Wonderful beautiful well maintained home.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location on the west side of the island was perfect for us. Secluded with beautiful views. Travis and Emi have a beautiful place that is brand new and definitely worth it! We really enjoyed our time staying there!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing coast to stay when you first visiting Ohau and you want escape the crowd.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Travis & Emi were incredibly responsive & thorough! Their home was beautiful & the directions were clear. They were very welcoming in their communication! Mahalos for a wonderful stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful studio in an idyllic location furnished to a very high standard. Travis and Emi were highly responsive and gave plenty of useful recommendations for this, my first, visit to such a beautiful island. If only all holidays could be like this"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis and Emi’s place is extremely comfortable and looks exactly like the photos. Has everything you need to feel like you’re at home as well as necessities for beach days. Travis is very welcoming, communicates and checks in to make sure your stay is going well. Would highly recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great thank you so much
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were super responsive, very helpful and kind. The place is immaculate and is exactly as seen in photos. Private entrance and place to park in driveway was a bonus. I don’t think there’s one thing they didn’t think of to have readily available for the unit. Great job for thinking of all the details. If you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful place to stay this is the place for you. I can’t forget to mention the guard gate attendant Julie who was super friendly (full of Aloha) and helpful with directions. Great place to stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So clean! Beautiful and private. Perfect spot!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,certainly cozy feel & beautiful view. Travis and Emi stayed in touch and are kind as well as professional
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is absolutely beautiful. Checkin was easy. Hosts were quick to respond. 10/10 would recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quinten is an incredible and helpful host. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at his place and the nice recommendations and advice that he provided to us. He allowed us to check in slightly early and also provided us with food recommendations in Hawaii.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It's far enough away from Waikiki to be peaceful, yet close enough to get there if you want to go. It was very comfortable for the 4 of us. Quinten was extremely nice, polite and helpful. It was convenient to get the the East and North coasts from there. We had a great week on Oahu."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting us Quinten! Your guests house was very comfortable wish we had more time:)
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quinten was very good at communicating and the home was nice. A few things you might want to know is both bedrooms are upstairs (17stairs) and the only bathroom upstairs is attached to one bedroom. The beds were comfortable but it’s only a double bed and two twins which is a little small if you’re very tall. The listing tells you that but it’s worth noting. I would have appreciated a little bit fuller pillows they were very flat. His instructions and rules are a little long and convoluted but he was very good at texting and communicating and left treats for your arrival. The kitchen is a little limited on cooking utensils but plenty of dishes. Right off of the Noisey highway but on the whole a very nice place for a visit. We would go back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was amazing from our arrival in Honolulu to our departure. Quinten was in contact with us before we arrived and was very attentive and responsive during our entire stay. The home is well appointed and we especially appreciated the beach chairs, towels and even the snorkel gear. Location is great for exploring the entire island, especially the beautiful beaches all along the east side. We highly recommend staying at this lovely home!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten's place was cute and cozy and a quick drive from the happening town of Waikiki and also the popular Hanauma Bay. The area wasn't very walkable by itself and did not have much to explore, but it's main advantage was the convenience of getting to downtown.
Quinten and his mom who manage the Airbnb were super helpful and highly responsive."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had to spend a lot of time indoors as we came off the plane with some illness. The home gave us enough space to have what we needed to recover as well as a lovely neighborhood to take walks while stuck.
The value of having a private residence and the added benefit of a person of contact was super helpful.
Upon check out we left an item behind and Quentin tried his best to get it returned to us before departure. While we didn’t find the time available, I appreciated his willingness to help us out. That is definitely going above and beyond the usual."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my parents first Airbnb experience and we all absolutely loved Quintens place. The neighborhood is very safe and beautiful too. Tons of great eating and shopping nearby. The house was spotless and well supplied with everything we needed. We all slept really well on the comfy beds.
Also loved that we could park in the driveway. We’d stay there again for sure."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place was very clean. Quinten was very responsive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For myself and my son, this place was perfect for our mother and son trip. It was everything we needed. While it looked like the pictures, some may feel it’s not perfect because there is some wear and tear from use. But it felt like staying at someone’s home instead of a pristine hotel like place. I personally like this type of place cause it’s homey. Bathrooms were really roomy and there were ceiling fans in every room. We were there in a cooler part of the year so we never had to use a/c because the nice breeze flowed thru the unit. The only drawback was,the second bedroom was a little stuffy without the fan running all night. We kept the front door open when we were there and the breeze cooled the downstairs due to the screen door and the windows (it was probably around 5 degrees cooler downstairs. There were plenty of towels and having the washer dryer was great. Even with the windows open at night it was quiet unlike some neighborhoods where there is street noise."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication by Quinten. Good location and quiet neighborhood
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the amenities and beach! next time we will certainly consider this home!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our vacation in Oahu was perfect! From the time we booked our trip, throughout our time at Quinten’s place, communication was excellent. We felt right at home during our stay. Quinten’s recommendations were exceptional. The home was well stocked in the kitchen and bathrooms as well as the many beach toys; very spacious rooms, as well as a safe and quiet neighborhood! We loved Quinten’s friendly cats who came by to say hello."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Highly recommend staying at Hale Wa’a! Quinten & Elaine were very helpful and friendly! Felt right at home staying with them. Beautiful home, exactly what was on the pictures but in person it’s even better!
They were really accommodating, especially since we had our dog staying with us. They were so kind to allow my other half and I go out on a date while our pup stayed with them at the guest house. Magical experience here! 10/10 recommend for anyone looking for an amazing place to stay with stunning views of a great location, beautiful sunrise view and just overall guest experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family loved our stay at Quinten's place - it was perfect for us. The guest home was set up with everything we needed and very comfortable. Quinten was the quintessential host! All the important things were there to greet us...coffee, chocolate, water, lots of recommendations! He was so helpful before, during and after our stay. Very communicative. The guest house is well cared for, the neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful and we found the location super convenient to explore the island. We enjoyed coming ""home"" to a calm place after a full day of activity. I would absolutely stay again if we have the opportunity to return to Oahu! Thanks Quinten!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten’s place is a must stay! Great location, super clean house, and great amenities! Quinten is very responsive and had some great recommendations for just about everything. Would recommend to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay! Quinten was very easy to work with, friendly and responsive to any problems. Would 100% come back. It was a dream."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay, it was perfect for two couples. Spacious. Host was super helpful w recommendations. Love the location and beaches nearby! Would stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hale Wa'a had everything necessary for our trip and Quinten was just a text away for any issues or questions. the unit was very clean and everything worked well.
the unit is outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown Honolulu/Waikiki, which is exactly what we wanted."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the lovely place, hosts were very nice and responsive. The place matched the description, it’s great for family stay in a quiet nice neighborhood."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this place if you can! Not only was this a wonderful place to stay, his communication went above and beyond. It made things so much easier and made our stay as pleasant as could be. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home is great for families visiting the island. Host offered kid stuff that made our trip go smoothly with the kiddos. Do read the rules closely as they are followed.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Located in a quiet and beautiful community, easy to everywhere. The house is clean and tidy. Thank you Quinten for your host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten was an amazing host! Accommodated us so last minute and even left a Halloween treat for my daughters! And loved how he decorated his home with Halloween decorations, made us feel right at home! We loved staying so much we already booked for next year when we come back to paddle. Thank you again Quinten!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I needed a place that accepted a dog (fairly small-16 lbs.). The location of the house was great, as it was near my parents house. I knew the neighborhood was quiet, and that it was safe to walk my dog around the area. The house was easy to find and it met our needs. Quinten and Elaine were nice and it was easy to contact Quinten when I had questions."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We just had a wonderful stay at Quinten's place. It was the perfect location for our needs with plenty of space for four adults and room for our Honolulu relatives to visit. The kitchen had pretty much everything we needed including coffee and tea bags. There were coolers and beach equipment available to borrow. The ocean is visible from the master bedroom lanai, and you can see the sunrise from the other window in the room. If rain isn't in the forecast and there's a breeze, turn off the a/c and open the windows. Even on 80-degree days, the room was comfortable. Quinten left information in the kitchen with suggestions for beaches to visit and restaurants to try, which was appreciated. He was quick to answer questions and really made us feel at home. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place and very responsive host! The house is clean and well equipped. They even have snorkeling gears, fins and beach chairs for you to borrow! Located about 15 min drive from Hanauma Bay, Moana Falls, Honolulu’s nearby attractions like Diamond Head, A La Mona Shopping Mail and Magic Island Beach Park! The nearby beach, which we didn’t go bc it’s across the main highway. For those who are used to central ACs, there is not one. There is a mini split downstairs and window units in the bedrooms upstairs, which you cannot adjust lower than 73 degree and the window units make loud noise. We did enjoy having the fresh air for a short moment without central AC though!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a happy vacation with our family of five in a pretty house located in a beautiful quiet neighbourhood.😊
The two hosts in the hat relationship take care of it, and they're both very kind and they reply very quickly. And he was staying in the house right next door. He lent me free snorkeling equipment, umbrella, chairs, beach towels, etc., and several board games were prepared, so I had fun with my family ~
On the last check-out day, Quinten came to see and even bought me bread for breakfast. It's a 15-minute drive to downtown👍 Waikiki, and the market is nearby. I think this is the best place to stay in Honolulu!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time. The house is situated perfect off the main road to help us start our many adventures. Elaine was wonderful and I consider her a friend now. She even got me a birthday cake. 😀 I plan on going back with my kids and will definitely stay there again. If you want a nice quiet place to stay in between your excursions, this is it. Thanks again Elaine and hope to talk to you soon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent host, very accommodative and gave us things that we asked for. Hope to visit again soon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was just amazing, really happy to have chosen Hale Wa'a with Elaine and Quinten. So kind, lovely and supportive. Kids loved the house and we immediately felt as home. Thank you both"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed the location and its proximity to places like Waikiki and Hanauma Bay. The house is well equipped and the access to beach gear was awesome. We had 5 people stay here and the accommodations more than fit us all.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family had a wonderful stay here and We absolutely loved everything! Quinten and Elaine were also very kind and friendly, and they always quickly responded my requests and questions. We highly recommend staying here :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice and spacious property for a family stay. Quiet area with beach view. Quiten was such a kind host with speedy reply and nice recommendations in the area. Also very much enjoyed chatting with Elaine. She is so good with children😍😍i wish to visit there again again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten and Elaine were very accommodating, considerate, friendly, and flexible. They had everything we could have needed during our stay from beach gear to baby gear, including a changing pad! I especially loved the feel around the home; they have some beautiful plants all around the outside. The home is just outside the busy city, close to a great park for kids and shopping and food just down the road."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family loved our stay at Quinten's! Very clean and had all the amenities! The location was great for us to go on adventures on land and in the ocean and close to the airport. We'd love to stay there again!!! We've met Quinten and he is very nice and we really enjoyed talking to him.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten’s guest house is 100 out of 10.
1. Such a nice and perfect house. Inside and outside. Nice location and very easy to park without cost (not like hotels).
2. Every time I asked something, Quinten answers really sweet and quickly. And He’s family, including cats and dog, so nice!
3. Very clean and neat. They set all the stuff for guest’s convenience.
We really enjoyed our vacation while staying this house and hope to be there soon. Thank you for your hospitality. ☺️
감사합니다."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"He was kind and answered right away, and it was really nice."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Family and I absolutely loved Quinten’s place. Quinten and his Mother live in the main house and the guest house of course is in the back. One morning, as I was loading our vehicle for one of our adventures, I ran into Quinten and he came up to me to introduce himself. He’s very friendly and super sweet just his Mother Elaine. They’re very informative. Mahalo! Quintien and Elaine, you have a beautiful home.
This home is exactly like the listing and more. It’s spotless and very modern. Made us feel right at home.
The house has everything. From sunscreen, ice chest, grocery bags to go shopping, to things other Airbnbs don’t provide to their guests. Not sure if the listing has a wheelchair ramp on it’s list for guests that need it because of a disability or simply easy access for all your luggage. I personally appreciated that ramp. Loved it.
My family and I would definitely stay here again in the future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Quinten’s with our 2 little girls (1 and 3 years old) Quinten and co were incredibly pleasant, thoughtful and proactive. As a family traveling with two little kids the high chair, travel crib, baby shampoo, baby bath, etc left out for us were so helpful. The place itself is much larger than we had expected and is just a 2 minute walk from a huge grassy field and playground (though it’s for older kids than ours). We found the entire place to be well stocked with conveniences we would have never thought to ask about. Would definitely stay again next time we’re visiting family in the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We wished we were staying longer at Quentin’s place! It was cozy, clean, well-stocked, and had comfy beds. He was responsive and accommodating. He even stored our luggage before check in time. My kids kept saying, “Quentin is so nice!” We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our Holidays at this lovely place. Quinten und Elaine were so hospitable and we felt very much at home. Our kids loved all the Cats and the Turtle (flash) and especially the dog, in Elaines beautiful garden. The house was clean and comfortable for us, just perfect for our little family. We would definitely like to come back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, it was really a beautiful and relaxing Airbnb that exceeded our expectations! The pretty house is in a safe and quiet neighborhood, so I had a comfortable stay. The house was clean and had everything I needed. I was so happy that the scenery outside the window was exactly as I imagined the Hawaiian scenery! The beach is a five-minute walk across the main street right in front of the house. Even Waikiki and Hanauma Bay are 10 minutes away by car, so it was convenient, and supermarkets and eateries are all within easy driving distance. Most of all, the host Quinten was very friendly and communicative while we were there, so I was able to stay comfortably without any difficulty. Definitely a place I want to go back next time! Highly recommended!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quentine's place was wonderful! It was well equipped with everything we could need. Quentin responded very fast to any questions we had and was very helpful, kind and accommodating. We would love to stay at his place again when we visit Oahu!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My parents and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at Quinten’s place! First of all, Quinten went above & beyond to let us check in 2 hours early - thank you! I was worries about finding a spot for my elderly parents to wait until normal check-in time.
The guest house is a very calm and private place surrounded by lush nature (hibiscus flowers outside the kitchen window, palm trees, looong ocean view from the Lanai). Kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms are stocked to a max and have everything you could need and more. Quinten has a terrific open & friendly personality and is extremely easy to communicate with. The beach is a short walk away and very calm & beautiful! We loved every minute! Highly, highly recommended - we will be back! Thank you so much, Quinten!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not only is Quinten a great and very kind host, with excellent communication and recommendations, his rental is located in a perfect location close to the beaches, to Waikiki, to great restaurants… The house is amazingly equipped and also includes all the beach gear. We really enjoyed our stay at Quinten’s and would highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Quentin is a great host. Very responsive and friendly. The place is spacious and well set up! We will definitely return here. No problems whatsoever.

Always replied to text quickly and was very helpful with things to do and see. Had a flight several hours after checkout and kept our bags for us so we could go enjoy the day. Would definitely stay here again on another trip."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten’s place was very beautifully appointed and clean, and had plenty kitchen accessories for and cooking.
We enjoyed the lanai when we wanted to be warm and the downstairs when we wanted cool. 👍🏽
Quinten was very responsive at all hours to our needs."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! It felt like home and had everything we needed. Check-in and check-out was super easy. The home is in a quiet and clean residential area only 15 mins away from Waikiki, so it was a perfect place to unwind after a day of exploring. The stay is wonderful, but Quinten felt like a friend to us which made this place even better 😁. Would recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Not only is this a lovely little house, but Quinten made sure there were so many little extras and amenities that made our stay that much better. He always responded quickly when we needed help, including questions about the house or local activities. We would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quinten’s place is very comfortable and clean.We had a wonderful staycation.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really appreciate all the thoughtful details so we really felt comfortable on our vacation with our baby. Host went beyond setting out baby gear for us that made traveling easy. Really enjoyed our holiday vacation in Oahu!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's the best place to travel to Ohau Island.
It was an excellent choice with many advantages over a hotel.
I especially liked the communication with Quinten."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quinten is a great host. The place was well set up. It’s a great home base for many great activities and beaches and in a quiet neighborhood. The beds were very comfortable. We had everything we needed. We enjoyed our time there very much.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quinten was a great host, and made our stay wonderful in Oahu. He gave suggestions for snorkeling and where to go for Halloween with the kids, and was available for any questions we had. His place was a great fit for us with 3 kids -- close to beautiful beaches, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay etc. Grocery like 3 mins drive, many restaurants nearby. Highly recommended!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is very clean, comfortable, and quiet, and in a wonderful location close to a beautiful small beach where you can watch the sunset without crowds.
Quinten and Elaine were both very wonderful and helpful. Quentin is a wealth of information for things to do on the island, and Elaine was always around if we ever needed anything (like some garlic for a dinner that we were cooking!)
I highly recommend this dream home, away from home!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quintens was a great experience. Everything was like the photos and the hospitality was impeccable. In a great area also. I definitely recommend staying there!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely home
Host was soooo nice and we enjoed talking with her
Thank you"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you to a wonderful hostess who gave great tips and was open to all questions. The accommodation is great. We had a great time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Clean, beautiful guest house. Not for smokers though. Quinten and Elaine were super nice and accommodating. Definitely recommend!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Quinten’s home has modern amenities. Quinten has thought of everything to make stays enjoyable and responded quickly to all our questions! We will definitely stay there again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten was phenomenal to work with! Helpful with anything we needed. Space is exactly as advertised. Great place, great host!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely guesthouse with all the amenities. Quiet location, but close to Honolulu and easy access to all the beaches and attractions like Haunama Bay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quinten’s property was exactly what our family of 5 needed and expected (except the close beach). The guest house had an open kitchen+living room floor plan downstairs, which was airy and nice when eating or sitting around (although, we were only home at night). The weather was perfect, so we didn’t need to use AC in any room. The house was stocked with plates, pans, towels, and toiletries. The “beach” nearby isn’t what we expected but if you drive down 10 mins further, then you’ll hit a real beach (where you can lay out on sand). Close to grocery stores and Waikiki was a short drive. All around great location and worth it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quinten and Elaine are wonderful hosts. Their home is beautiful — wonderfully appointed and stocked up for every need. We loved watching the sunrise and sunset from the amazing balcony. Can’t wait to return!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great unit for anyone looking for a comfy home base from which to explore the island. The kitchen is well appointed and user friendly, the bathrooms are spacious and clean, and the views from the master bedroom and balcony are spectacular. We especially enjoyed watching the sunrise from the comfort of the master bedroom. The living room would be a comfortable place to hang out if you only have 2-4 people staying here, though it gets a little tight if you’re using the couch as a pullout bed for a fifth person. That didn’t bother us because we were out and about all day, but if you wanted to hang out during the day and have someone sleeping there you might be a little cramped.
In terms of location, it’s perfect for folks who want to explore the east side of the island but still want to be able to get to Waikiki fairly quickly. It’s less than 15 minutes to Hanauma Bay, 20 minutes to Makapu’u (great bodyboarding), and 20 minutes to Waikiki. It’s a few blocks off the main highway, so you can hear the road, but the breeze in the trees and the birds mostly cover it. For those who hate mornings but want the windows open, note that there is a neighborhood rooster. :)
Quinten is a terrific host, and supplied us with boogie boards, snorkel gear, beach chairs, and towels. We had five folks and didn’t have to buy or rent any gear. He also welcomed us on Easter with some delicious chocolates and other snacks that the kids loved. And he referred us to his uncle for surf lessons at Waikiki.
We loved it and would definitely stay again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an absolute wonderful time in Hawaii. The house was clean and very comfortable with a great view. wonderful hospitality as well! We will definitely look to stay here again on our next visit to Hawaii.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had an amazing stay and would definitely stay again! Our hosts welcomed us with a gift of local treats and the house had everything we needed. The location was the best, we were out of the touristy area of Waikiki, but still close to everything. Mahalo for an amazing stay! Definitely recommend !"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communicating with Quinten was always positive. I’ve learned how environmentally conscious Hawaii is and the rules of this Airbnb reflect that. For example, recycling plastics/cans and turning off the AC/ lights anytime you leave the house. The Airbnb was in a nice quiet neighborhood so it was important to not be loud at night. Overall great Airbnb location and price."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Quinten’s. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Location was convenient. Loved having coffee on the lanai."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed a little getaway, and the many amenities it offered!! Perfect location and wonderful hosts."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful beach cottage stocked with everything one might need. We stayed over Christmas and the cottage was decorated with a Christmas tree and other festive touches! That really made us feel at home. The place is quiet and convenient to Honolulu and shopping and restaurants. A perfect stay. Quinten was available by phone for any concerns.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view on the balcony was breathtaking. Very close to the beach and I loved the jet tub!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quinten is a fantastic host and his place is perfect for a stay for a group of 4!
Quinten was always super responsive in any questions that I had and also keeping us informed when anything happened. There was a short power outage which we were not home for, but he kept us in the loop which was amazing since we could plan accordingly if anything happened. On top of that he gave a lot of wonderful suggestions around the area and lent us some snorkeling equipment. He also left some really nice touches, like a lei, a guidebook and some treats! He was always great to talk to and is an amazing host!
The place was also really nice with all the things we needed for a 1 week stay. Having 2 bathrooms was a really nice plus. We had no issues with anything in the place and found the rooms very comfortable, with enough space for the 4 of us. The master bedroom was very spacious and has an amazing bathroom. It was easy getting in an out of and there was a parking spot for us with easy access to the guest house. The area was also amazing as it was just a few minutes outside Waikiki and it was nice and quite. There is also a park just a short walk away so that was a plus if you needed some running space.
I experienced a very clean place with great communication from the host in a very nice location. I highly recommended Quinten as a host and his place for a nice quite and spacious stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time at this location. The apartment was beautiful and no details were skipped in providing a great stay. Very clean with beautiful beach decor. Plenty of towels, jacuzzi tub with nice shower and all the items needed in case U forgot something. Neighborhood was peaceful and location terrific for touring around multiple beaches. All around a great stay and definitely recommend ."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"LOVELY GUEST HOUSE
Wonderful stay and great host. Very clean and well appointed. Host provided a welcome basket of goodies. He was very flexible and helpful on checking in (allowed us to drop off luggage early). Was very responsive to any questions. Loved the peaceful beach decor. Highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Quintin’s. The location was perfect. I loved the lanai off the master bedroom with the 95 degree view of the ocean. There were many thoughtful touches to make us feel welcome. Huge master bathroom with lots of fans and open windows. The beds were incredibly comfortable. We will definitely stay at Quintin’s again! Mahalo nui!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten and Elaine are fantastic host. We stayed in Waikiki for 2 weeks and decided to experience the suburbs for our last week and turns out to be a great decision. The house location is in a good neighborhood, easy access high way, but quiet enough to open window to sleep. Love being wake up by the birds in the morning! There is a park 3 minutes walk away and you can also walk to a local beach about 7 min away (though you need to walk on the side of a busy highway). The house is clean and as expected. My daughter love their cat Yuki and their pet turtle ‘flash’ :). Sometime their neighbors’ cats will drop by and say Hi! We will stay there again if visit Oahu."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hosts were fantastic! We also loved the location and accommodations.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Elaine's place along with her hospitality were both top notch. Having a local feel at a comfortable beach house with all the beach necessities was perfect for our family of four. Highly recommend.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for your hospitality. We had a great time. Perfect location. Everything was perfect for our stay, plenty of towels and supplies. Super clean. I would stay here again.!! Thank you Quinten"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten went above and beyond what you would expect from a host, as far as setting up a pack n play, a blow up mattress, and leaving fruit/snacks on the table for a welcome gift. We appreciated Quinten's effort. We used this little home as a base to visit our family in Hawaii Kai. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood, close to shopping/coffee. We appreciated how easy it was to get to Honolulu and the airport. We had three adults in our party, and two babies. So, we had one adult sleeping downstairs in the living room. We also used the deck one evening to have drinks and dinner, and we could just see the ocean from the patio view, which made it fun. I recommend this place as centrally located, clean, and quiet."
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quentin and Elaine were very friendly and very hospitable! Iced lemon water on a hot day ready is definitely refreshing with fruits, snacks, and tea available. They also provided recommendations to locations around the place. The hosts are very accommodating to the needs of the guests! Would definitely like to visit again !"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A true home away from home! Will book with Quinten for my next trip. Exactly as advertised!
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thanks, Quinten & Elaine, for being such great hosts! We really enjoyed our stay at Hale Wa’a! The location was the perfect place to serve as our home base while exploring Oahu. We felt very safe and having our own parking spot was so convenient. You provided all of the necessary amenities and then some! Your special touches, such as the fresh fruit, local chocolates, lemon water, water toys, beach towels and even a Christmas tree - were much appreciated! We would definitely recommend staying at Hale Wa’a! Mahalo!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was great! Very clean and there were a lot of nice touches! A Christmas tree was set up for the holidays. The hosts welcomed us and were really responsive to our questions. I highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten and Elaine were so helpful and their guest house was perfect for our family of 4! We had a blast. The food, hike, and beach recommendations were on point. We loved that we had all the beach and snorkel gear available and didn’t have to worry about packing it. Plenty of towels! We arrived to fresh fruit, lemon water, Hawaiian chips, and candies. You can’t beat two showers, 2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, living room, balcony with a view, and a parking space! We would come back in a heart beat. Tastefully decorated! We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quinten was a great host! The property was truly a home away from home. It was perfect for a family of 3 and in a prime location close to a beach that's not as crowded as the main tourists beaches. Highly recommend! 😁
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful and very clean. Quinton and Elaine are both wonderful people and are available at all times if you need anything.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten and Elaine were wonderful hosts and their place was excellent in all aspects.
Very quick responses to questions and both are very personable and helpful."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place away from the crowds. Great access to beaches on the east side. Wonderful hosts!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quinten’s place is truly wonderful and felt like our own little paradise. The location is perfect and the guesthouse had everything we needed and was sparkling clean. The personal touches and their amazing hospitality made for a stay we’ll never forget.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten was a fabulous host. He went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The location is great - close enough to the city, the beach, and other amenities. This worked out well for our family of 4. We hope our paths will cross again!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I stayed 8 nights with my parents. Quinten's house was the same as I expected. But Quinten and his Mom were the best host that I have ever met.
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hale Wa'a is a nice little attached guest house. Although it is on the smaller side, it does have 2 stories, 2 bedrooms, and 2 baths. We had 5 people and it spaciously accommodated all of us. Quentin and his mom are great hosts and made us feel like a part of their family, even down to inviting us to meet their pets. If you're the type of traveler that likes to totally be left alone, this would be a downfall for you. Our group was all from Hawaii and we are all used to everyone feeling like family, so this was great for us.
The house was very clean, had cute little welcoming touches (Fruit bowl, fruit infused water, and Mac nut chocolates), and was very stylish with a theme. Hale Wa'a is in a residential area, but not far from the shopping mall (Kahala Mall), the trendy artsy hipster town (kaimuki-waialae), and the tourist Mecca (waikiki). Its nice to be outside of these busy areas, but close enough to see them. It also is very close to the beach, which is easily something you could do since Quentin has stocked the house with beach chairs, boogie boards, towels, and the like.
For the price, you can't beat Hale Wa'a with the amenities, location, and hospitality."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place in quiet neighbourhood. Quinten is a great, friendly host. The house was spotless and we had really good help in finding our way around. We mainly used nearby buses to get around and that worked just fine. Rented a car also to see more of the island (recommended). Thank you Quinten, all the best to you and your family!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a good house, clean and tidy, fully equipped.Nice location, easy to go everywhere.Quinten is a very nice host, very hospitable and attentive.I also prepared toys for my baby and my son was very happy.I hope to stay in this house again next time.Thank you Quinten, nice to meet you."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great airbnb! Nice house with al the things you need. My kids loved the bodyboards and snorkelsets. The host is very friendly and always willing to help if necessary.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten is an outstanding host! He not only satisfied our every request, and answered every question right away, but anticipated our possible needs, gave us a ride and even delivered a couple of items we had left behind. He gave us some fruit and snacks on arrival. The place itself is large, has all the amenities listed, including a jacuzzi. A beach is a short walk away, and so is a bus stop. Kahala Shopping Center is a couple of stops away. There are hiking trails nearby."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was very quaint with a beautiful view and deck. A great experience and excellent hospitality. I highly recommend!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to have as a home base - we had two couples and a 6 month old. The home was filled with everything we would need and more so (beach gear, extra towels). Quinten was a great host and provided local tips and suggestions. The place worked well with a baby - he provided a pack n play and changing table. Everything was very clean an well thought of, just outside of downtown Honolulu. Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten was a great host. He made coming to Hale Wa'a feel like home, with special, unexpected touches upon our arrival. (I won't share, otherwise you will EXPECT them, and part of the joy is that they are unexpected!). We arrived on New Year's eve and Quinten was there to greet us and show us the place. He was very available to answer any questions we might have. The master bedroom has a lovely lanai where you can sit outside and enjoy the view looking down toward the ocean. The location is very close to Kahala Mall and Whole Foods (which my daughter was pretty excited about). She and I also did a great hike on Kuli'ou'ou Ridge nearby which was absolutely incredible. We had views looking out over the Koolau Mountains one way and then down into Hawaii Kai another way and all the way to Diamond Head. The Air BnB was very well outfitted with everything we needed during our stay-- and more! I recommend Hale Wa'a and Quinten as a host without reservation!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is clean and the interior is sea-like and beautiful.It is also a convenient place for moving, so it is recommended for those who want to escape the bustling Waikiki."
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is sparking clean and has all the amenities--clean bathrooms, clean bed linens/pillows, clean kitchen--it has all the things you need! it is also close to Kahala Mall, restaurants, and the beach is a 5 minute drive. Waikiki is a 10 minute drive. Quentin is very easy to reach and answers questions right away. He is so hospitable that he showed us their Maine Coon cats!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"In my beloved Hawaii, I always rent a car from the airport and enjoy everything.
The location of Kahala was great with us from such an activist!
My elderly mother is also with me, so maybe I want to take a break alone on some days, and in that sense, Kahala in a high-end residential area is safe, and it was really encouraging that the owner Quinten was there soon.As you can imagine, my mother was alone at home for one day, but it was helpful to see how my mother was doing.
It was very nice to be able to park in front of the house, and the laundry was very convenient.
As a cooking lover, I cook every day, but I have all the basics.
Glad to have a dishwasher.
But the ladles are too heavy, lol
The owner, Quinten, was very good, and the pet dog was really cute!
I want to see you again!
Thank you!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten was so friendly host and his house was ansolutely perfect for me and my wife and 3 active boys.
We stayed here for 6 nights and everything was more than what we expected.
My kids loved cats and turtle and enjoyed playing pingpong with Quinten a lot.
We would definately recommand this place and hope to make our way back sometime soon.
Thanks Quinten and Elaine."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten was super friendly and was upfront about the local taxes (we brought a check). This place is walking distance to a golf course, park, and beach park (rocky water so bring water shoes). There were a lot of games, coffee, chips and fresh fruit which was a plus. A/C upstairs, they are small old units but they do the job. The view from master bedroom is nice and wasn't expecting it. We went in summer and there were like island versions of ants in the kitchen, but everything was very clean so we didn't care about them. We were three people and were very comfortable throughout our stay. They have boogie boards and beach chairs which is a plus. Easy parking."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quinten and Elaine are great hosts. The place was spotless, the location was perfect, and they had every amenity one could think of to make this a perfect stay. We are very happy and hope to return again in the near future."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and conveniences of dining and shopping in a nearby mall.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing rental. The location is great, and Quinten and his mom are super helpful with places to go and things to see. It was also nice to come back to a home space and not a hotel every night. It was also a rare find to have two full bathrooms! Also, the flowers they have growing outside are amazing!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect in every aspect. The location is very Central to everything. A few minutes to Waikiki and to the East side of Island. Quinten was extremely gracious and helpful. Communication easy. Amenities were also great. Highly recommend this place for ease, value and comfort."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten is a very good owner, he will help you well, the house is well equipped, clean and hygienic, good location, is a good choice for vacation."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten was an amazing host, provided thorough explanations on the area and the island and even took my brother out to show him around. The apartment was super clean and on top of the extras that were mentioned in the posting, Quinten added other small touches, such as a fruit bowl, snacks and others. Quinten has equipped the apartment with many accessories that were good for any type of vacation and are really helpful. From fully equipped kitchen to beach toys for kids, small surf boards, a grill, beach towels, different types of games and a lot of other things that can make your vacation more pleasant and relaxed. This is definitely a good place for families or friends that want to enjoy Ohao and keep costs controlled. A few things to keep in mind (1) the beds are really soft (this was mentioned before, but thought it was important to mention again), (2) apartment layout - two stories with both rooms upstairs. Master bedroom has a balcony, bath and jacuzzi, second bedroom guests need to use the bathroon on the fist floor (we were a bit surprised when we arrived, however it probably would not change our decision to stay there)"
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quinten was very thoughtful and kind! He replied fast, and really tried to help us on lots of things. Very clean and quiet house overall. 100% recommended!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Loved that we were able to bring our corgi. Great suggestions for activities in the area. Quinten is an awesome host!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten was a lifesaver! We were staying in a different Airbnb and due to plumbing issues that were unable to be fixed, we had to leave and find a different place to stay. Airbnb customer support asked us to find other places that would suit our needs and message the hosts to find out if they would be available to accommodate us. I messaged him shortly before 4 pm and he responded by 4:30 that the home was available. Working with Airbnb to get a refund from our previous place and then apply that to Quinten's place, we were booked and ready to go by 5 pm. We arrived about 7:30 pm (3 adults, 3 kids, and 2 cars full of stuff) and were so grateful for such a beautiful and well-appointed place to be after a somewhat trying day. He even helped carry in all of our stuff.
The home is located in a pretty, quiet neighborhood. It has everything you need. The bathrooms had shampoo/conditioner/soap, hair dryers and curling irons and plenty of towels! The master bathroom tub was a wonderful place to soak after being at the beach all day. The bedrooms had comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets. (The master bed is soft...I generally prefer a firmer mattress so it was a little soft for me but that's just a personal preference!) There were plenty of hangers in the closets; the master bedroom has a dresser to put clothes away and the trundle bed in the second bedroom has drawers to be able to put clothes away. The living room has a big couch and the whole home is airy and bright. (Since the home is bright, both bedroom windows have blackout curtains which was so helpful!) The kitchen is well stocked with all the utensils and appliances you need to cook breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The only thing we couldn't find were measuring cups and spoons but perhaps we just didn't look in the correct place! There was a spice rack as well as a cups for the Keurig, a bowl with bags of chips, and a bowl with fresh fruit and 3 Easter egg cookies for our kids. And since it was close to Easter there were little things like Easter hand towels which I though was a cute and thoughtful touch. There were also plenty of beach items; towels, snorkels, chairs, and boogie boards. The washer and dryer was a huge plus. It is a small stacked unit so expect to do more loads than you normally would in regular capacity machines. Quentin and Elaine were available for anything we needed and gave us great tips for things to see and do the day we were headed up to North Shore. Our only regret is that we only stayed 3 nights instead of our entire trip! A huge Mahalo from the Walker and Wright families!"
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"In addition to shower towels, there are plenty of services such as hand towels. I couldn't even eat capsule coffee, fruit, and snacks. The host was not informed of the exceeding the number of people in advance, but he responded kindly without any offense!
After the trip, come back, take a shower, and have a beer on the picturesque terrace!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our first Air BnB and could not have been more happy. Our hosts welcomed us and provided us information quickly when we were unsure of what to do next in Honolulu. Our family loved the apartment, quiet, safe and as my wife said ""i feel like home"".
Thank you, when we come back to Honolulu, we will definitely look here first to see if they have space available.
You definitely made us feel like we were at home. Thank you again."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Quinten their house for four nights and he and his mom Elaine were very welcoming and accommodating, and we were very prompt in helping us with the answers.The house is as described online, it can be seen that the host is very attentive to detail, a lot of decorations are very Hawaiian, they also prepared welcome drinks for us, local chocolate, fruit tray (that pineapple is super sweet), snacks, etc., and it is his house has tools to go to the beach to play, snorkeling, etc., it provides a lot of convenience to go to the beach.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and thank you Quinten and Elaine for making our trip to Hawaii a memorable one and recommending everyone to stay!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are very welcoming and friendly, the house is fully equipped, in a quiet living area, good living experience."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't know if this is the first Chinese review of the host, Quinten.Our family of three booked a total of three stays in Hawaii, Quinten's house is the best, everything is fully furnished, and Quinten himself is friendly.Everything was perfect, would recommend."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quinten's house is the perfect place to stay!
Our party of 4-5 adults and one baby stayed here for 5 nights and everything exceeded expectations
The house is more beautiful than the pictures can do justice. It's located in a quiet, very pretty neighborhood with views of the ocean from the top floor. The whole house has a peaceful and relaxing feel that is perfect to come home to after a busy day of fun. There are plenty of towels and blankets to keep us comfortable as well as a nicely stocked kitchen with everything from plastic wrap to a cooler for a packed lunch! The sand toys and beach chairs were a nice touch as well.
But what really made our visit special was our host. Quinten was a stellar host. He greeted us when we arrived with a birthday cake and balloon for my moms birthday as well as fresh fruit, snacks and cold water for us to enjoy as he carried in our heavy bags. He was so kind and didn't mind answering all of our questions and texts promptly. Great suggestions for hikes and food! He even let us play with his turtle and attempted to show his cats to my daughter.
We will definitely stay here again if we come back!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Should say this is the best airbnb experience I've had so far. The house is lovely and equipmented and location is wonderful. Close to the bleach in East Oahu so that u won't have to see crowded tourists fill in the bleaches. Got several grocery stores nearby and can got supplies very convenient. But the most important things is Quiten and Elaine are sooooo kind and considering and easy to communicate. Quiten is so resourceful and helpful. Gave us a lot of advice and even help to collect all the trip information for us. Can't be more grateful to have the opportunity to stay here. Truly hope we can come back very soon !
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quinten is a great host and very welcoming! We received ice cold fruit infused water as well as a fruit basket upon check in. He also was very quick to respond to questions or concerns we had. The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and safe. The house itself is separated from the main house. The AC in both bedrooms are a great plus. They also provide beach towels, boogie boards, beach chairs, and beach toys. I would definitely stay here again and recommend other travellers to stay here."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you for a clean and wonderful accommodation. My family had a great time. I also appreciated the friendly instructions ~ I want to go again if I have a chance next time. Thank you.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quinten was a great host! Would definitely stay if again!
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Quinten was the perfect host and made sure to address any of our needs. The house was perfect for our family of 4 and we really appreciated the welcoming fruit basket, snacks and chocolate. Quiten makes sure to provide beach towels, chairs and snorkeling gear as well - very much appreciated. Having a washer and dryer was super convenient and his house is conveniently located to major roads and local attractions. We loved it. Thanks Quiten."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first family trip and staying at Quinten's place was a perfect choice. Location is close to many tourist spots (i.e. Waikiki beach, Hahauma bay, Diamond head) and quiet neighborhood. Especially, we started our day early so that we can enjoy the sunrise and it must be more difficult if the location is far from Hanauma Bay or Diamond Head.
The place is exactly the same with the photos. Home equipped almost everything you need, plates, lots of beach towels, snorkeling masks and even a tent.
Quinten and Elaine were quick to respond to our messages and we had no issue with communication. They provided tour information which was really helpful.
Home gets quite hot during the day, but it wasn't a critical issue since we didn't spend much time at home during the day. We had lovely days during the stay and definitely recommend!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great sheets and towels, very clean apartment. Great welcome with fruit basket , chocolates and snacks . Icy fruit water on arrival. Quinton great host"
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely clean place, but had a couple of issues. The host collects an additional 14% state tax upon your arrival. This info is buried at the bottom of the ""more"" section in the listing, and I was blindsided by it. Airbnb picked up the tab for me, and has suggested to the host to indicate that add-on more prominently, and I suggested that they simply build that extra expense in to the cost of listing, so the issue may be rectified by now. Also the second bedroom is for kids. The top trundle bed is VERY hard and I had a terrible night's sleep on it. I did not realize there was a second lower bed until the morning (I didn't know what a trundle bed was), and did not try out the lower bed because we were only there for one night. The lower bed was softer. The host offers to provide a queen airbed which probably is the best option."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I wish I can put in words how happy I was and am with Quinten and Elaine place. They are so so sweet and helpful and very nice people. Elaine brought us fresh garden mangos and let us play with her cats. The place was supper beautiful, cozy, clean, and very much home like feel. Location can't be any better and hosts and they beautiful house was more than perfect. Thank you once more and I will definitely stay with you guys again soon. Much Mahalo."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Quinten's place for 9 nights and we simply couldn't have asked for more in a property and hosts. The house is fully equipped with everything you could need for trips to the beach and making meals at home, even a rice cooker and ice-dispensing fridge (lifesavers!). The bathrooms were stocked with good quality toiletries as well. Quinten and Elaine were exceptional hosts. They made us feel welcome on arrival and we had some lovely chats when we ran into each other. They were also thoughtful of anything we might need or like to have, like sand buckets, offers of washing beach towels, and even mangos! There is plenty of facilities nearby, with a neighbourhood shopping centre within a mile, a larger mall a few minutes drive away, a small playground a few minutes walk away, and several local beaches, even within walking distance. It's also a short drive (10-15 mins) into central Honolulu, an easy and straightforward 15-10 mins from the airport, and best of all easy to access the beautiful coastal areas in East Oahu, like Hanauma Bay, Sandy Beach, Koko Head and other places. We were really sad to leave, as we felt that we were almost part of the neighbourhood. Our son is adamant that we stay there again the next time we are in Hawaii!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were super happy with our stay here! Quinten and Elaine were very helpful, and Elaine gave us great tips on cool scenic overlooks and beaches, as well as local events happening in the area. We loved the wonderful fruit basket upon arrival - it was perfect after a long flight! We hope to return to beautiful Hawaii one day, and we would certainly chose to stay here again!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Both Quentin and Elaine were wonderful! Very warm and friendly. The place was spotless and there were so many nice little personal touches that made us feel so welcome. We enjoyed playing the games and appreciated the fruit basket, chips, coffee and more. Thank you so much! We just wish we could have stayed longer."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Quentin's place was perfect for our stay allowing us the opportunity to get away from the business of Waikiki yet close enough to enjoy the fun times. He was always prompt with any requests and helping us local information.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quinten and Elaine were great hosts and the home was exactly what we wanted! The home is in a residential area, away from tourists and about a 10 minute drive into town and Waikiki. There is a nice little park with shade about a 5 minute walk away when the kids need a break from beach activities. The nearby beach is about a 5-10 minute walk but you have to cross a major street. The beach is quite narrow but very secluded every time we visited. There were no waves which is nice for little ones but was a little rocky in some parts, so water shoes is recommended for sensitive kids (mine were fine.) There is no TV but wifi streamed Netflix well. The bedrooms are upstairs so I'd be careful if traveling with toddlers as there is no safety gate at the top of the stairs. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed for our 12 day stay. Our kids' favorite part of the house was the huge jacuzzi tub! And of course, Flash the resident turtle. This will be our first choice to stay when returning to Oahu in the future! Thank you Quinten and Elaine for being great hosts!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was the my first time to use Airbnb. So I checked (almost I did research study) a lot of hotels, inns, and houses in the O'ahu Island. I would like to list so many pros and few of cons.
[Pros]
1. Super versatile host. Quinten is young and good educated person. He has really kind personality and knows how to communicate with his guests. Even his family were so knowledgeable and polite! And he knows every small details in O'ahu Island. Me and my friends are crazy to see and play in a great beach, so he recommended us to visit 'Makapu'u Beach', 'Kailua Beach', 'Lanikai Beach', and 'Three Tables' (We didn't like to do tanning on the 'Waikiki Beach' because of too many travelers). We really loved to drive south-east roads with prevailing scenes to go to the above listed beaches.
2. Definitely, very quite area. You can drink beers and wines on the terrace (2nd floor) looking at the floating stars on the sky every night.
3. But also, this house is close to Waikiki and downtown areas (approx. 10~15 min with car).
4. Very reasonable price for two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Especially the bathroom with main bedroom (with terrace) has extremely big size and good quality.
5. Guest rooms, kitchen, and dining rooms are totally separated to host's house. Quinten and his family never interrupt your groups if you wanna keep personal place and mood.
6. They provided all the beach stuff such as tent, snorkeling items, mini board and etc. As you know, this helped us a lot to save both time and money.
[Cons]
** If you don't rent a car, it could be uncomfortable to go to Waikiki (downtown) areas and come back to the house. 99% of famous shopping centers and restaurants are located on that areas. As I checked, the last times you can use the public buses are between 6~8 pm which are too early to enjoy night atmosphere. If you never mind to use taxi or uber, this topic is not a big deal."
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Our family stayed at Quinten's for a week and it was central to everything we did. Downtown Waikiki was only 10 minutes away which was great if we wanted to go out to eat or go shopping. 10 minutes the other way, you had Koko head rail and Hanuma Bay. The location was perfect for our family. The place was nice and very clean. Quinten also communicated with us whenever we needed anything around the house or had questions. I would 10/10 recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was perfect for me
everything is clean, comfortable and the room has beautiful view !"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing views great spot definitely would book again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Had a wonderful stay for a month. Place was retro decorated (which we liked), clean and had everything we needed. Really enjoyed the large sliding doors and lanai where we spent most of our time when there. Great views of the ocean, lagoon, Friday night fireworks and surfers. Definitely a bonus to be able to view/hear the luau happening next door several nights of the week. The Ilikai is in a great location to be able to take in Waikiki and the surrounding areas. Janine was a great host!!! We will be back!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely beautiful view!
The place was very clean and comfortable, easy to excess.
We’re definitely staying here again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"AMAZING VIEW from the balcony! Looking out to the ocean to see the boats and surfers, and pools below; views to the Lagoon and part of Marina!!…was exceptional. Shower worked wonderfully. It is a ‘vintage’ condo, as listed, and nice and roomy to spend a glorious month of holiday fun!! Janine manages this property very well…very quick to respond! Easy instructions for arrival and departure…Thank you!!! We certainly plan to make a return visit!!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent place to stay again. Always my favorite place to stay in Oahu
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Loved staying in Janine's place last 3 months. Really clean and spacious studio with views of the ocean. Great for surfers looking for easy access to Bowls, Rockpiles, Kaiser's etc. Nice lanai. AC Unit was excellent and quiet. Ilikai is a classic hotel and well maintained for its age. Hotel lobby offers easy access to stores and restaurants. Just a few minutes drive from Waikiki and Ala Moana Mall."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place , we will stay again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We loved our stay - the accommodation was fantastic - great room and view. Would highly recommend. To top it off communication with Janine was fantastic. Already planning our next trip.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We will be happy to come back to the apartment.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location! Outstanding view! Right in the center of beaches, restaurants, stores, lagoon, and Waikiki! Easy to walk along the entire stretch of beach and great swimming! Watching all the surfers was great. The Ilikai is vintage, but wonderful! We will be back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed our stay
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location. Walking distance between Waikiki and Ala Moana shopping Centre, restaurants, beaches etc. Handy having the car hire place in the lobby. The apartment had everything we needed for our 9 day stay. The only issue we had was we bought a lot of food that required microwaving and the microwave didn't heat. and we only had two beach/pool towels for the 3 of us. But managed it well.
Overall I was very happy with the accommodation it was great value for money. Highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay in the Condo in May 2024. Everything was as expected and the communication with Shujie was very nice.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although the check-in was a little late, the location and view of the accommodation were good, and I was very satisfied with the quick response when the sink was blocked."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very comfortable stay.
Thank you so mych"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie place was very clean, felt safe and had a beautiful view. I will definitely come back"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for an amazing place to start our Hawaiian adventure! Perfect location, loved the food trucks across the street. Parking is super easy and convenient and an easy walk to Waikiki beach! Apartment had everything we needed and the beds were very comfy! Mahalo!"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This place barely gets an okay from me. I was expecting so much from this too. To me, the pictures looked way better than it actually is. This place is only good for location and views. There are great sunset views with the cityscape. It was clean, but the place needs maintenance so it looks dirty. The ceiling trim is yellow, gapped and poor look. Cracked tiles around the shower spout. Shower itself was stuck on shower, so no use of the tub for my 2 kids. Kitchen accessories were scratched up and lacking. Can opener was useless. That’s frustrating when you buy your food and can’t use it. Beach toys and chairs provided. This took all the little space in the closet. Our clothes were on the floor. No beach towels, just regular small towels. That’s another thing, bathroom towels. 4 people and only 3 towels for a 3 day stay. Nope. Didn’t like that. I like a fresh, non-damp towel when I stay at places with kids. Wifi and TV useless for my kids. No access to either. Overall: not recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Fantastic location, has everything you need!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shujie was a great host. Everything is walking distance …
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the price, you will not find anything better. This place was all we wanted and more. The beds were super comfortable and the kitchen had all necessary pans, utensils, etc. I highly recommend this stay, parking is near by for $40 a day; not a great price but it’s convenient and connects right to the elevators. It is about a 10 min walk to the beach, it was perfect."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay at Shujie’s Condo! The apartment was clean, cozy, and had all the amenities we needed. The host was friendly and responsive. Highly recommend. Thank you very much!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to rest
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place is an awesome fine Had the Time of Our Lives The Host took good care of all our amenities 10 minute walk to the beach very clean room lots of extras in the room like boogie boards umbrellas snorkeling equipment pretty much everything you need one tip bring a fire stick Roku don't work too good with Wi-Fi but that's not a problem if you're in Hawaii I give this place a 10 out of 10 definitely going back next year
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a perfect place to stay.
Walking distance to a lot and a beautiful view from the window."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very nice time in Honolulu! Shujie was always reachable and helpful. Very friendly! We felt comfortable in the apartment and could imagine staying there again. Mahalo!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Simple straight to the point. Plenty of directions. and holds the exact thing s you need for your stay down to the snorkel and beach chair for you to borrow for your walks to the beach. Kitchen was just enough so i can go to the grocery store and make my own breakfast and coffee in the morning before heading out. Though I didnt use them all there are alot of amenities, even a car rental place. ITs kind of a one-stop kind of place to be."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We where lucky to stay there so that we can see my daughter in honolulu marathon . Thank you . Aloha from big island Hawaii
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Only a 15 minute walk to Waikiki area.
Shujie was extremely responsive at all times! His proactive communication made checkin with very easy!
One of the best host in all our Airbnb stays! Truly commendable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great place to stay. Close to everything. Shujie was always responsive to questions & if we needed something.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Condo was in a good location. Easy walk to the beach. Plenty of great restaurants and shopping if you are so inclined.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shujie’s place was perfect for me and my family. My girls were so excited to find the sand toys and the beach chairs were terrific. The location is walkable to either Waikiki and Ala Moana beach. It is close to many different bus stops/routes that can take you all around the island as well.
Shujie was responsive, helpful and went above and beyond as a host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Honolulu Airbnb deserves a glowing five-star review. The host's excellent communication, clean space, convenient location, and thoughtful provision of sunscreen and beach toys made my stay truly exceptional. I highly recommend this Airbnb and look forward to returning."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie’s place was perfectly located and so easy to check in and out. Less than 10min walk to the beach and to a number of restaurants and shopping. Would definitely stay here again, no issues and Shujie was very responsive."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very delighted with the place, excellent service from the host 👌🏻 ⭐️10/10"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location in the Hawaii Monarch hotel. Easy access to food trucks.
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,The bathrooms had sand on the floor the paint is peeling on the ceiling of the restroom and sleeping area. It needsots of work ... parking over priced and no where to park just to take your items down when you arrive.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with a great view!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent host.
The perfect directions.
The apartment had everything needed.
Just keep in mind that they are few elevators for so many floors, so sometimes you have to wait a little longer than you have to go up to one.
I would stay here on the way"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was a great host, accommodated us with the check in and was flexible with the parking. The place was as described with a great view. Highly recommend. Aloha!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome and the views spectacular
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really appreciated the amenities. And parking while expensive was actually really flexible and easier to handle versus other complexes. The place was quiet and the host was wonderful. Thanks!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place exceeded my expectations . The host kept constant communication with me from the time I reserved the condo until checkout . Even gave me suggestions on rides from the airport. The condo was very cleaned and well maintained. The view is exactly what is in the photos . Everything was within walking distance. This condo is definitely referrable and I will definitely use them again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice apartment on the 31st floor with a great view.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location but parking was very expensive and pictures a little deceptive. It was basically a small older hotel room with bad lighting in the bathroom. Not enough linens and no washcloths and sheets were older. The beach gear was a nice touch though and restaurants were within walking distance. If you aren’t going to be staying in the room much (like us) then it’s worth it for the location and a bed to sleep in.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very amazing and responsive the only reason I give 4 stars is because of maintenance issues. The shower light was broken so we were constantly showering in the dark/ parking was hard to find and on the expensive side. The elevators were terrible, they took5 minutes to open everytime. I think just might be an old building but definitely not the hosts fault cause Shujie was great, just needs some maintenance."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good deal, great host"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great value. Beds were very comfortable!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, responded quickly. place was nice and within walking distance of everything. would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice host and good location!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean condo conveniently located to Waikiki beach. Shujie is a very responsive host and gives clear instructions on checking in. There is paid parking on-site (cash only), which is clearly described in the description/instructions. I would recommend staying here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location. Walkable area. Beds were very comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly like photos. We had a few problems with the coffee maker and sink, but Shujie took care of it right away. He was very sweet and communicative. Overall, great place for the price."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and clean room.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't be happier with Shujie's quick responses, the location, the price, the coffee, the beach items...wonderful experience!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay to be on the go exploring! We walked almost everywhere during our stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, close to the beach and restaurants. My daughter loved the pool and hot tub."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful no frills condo! For us, who rarely stay indoors, it was perfectly comfortable and had some beach necessities that made it super convenient. Shujie is excellent with communication and providing a family friendly place to experience Aloha the true Hawaiian way!! It’s located just outside the crazy hustle and bustle ofWaikiki, with small kids that was a welcome relief. It was still close enough we could walk to the beach, shopping and food. Our neighbors were friendly and everyone was respectful. Shujie was upfront that parking on site was very expensive but with kids we felt like we didn’t have a choice but it is very pricey to park. The building is concrete and reception for the tv didn’t work so at night we couldn’t watch tv. If you’re an indoor person that may be more of an issue than it was for us. It was easy checking in and out."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was excellent from the time of booking till checkout!
Very communicative and answered all questions as they arose.
We will definitely book again for future vacations."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! Everything was easy to figure out. The room had everything we needed. There were so many places within walking distance.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was incredibly responsive and communicative! No issues whatsoever. We walked to Waikiki every day-probably about 30 min walk one way. The apartment could use a little updating, one of the beds wasn’t the sturdiest but overall the apartment served its purpose-we were there to visit the island and weren’t in the room very much."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! The beach chairs and umbrella provided were wonderful and the location was great for walking to restaurants or even driving around the island. The building has a lot of security (people and key cards) which made us feel safe during our stay. Overall a great experience!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful experience overall with great views!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shujie was timely and super accommodating with check-in & out needs. The view was impressive.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location for the price!!! It was easy to check in and the host was very responsive.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome value!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The apartment had awesome city views, was clean, and had comfortable beds. The location is a bit of a walk from the fun, especially in hot humid weather but still a great value. We also utilized the $35 daily overnight parking offered in the building which is competitively priced compared to other lots in the area.
Shujie was also willing to help us downsize our reservation after a portion of our party had to cancel with little notice. We are really appreciative for Shujie being so flexible and a great host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was stocked with the essentials, plus some beach gear (towels, chair, umbrella, bag, etc.). The view was gorgeous!!! We got some awesome sunset pics over Honolulu from the room."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great condo, good location. Many amenities provided for beach use and cooking in condo. Appreciate the shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner. Plenty of items provided for our family of 4 for a week. Will definitely book with them again. Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Can’t beat this location! 10 minute walk to the beach and good shopping. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location and space for our family for four. Great communication. Exactly like we expected.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Convenient for shopping, beach, eating, etc."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place located close to a lot of shops and places to eat within walking distance.
The room was clean and equipped with all the necessities.
As mentioned by other reviews you do have to pay for parking, and sometimes the elevators do take some time to come but other than that it was a great place to stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is prime near lots of restaurants and convenience stores and even a laundry mat(if you don’t use the one in the building). Amenities where great they have on site scooter rentals, smart car rentals, spider car rentals and jeeps if you’re interested. There’s a bar and small coffee place which was great. There’s also a place for a quick bite (no sit down) place and the famous cream pot which Is more sit down dining. The elevator was good definitely read all the instructions really well prior to the trip its very self explanatory. Felt really safe, there was always on-site security all the time and I saw no rodents. Ac was always cold so no problem not complicated to work and no funky smells. There was 3 of us staying here so it worked out great we stayed for 4 nights. You do have to pay for parking if you like the convenience and dont mind paying just park there but take cash and if not you can walk to other places nearby."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was amazing we were provided with lots of things the room was easy to find and we were given a good detail instructions on how to check in and check out
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Stay. Great Place. Great Host. Will definitely repeat. All the things you need for your beach escapade is provided.
Swimming pool area is a bonus, where you can hang out with family and friends and have bbq or simply just relax.

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is very high up and a little scary, but beautiful view of city. Check in was convenient The host communicates really well and let us check in early. The place has all the amenities you need, nothing fancy. Full kitchen and fridge with microwave. The beds weren't the most comfy, but it was all that we needed. Close to rental bikes, right next to 7-11 for snacks. We didn't fly out until 1040pm and you are able to check your bags with security on the first floor for $5. I would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great room for a great price! It's not perfect, but well worth the cost and the imperfections are barely noticeable. It was clean, neat, and comfortable. We had no trouble cooking a few meals in there as well. Most everything you need (including the beach) is within walking distance, and everything else is just an Uber away. Every Uber driver we hailed was only 3 minutes or less away. Everyone we dealt with was friendly. We definitely recommend this stay and will book it again on our next trip!"

I loved that it had a rice cooker as I was able to make onigiri & ochazuke! The proximity to the beach was just right. Instructions were super clear and communication was prompt, patient and kind. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very thorough directions on how to get there and the check in process. Clean place with everything necessary for our stay! Overall we had a great experience

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was an amazing host and answered all of my questions rapidly. We arrived early and she even made sure our room was ready at our arrival time. The room is clean and located a few minutes walking distance from the beach. The kitchen has a stove, refrigerator and microwave and comes with everything you need. We made sure to take advantage of the pool and hot tub as well. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Shujie!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a must stay for anyone who is staying in Waikiki. The condo had all the necessities we needed and some. It was clean and the host was very helpful.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I came here for vacation as a reward to ourselves as seniors in college. We very much enjoyed our trip and loved the space we were given! The chocolates, household items (toilet paper, trash bags, paper towels), and beach supplies were thoughtful and much appreciated!

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Shujie’s place was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed (coffee, towels, etc.). Check-in was easy because of the detailed instructions. The view of the city is breath taking. It was a perfect place to crash for a night before our flight. It’s worth noting tho that the space is a little small and feels
more like a hotel rather than a home or airbnb, if that’s what you’re looking for, then this is the place for you."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was great! Got a great view all day long and steps away from restaurants and breweries. There were beach towels and snorkeling gear to use and parking was on site
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Initially, we were looking for something that was close to Waikiki without spending a few thousand dollars; that seems to be the case around Waikiki. Sure enough, I stumbled on this gem of a place that was within reason for price and close to majority of the things we wanted to do.
The place was clean, simple, and had a kitchen which was cool since eating out everyday can get pricey. Some of the best food we had was making food in the room; with local ingredients of course! Not to mention, Shujie was extremely quick on the responses when we had questions.
Anyway, if you’re looking for a place that is reasonable in price, close to everything in Waikiki, and awesome communication, this is the place for you."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shujie's place was definitely an amazing one! The view is phenomenal overlooking the city and hillside. I would definitely recommend this quaint and cozy place!
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Such an amazing place to stay very close to everything!

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the view from 31st floor. Good value for money. Close enough to everything.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable
2020-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The cost is what you get. The entire building needs updating including the suite.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice stay at shujie's!! It is a beautiful apartment with stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc. It is very well located a stone's throw from the main street. We didn't meet our host, but we messaged us. She responds quickly. She helped us with our search to save on the taxi and head to her condo. Everything you need is there. We highly recommend this property:)"
2020-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I walked a little from the center of Waikiki, but I had a pleasant stay.Also, they responded to my request for a little early check-in just before.Communication was very good."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is perfect, really well located
This is an old building but the room is ok, we were 5 and we were good
The bed are really comfy and there is everything you need in the kitchen for small meal
The self check in is really appreciated
A good place to stay in waikiki !"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"More than expected! It is about 15 minutes from the center of Waikiki. Great views, comfortable space, easy check-in, no complaints. If you want to stay short and explore Waikiki, this condo is for you.
I used it alone on a trip from Japan.The building itself is old and may not be suitable for Japanese people, but it is great for a short stay.It's about a 15 minute walk from downtown Waikiki, so you might be a little anxious to walk alone at night.There is also a 7-Eleven nearby, so you can rest assured of anything.The owner responds quickly and will be available if you consult with us.If you have any concerns, you can ask me anything."
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"For those who want an excellent location and service in Hololulu, our experience has been excellent!!! atte
Horacio"
2020-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a good location - close enough to walk to the beach but far enough from the large crowds of downtown. We had all the things for our basic needs. Room is very basic there are not very many extras (extras included were hairdryer, towels, 1 sheet set, 1 extra blanket, coffee pot -no filters, coffee, tea, creamer). There were very few dishes and silverware so we had to wash after each use. Beds are comfortable but small (full size) for two adults. The shower was a nice size and a good strong stream. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash and towels provided were nice. The TV worked well, just not very many stations, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway. Elevator was kinda sketchy as we got stuck in it 3 times and actually had to ring the alarm! Even walked down 30 flights of stairs one time to avoid the elevator. Halls kinda dirty, but it is an older building. Parking is 30$ for every 24 hours CASH only, but it is much cheaper than closer to the beach! Just a very basic place with basic amenities. Nothing special or grand, but a good price and a good location overall. The check in/out information is very clear and detailed."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night only. Check-in was easy, even though we arrive later in the evening."

Shujie responded very quickly to our last minute request, and the place was in perfect shape and check in was easy. The view of the city is spectacular from the room!

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was not only beautiful, but the location was also close to Ala Moana Shopping Center and downtown, which was great.Also, the view from the room is awesome, and this condition is too cheap.In addition, suitcases are stored under the hotel for 24 hours, and there is a famous pancake shop in the same building, which is great!I want to use it again."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was a great host! The place was in a great location, near Downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. Close to everything. The view was to die for! He was very responsive to questions. The bed was very comfortable. I would stay again! Aloha Shujie!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie was one of the best hosts and her place was completely prepared. Everything was in place and every detail was documented in the instruction. My family loved the place, and this place definitely added value to our days in Hawaii."

2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Good
- Shujie is so organized and very responsive
- Beds were clean and comfortable
- Nice city view with a glimpse of the beautiful ocean
- Fine to walk the 10-15 mins to the beach with the kids
- Air conditioning was so lovely
- Nice thick, soft towels
Suggested Enhancements:
- Shower drain is really slow to drain
- a drying rack to hang wet towels and beach stuff would be helpful
- A few condiments in the kitchen would be a nice touch
Overall, we had a good stay and I'd recommend staying at Shujie's while you're in Hawaii."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We spent a wonderful time! Great localisation and perfect hosting!
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This studio apartment is really cute and is centrally located to a lot of restaraunts. The host is very nice and the place is really clean. We were welcomed by a box of chocolate covered macadamia candies. We also had 4 bottles of water in the fridge as well. We definilty needed it. The view of the apartment is nice.

2018-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shujie is great at helping you check in, always helpful and the room is nice. The unit is in a quiet location away from the hassle of Waikiki so if you want to be close to the beach then this place is a walk to it. Uber was great to get around to do things."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location -walking distance to the beach and lots of restaurants nearby. The studio was clean and had everything we needed for a few days stay.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and room. Everything was sparkling clean. The beds are very comfortable. The Ala Moana Shopping Center to Waikiki Beach and everything in between are all a short walk/drive away. The view at night was beautiful. I could not be happier with the stay.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean. Nice view, Convenient location, walking distance to Aramoana shopping center and center of Waikiki shops and restaurants. They welcomed us with special gifts. Quick and clear response to question."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Kei's place. The studio is very comfortable and cozily furnished, so you immediately felt at home. At night you can hear very relaxed wind or water noises, so you can sleep great. We didn't want to leave :). In addition, Kei has been very helpful and always available. I fully recommend this place, especially for solo travelers, as the surroundings are very safe."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little place in a very quiet neighborhood. Close enough to everything, especially the Windward side locations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kei was a great host!
She will go out of her way to make me feel like home.
She is very proactive and prompt with communication.
I had a great stay.
Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very quiet, clean, and comfortable place to rest, very good location and with very safe parking where to leave the car. It is ideal for a couple who wants to spend an unforgettable vacation in Hawaii !! ... We will definitely be back!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great Airbnb for sleeping on our short trip to Oahu. Kei is a great host and went above and beyond. The location is safe, quiet and easy to get to various parts of the island. The parking situation was good."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, that's a really great deal. The location is very nice, with the car making it easy to drive anywhere, the village is also very peaceful and safe. A few hiking trails are nearby, but the weather didn't allow me to try them. Just a 5-minute drive and you are near the coast with enjoyable running routes. The place is small, that's true, but it was very comfortable for me, and I had a good night's sleep. And who would spend time at home while being in such a remote location? The only thing I would add is the small spoon/fork. I would definitely recommend Key's place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice and clean apartment, I would stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quite close to Honolulu and the eastern part of Oahu. Easy to find and get into the apartment, had everything we needed for our four days here."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Staying for the second time in Kei’s BnB. Great value, spotless clean, exactly like the photos. Parking space is great value, also the location, not far from the airport or Waikiki. Very friendly and good neighborhood. Definitely recommend the place and will definitely come back for the third time."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, great value for the price, the location is excellent the area is beautiful and quiet there is free parking, highly recommended!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were two of us on the road and we were delighted with the place. Kei already sent us all the relevant information in advance (location, parking, check-in, etc.), so that we felt well taken care of. The place is quite small but also very cozy. There was everything you need (fridge, hairdryer, towels, air conditioning, TV). There was even coffee and beach towels. The area is very calm. The place is perfect for exploring the east of the island. We were completely traveling by rental car. However, a bus stop was in walking distance.
We would book the accommodation again at any time."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"1 min walk from Bus 24 or 12 mins from Bus1L. Out in a very quiet neighborhood but closer to Hawai Kai and the East side. Private parking but if u dont rent car and no rush, bus is very convenient. Affordable and u get yr own private unit which was very good."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a comfortable, cozy place where you can listen to the stream as you sleep - plus such a warm, friendly host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei's place was cozy. Perfect for me and my girlfriend. Relatively small space especially if you have lots of baggage. We pack light so no problem for us. Felt very safe tucked away behind her house. The neighborhood was nice and a fancy foodland and starbucks within a 3min drive was very convenient.
Their amenities were as described. The bathroom was spotless with a nice shower. Beach towels were large and luxurious. Thank you!
Kei was very responsive for check in. good vibes all around. Only negative was a reoccurring sound behind the studio while we slept. I thought it was maybe an animal while gf thinks a mechanical pump of some sort. It wasn't a problem for us, but if you're a light sleeper, something to consider.
We loved the location for some amazing hikes nearby (12-15mins drive) in each direction. Close 10ish mins to Waikiki (traffic depending).
Kei's place is a great spot to escape the Hussle and Bussle of Waikiki while still being close enough to everything."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little small, but a great value in a beautiful neighborhood! Birds and animals are a little loud in the morning/night, but worth it to stay close to nature. Host is super nice and responsive if you need anything. Coffee and simple necessities provided in the room like sunscreen and bug spray!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great quiet area and close to Honolulu, hope to be back soon!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay again! Close to everything and as described. It is small, but for a solo traveler it was great! I do wish it had some silverware, but maybe I missed that. It was safe and quiet!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great small place to stay outside of the main city.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our 6 day stay with this host. The accommodation was clean, small, as pictured, and sufficient for the two of us. It is attached to a family home, so it was common to hear children playing or seeing people outside during the day. The parking was large enough to fit our 4 Runner. Perks included the cable TV, strong wifi, ample bathroom supplies and sunscreen. The location was close to stores, restaurants, beaches, and hikes. Near the mountains, so that that side of the island gets a little more rain than others. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great choice for your stay on Oahu! It’s perfect for a couple or close friends. The studio was clean and the location was great. I would definitely recommend it!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simple space, very clean and with privacy. Close to Honolulu. It may be a little too small for two people, it was completely enough for me alone."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place was perfect. I was traveling by myself to the island and this spot was a cozy place to call home. Perfect amount of space for the solo traveler. The place was clean, comfortable and in a beautiful neighborhood. Felt very safe and was easy to access everything. I will definitely be looking to stay here again when I come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The stay was great! The listing is accurate and had no problems during my week there! Thank you Kei!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and quiet neighborhood. The place is quaint and most of all its clean. The host is very responsive and I feel safe during my stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to get away from bustle of the tourist-heavy areas. Awesome grocery store down the street that has pretty much everything you could need, and the pharmacy across from that has everything else. There’s even a public beach park that you could hang out at. Room was spotless and comfortable, definitely a decent size for couples who pack light. WiFi was fast, AC worked well. Kei was quick to respond and made sure we were well taken care of. You feel like a local. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Kei’s place was great and she gave great instructions. Her place was in a great spot to get downtown Honolulu very easily. It was tucked away in a quiet neighborhood which was great! It was the perfect little stay for my husband and I!! Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, and sparkling clean small studio located in a peaceful neighborhood right next to a stream of water. I would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is as described and recognizable in the pictures. The apartment is small but very cozy. Very easy check-in. Quiet location with high privacy. Towels, shampoo and shower gel are available. A very good value for money by Hawaiian standards. We were comfortable and would come back anytime. Mahalo"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay! Kei’s instructions were helpful and thorough. The studio was cozy, clean, and located in a quiet residential neighborhood. The space is small and intimate but perfect for solo travelers or couples. Would absolutely recommend staying here!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mahalo nui 🌺
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good neighborhood
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei and Lance has been very accommodating to and very responsive. The place is a bit small for 2 people and its a bit of a challenge to move around with luggage. The place is really clean.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"One of my favorite spots to stay on the island. The location is great, and Kei is the best host! Can’t wait to stay again. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kei’s place is in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood.
There is a bus stop around the corner which was very convenient.
I was very comfortable there - it was the perfect space for one person.
Everything was neat and tidy. The mattress was a bit soft for me - otherwise I found it to be a very comfortable space.
There’s a microwave and fridge and thankfully I had some camping cutlery and plate/bowl as this was not provided.
Overall I had a wonderful stay and Kei was very helpful any time I had a question. :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and very nice hosts
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect little loft for solo travellers or couple! The neighbourhood is calm and Thebus line 24 is two minutes away. Takes 30 or so minutes to get to waikiki beach via Thebus line 24. The loft is clean, and the AC is a treat! Recommend Kei’s place to everyone!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The area this home is in is absolutely beautiful and not too far from everything the island has to offer. The neighborhood is quiet, but the style of windows are not airtight, so you can sometimes hear sounds/conversations from inside, and others will be able to hear you inside if you're loud. The driveway would be a little difficult to manage without a backup camera, but we had no issues with one. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here any time I visit Oahu. Kei was very helpful and the tiny home had everything we needed!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay. For two people a bit small. Absolutely sufficient as a solo traveler. Accommodation as described. Gladly come back. Quiet and private in homey surroundings.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Neat little flat behind the house, comfortable and simple and perfect for our stay with friendly and responsive hosts. Aircon wasn’t very effective, but host kindly provided a fan that was awesome, and we probably didn’t need the aircon anyway. Thanks"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei, very helpful When I return to Hawai'i I will certainly stay there again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely people. Very nice. This is a small unit but was perfect for me. It's in a local community so removed from Waikiki and other busy places.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Alright as a place. You should know that there would be a lack of dishes and utensils. There are no BBQs as the listing suggests either. Otherwise it's great and I recommend it 100% 😁
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei's place is wonderful! It is exactly as it is described. Very clean and cozy, perfect for a solo traveler. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet as well - although it is farther away from the downtown area/main attractions, it is very safe and close to a strip mall with some good restaurants (as well as a grocery store). There is also a bus stop close by (though the bus probably isn't the most efficient option if you are on a tight schedule). Kei was very friendly and communicated very well. This place had everything I needed for my stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We met Kai and Lance briefly but they were very nice. We were in and out. They were very accommodating for my husband and I. Had items ready for us like clean beach and bathing towels, shampoo, conditioner and body wash if needed A great space for people just looking for some where to rest their head after being around the island. Great location with a food land right around the corner if needed. We took a walk and there was a babbling brook, nice birds singing in the morning! We would say stay again! The price was great and it was a really pleasant stay! Thanks Kai and Lance!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is in a quiet neigborhood, just one block from a great park. It is small but very comfortable and Kei was very quick to respond to our few requests. It is also located a very easy drive from Koko Head which has some great beaches and better waves for surfing than Waikiki."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay with Kei . Perfect for two people on vacation very homey and comfortable she has so much to offer in this small room. She was very friendly and responsive she even did our laundry for 5$ which was a big help since we didn’t pack much clothing for souvenir space :) we will definitely stay here for a future visits . As far as for privacy this room was private .
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is great for a couple who packs light. If you pack heavy you might be shuffling your suitcase around a bit. It was clean and has the basics you need. My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and we were pleased with everything. The AC works REALLY well.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kei’s place is a perfect base of operations for a couple or single! Super quiet and safe neighborhood!! Great morning walks in the area and cool at night due to the elevation.
Definitely look forward to staying here the next time we visit O’ahu!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay. Pretty walkable location to the beach and foodland supermarket. Also some restaurants in the plaza nearby. Bus access is also there, can take you downtown or wherever. Otherwise pretty good place to stay. Seperate entrance, has a/c, bed is comfy, space was adequate for me personally."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay! As a solo traveller the size was perfect, I would not recommend for those who need more space to spread out. Easy to get to with bus #24, but check the bus schedules, it doesn't seem to run Sunday nights and I ended up having to walk 1.5 miles in the rain from another stop. It only took about 15 minutes, a fine neighborhood walk without the rain! Everything takes a lot longer with the bus so if you can rent a car I would, but if you don't mind taking your time you can absolutely make the bus work with this location.
Very clean space, Kei was clear with instructions and answering questions, and she provided some coffee and a snack in the room, plus soap and hair products for the shower. The worst part about my stay was that it was incredibly rainy in Honolulu so I couldn't do the things I was hoping to do, but I was really glad to have such a cute little place to hang out during the storm.
If I'm back in the area I would be happy to stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Top place. Everything exactly as described. Quiet location but not far to the beaches and sights.
Small apartment with everything you need. Value for money TOP. I'd love to come back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great holiday home base. Good hosts! Thanks for everything.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for the price. Would not recommend to anyone travelling as 2 people as the space is too small but would be great for solo traveller. Couldn’t even open our suitcases. Nice hiking trails nearby. Peaceful neighbourhood. Thank you Kei.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot in terms of location. Neighborhoods were very cute and quick access to several beaches as well as the highway to get to other parts of the island. Tad bit small, but I spent most of my time out and about. Overall, wonderful place to stay while exploring the islands!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a little hidden gem, away from the hubbub and downtown. It was an adorable, private space. It was a little difficult getting around, I rented a bike but with the wind and hills it was tough. The few times I had to Uber was quite expensive. I would recommend studying public transportation or renting a car. The only complaint was I had to “live out of the suitcase,” but there was no place to set the suitcase out."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and Airbnb. I would stay here again 🤙
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is very clean and nice. Even though the space is small, she organizes everything perfectly. There are a lot of outlets in the room so it’s very convenient! The location is great, it’s close to everywhere and right near by Foodland. I would highly recommend Kei’s place to anyone visiting Oahu."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Kei was kind and her place was a 15 to 20 minute bus ride to Waikiki and to Hanauma Bay . It was great value and her family were really friendly too. I only saw Kei twice on my trip trip and she gives you utmost privacy . Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT bang for your buck, especially if you're on a solo adventure like I was. It's got everything you need, in a fantastic location. SO MUCH to see and explore within 15-20 minutes of the neighborhood. I pretty much made that southeast slice of the island my home for a week. Kei was very responsive to my questions and went above and beyond for me during my stay. I know where I'm staying during my next ""working vacation!"""
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is a little home from home and exceptional value. It is in a quiet neighbourhood, and well positioned for exploring the eastern part of O’ahu. I slept well on the comfy bed and it has a nice shower."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei was such a warm and welcoming host. She did the most to make everything easy to check-in, easy to use, and easy to communicate with her. She is a quick responder and is always so accommodating. Her listings are gems and for the price I paid, I was ecstatic! I will definitely be returning to Oahu and will always ALWAYS check her site availability because this was nothing short of amazing! P.S. the view from outside the site is absolutely breathtaking."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value and location!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent!!! Very cozy and as described in the ad. Everything was very clean and organized. Kei is excellent host, always ready to answer everything we asked her. The location is nice and safe. We would recommend it"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a successful stay. The apartment was very clean. The bed was perfect. You had a good night's sleep. So you have to be Airnbnb you have to feel comfortable. Mahalo Kei
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and relaxing
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was an excellent place for two , Kei is a great hostess, I would absolutely go back again"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an awesome time staying at Kei's place! It is the perfect location and, although small, she has designed it very nicely! I felt comfortable and safe the whole time. If you are looking to book a trip to O'ahu for 1 or 2 people, do not hesitate to book Kei's place."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We bathed on the west side on various beaches.
Recommended is Sandy Beach, but where there is hardly any shade.
Kalama Beach was the most beautiful thing for us. Unfortunately, there is only a handful of parking and you have to park in the neighboring residential area. But it's worth the way.
There's still a lot to discover on Oahu, like the Dole plantation or the Byodo-In Temple."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt like such a local staying here. it was my home for 4 days and I enjoyed every second of it! Such a quiet neighborhood!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei was so helpful and understanding when our plans slightly changed due to military travel complications. She made our little trip so amazing and it was a great experience. If you are considering this place, go for it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A little smaller than expected but it served its purpose - a place to sleep and shower. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. There are many things close by. Kei was very accommodating.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very good commute as the bus stop is qround the corner. Nice place to stay if you wish to stay out of the town, the bus system is easy to figure out. I appreciated my stay, the neighborhood was great and people are friendly. The host was easy to communicate with and very friendly."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s service and Airbnb home is amazing! The unit is extremely clean, welcoming and perfectly located for 1-2 people looking for a place to stay on Oahu! A must see and place to hopefully stay at again when I return for my next Spartan Hawaii Race weekend!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb was good value and the location was relatively convenient for us. Our only issues were a few cockroaches scurrying around and the smell of the towels. The place is a bit small but we were expecting that.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was an amazing Airbnb, the location was amazing, it was about 15 minutes out from Waikiki. It was able to accommodate at least two people, the size was smaller than expected. But it preformed just as wonderfully. If you do book, keep in mind that it might be a bit of a squeeze for three, but it does the job for two. I would highly recommend if you want a chill and quiet place to stay while on the island of O’ahu."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect place for me! As a solo female traveler, there was never a moment where I felt unsafe. It was small but the perfect size for 1-2 people. Kei was also very helpful and kind. Thank you Kei for a great stay, I will definitely be coming back when I get the opportunity!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lovely spot in a quiet neighborhood! Super well set up for a solo traveler
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Kei and her family were amazing host and were extremely helpful. The room was exactly as how it was described. It was really cute and comfortable for two people. I would 100% come back for another visit.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was as advertised, great location, centrally based, quiet neighborhood, great relaxation"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is quaint but totally comfortable and everything you need. Parking was readily available at all times and we truly enjoyed our stay! Flawless experience from start to finish :) thank you, Kei for a clean, quiet, and perfect experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great location, private, basically like a little hotel room with private entrance and a spot to park off the street. 10/10 wouls stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I were super happy at Kei's. Nice and clean studio and everything you need for a stay on the Island when you're out all day. Mahalo for the hospitality!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great little place to use as a home base to explore the rest of the island! Simple, but great if you just need a place to relax and rest before leaving. Kei was a great host :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised! Small but sufficient, quaint and clean. nice quiet neighborhood. Would gladly go back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good host. The stay is a good exp.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and fast communication. Seamless check-in/out. Space is just big enough for 2 people. Clean and safe. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei’s studio was great! Definitely perfect for 2 people. Distance from Waikiki was about a 15-20 min drive. We found a beach less than 3 miles away. Uncles Clays is right down the street…a must to try! Next time I’m in Oahu I’ll be booking here again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy stay! We enjoyed our time here. Kei is accommodating and easy to communicate with.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Itty bitty, BUT for us this place was perfect! If you need space for cartwheels or a rugby game maybe this isn’t the place for you. It was a great home base for our island visit. We liked that it was in a quiet neighbourhood. It has a bar fridge and microwave. Grocery and drug store less than two kms away, so with creativity we were able to have some great meals in our room at the cutest dining table. Because of where it is located I highly suggest a vehicle rental. Would prefer a slightly bigger bed, but we made it work."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a great stay at Kei's place. Very small place but if you are on the road all day, it doesn't bother you.
Location is very quiet in a residential area. Right in front of the property, the bus runs along which goes directly to Waikiki.
Internet is super good. On the long time of our trip, we never had as good internet as here."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're traveling to Oahu solo or as a couple, no need to look further! It's a small studio as described, but Kei does a great job of making it homey. The neighborhood is quiet, yet the island's main highway is not far away, so commuting to your favorite spots is easy. The shopping center has everything you need or want in terms of food, I recommend some Poke from Foodland and Uncle Clay's Shave Ice. All in all a great place to come back to in between seeing everything Oahu has to offer."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described! Very clean and was perfect for our quick trip!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is small but has everything you need and is located in a nice surrounding. Kei was very friendly and helpful.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and it easy to travel to different spots on the island without too much of a long drive. The place was well kept and perfect for a one person or couple. It was also very easy to communicate with the host. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, we can highly recommend staying here when you visit O'ahu."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei is great! She has amazing response time and will help you figure out any part of your trip. The check in process was super simple and went amazingly smooth. The room is pretty small but is comfortable enough for two intimate people. The shower does not get super hot but does warm up a little bit if you wait awhile. Overall, great place to stay."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great small studio for me and my fiancé! Loved having air conditioning for the warm Hawaiian nights. Overall great experience and would stay here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect if you’re going to be out and about. Clean and quaint. It is small but we didn’t need anymore room really because we only slept and showered here. Great neighborhood and great little room. We enjoyed our stay.
Mahalo"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit was exactly as described. Kei went above and beyond by taking care of some laundry for me, coffee and a refrigerator.
The only complaint was not having a bathroom door or fan. That's my fault for not looking at all of the pictures! If you plan on parking in the driveway, bring a tiny car!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, small but has everything you need"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute and peaceful. The sound of the water from the steam is really relaxing. Super clean and beach towels were included.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little spot to stay in Oahu!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei's studio is very small, though big enough for two very intimate people. I say intimate because there's no way to get any privacy. The shower is in the corner of the room, so when you step out of the shower, you're in full view. Also, there's only a partial wall separating the toilet from the rest of the room (no door), so all sounds and scents are audible and discernible by all occupants! There's nowhere to hang your clothes, so expect to leave them in your suitcase(s). The water in the shower never got above lukewarm, if even that, so expect somewhat cold showers. Kei said to let the water run for a long time, but even doing that didn't seem to help.
The positives are that the location is great and Kei was very responsive. She tried to help in whatever way she could, but not much could be done about the cold showers. She's very sweet and if you can tolerate the negatives or if you're traveling alone, her place might be perfect for you!
There's a shopping plaza minutes away with a nice place for breakfast or lunch (Jack's), Uncle Clay's House of Pure Aloha (for shave ice), and Foodland for groceries or deli items; very convenient.
This could very well be a 5 star place for somebody looking for more affordable accommodations, but I think the lack of privacy and the cold showers kick it down to 4 stars for me. If it was only based on Kei and the location, I'd give it 5 stars!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really great spot if you're solo. I think it's little tight for two, but maybe that's just me. It's like the nicest, cleanest dorm room ever, except with your own shower, toilet and adjacent parking space. There are a lot of windows to let fresh air in, but there's also ac if you need it.
By car, this residential suburb is about 15 minutes away from Honolulu proper. I wouldn't recommend the area if you aren't driving, but I'm lazy like that. The neighborhood was friendly and seems very safe.
Kei is responsive and always answered my messages promptly. Though we never met, she I think she most be really nice because her messages were always friendly. The towels and bedding were plush, and the toiletries she provided were great. I enjoyed my stay, and really appreciated the great value."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value and location. Well maintained.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is perfect for 2 people. Perfectly located away from Waikiki downtown, it is a nature retreat. The space is clean and has all the necessary amenities. Highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and functional space in an amazing neighbourhood which is in the valley. I loved the location so much! Would 10/10 recommend this listing for solo travellers/a pair of travellers. Kei’s also extremely responsive and is very hospitable. This is my favourite Airbnb out of all the ones I’ve stayed at in O’ahu.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place in Oahu! Very clean and quiet. Super location close to everything. We definetly recommand this place! Communication was super easy with Kei. We had a great time there. Thank you very much Kei :)
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with our travels with Kei, She was great with communication and made sure we had everything we needed. The room is what we expected and had all the necessities. Great for travelers who are looking to use the space just for sleeping, as we spent most of our time outside the apartment/exploring. Location is in a quiet neighborhood and the view is fantastic driving in."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was accommodating, communicative and friendly. The space was as described and I enjoyed my time."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great room and excellent service! Would stay again, perfect for couples or singles."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with nice host. Room is perfect size for 2 people. Easy commute into the city and just far away to get away from the hustle and bustle. Host is great communicator and free parking is awesome to have.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei’s studio is about 15-20 mins away from Waikiki downtown which is exactly what I was looking for. There is private parking for you next to the studio so loading and unloading is convenient. The home inside is clean and tidy. There is also AC inside the home so it’s comfortable when you’re sleeping. I had an amazing stay! 10/10 would come back (:
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place very comfy place for two. Kei was a great host responded very fast, very kind. Not far from Waikiki and has some very great restaurants near by. I definitely recommend this place."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,AWESOME STAY! no issues. Great location and close to everything! The Host was able to help us with whatever we needed. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was very nice and has everything you need! I was very comfortable during my time here and would love to stay here again during my next time visiting!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is a great budget friendly option in Hawaii! Located in a lovely, quite neighborhood surrounded by lush mountains. The studio is perfect for 1-2 people. Everything you need if you plan to be out adventuring all day.
Kei was responsive and easy to communicate with. We will definitely stay next time we are on the island."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,GREAT place in a nice residential neighborhood. The WiFi worked well. Very nice landscaped backyard.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. It's in such a beautiful location and it avoids the heavy traffic from downtown! The room is just perfect for two people or less. Everything is very clean and tidy. Kei is super awesome and I hope to come back soon!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is the perfect location to explore the island from. It is close to the city and also to some of the best beaches on the island! Kei is lovely and very good at communicating. I loved having the Starbucks and foodland just down the street. It’s a great unit for one or two people. I would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei is a very sweet and hospitable host. The location was really great- easy access to all major sights. The unit is very small... be warned! We made the mistake of over packing for this trip, and paid the price a couple of times- Wailupe Stream is a flat for the light traveler.. ha ha"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, great location."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great! Loved the location and the place was really close to things we wanted to visit.
I would highly recommend the place to everyone."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cute, clean and affordable. Would recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, communication, cleanliness, and accuracy! I would certainly stay again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!!! We had a great stay. Just perfect for my husband and I. Would stay again !!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for what my roomate and I needed. It was very clean and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend for someone who plans to barely spend time in the room!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little studio! A little bit off the beaten path, but relatively centrally located as it relates to Honolulu and Kailua, and the touristy spots between.
The studio is small, but very clean and with all the amenities you would need. Kei provided beach towels which saved the day. Parking was super easy and so was check in/out. Nights were quiet and comfortable (with AC). Great value."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was perfect for our 5 night stay. The home has such a peaceful atmosphereand we could feel the love put into it. Kei was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in Honolulu
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was great! We had a lovely stay and Kei was super responsive and helpful.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay. The location is perfect for accessing everything. It was close to the airport and close to what I wanted to do. The host was incredibly kind and easy to talk to. The room is fantastic! You have a comfy bed, shower, minifridge and microwave and coffee maker. I would stay here over and over again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent value 👏
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect for 2 people. Very small and not luxury, but clean, and very practical. Everything we needed was there and they even had coffee available! My only complaint is that the shower only made it to a little warmer than Luke-warm. It was an overall great place for its value. If we were to visit Oahu again, we would probably stay here again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei was very hospitable. The room was clean and inviting. I really appreciate the amenities of having air condition, privacy windows, cable tv, and toiletries. It was a very nice stay closer to the windward side of Oahu and outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown Honolulu and Waikiki."
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value place to stay. A bit small, as others have suggested but I stayed with my partner and it felt fine. I would recommend staying here either alone or if you and 1 other don't plan to spend time in the airbnb. I would recommend this place to others."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location, great price!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice value for the price listed! Host was very friendly, as well as, the rest of the family. Only issues was the space was small, could really only fit one person, & since there was children on the property it was a little noisy in the early mornings. Other than that I had a wonderful time on my business trip!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a local neighborhood very nicely located from all the must see sites. Nice to stay outside of Waikiki
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, cozy, comfortable place! Very comfy bed and in close proximity to a bunch of great spots!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved to stay at Keis place. the area is really friendly and close to the center with the car but still not in the busy part what we really liked! also close to a couple of great hikes! Keinis really friendly, answers really fast and is helpful! thank you!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei was very responsive and even messaged us halfway through our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. She was very professional and kind! I would definitely stay with her again.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was as expected from reading the reviews. I would say that for what we paid, our experience was good. Close to Waikiki/Honolulu. Some things to note, the space is small, the bed is in the same space as the bathroom, toilet and shower. The toilet is behind a wall so you cannot see it from the bed, but there is no door. There were also ants in the apartment during our stay. Overall, you get what you pay for."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking to stay
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei's studio was perfect! It was in a great location near Hawaii Kai, shopping, freeways and beaches. Kei was also very quick in her replies and recommendations of the area. I will certainly return for any future stays in Hawaii. Great price with a great location."
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place for a single person. For me it was noisier than I usually like bc of the bread fruit and coconuts falling on the roof without notice but no one's fault. It's a family neighborhood so expect the usual busy neighborhood noises. Owner is very responsive and helpful. Be sure to double check pricing when booking. Centrally located, a big plus!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean studio in a safe neighborhood. A short drive to Waikiki. Nice place.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As this was our first trip to Hawaii, we had an itinerary full of sightseeing, eating, and relaxing on the beach. We certainly enjoyed our stay at Kei's place. She was very welcoming and communicative. We liked how there was a parking spot and we had a nice studio with amenities. We also liked how Kei's Airbnb is conveniently located to beaches and main tourist attractions. We would not hesitate to book her place for our future trips to the island. Mahalo for being such a great host Kei!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great hospitality, very nice very friendly. Very cute and cozy place! Great location easy to get to and off the tourist beaten path. Very clean, very accommodating."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice apartment in quiet area, close to bus stop, shopping centre within 5 minutes by bus or 20 minutes by walk. Hiking trails are also nearby, everything was clean"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed every second of our stay! Kei’s location is perfect for those who want to be outside of the main tourist areas of Waikiki Beach and Honolulu, but still want to be able to make a quick drive to those places to explore, eat, etc. The room was exactly as described and had everything we needed. Kei was very quick to respond to messages- it was so kind of her to check in with us throughout our stay to make sure we were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again- this place is a great value."
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Host is very nice and welcoming. Space is small but just what I needed for my time there.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Definitely a little small, but it has everything you'll need. With a designated parking space, away from the craziness of Honolulu, you can't ask for a better getaway!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei was great & I loved staying at her place.
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall good experience, but it was bit cold at night because the blanket is quite thin."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s space is wonderful. I live on Oahu but needed a space to study while my house was full of family and this was perfect. The area is beautiful with lots of easy places to get food, great beaches, conveniences, etc. She provided sunscreen, coffee pods, beach towels, shower stuff, etc etc etc. which was so nice! It was fun to hear and see the sounds of a neighborhood during my stay—nothing like Waikiki (which is a real compliment). Mahalo Kei!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place. Conveniently located to almost anything and everything you would want to do on the island. Kei was a wonderful host and always answered any questions we had. Highly recommend and I would definitely stay with Kei again.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It is a clean and neat place in the safe neighborhood! A perfect place to stay for the weekend get-aways.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay at Kei’s place was very quiet and in a wonderfully convenient location with a Foodland and Starbucks very close by. It was a small space but that’s all we needed as we were out and about on the island most of the time. We would definitely recommend this stay.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quite, and quaint. Perfect for us! Close enough to everything we wanted to do in the area. Thank you!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All is like Kei describes her Place with lots of little touches of surprises (:
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at the airbnb.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Kei's! Location was very peaceful and a great base point for exploring Honolulu or Kailua (with a rental car). Check-in was super easy and Kei was responsive and gracious throughout. I stayed here with my boyfriend and would recommend only staying as a group of 2 if you are really comfortable with the other person because the bathroom isn't fully enclosed. This wasn't an issue for us and I would happily stay here again in the future. Thanks Kei!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great to stay with Kei
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just as described! Perfect location if you want to be close to everything but away from the crowds.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei is a wonderful and communicative host. I enjoyed the privacy of a room all to myself with its own entrance door. Thank you for making my short stay a delight!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We highly recommend this efficiency apartment for couples. It is well maintained and in a nice location. At the front of the neighborhood is a nice grocery store, pharmacy, and several restaurants. Kei always responded to our messages promptly. We will definitely consider staying here again if and when we return to Hawaii."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place was clean, comfortable and close by bus to Waikiki. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting a place to stay slightly out of the city centre. Also close to Kahala Mall shopping centre."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The communication with Kei was seamless and easy, making our stay enjoyable. It also was ideal in that the AirBnb is in a great location near Diamond Head, beaches, and a little drive to Waikiki."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei’s place is very clean and very well located. It’s just perfect for a couple or a single person who wants to discover Oahu.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay. Kei and her husband are very friendly. The apt is in a great area for Waikiki night life, only minutes from the beach. I highly recommend. Great views from the porch area."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kei’s Place is small and has everything you need. Great and quite neighborhood. Our stay was amazing!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kei is a great host who communicates clearly and her place is of great value.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place close to Honolulu downtown. The studio was cosy and everything was perfect.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place if you are looking for some privacy and comfort at affordable price in hawaii. Kei is very kind and reachable. The bus 24 runs just around the corner which is very convenient but keep in mind the last run is a bit early. You can still use other bus and walk about 15 minutes.
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This place is cute and in a great location and Kei is great.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, whether you are a single person or a couple!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and small space! Lots of privacy and neighbors are quiet. Kei responds really quickly! We enjoyed our time!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great room! The location is just far enough from the busy and crowded waikiki beach which made it feel like you lived there. Great neighborhood and amazing amenities for first timers to Oahu. Room comes with everything I would need and a cozy atmosphere. Would recommend to all my friends planning to take the trip.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kei’s guest room was more than perfect for two people. Neighborhood is quiet and parking next to the guest room was a plus! We had no issues with the room and location was perfect for our itinerary, not too far from the city life. We definitely enjoyed our stay here in Oahu and hope to come back in the future! :)"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Appreciated the extra touches like the Keurig cups, and 1/2 & 1/2, luxe towels, conditioner and shower gel, etc. Effective use of a small space and in a nice residential area but with shops and restaurants just a short drive down the road. Nice to be outside of Waikiki for our staycation!"
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The only complain is the noise, everything else is a 5 star."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Place is clean, away (but not far) from Waikiki, and TINY. It was perfect for us, but keep in mind only 2 people fit comfortably with maybe one or two carry-on luggages, if taking more you may need to store the luggage under the table if it doesn't fit under the bed. We really enjoyed the quiet neighborhood away from Waikiki, yet the place is a quick 15 minute drive from the International Marketplace, it's about half way between Waikiki and Hanauma Bay. There's also a pharmacy, grocery store, gas station, and a couple restaurants nearby that make this a very convenient spot."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting Oahu and want to get away from the tourist traps of Waikiki, definitely book a stay here with Kei! It’s a small space, but has everything you need to rest and relax after a full day of snorkeling and hiking! The neighborhood is quiet and is fairly central to everything. I highly recommend a stay here if you are looking for a cozy space away from home!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, quiet and peaceful."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little, cozy place! We had a good time!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kei was very welcoming, the place is super cute and perfect for couples or single someone. Very close to Waikiki and some great beaches which was awesome."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and perfect spot for a solo traveler!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! It is smaller than some places since it is a studio, but we expected this and knew we would mostly be out and about and only sleeping here so it was fine for us! Beach towels were provided which was nice! They provided a couple waters and were nice enough to give us a few more as well! The chocolates they left for us were a nice touch too! The place was clean and the parking right next to room and off the street was nice. Kei was a great host!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a pleasant experience for me and my wife. Place is bit small but very efficient. Privacy and private parking make this a very good deal! Thanks Kei!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Beautiful neighborhood! Just what we needed for our weekend stay. Kei is a great hostess.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is clean and quite. And you can tell she cares and makes efforts to sever each guest. There are bottle water, chocolates, coffee & cups on the table. Room is not big but got everything you probably would need on a trip. Great for traveling alone or as couple. Towels are new and soft. I think they’re much better than those in many motel or even the hotels. The only thing is that the noise of the fridge and ac was loud, especially at night when you try to sleep. After all, I’d still recommend Kei’s place."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kei’s place is absolutely perfect – it felt like a home away from home. Kei is an awesome host! She is easy to communicate with and she made sure to check in during the week to see if I needed more towels or any other accommodations. The location is beautiful and quiet, I loved stepping out in the morning and taking my time to enjoy the view. I would definitely stay here again :)"
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a beautiful stay. It’s described accurately as a smaller place but the amenities were useful. It’s a lovely suburb with mountain views and a bus stop nearby. Friendly locals and a safe neighbourhood. Mahalo
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Kei's place for 6 nights during our time in Hawaii. We loved the location and were grateful to have our own place at the end of each day. It was a small space but worked well for the two of us. Although we didn't get the chance to meet her, Kei was very helpful and prompt with her responses to us. I would definitely recommend Kei's place if you want a quiet place away from the very touristy areas. Thank you Kei!
(Side note: the best Hawaiian food and shave ice we had during our trip is just down the street from her house!)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"we had a great stay in the yurt. we loved the beach within walking distance, and ewa beach in general was a good place for us to stay to take some day trips to other towns. everything was as expected and the hosts were very kind, we tried a lot of their food recommendations which were very ono. the only thing for us was because we were staying in the yurt with thin walls and surrounded by plants my husband did have some pollen allergies that did affect him a bit. overall we loved this stay and we loved hawaii."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great from check in to check out. Location is easy to get to. The beach is a very short walk that is in a residential area. Every morning we would make coffee and sit in the beach chairs and watch for sea turtles that would occasionally hang out next to shore. Staying in a Yurt was an amazing experience. You can hear the waves crashing from the beach. I was concerned it may be hot at night, but never had to run the air conditioning. Opening flaps and running fans provided plenty of cooling. There is lots of beautiful trees and plants around the Yurt to give a private feeling. Bathroom is only a few steps outside that provides everything you need. Dim motion light is very helpful when going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I can not think of anything that could be improved on. I would not hesitate staying there again. Way more interesting than a boring hotel room."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and enjoy the beach!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was cozy and something that was so unique. I really appreciated that they provided what I thought were ‘extra’ accommodations like a fridge stocked with a couple water bottles, sparkling water drinks, coffee grounds and a few snacks. In the shed there were all the beach essentials you would need and washer and dryer and laundry detergent! Pc was always quick to respond to any questions I had thru Airbnb’s messaging. It was too short of a stay for us but so beautiful. The location felt very private as well!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique accommodation. Very quiet, out of the fray even though in a very busy community. Close to public but very secluded Beach. Perfect if you want privacy yet close to outdoor and city activities and. I'd go back just for Michele's banana bread!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Resurt was even better than we expected it to be! The bed was super comfy. The yurt had a great amount of space. The beach was fantastic and only a few steps away. The bathroom was nice and just a step outside the yurt. The laundry machines made it easier to pack light. Parking was in the shade of the palms. It was easy to get in and out of the property. Property is in a good location and is private. The banana bread was superb and so thoughtful! The hosts are fantastic. We hope to return soon!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful little home away from home. The hosts were absolutely fabulous, easy to contact, and the room was very well stocked upon arrival. 10/10 experience! Thanks guys!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, tucked away in a lovely garden and steps away from the beach. Plenty of space in the yurt. Communication was really good and responsive. Lovely time and a great introduction to O’Ahu."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay in the yurt. It was squeaky clean and I was very comfortable in the bed and temperature wise.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was beyond perfect for our family of 3! We have a toddler and when we arrived they had the pack-n-play set up for us, and they also have beach toys and other beach necessities for us to use. The yurt feels very private and is surrounded by beautiful vegetation. We loved hearing the birds singing in the morning. The convenance of having the beach less than a minute away made it easy for us to get to the beach with our toddler. The host was great, and the banana bread was delicious! We will be recommending to all of our friends and family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was unreal for us as first timers in Hawaii, the place was so welcoming and very intentional with decor to layout to items needed for us throughout our stay. Polu-Warren was a very kind host and the banana bread his wife makes is chef’s kiss, amazing. We couldn’t recommend this place enough for anyone in the future seeking an accommodation that truly immerses you in the beach and trees of Hawaii."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were a little bit hesitant to stay here being that it was in a residential community, but I am so glad we did! ￼The landscaping made it feel like a private tropical paradise with the private beach as the backyard. It was lovely to sleep listening to the waves and birds. Very clean and a wonderful, unique stay. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,BOOK THIS PLACE NOW!! This was our first stop on the trip and we are so mad we didn’t stay for longer here. I don’t think you’ll find a place that’s as close to the water (20 second walk along the private property) and for that price. We were absolutely blown away!! Super private and safe. When I come back to Oahu this is the place i am going to book. Perfect for a couple. And say yes to the banana bread it’s absolutely delicious.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If we could give more than five stars for any of our AirBnB stays it would be for here. It was more than what we expected and Polu-Warren over delivered. The home was a perfect stay that started with friendly clear directions, very clean accommodations including spotless glasses, full products in the bath, a BBQ and even a good washer and dryer to name a few. The private beach on the property was a highlight at the beginning and end of our days."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for paradise in paradise, look no further than this lovely yurt! The furnishings are cozy and welcoming, bed is very comfortable, and on a full moon night, there's a lovely glow that can be seen through the curtain in the ceiling. The bathroom is detached, but is private and we did not have an issue with this design. Polu-Warren is most gracious in sharing the beach furniture as well as other beach items. A dinner at Haleiwa Joe's is a must. Go earlier than you plan for dinner and be sure to ask for a rail table. the view is spectacular! It's a long wait, but you can stroll the gardens below before dinner. Don't forget to ask for Michelle's banana bread, it is really good! We did not get to meet them, but communication was top notch! This was a real gem of a find and we were really excited to have gotten to stay here. Thank you so much, Polu-Warren and Michelle, for an outstanding place to stay. If we get to come back to Oahu, we'll be sure and book with you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great option outside of busy Honolulu, gives you an Island feeling"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolute blast staying in the yurt! The host thought of everything and was super accommodating. The space was clean, private, and beautiful. A very relaxing week and the beach was steps away. We would definitely stay again! Mahalo!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and your banana bread. Sad to leave. Mahalo! 🌺
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little place! Very quiet and secluded with wonderful amenities!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Polu and Warren's place is very well taken care of. The banana bread is very good. It's probably one of the best I've had next to my father's banana bread. Very prompt in responding/ communicating. Very friendly to talk to. The bathroom was very clean! The yurt was very spacious and clean as well. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Everyone has their own preference in mattresses and pillows, but overall, it was comfortable. Let it be known that there is a rogue rooster that wanders the neighborhood and will crow every morning. Sometimes, it's quite early. Other than the rooster, the stay was very relaxing. Access to the beach is superb! Overall, it was a very relaxing stay. if you are after a quiet stay on virtually your own beach, private accommodations, and nice people, this is the place. Just beware the ""rogue rooster,"" trying to escape from becoming nuggets! LOL!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I don't think I can give this enough stars. It was exactly as described. It was easy to check in and check out, just read what he sends and has on the listing. The place was amazing! Bathroom is detached but steps away and you're in a gated property so very safe and comfortable. Beach is a short walk on their private property and amazing! There's plenty close by (driving distance) and they give lots of good recommendations for food (we tried 2 that he suggested and both great!). Would recommend and would love to be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This stay was great. I am going to keep it simple and just do a pros and cons
PROS:
1. The location is key for someone not wanting to be in the crazy city life. & is directly on the beach (which people were rarely on) so it is really peaceful.
2. I landed in the evening and had trouble opening the gate I called the host & he answered and was SUPER kind. But check in was over all super easy.
3. The complimentary banana bread was so delicious. It was highly appreciated.
CONS:
1. In my opinion is a bit too pricy for what you’re getting. But hey, still paid it & definitely don’t regret it.
2. At night the area was SO dark. There are motion censored lights but as a solo female traveler it just wasn’t enough & it wasn’t my favorite. Landed at night and could barely see anything outside the yurt at all def was creepy the first few night. The bathroom is across the way and getting up to pee at night I always took out my flashlight. Might be minimal to some but wasn’t my fave."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 8 yr old daughter and I had such a great time at the yurt and just rolling on to the beach in the morning, especially with a cup of coffee and homemade banana break to see the sunrise, ahhhh~ I enjoyed that it is hidden in a local neighborhood and still central to most places with our car. Miss it already!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This stay is exactly as listed and then more! We enjoyed our stay and loved hearing the waves of the ocean from inside the hut. The host made us amazing banana bread and left us with so many essentials.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was fantastic. The beach is amazing and a perfect evening relaxing spot. The yurt is wonderful and the skylight is a wonderful addition. This was my second time staying here and if I ever find myself on island again this will be where I stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place to stay. The yurt is on the back of the property and access to the beach is within the property along beautiful trees and bushes. Very kind and friendly hosts, with superior communication. Fabulous local recommendations. Super comfy bed. Very close to excellent beaches for swimming."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’d give this property more than 5 stars if possible! The yurt was absolutely beautiful and comfortable, in a private setting, steps from a beautiful beach. The bathroom, although detached, was only a few steps away and beautiful. Having laundry available right outside the yurt was so convenient. If you have a chance to have some of the host’s banana bread, please indulge; it’s the absolute best I’ve ever had! You won’t regret renting here, we’d definitely stay again, it was great!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The yurt was great and had everything we needed. Beautiful beach. Close to stores and restaurants. We had a great time.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderfully, relaxing stay! Great location and place. Being outside the major city was exactly what we were looking for. Would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable! We loved our stay it was absolutely perfect! We were just married, and it was the perfect honeymoon yurt. private with beautiful surroundings, beach access was perfect with availability to wash up and had many different water accessories to play with if desired. We will definitely be staying in the future. Mahalo It was a beautiful experience"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the yurt was perfect. All the countryside at the driveway and around the yurt was our highlight. We were very safe, private and had a real holiday feeling. Direct beach access with sunrise, various Amenities provided, free parking directly at yurt... what else could you ask for?
Food options in the area are limited. We had super cozy evenings at ""D'lish at the beach"" with live music.
The hosts responded to messages within minutes and we received a super delicious job bread. A thousand thanks, we will recommend it to everyone!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The airbnb was greatly appreciated. As soon as walking in the airbnb youre greeted with the comforting and most welcome place. Would love to rent again if Im ever back in Hawaii!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warren and Michele were the perfect hosts. Their accommodations were exactly as advertised. We were lucky enough to be able to book a sailing / snorkeling 3 hrs excursion on Captain Pulo's (Warren) beautiful 32 ft catamaran. This made our first trip to Oahu that much more memorable. Oh yeah, if you get the chance to try Michele's banana bread, it's also 5 stars."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our first Airbnb stay- this will be a tough one to beat. Amazing location. Clean, Secure, felt safe, beautiful surroundings. They anticipated all the things we might need for our trip: beach chairs, breach umbrella, cooler you name it. The yurt was really amazing: great climate control, smart tv, fridge, microwave ceiling fan, secure close parking. Perhaps the best part: you can hear and sleep to the ocean waves. I can’t say enough great things about the location and hosts. Would love to return."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and absolutely loved it! This location felt private, romantic, and very relaxing. We enjoyed the beach, beautiful sunrises, and the banana bread was amazing. We went to several restaurants that Polu had recommended and were always satisfied! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with beach access, we got up early to watch the sunrise a couple of times and it was worth the effort! The yurt was a fun experience too. Expectedly, you can hear the ocean, birds and other noises through the tent walls"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We spent a week at the Yurt and had a great and unique experience. Polu was very communicative and we appreciated his binder with logistical renting items as well as fun recommendations for the area. We also loved being on the ocean with our own little beach spot. We were thankful for all of the items he let us use (beach towels, snorkeling gear, water shoes, laundry)."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described, communication and check in were straight forward with many recommendations provided.
The vibe of the yurt and property was exactly what I was looking for, peace, and space/privacy
Amenities were appreciated.
I look forward to returning one day!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the private beach for sunrises!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Polu-Warrens place was an experience staying an a Yurt. The place was private along with a private beachThe restroom/shower was just across from the yurt and very nice. Washer/dryer was available and near the Yurt. There is no need to take towels, a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, and soap. The place had swim shoes, chairs, ice chest, and umbrellas to take to other places on the island to sightsee. We would definitely be back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time I’ve ever stayed at an Airbnb. The host were always friendly and responsive. It was so beautiful and peaceful. My husband and I got married right on the beach and it couldn’t have been more perfect!! We can’t wait to come back and stay here again!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience! We loved our stay, definitely recommend! Very romantic, clean, cozy! One of the best experiences I've had!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing experience from beginning to end. Not only Polu, Michele, and Kawika are amazing hosts, but they also make you feel very welcomed to their lovely yurt. You actually feel like if you were visiting some relatives on the island rather than renting an Airbnb. The place is equipped with so many things that if you are a person that plans to sit and relax during your stay, you will probably just need to leave for some food and come back to enjoy your yurt. The place was extremely clean, and even though it is literally a few steps from the beach, we did not see any bugs! The hosts do a great job by keeping this place spotless. A++++ we can't wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The “resurt” was an excellent experience! My husband and I stayed at the yurt for our honeymoon. Everything was convenient, easy, and set up for us. The AC, the standing fan, and the ceiling fan provided comfort in the heat. The bed was ridiculously comfortable and we slept like a baby. The banana bread that we arrived to was extremely delicious and addicting! It felt very private even though it was located in the same property. Access to the beach was convenient and private. The only downside of the trip was that it was not long enough. We will definitely be returning in our future adventures in Oahu!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 4 nights and it was great! The ocean waves lulled you to sleep which was amazing. Very close to everything, would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Polu-Warrens listing was a fantastic experience. We could not have asked for any more from the hosts.
The accommodation itself matched the photos and descriptions exactly. The overall experience ran smoothly due to the clear instruction of the host.
We would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy and relaxing place right by the beach
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a great yurt! Fantastic glamping with great views! Very quick to fix the air conditioner and enjoyed the beach front. The bathroom was super close and it was a great place to sleep and relax. Mahalo!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not regret staying here!! Nicest Airbnb I've ever stayed! Just Book it already.
The host is amazing, responds fast and really makes sure you have everything you need. Beach in the backyard got the best view. You will feel like you are in paradise during your stay. I will definitely stay here again next time I come back to Oahu!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in this little and comfy Yart! Everything we needed was provided and it was very clean. We even got some home made banana bread and it was sooo delicious!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Polu- Warren and Michele were excellent hosts. The house manual was clear and thorough. I received it before arriving and excellent food suggestions were included. Arriving at the privacy gate brought a lot of relief and intrigue. When the gate opened and I saw the yurt, the parking space, and the beautiful plants all around -WOW! It was a private little paradise. The short walk to the private beach?!? WOW again. We enjoyed breakfasts on the beach, saw a sea lion on our arrival date, and stayed out to catch the stars one of the nights we stayed. The yurt was a fun and different experience. Glamping in paradise with many more amenities than I expected! This was a great experience! I enjoyed the area and things to do in Ewa Beach area. Polu- Warren and Michele provided a wonderful place and experience. Mahalo to them and their hospitality! Definitely recommend the Plumeria Resurt to anyone going to Oahu!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool place. Nice and private. It was perfect for my needs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a magical stay! Polu's property is right on the beach and feels like a tropical oasis. The beautiful, tropical landscaping lends to the oasis feel and provides privacy. Very comfy and clean.
We stumbled upon this gem due to some misfortune with our flight to Big Island and we needed a place to stay with our pup for 3 days, last minute at 8pm. Polu and Michele were so gracious and ended up cleaning the bathroom and yurt last minute and took us in! Polu showed us around when we got in at 9pm on a Sunday, very friendly and helpful. We were grateful to be greeted with a serene place to rest and were given snacks and delicious homemade banana bread. The hospitality and warmth they showed us is the definition of Aloha 🌸
We made the best of our situation and fully enjoyed our stay here - went to nearby hikes and beaches. The location was perfect for us, we much prefer staying in more local areas where we can explore from. We will definitely be back for our future trips to Oahu!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect location for us. 100 feet from a nearly private beach, close to Pearl Harbor, and Waikiki, close to all the shopping and restaurants in Kapolei, and near the camp in the mountains where the family wedding was being held. Great suggestions on dining options nearby. Nothing better than falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the ocean. Highly recommended to anyone looking to explore all that beautiful Oahu has to offer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality and communication. We hope to return to this “ Resurt!”
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The yurt was an amazing and private location for my husband and I during our honeymoon. It was clean, comfortable, quiet, and was an overall awesome experience. The furniture and bed in the yurt were beautiful and comfortable, and the air conditioner kept us nice and comfortable during our stay. The access to the beach area was great and where we enjoyed having our morning coffee. The patio area with the grill and furniture is where we grilled many of our meals during our stay. This place was amazing and we are so glad we got to experience it on our honeymoon."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! They have everything you need and things you didn’t know you needed. Will definitely be back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely beautiful. It was just what I was looking for Peaceful. Perfect
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a solo traveler, I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The yurt felt private, safe, clean, and was 30 steps away from what felt like your own private beach. The bathroom was clean and laundry was a nice touch. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway from the hustle and bustle of touristy spots like Waikiki, this is the perfect place for you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyable stay! We had a great time here!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Reminds me of camping but 100 times better because of all the anemities. Also, the beach is steps away. I've been to the Hawaiian Islands so many times, but never this close to the beach. It's like having your private beach. No crowds! I will definitely be coming back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is 40 yards to the beach. Bed is super comfortable.
I enjoyed my stay very much."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this place. It had everything I could possibly need or want. I loved the ease of check in and the security gate. The greenery surrounding the yurt provided nice shade and privacy. I loved being able to park so close and that my rental car was always in the shade.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warren & Michele were the perfect hosts from the time of booking to the end of our stay, very welcoming and communicative😀The yurt space and bathroom were spotless and the location right on the beach was beautiful🐋 We had all the amenities you could need and the loaf of banana nut bread was the best! Thank you for sharing your spot of paradise with us and we will definitely return ♥️"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The quiet private beach, the blooming Plumeria all around, falling petals on the floor, the various free beach amenities.. Being able to live like a Hawaiian local at the more native side of the town is such a rare and precious experience that I'll always remember."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, convenient, and with all the necessary amenities (not the least of which included coffee). 10/10 would stay again!
Can’t beat staying on the beach and having luxury at the same time.
Don’t miss an opportunity to sail with Polu."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at a yurt so very close to the beach was awesome. My hosts were amazing and very helpful. Michelle even took me to a grocery store to get a few basics , and shared what places would be great to see. I would be glad to go back, and next time I will rent a car."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful beach, yurt secure, private and comfortable!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely peaceful. Highly recommend for the oasis vibe. The yurt was the perfect size for 2 people and has everything you need. The beach was a short stroll from your front door and very private! The hosts and their dog were very nice and available when needed.
Could not recommend this place more."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my husband and I’s absolute FAVORITE stay out of all of the islands we went to! There aren’t enough good things that could be said about it. Beautiful yurt within walking distance to the beach. Very clean and well put together, very private, and great hosts. 10000/10 would recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely way worth what you pay for.
Would recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For our first trip to Hawaii, we couldn't have been more pleased with the yurt on the beach. We got great instructions on getting access to the secure location (felt very safe) and was greeted with Hawaiian music (playing on the Roku TV) and a fresh loaf of banana bread (which quickly disappeared for some reason - so yummy). I worked during the day and had a great desktop surface with excellent wi-fi connectivity. The beach was so close we went to sleep every night to the relaxing sound of the waves. We rented a car and had parking space right next to our yurt to loading/unloading was very easy. Outside, I had access to a covered gazebo for times I wanted to work outside. Our hosts were very kind and we enjoyed our conversation on the beach one morning. A ""must"" location if you want a great room and yet have access to the Makai side of the island. So many restaurants and local sites/hiking within minutes of driving. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute spot, really private and romantic, the beach is beautiful with a view of sunrise and sunset. Highly recommended"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Arriving to Hawaiian music streaming from Pandora created a wonderful mood. Great privacy on the layout and the bathroom in a separate location was no issue at all. I felt very comfortable my entire stay. If needed, communications were quick and easy.
They thoughtfully provided snacks, water & banana nut bread to get you started🙏
The beach was a wonderful place to take walks, sunbath and soak in the island feel. So glad I stayed here!🌺"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"unique space, immaculate, charming! on the beach. what could be better!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for morning Qi-Gong on a private beach.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the BEST stays for an Airbnb! It’s peaceful, quiet and private! There’s a beach not even 200ft from the yurt And is perfect for a quite relaxing vacation. Polu had the best restaurant recommendations, we tried about half of them and they were all amazing! If and when we come back to Oahu this is the place we will be staying!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place if you're after somewhere casual and rustic. Right on the beach but it's pretty rocky so not a great swimming beach. Fine for just cooling off. The immediate area is residential and nothing flash, but great if you want to be away from the tourist hordes for a bit. There's a small local shop 300m away and a shopping village with big drug store, 7 eleven, and a couple of restaurants. the Thai one is pretty good. Bit of a trip by Uber or bus to get to Waikiki. All in all it suited us perfectly."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My brother and I absolutely loved our stay and have nothing but good things to say! The host were very responsive and the beach was just seconds away. An added bonus was the homemade banana bread left for us in the fridge! Would recommend this place any day of the week!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Clean. Charming. So close to the beach. A wonderful, unique experience."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt is absolutely lovely! It has everything we need, and banana bread and other snacks were also provided for us to enjoy. Beach is at the back of the place within a super short walk, and we got to walk along the beach in the morning. Polu also helped me find my AirPods and shipped to my home address. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun experience staying in Polu-Warren's yurt. The surroundings are like a tropical paradise and we absolutely loved being able to grill under the gazebo. The ocean is just steps away and feels like your own private beach. The bathroom was spotless and everything was just like the photos, only better. We'd love to go back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and they had a handwritten sign welcoming us and congratulating us. We wanted something outside of downtown and close to the beach and this was it. We could walk right out to the beach and it was almost like having a private beach. We would definitely stay here again! Very responsive hosts and had everything we needed available. Hannah even gave us some homemade banana bread for our flight home. Just a spectacular place to stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was fantastic for the price. Everything was very clean when we arrived and it was very easy to check in. Being right on Ewa beach was great and was good for body boarding. Another great thing about the stay is that the hosts have a ton of things that they let you use. This includes body boards, snorkels, coolers, etc. Could not be happier with the stay and can't wait to come back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! It was our first time staying in a yurt, it was super peaceful. The beach nearby is a plus! Definitely recommend!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time during our stay. Loved the yurt! Definitely will be checking to see if it is available on our next trip to Oahu. Private, very close to the beach so we were able to watch sunrise from the beach in the mornings. 100% recommended!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Fun experience. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Great star gazing. Comfortable and convenient access to places we wanted to visit.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in the yurt for our honeymoon and had an amazing time! It’s such a unique place to stay on Oahu to get away from the tourist areas. It was spotless - perfectly clean! The beach is so beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset. It was so nice to meet Warren and Michele, they are such kind hosts. We’d stay here again anytime, this spot is a true gem on Oahu!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was wonderful, it had everything we needed for our holiday... a comfortable bed, AC & fan, fridge, microwave, a nice table to have breakfast outside (there is a Plumeria tree too). The bathroom is right outside and works perfectly. Palu was very thoughtful and provided us with everything for the beach, including towels, chairs, and umbrella."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt is fun and as pictured! The bathroom is right across the way and the whole setup is very private. Everything is clean and you have everything you need. Checkout the bottom draws of the dresser, (we didn’t until we left) there are books, another fan, and the light remotes in there.
The beach is beautiful. There are crabs that will keep you entertained for hours, and we saw sea sponges, cool algae, pretty shells. There are houses all along the beach, with other rentals, so you never be alone, but it is peaceful.
In the rainy season you have to keep the flaps of the yurt closed because of rain, and it gets hot! It takes about an hour with the AC on to get it cool. The yurt is noisy! You are in a neighborhood, despite the beautiful garden, and you will hear airplanes, chickens, sirens, motorcycles, gun shots (2x), the neighbors are currently remodeling so there is some serious construction on the other side of the fence! Be prepared with headphones or ear plugs if you want to sleep."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing Glamping experience. We enjoyed the quietness without sacrificing modern comfort. Polu is very easy to communicate with. The property has been well maintained for all time.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a very comfortable and private spot. the bed was very comfortable. the garden around the house is lovely.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and so close to the beach! The A/C in the yurt made nights nice and cool. I would love to come back and stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about a hidden gem! Everything was absolutely perfect. Could not have asked for anything else. This property is stunning. It was exactly the type of experience we were looking for on the island. Polu, Michelle and Zoey, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your hospitality. We definitely are looking forward to not only referring friends and family but also would love to come back for another stay. 12/10!!
Mahalos and malma ponu!!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in this perfect little yurt in Eva. The bathroom access is very close. The shower is nice and large. The laundry access was wonderful as well. It is just a short walk to beach access with beautiful sunsets. The bed was so very comfortable! Just what we needed with a microwave, and small fridge, and coffee maker. They also supply you with dishes and silverware to use. Love the perk of the beach towels, chairs and coolers. I would recommend staying here for someone who wants peace and quiet off the beaten path. We woke up to lovely birds every morning. Our host's were very accessible and kind. We had a great stay! ❤️"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place with the private beach on the property. So glad we stayed here and not a busy, large hotel. Exactly what we expected, and it did not disappoint. Would do it again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful experience. The yurt was exactly as described. The sandy beach had a lot of sharp coral and glass but they provided water shoes as not to end up with an injury but a little bit of a bummer not to be able to safely walk barefoot on the beach. They had wonderful personal touches that really showed they cared about their guests. All in all a wonderful stay :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! Wish we could have stayed longer.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If your into the fun and unique with Awesome accommodations and proximity to the beach (for a Party of 2) You have found a Gem. Gated Home for added security, clean and prompt with responses, check in easy. Positive experience stay. Mahalo"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were a little nervous about staying in a yurt because we had never done it before. I turned out to be amazing! It was a perfect visit and right on the beach with our own private restroom. We highly recommend staying here. A wonderful place!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Super close to the beach and beautiful property.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A real gem. Fantastic find. Better than advertised. Lovely, peaceful, right on ocean, very clean and well kept place. A real have your cake and eat it too spot - all the pleasures of glamping with all the creature comforts of a well furnished airbnb and at a fantastic price. We loved hanging out on quiet beach right outside the unit - felt like we had our own private beach with a lovely view of Honolulu far in the distance. Wish we had some extra days to chill there. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect little getaway! Right on the beach, away from the hustle of the city, yet close enough if you need anything! We couldn’t have asked for a better time. Highly recommend!! Will be coming back!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an accommodation where you can feel the host's thoughtful children's path! You can really go
to the sea in 30 seconds ~
I was able to enjoy the accommodation and the sea privately!!!
It's also close to
the outlet, and you can use it while renting a car!
In the morning, I can hear the sound of chirping. Sometimes the sound of airplanes ~
You're sensitive to the sound, but you might not like it if you want to sleep late!
We stayed early."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect and caring hosts in a clean and cozy accomodation. Highly recommended for everyone who seeks relaxing days at the beach and / or wants to discover Oahu.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family of 5 rented cottage and yurt for two nights. We were vacationing in Maui and came to visit Pearl Harbor. (Check out the swap meet at Aloha Stadium) This was perfect for us. Definitely got the vibe of Hawaiian living. May be a little too rustic for some but suited our personalities.
Limited A/C but was not a problem. We were out during the day and very comfortable sleeping at night.
We especially enjoyed sitting by the ocean with an almost full moon. Website is accurate and host is very responsive with communication. Great choice you want something away from high rise condos and tourist areas."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great and my wife and daughter really enjoyed the banana bread!! The room was clean, bathroom had everything one would need or want to have during their visit!! Would definitely recommend and stay again. Thanks for being an awesome host"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Private beach! Great way to get away from the tourist spots and to get a chance to enjoy some privacy. The yurt we stayed at was perfect. Had all the accommodations that were needed for a comfortable stay. The entire property and landscaping was beautiful and what you would imagine for Hawaii. Host was super responsive and gave some great tips on dining destinations. Every place we tried was amazing. Thank you very much for your hospitality. Mahalo!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing gem this place is! The landscaping is incredible, the beach is out of this world gorgeous, and the yurt is comfy and cozy. It can get a bit warm in the yurt on hot days later in the morning, but no worries, the beautiful covered lanai is always available. The private bathroom is just six step away from the yurt, and is adorable. It has everything you need and the things you may have forgotten. We really appreciated the freshly baked banana bread. Not only was it delicious, it provided us with breakfast every day we stayed. This unexpected retreat is a little slice of heaven. You won’t go wrong staying here. Stop thinking and book it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time staying in a yurt and we loved it. Spacious, well equipped, and clean. Being so close to the ocean, you can hear it from the yurt at night. It's a residential area, so the usual noises could be heard. Host was responsive and welcoming."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a private, peaceful and romantic place to retreat, this is the perfect place for you. This charming cozy yurt will not disappoint. My husband and I look forward returning again:)"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,easy to find and super clear instructions. nice and really clean!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to unwind. It was clean and cozy and as full of amenities as one can expect from a yurt. Even though it stands next to the owner's house it still felt really private. A car is pretty much a must, but a parking spot is provided right next to the yurt. And the greeting note made me feel really welcome."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay all around for the value. Polu thought of everything we needed & checkin/out was pretty convenient. Will look to stay here next time we are in this part of the island.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place! Wonderful host!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great for anyone want to enjoy and relax, stay away from the busy life of Waikiki. HIGHLY RECOMMEND in every way."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ok but.....
Pro's, Clean, comfortable, lovely secluded beach area, great shower & bathroom, seemingly secure, laundry facilities, parking, hosts quiet, polite and unobtrusive, excellent coffee in refrigerator.
Cons, Very noisy indeed at all sorts of random times during the night, motorbikes, cars, aircraft, music, neigbors arguing, lack of actual address until very close to check in time which prevents detailed research of the actual property location. The rules for the house stipulate quiet hours which is great if only every one else was quiet too. Do not rely on welcome basket if you are hungry after long trip."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very easy to get to after a long day of travel. We were offered homemade banana bread which we enjoyedwith our coffee the next morning while we sat outside and listened to the birds! Lovely stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, wow, wow! So many good things to say about this gem of an air bnb.. exactly/better than advertised. Would give 6/5 stars and definitely recommend staying here. Would love to come back every time I visit Hawaii. What I liked most was the attention to decor detail, the well thought out traveler-accommodations, the cleanliness (was as if I was the first ever to stay there), the security of the property, and the proximity to the beach. Awesome air bnb!
Mahalo Polu- Warren!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little hideaway complete with front yard access to the beach! If you’re looking for a unique experience, serenity and be closer to nature (glamping) this would be it:) Check it out and fyi the host is a captain and can schedule a sailing excursion!! I got to see ALOT of dolphins:)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! Beautiful property. So quiet and relaxing. We were spoiled with homemade banana bread and juices. Perfect stay.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A truly wonderful stay in this beautiful yurt, right on the beach. Very clean and convenient with a private bathroom, parking spot and beach gear provided. Many thanks for a very relaxing stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay. The place is spotless clean and the bed is comfortable. The garden is beautiful too. We would highly recommend this place.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location right next to the beach! Staying in the yurt was an awesome experience. We had everything we needed.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice! We loved the practically private beach and the cozy yurt. It rained on our last night but was very snug and dry inside. Comfy bed! Yes, there were technically other people on the property but we didn’t see them, it felt very private. Def walk down the beach to Silva’s for delicious home-cooked take out food."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING experience! This is definitely a different type of stay than what we normally would stay at. But it was so worth it! The yurt is such a cool concept! We were very comfortable. Lots of natural lighting and breeze came in. Lots of storage space. The bathroom was very close and just across the yurt. Having laundry was a plus too!! We were able to wash all of our clothes so that we wouldn’t have to go home with dirty clothes. Having a beach in the backyard was very convenient. Beach towels, chairs, snorkels, bougie board and cooler all included! Love that there was a shower outside to rinse off after the beach too. I felt very safe staying here. Gated house too. And absolutely love going to sleep / waking up hearing all the nature sounds and sounds of the wave Polu and his crew were very welcoming and nice!! Would definitely come back here in the future. Mahalo!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location and easy access! Definitely would stay here again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This yurt was super lovely. We really enjoyed spending time here and the access to the beach right out back was such a delight. To hear the peaceful sound of the waves at night and get to enjoy the stars was just a treat for us.
We truly loved every minute there. Wish we could have spent even more time there, but have to work in order to come back.
Everything from booking, communication, to the entire stay, and check out was simple and just great.
Definitely will come back soon!!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed staying in the yurt. It was very private and comfortable. The access to the beach was awesome! It was great to have the beach to ourselves. Sunrise over diamond head and sunset were awesome. We also saw sea turtles right from the beach! We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves on Oahu.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The yurt is pretty cool with direct access to the beach. There is a lot of noise from airplanes during the day but not so much at night.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Glamping in a yurt was an experience. The aloha breeze kept us cool at night. Use of the washer & dryer was nice.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place. Feels like you’re own private Beach in Hawaii! The Yurt is great for a couple - very clean and comfortable. Ewa Beach is not far from the more “Touristy” areas if that is what you want. Will be telling our Friends to check out Polu’s place if going to Hawaii!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome experience. We loved the setting and having quick access to a relatively private beach (it’s not private, but felt like it because there were few people there). Sleeping to the sound of the ocean waves was very cathartic. The yurt was very cute and the restroom was clean and sharp. I highly recommend this stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love it here
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Slice of heaven - great location, beautiful beach, and lots of amenities. Exactly what we needed!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, comfortable, and very special Airbnb. Private beach access, private sitting area, washer and dryer available. So happy we stayed here!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Enjoyed our stay
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, great place. Private beach access is definitely the best part of the stay."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt was amazing!! Super clean and had everything we needed!! The bathroom was right outside the front door, private and had great showers. The beach was amazing!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Resurt for our anniversary and to ring in the New Year. Our stay fulfilled all of our expectations and then some! It was our first time in Hawaii and our first time staying in a yurt. We had the most memorable time and will definitely recommend this listing to our friends and family.
Check in and check out: Easy breezy!
Communication with Polu was easy as well. He answered our questions quickly.
The yurt and bathroom were spotless. Bed was very comfy and having a fridge and microwave was a HUGE plus!
*Pro tip: there is a Foodland up the street where we bought fresh poke almost everyday! Buy a pound or two, take it to the beach for a perfect snack.
Even though it rained for most of our stay, the days that it didn’t, we were able to utilize the beach lounge chairs and hang while we watched the most beautiful sunsets. Being so close to the beach was the cherry on top of this listing. Polu provided beach towels for us to use. Very thoughtful! We loved didn’t have to share the beach with tons of tourists like in Waikiki. We were relieved especially while Omicrom was spreading that we had the beach to ourselves. Just note that you’ll have to use water shoes because the beach is a bit rocky. There are water shoes provided as well.
The location of the Yurt is perfect for day excursions. We were able to get to other parts of the island easily from there.
It rained a lot during our stay but the yurt held up well. There weren’t any leaks. The sound of the rain on the roof was so relaxing and hearing the tropical birds in the morning was awesome.
We can’t wait to come back! Thank you Polu! You made our first trip to Hawaii one we will never forget!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an outstanding stay!!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing place! Would highly recommend it to anyone.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot, away from the craziness that is Waikiki and an amazing spot where it is easy to get to other locations on the island. The kind of place you would trade in your 5-star hotel for."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, private place to stay on Oahu with all the amenities you need."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place! Super clean and well stocked. Polu was quick to respond to requests. The private beach is really close as well.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in a yurt and it was unique and great! Staying here was glamping where you feel like you’re in a fancy tent but with a Rocky TV with an HDMI cord, Wi-Fi, a comfy bed, small fridge, microwave, 2 fans, an AC unit, wooden floors, plumbing, and more. The property has a gate you drive through and park your car right next to the yurt, providing another level of security. You will hear the neighborhood traffic but you also get to hear the rhythmic and soothing ocean (where the beach is literally 76 steps from the door of the yurt…I counted). You will also hear the night animals and the morning calls of the local birds. The only con is the bathroom not being inside the yurt, but that’s okay because if you get portable Johns from Amazon no worries about night time bathroom trips. We were more worried about using the restroom at night but the portable John’s are great for men and women. My husband and I used them (with wipes, of course) and had no issues with the well stocked bathroom, which was 4 steps across from the front door of the yurt….problem solved. There were supplies there and we really didn’t have to bring any consumables (except toothpaste). Polu is very friendly and great with communication. I will definitely stay here again when we return to O’ahu and will recommend to my friends and family."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! great location and yurt is perfect
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s perfect!!! Right on the beach, great location, the yurt was awesome!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate to book this Airbnb! The yurt is amazing. It’s cute and cozy and perfect for a couple’s getaway! The location right on the beach was great for relaxing and the sunsets are unreal. Poly even offered us a ride on their catamaran, unfortunately it didn’t work out with our plans but seemed like a must do snorkeling trip! My boyfriend and I loved it and will hopefully be back soon!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The yurt was beautiful. We were hesitant that the yurt wasn’t exactly on the beach but was pleasantly surprised that it was tucked away on the property and literally a few steps away from the sand.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great stay, location was convenient, 10 min from outdoor mall, groceries, reasturants, and movie theater; delivery even closer. The yurt and bathroom was clean, washer and dryer was a blessing. Beach was beautiful, not sandy so make sure to have water shoes. You can hear the waves at night from the yurt if the ac is off. The location was good for travel to other areas of Oahu, 20 min from Honolulu and 20 min to Pearl City in a car; beaches in the area. Host were great 🍍"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Polu has the cutest yurt in a great location! I promise you will not be disappointed! The yurt is on a shared location with two other houses (the owners) but it’s very private and you don’t even notice. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and star gazing at the beach which is just footsteps away. You can even hear the waves from the yurt. So peaceful and relaxing! Just book it already! :)
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing vacation! You will love staying at the yurt! Very clean, comfortable, and a very cozy bed. The bathroom is right next to the yurt, so convenient, basically an en suit. The beach is wonderful to watch waves, sunrise, and sunset but not a swimming beach. You will need a rental car for all your sightseeing adventures. The yurt is a must, so just book it if you can."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience. Love the Yurt. Beautifully landscaped. Great location.
Beach is unbelievable close and has lots of room and comfortable lounge chairs. Has very nice night sky line looking at Honolulu in the distance."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were already high based on the other reviews. Clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully arranged with everything you need. The property is beautiful - feels kinda like a low key resort. And the beach, which is right in front of the property, is lovely. Not a swimming beach but a stunningly beautiful place to relax, eat breakfast, and watch the sunrise. Host was friendly and communication was great. Location isn’t super close to any the areas on the island we frequent (North Shore, Kailua, Honolulu/Waikiki) but it isn’t super far from any of them either, so it’s a great neutral launching point if you want to explore different parts of the island. Overall, highly recommended."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and the hosts are very responsive! Just a short walk to the beach to enjoy beautiful sunsets. The yurt was quite hot in the morning and during the day but we were usually out having fun anyway!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay! The bed was so comfy and beach was beautiful, 10/10 recommended. I would say you must have a rental car if staying here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was wonderful, everything was perfect. So many thoughtful things in place at the Yurt. Location is far from tourist area and traffic can be bad during the week day. Other than that it is definitely worth the price."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Loved staying here. Very clean, fun and quick 1 minute walk to beach. Hope to be back soon!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Polu's yurt was definitely a highlight of our trip to Oahu. The yurt definitely embodies what Airbnb is all about; providing an unique travelling/hospitality experience that truly captures the essence and cultural beauty of Hawaii. The location itself is a bit a of a travel to touristy locations, but the trade-off is a very quiet, calm and peaceful area that is secluded from busy, noisy tourists. The yurt is beautiful and is well-equipped with amenities and bathroom/shower that is refreshing and clean. All travelers to the island of Oahu must consider this rental if seeking for an unique experience and that is filled with Instagram-worthy picture taking. Also, make sure to ask Polu regarding his sailing/snorkeling excursion experience ;)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! would stay again on a heart beat! Host easy to contact was helpful. It was difficult finding uber or lyft from this location.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Polu and Michelle made the stay so amazing, they really are the best hosts. They make sure you are taken care of completely and the yurt is so perfect! I wish we could have stayed longer!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,awesome location and easy checkin !
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot right on the beach. Hosts could not be more accommodating.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at the yurt was an amazing experience. It had all the amenities that we needed. We would definitely come back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic 3-day stay at Polu’s place! He and his family, Michelle and Kawika, were so kind and helpful. The yurt is absolutely perfect, bed is so comfortable, bathroom is lovely, and the amenities are so thoughtful. It was like staying at a friend’s home. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"You will not regret booking this yurt. It is a perfect little piece of private paradise. You will wake up to the sounds of birds (ear plugs are good for those who prefer to sleep in) and fall asleep to the sound of the ocean. Polu is accommodating and gives excellent recommendations on where to visit on the island. Again, you will not regret booking here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful location and a great experience!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt is a one of a kind experience. We had a great time meeting the other AirBnB’rs on the property (there are two other houses with guests) and the location was perfect. The portable AC works well at night but it can get a bit hot between 10am to 5pm.
You will find yourself waking up early here with roosters, birds, and lots of natural light coming through the top of the yurt.
Polu and Michelle were gracious hosts and are wonderful at communicating promptly with any questions or concerns."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can't say enough about how wonderful this was. My wife and I stayed here for the last couple of nights of a 2 week vacation and it was perfect. Everything was spotless and super cute. Polu put in special touches that made it an amazing stay. The beach was super easy to access and it was absolutely beautiful. Would absolutely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful spot and so close to the beach! Couldn't ask for a nicer place or hosts.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was so much fun! We woke up to birds chirping in the morning and most days ypu could hear the waves rolling in with the tide. The host was super friendly and easy to talk to. It was a great stay and I highly recommend it
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we had a good time staying here.
I just have a few comments about the location. These are not complaints, but just about this part of the island:
- There is some occasional fireworks-like noise coming from the military base (shooting practice?).
- Landing airplanes
- The beach is good for walking, but not so much for swimming. There are rocks/corals everywhere. The water was too shallow to swim over them. I have not seen anyone in or around the water in the 3 day-stay.
- Yurt is in the backyard of the house. You have to pass through couple of gates to reach the beach."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and welcoming hosts. The yurt and amenities are thoughtful. Not much to do in Ewa but is a nice getaway from Waikiki. Heads up for light sleepers: birds start chirping in the 5am hour pretty loud. Overall great, would come here again:)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The resurt was absolutely amazing! I’m so glad I was able to experience this unique stay. They have really thought about everything you might need. There was clearly a lot of thought and live out into the stay. Thank you!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazzzzing experience! Polu was great about contacting us before checking in to make sure we knew exactly how to get there and greeted us. The yurt was beautiful and had everything we needed! I loved listening to the sound of the ocean before bed. Polu had boogie boards, snorkels, and chairs for us to borrow. I would definitely recommend this stay and look forward to coming back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place. Would I return again? In a second. The host and his family are beyond accommodating and have an excellent setup, exactly what AirBNB is all about. Stay here, you won’t regret it!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I’m so happy we booked this yurt. If you are looking for a unique and kind of adventurous spot, this is it! We loved being just steps away from the beach and being woken up by the birds chirping in the morning. If you get the option to go on the catamaran cruise don’t pass it up! We saw dolphins and snorkeled. The hosts are so thoughtful and provided snorkeling gear, boogie boards, towels etc. and made the trip that much more special.
A little bit of a drive to main attractions, but it was totally worth it. Rental car highly recommended. PS the banana bread was amazing. Thanks Michele!
We are even wanting to book again in the future.
Aloha,
Bre and David"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Yurt is a unique experience, it has all the comforts inside and out. The beach is right there and so inviting after a day of sightseeing. The owners take great care of the grounds, are available to answer questions or provide tips, and unless you need them you won't know they're around. Highly recommend if you're looking for a comfortable and cozy retreat away from the crowds but close enough to great food and all the sights."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super awesome place to stay. Loved the yurt and the sounds of the birds and ocean. Well stocked with all the amenities. Enjoyed having access to a very quiet beach. Great find and will book it again when we come back to Hawaii! Thanks!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little getaway outside of the busy world that is Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend if you are planning on relaxing around Ewa or have a rental car if you are going back and forth from the east / south side.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have nothing but great things to say about our stay at the resurt! This is such a awesome place and just steps from the beach! They have really thought of everything from snorkel gear to the boogie boards and even some snacks in the yurt. This place is very special and made our trip unforgettable. Thank you guys for everything! We highly highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay a couple nights! AC and fans keep it nice and cool! Beach is great to relax at!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, convenient and free parking was a blessing. Steps away from the beach which was nice. Bring your own water sandals though because the sand in the ocean is rocky. Otherwise great stay."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, wonderful time at Plumeria Resurt! From the accommodations to the landscaping to the beach to the friendliness, it was great! Hope to visit again!"
,,,"What’s the average of five and negative infinity? That’s how many stars I want to give these Airbnb hosts, Gabriele and Lee.
I’m a college professor who went to Kailua to spend some days with a local friend. When he first arrived at the property, he accidentally walked into the hosts’ house; this led to Gabriele shouting at the two of us on the front porch for several minutes, refusing to accept our explanations for the misunderstanding. She accused me of not having registered two guests (I had, and it was easily provable that I had; all she would have had to do was check the reservation). She also acknowledged that Airbnb guests accidentally go in that door from time to time, so it was mind-boggling that *this* time that error resulted in shouted threats of calling the police; whether that has anything to do with the fact that my friend is African-American is something I guess only Gabriele and Lee know for sure. She also seemed horrified by the idea that my friend and I, both men, might have casual sex under her roof.
In our subsequent exchange of messages, Gabriele never apologized or said a single kind thing to me about the situation; she showed no capacity for seeing the situation from my perspective, focusing instead on her “disappointment”; she inexplicably held *me* responsible for my friend’s statements and actions, asking me to explain what he meant by some of the things he said; and, most insanely, she judged me harshly for not doing more to defend my friend when she was shouting at him!
Note, by the way, that there was a perfectly reasonable way to handle this; Gabriele and Lee could have said, for example, “Would you mind waiting outside? I’m going to call our guests to see if any of them are expecting you.” I would have expected people with decades of experience in hospitality to have more productive tools at their disposal. Alas.
In short, what I have learned from Gabriele is that the customer is not always right; in fact, the customer apparently doesn’t even deserve to be treated with dignity or respect. It’s really too bad, as she and Lee have created a lovely, spotlessly clean, thoughtfully appointed, physically very comfortable space that I would otherwise have given five stars. But this episode substantially ruined my time in Hawaii; having been accused and threatened by these hosts, my friend and I never again felt comfortable in that space. My friend was so disturbed by the whole encounter that he was not comfortable coming back to the property.
I sincerely hope that this feedback prompts Gabriele in particular to reflect on her behavior and the limits of her ideas about hospitality. In the meantime: queer folks and people of color, I suggest you look for accommodations elsewhere."
,,,"I don't think it's a good place for 2 families to stay.
The bedroom space is on the second floor, so one family has to go up and down the first floor to go to the bathroom."
