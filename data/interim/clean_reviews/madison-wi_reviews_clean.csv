2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We absolutely LOVED our stay! Jackie’s place was really beautiful and in a very walkable location. She thought of SO many details to make our stay comfortable - eco cleaning and toiletry products, heated floors, a shopping bag we could use to walk to the local co-op. She even left us a lovely welcome bowl with fruits and chocolates for our arrival. ☺️
We also really appreciated having parking on the premises! And on top of all this, Jackie was extremely proactive and responsive in her communication.
We will definitely stay here again when we’re in Madison!
Thank you for such a beautiful stay. ❤️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Charming and undisturbed home in lovely surroundings - very recommendable 😊
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our week in Jackie's home. It was clean, well-provisioned, and comfortable. The hosts, who live just across a small yard, were friendly and responsive. The neighborhood is full of trees and peace, with short walks to a shopping street and parks and the lake. Because we're older, we would have appreciated some support at the steep front step and the claw foot tub, but Jackie was more than clear in her description and reiterated about accessibility in her messages. We cooked more than many might, and her kitchen supplies, such as dishes and cookware, were top-notch. For most, the small fridge is plenty, but we missed a regular fridge a little, especially after we visited the amazing farmer's market on the square! Thanks to Jackie and her husband for a restful stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Jackie's place. The quality of the items provided/available in the kitchen were top notch, it was comfortable and clean. We had everything needed to make all meals there. It was extremely convenient to downtown or for us close to Alliant Energy Center for the CrossFit Games. There was a lake a short walk away and Willy's co-op was awesome for grocery food selections right around the corner. Jackie was responsive and friendly and helped make adjustments to our length of stay and amount of guests easily. You are in a small guest house behind her home but we didn't feel that it was an issue at all. We saw them here and there but still felt like we had our own space. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jackie does a great job and is super responsive. It’s a healthy walk to the capitol, State Street, and the UW but we like to get our steps in so it’s great for us. There are nice restaurants close by and the apartment has a very nice small kitchen. Jackie has done an elegant job."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jackie’s place was lovely. Everything was provided, all useful items such as clothes and dish washing soaps, shampoo, aluminum foil, parchment paper, paper towels etc. When the outside air became unhealthy due to Canadian wildfires, Jackie provided an indoor air purifier. We stayed an entire month and felt like we were home. We will stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean and comfortable with a well equipped kitchen and lovely outdoor patio. The shower was a wonderfull rainfall and the clawfoot tub was so relaxing. Lots of natural light, pretty flowers. and beautiful songbirds. It is a great bnb."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great little space in a perfect location. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time we're in town. There were nice little touches like cheese and chocolate waiting for us when we arrived.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had an absolutely fabulous stay at Jackie’s little green house. We lived in Madison for years and were excited to come back for a PhD graduation. This little home was the perfect place for us! It is impeccably styled, had everything we needed, and was in the best location. We loved morning walks by the lake to head downtown or a quick few steps to Madison Sourdough and Orton Park. Jackie was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed and more. Thank you so much for a delightful Madison trip, we’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jackie’s place was beautiful and had everything one would need for a long stay. She was responsive and friendly and had lots of suggestions for local places to check out. The check in process was quick and easy, her instructions were very clear. I highly recommend staying here, and I would definitely stay again when I’m back in the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very Charming and lovely appointed place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Jackie's place and had a great experience. I arrived late at night and the lights were on, there were two different cheeses in the fridge, a nice box of craft crackers, and some wonderful chocolates. The location is awesome as you can walk to many restaurants, coffee shops, and the local grocery co-op, know as Willy Street Co-Op. The place is clean, quaint, comfortable, and well-stocked with anything you might need. I recommend Jackie's place if you're planning a stay in this iconic town. So much to do and so much fun."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,The space was really cozy and beautiful and I felt right at home there! Jackie provided everything I needed and I was very comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stayed here for about a week during our wedding preparations and loved every minute of this cute little bungalow. It had what we needed and then some appreciated amenities. Super easy to walk to Willy Street and downtown for food and drinks. Would stay again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a special, peaceful place . . . Jackie has thought of everything to both welcome and support her guests. She has a rare knack for comprehensive and respectful hosting. For many years I lived in this Madison neighborhood, and staying at Jackie's felt like coming home."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Charming property, great communication, and one of Madison’s best neighborhoods. The house was filled with character, making it a fun spot to hang out. The host even left some delicious treats as a greeting, which fewer people seem to do these days. I really enjoyed my stay here and will do it again next time I’m in town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The town of Madison is filled with adventure. We shopped at the Saturday Farmers Market and fed on fresh vegetables, constructed a charcuterie tray, and feasted on empenadas. But wait there is MORE, Willys Coop is a 5 minute walk and is fresh, healthy and caters to specific dietary needs. We enjoyed kayaking, biking, the Geology Museum, the Union, and took in the panoramic view at the top of the capital building. Thank you Jackie and Henry"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jackie and Henry were awesome hosts! The cottage was very nice, clean, and well stocked with supplies for our month-long stay. They even provided us with a welcome treat of crackers, cheese, chocolates, and cherries! The cottage is in an excellent location close to the capital with restaurants and grocery store within walking distance. An added benefit was to be only a block away from the annual Orton Park Festival! Bring your bicycles as Madison is a very bike friendly city with ready access to some great biking trails."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely place to stay and relax. I had a week long class at the college- great location- everything was clean and super comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jaquie‘s property. There was a lot of thought and care put into this Airbnb from the linens, pillows, dishes and decor. She gifted us with artisan snacks from the local co-op. The neighborhood is lovely and so many places within walking distance, my favorite was the beach, only one block away. Celeste who was managing the property at the time of our visit made sure we had everything we needed, she even set us up with a cooler and floaty’s for the beach and gave great suggestions for local restaurants. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is absolutely adorable and pristine. The bedroom is surprisingly large for a cute little casita. It has impeccable design and taste, everything you could possibly need. The amenities all worked as described, and check in/out was easy as pie! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a sweet, quaint spot with all the amenities you could need for a short term/monthly stay. Plus, it’s super luxe! A gorgeous seating area outside, beautiful kitchen countertops and trendy flooring, and heated floors. Totally luxurious, cozy and has a few sweet vintage touches like the bathroom sink/bathtub and such. I wish I could live here full time ;-)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic getaway!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is such a lovely home! Comfortable bed, nice washer and dryer, serene setting, walkable. Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful house in a wonderful place. Lovely nest for a couple or a small family. You will find everything you need from the full complete kitchen to the laundry ( with dryer). We stayed 5 weeks in this house, we were like at home.
Location is perfect too. You can do everything by walk ( lake 1 min, city center 15 min, supermarket 15 min, 4 bus lines 2 min )."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice place to stay. Guest house has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Great location. Several restaurants and bakeries within walking distance.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jackie's place is really clean and comfortable, with many thoughtful touches. We especially appreciated the washer and dryer, very handy.
It's located in a great neighborhood, and we picked up something from Batch Bakery every day it was open."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The eco hideaway is an absolute gem! It is tucked away from the street and has a very charming and elegant aesthetic that makes it a really lovely place to relax and unwind. The high-end amenities make it feel unique among other Airbnbs. Jackie is an excellent communicator and left very thoughtful touches, including local cheese, crackers and chocolates! This space has everything you need for a restorative and cozy stay - comfy couches, full kitchen set up, claw foot tub, very comfortable bed and washer/dryer. We stayed over our wedding weekend and it was a perfect place to get ready! Will absolutely be back and will recommend to family and friends!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The casita is located in walkable and bike friendly neighborhood. Having a dedicated parking space was a plus for us, however we didn’t drive very much during our stay. Restaurants, bakery, Saturday market are within easy walking distance. Touring the capitol and a visit to Tallisen AND all the cycling paths were highlights of our visit. The kitchen, while small is more than adequate for preparing simple meals. The cookware is top notch, better than what I have at home. Loved the casita and loved Madison."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s place was amazing! Located in a quaint part of Madison, it is the perfect location to escape the hustle and bustle of the downtown but close enough to walk to. Upon arrival, we found an informational packet with tips, tricks, and restaurant recommendations. Along with that, Jackie had cheese, crackers, chocolate, and grapes waiting for us. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place, great location, great host"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed here for two weeks while visiting family in Madison. This is an absolutely charming and super comfortable place to stay, with every amenity provided (even a washer/dryer). Feels like a home-away-from-home, and everything is very tastefully done -- Jackie is the perfect host (very accessible) with the perfect touch. And there's a beach just a block away. If I could, I'd give this more than five stars!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great experience. Very nice, clean, great location. Perfect for our group of 3!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Joanna Gaines has nothing on this gorgeous little guesthouse. It is aesthetically pleasing and thoughtfully equipped. The location is fantastic - close to great restaurants, the lakes, the Capitol, and campus. We enjoyed our stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great place this was! Jackie’s Eco Boutique Airbnb that is. Very clean, very comfortable, and really close to my children’s place. We had an excellent time here."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay in this lovely little abode. It's perfect for a couple or a small family, and in the perfect location (a block from Willy Street) for exploring Madison.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful accommodations in a lovely area of the city. The perfect place to spend graduation weekend!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful and restful coach house/cottage behind historic home. Great neighborhood too. Radiant heat in the floor is also terrific - no blowing of hot air or radiators. Thoughtful touches throughout and a high design aesthetic- the photos do a great job conveying the sense of the space. Lovely amenities. Added bonus are the birds, squirrels and bunnies in the yard - a cardinal lives nearby and is around quite a bit - and with the windows and french doors that look out on the yard you take it all in with your coffee as you relax and unwind. A great getaway right in the city-"

The space is impeccably designed. I stayed so I could attend an online conference. I would definitely stay again and bring my husband!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jackie’s place was wonderful. The location couldn’t be more perfect, and we were able to walk to so many places downtown and on the East Side (plus the lake!) from her place. The thoughtful touches such as cheese and Potter’s crackers, plus the binder full of pro local tips made it feel like we were staying at a good friends home. Would pick this Airbnb to stay in again on our next visit to Madison. Communication with Jackie was also super speedy. 5 stars all around!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jackie's Boutique Eco Hideaway was the perfect escape for a long weekend. The local eco-friendly materials and personal touches made for a very comfortable and cozy home during our stay, and made our first visit to Madison a memorable one.

The sandy beach is within a block, and restaurants within 15-20 minute walk. We loved it!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great experience! The house was so cute, stylish and clean; even better than the photos!

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is the perfect place to stay in Madison. It is by far the most carefully put together, decorated, and maintained airBnB I’ve ever stayed in. The location is idyllic, and Jackie has all the right tips to help you navigate the best spots in the neighborhood, as well as Madison as a whole. Given the other AirBnB’s in Madison this place is a no brainer. Jackie was also quite modest about the restaurants she works with, but don’t be fooled, they are the best in town, so absolutely worth checking out!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie was so friendly and easy to communicate with! She made sure to check in with us throughout our trip and had every detail beautifully set out and ready for us upon our arrival! (Including fresh fruit , cracker and cheese plate and coffee with fresh cream!) She was a wonderful host and highly recommend her air b n b ! It was beautifully decorated (beyond expectation), cozy, quiet and private and very centrally located (eveything within walking distance ) We will be back for sure !! Our favorite we’ve stayed in thus far in Madison!"

2019-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 weeks while we were in town for work. The place is very cozy and beautifully decorated/remodeled.

Jackie was very communicative and an excellent host. If we ever come back to Madison I hope we can stay here again!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars all around! The hideaway was clean, modern, and cozy. Stylishly decorated, yet still feels inviting. The location features a great combination of privacy while still being right in the middle of everything! The pictures and description are 100% accurate. Appreciated the thorough guide book. We loved the neighborhood and felt safe walking after dark. Lake Monona is steps away and is gorgeous at night. Very convenient to have a dedicated off-street parking spot. Jackie was friendly, easy-going, and responsive. No hassle check-in/check-out process. Highly recommend!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House is one of the best AirBnb's I've rented. The space has been remodeled with high quality materials and attention to detail. The interior is very roomy and comfortable for 2 people. The location is a short drive to University of Wisconsin main campus and State Street, but there are several walkable restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood. The location is perfect for IRONMAN Wisconsin :)"

I can’t wait to come stay here again. The hosts couldn’t have been more accommodating and welcoming."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie is an amazing host. She is so thoughtful, sharing local treats, and giving great suggestions to make your stay wonderful! We are return customers and intend to keep returning!! :)"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This sweet light filled little house has so much to offer. We loved our stay. Not only is the place gorgeous and clean all of the touches are so thoughtful. We came for the CrossFit Games in Madison and Jackie was welcoming and communicated throughly as this was our first air bnb experience. We are looking for excuses to come back!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely LOVED Jackie’s space. It added so much value to our first trip to Madison! Would definitely recommend and hope to visit again!

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hideaway is a stylish and well furnished oasis in a bustling neighborhood close to the capitol and across the street from the lake. The immediate neighborhood has plenty of dining and entertainment options and 2 playgrounds within a five minute walk. Jackie and her family were welcoming but gave us plenty of space to come and go. Perfect for a couple of friends, a romantic trip, or even a small family. Jackie left us thoughtful treats of local crackers and chocolates, a cheese board, refrigerated water, and fresh cherries. Her garden is delightful and we enjoyed the relaxing and artful design of the cottage."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space for an urban getaway. Tasteful and contemporary but very comfortable. Restful and quiet yet in the middle of a bustling and fun neighborhood, with many great food and entertainment options close by. Jackie the owner could not be more accommodating and thoughtful, from the welcome treats provided to the high-end kettle and press coffee gear (coffee provided!) to the beverages, you feel instantly welcome and cared for yet private and cozy. In nice weather, watch for the bunnies in the yard! Highly recommended."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible hideaway just a few minutes from downtown Madison. We walked everywhere we wanted to go, and Jackie’s space was close to the water, the greenway, and several neighborhood spots! Sparkling clean, well-kept, and perfect welcoming touches. Highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Strongly agree with the many very favorable reviews with the property’s well deserved 5 star ratings in all areas & Jackie’s well deserved super host rating. The rental is run very professionally with great communication, organization, attention to detail and caring. It was well stocked, had a neat, clean, helpful booklet on the local services. Enjoyable neighborhood with nice, old 2 story houses and with lived-in feeling rather than the more upscale, manicured lawn feeling of the north isthmus shore; the neighborhood vibe was reflected in a Hell’s Angel guy participating in a local yoga class at the nearby park. Definitely recommend."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem. The design of this little house can't be beat -- it's gorgeous, and I wish my own home was this beautiful and thoughtfully appointed. We loved the welcome cheese plate, beer sampler, and chocolates. The location is ideal -- walking distance to downtown, Willy's co-op, and a little beach where you can go for a quick swim. Check-in was a breeze, the house is sparkling clean, and Jackie is an incredible host. Highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s place is perfect for a couple to use while exploring Madison. The place is very comfortable and even though they are right next door, you have your privacy. Jackie put in a lot of special touches from flowers to treats. She left plenty of toiletries to get us through the week. Easy walking distance to a lot of restaurants, parks, and even downtown. Plus they provided a place to park our rental car. We would definitely stay again."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie's place is wonderful! It was spotlessly clean, bright, and beautifully decorated. The location could not be any better. It is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, but is just steps from Madison's best restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. There is plenty of room to stretch out and relax inside - the whole place feels very spacious. The luxurious touches like the bedding, excellent shower water pressure, and radiant floor heating show that Jackie thinks of everything to ensure that her guests are comfortable. We cannot wait to stay here again someday. I highly recommend this place to anyone staying in the Madison area!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot off Willy Street. Great for a baby. Kitchen is a little small for a long stay but we made it work! Amazing host also provided a baby bed and was super quick with helpful responses via text.

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was just in town for a short weekend, and this place was perfect. Easy to find, very private, clean, and warm. Being so close to Madison Sourdough and the other spots on Willy street was very helpful, and Jackie was very quick to respond to any questions. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us. It is in a great location near Williamson St. in Madison, and is just a few minutes walk to a whole variety of stores and restaurants. The space is stylish, comfortable, and very relaxing. I highly recommend this small cottage in Madison and would gladly stay there again."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's place is cute and cozy. It is small, but private. We did not feel crowded and we had everything that we needed, even a crib.

Everything in the place was super clean and stylish, and we loved all the natural light.

The chocolates were a much appreciated touch. :) We would definitely stay here again next time we visit Madison!"

2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s house is perfect. It has amazing touches, with lot of windows that allow natural light to light up the place and it is impecable clean. For us was like a fairy tale in New Year Eve and Day because it was snowing and the birds and squirrels were on the trees around the house playing.
Jackie was very good and fast responding our questions anytime we reached out to her.
I really recommend this place."

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to stay in the Madison area, you cannot get better than Jackie’s place. Her place is completely private and very stylishly and thoughtfully decorated. The bed is super comfortable (something very important to me) and you have everything you need right there. Jackie left us local cheeses, chocolates and fresh fruit, which made our stay that much better. There was fresh coffee and cream, which also saved us expensive trips to the coffee shop. The neighborhood is quiet but trendy with tons of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. We could not have asked for more and enjoyed our stay more than we expected. Jackie communicated quickly any time we needed to contact her. We needed to ask for help with something rather urgent and Jackie and our husband helped us immediately. If you’re staying in Madison, don’t waste your time looking elsewhere, this place has everything you’ll need and more. Thanks again for the excellent weekend getaway!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the descriptions, we expected this place to be awesome and it delivered (and then some). Outstanding experience. Great location. Beautiful space. Lots of little Madison-related touches and treats. We were pampered with reverse osmosis water and fine cheeses and radiant floor heat (which was great to come back to after an afternoon of hiking). Highly, highly recommended."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very stylish and comfortable space, well located but away from the crowded areas. Lakeshore is a 2 minute walk. Some of the most thoughtful touches we've experienced in many airbnb stays."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Jackie's place over a weekend for the Ironman Triathlon that takes place in September. And this is seriously one of my favorite Airbnbs that I have stayed in. I think everything about it was just awesome.
The location is fantastic. It sits by the lake in a cool little neighborhood just off Williamson Street. Williamson St. has a great selection of coffee houses, restaurants, bars and stores only a couple of minutes walk away. Totally safe area to walk around, even after dark. It's only a 10-15 minute walk to the State Capital building in downtown and everything else in that area.
The place itself is a cozy two room place. One is a bed room, the other is a living room/dining room area. There's not really a kitchen to speak off, but an area with a fridge, sink, microwave, kettle and coffee maker - all we really needed as we ate out every night. It is stylishly decorated from local shops with an independent feel.
Jackie was the perfect host - friendly and communicative (even though we never met her in person). However it was the little personal touches that really made this place stand out. From her recommendation of local establishments to try out, to the cheese and cracker board she left out for us as a welcome present (local WI cheeses). As well as a little selection of locally made chocolates."
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely long weekend here. The place was sparkling clean an we loved the little touches of the fresh grapes, Wisconsin cheese, and fresh coffee beans. The house is lovely and unique. Everything is very well thought out."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie's place is absolutely wonderful. The space is private, beautifully, sustainably, and intentionally decorated, and has all the amenities you could want or need. Likewise, Jackie is a wonderful host- very communicative and accommodating. The location is spectacular in Madison as well. I would highly recommend this space to anyone traveling to Madison! Truly a gem!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect amount of space for our family of 4 (including a 5 yo and an almost 2 yo) for two nights. I loved the place’s style and the kids loved the basket of toys and books and the claw foot tub. We were able to walk to a few different restaurants and a coffee shop in less than 10 minutes with the kids.
2018-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Quaint space. Not far from the capital. Plenty of Uber’s available. Lots of suggestions in the guest book. Thanks, Jackie and family!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to stay at this lovely cottage. The setting, decor, and amenities are outstanding. I so appreciate the attention to details.

Highly recommend!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie's place completely exceeded my exceptions! It's the perfect combination of chic and cozy in the most amazing location in Madison just a few steps away from the water!

2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the cutest! And the coziest! Very very highly recommend Jackie's guesthouse if you are ever in the Madison area, the neighborhood was very charming and I would go back in a heartbeat."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here to attend the 2018 Crossfit Games. I intended to not just see the Games but also experience some of Madison's. The location on Willy St. was perfect for both. I rented a bike just 5 minutes from the BNB and was able to get everywhere using on the bike for the entire week. The place was just as advertised. Clean, quiet great locale with plenty of amenities. Host were helpful and friendly yet stay felt very private. Would definitely stay again."
2018-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s guest house is in a great location and it is beautifully designed. There are so many thoughtful details. I shared the space with my sister for a fun weekend in Madison and we were very comfortable.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about perfection- you won’t find a better place for value and location! We walked and walked and walked. To the beach, to the co-op, to get coffee, to the farmers market, to find a shaded spot to read by the lake, to a resale shop, to dinner, you name it. What a relaxing, minimal, cozy place to call home for a few days!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here, and it couldn’t have been more perfect—walking distance to the lake, in a charming neighborhood that feels like a home away from home, and all close to multiple restaurants and coffee shops. Couldn’t ask for more in terms of a comfortable space and thoughtful, responsive hosts. Thanks again!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie’s place is wonderful. The decor is very nicely done, with small touches such as a complimentary welcome basket of snacks and local cheeses, coffee, great toiletries. The location is great: close to the water, stores, restaurants and downtown. We visited with a baby, but the place is wonderful for couples, families and even friends."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie was an excellent host, and we loved the guest house! It was incredibly clean, the furnishings were excellent, and there were thoughtful, special touches everywhere. From the fresh flowers to the local chocolates and cheeses, we couldn't have asked for better hospitality. Everything was just right! We'll definitely book again when we return to Madison. [Other touches worth mentioning: environmentally-friendly products in kitchenette and bath, more than enough towels, pillows, and linens, iron and ironing board, a basket of toys, lots of natural light, a beautiful garden, and only a block from the lake!]"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's place is beautiful, bright, and cozy. Everything was well put together and available. Jackie was especially flexible with our stay and we appreciated her quick responses as we were making plans. As far as value...Airbnb is just expensive with all the fees and taxes, nothing Jackie can do about that. The cottage is in such a great location with easy access to restaurants, cafes, and the lake. Really a lovely time."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Jackie’s place while spending the weekend in Madison. The location was perfect and the house was super comfortable and decorated to perfection.

And I don't know how I will go back to non-heated floors... the house is in a perfect location with wonderful restaurants and a lake a block away. Definitely stay here!"

2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was comfortable, modern and homey. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. We would stay here again!

2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about this Madison gem?
First, trust the pictures. This space is even more beautiful than they can convey. It was absolutely spotless throughout. Quality shampoo, conditioner, and soap was provided in the bathroom. Bring a bath bomb and a soak in the claw foot tub. Heaven.
There were two types of WI cheese, chocolates, crackers, and grapes waiting for us in the kitchen. Coffee, tea, cream were provided as well.
The bedroom is large and the bed and bedding are high quality and extremely comfortable. The host even put a vase of fresh roses on the dresser.
The living room is a bright, peaceful place to hang out. There is a TV here (also in the bedroom) which works with Roku. The patio off the living room is private and serene. It's the perfect place to have coffee in the morning, a glass of wine in the evening, and to read and relax throughout the day.
The neighborhood is walkable with the lake close by, and Williamson St. (Willy St.) just a few short blocks away. The host provided a detailed guide with area recommendations and directions. I had a car and the host provided a covered parking spot.
I will definitely be returning the next time I need a place to stay in Madison."

Jackie’s apartment was extremely comfortable, relaxing, private, clean, and beautifully appointed. The apartment is actually it's own free-standing building, and parking is easy and a few feet away from the front door. The apartment was very spacious for two guests. The living room is both roomy and cozy and has plenty of seating areas to lounge on. There are plenty of shelves to put your belongings, like phones, books, glasses, keys, etc. Everything is immaculately clean, including the sofa’s cushions, bed linens, bathrooms, towels, kitchen, and utensils. Sheets and pillows are wonderfully comfortable.
Jackie’s design of the space is aesthetically pleasing and unique, and every detail has been carefully chosen for both function and style. There is lots of closet space, hangers, wall hooks, drawers to organize your clothes. There is a hall closet well stocked with amenities, including extra pillows, comforter, ironing board, iron, etc. The kitchenette is fully stocked with cutlery, dishes, glasses, and all that you need to make coffee and tea, as well as amenities for tidying up (dish soap, sponge, garbage bags, dish rack, etc.). On the two TV's, there’s Netflix and Amazon Prime Video available. Jackie also provided high-end snacks, filtered water, coffee, teas, etc., as well as good quality soap, shampoo, and conditioner. There is a lot of attention to detail to ensure that guests are comfortable in their stay—a great mix of professional-grade functionality, thoughtful hospitality, and homey creature comfort.
The location of the apartment is superb. It’s quiet and private, so you can leave the window blinds open to let the sun stream into the living room. There are lovely birds singing outside. Two blocks away in one direction there’s the Monona lake front and two blocks away in the other direction there is Williamson (Willy) Street with tons of interesting restaurants, cafes, shops, and an excellent co-op supermarket.

It took no time feeling right at home, too, thanks to a well-stocked kitchenette area and bathroom with everything you need for a short stay.
The area is lovely -- quiet, residential, and a 2-minute walk to a stunning view of Lake Monona. It's also super close to really fun, hip shops, restaurants, and bars, making it an ideal destination for something looking to relax but also see a really cool, locally beloved of the city.
Really hope I have another excuse to get to Madison for another stay soon!"

Gregory met me when I got there, walked me through the space and gave me some history lessons on Frank Lloyd Wright. Before I came to WI, he gave me some great recommendations and I am so glad I took his suggestions. It was so nice to be able to tell him in person how much I appreciated his advice! He's a very interesting and intelligent man with lots of interests! I enjoyed talking to him a great deal! Next time I stay, it'll have to be in the spring and summer months when their garden is in full bloom. The location, the recommends, the accommodations, the artwork, the books... I can go on and on why I loved this stay! Would absolutely love to visit again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Gregory's place before and, just like then, my recent stay stood out compared to the many other airbnbs I've stayed in. The space is large, quiet, homey, and has lovely views out the big picture windows. It was winter, so I especially loved the gas fireplace. It's rare to find such a nice space at such a fair price. Also, Gregory himself is a delight."

Communication was very pleasant and Greg welcomed us very kindly on site. Be it in the briefing as well as with questions - Greg was there for us. The tranquility and cleanliness was exemplary. It was just all right!!! We highly recommend Greg and thus his accommodation! All the best for him and warm greetings from Germany - Tanja and Wolfgang.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The space Gregory rents is really nice; it is clean, well-decorated, and homey feeling. I really appreciated the comfortable furniture and bed, art on the walls, the table for eating and working, chairs for enjoying the garden and fire, and using the kitchenette. There were also plenty of towels. One thing that's not explicitly included in the listing, which was a nice surprise, was a sturdy curtain with a latch and lock for securing the space while inside; this helped me feel like I had enough privacy to sleep well. As other reviewers mentioned, you can hear some noise upstairs when the hosts are on their main floor living space - which can be a problem if you go to bed early and you're a light sleeper."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gregory was a fantastic host from the day of reservation to day of departure!
All of our questions were answered quickly and suggestions were provided for entertainment, restaurants and points of interest. Our accommodations were so cozy, it felt like we had our own little apartment. Drinks and snacks were provided as well as a refrigerator and microwave which was great for having leftovers. The garden area outside the large windows was a beautiful view that we enjoyed while having morning coffee. I would have loved to stay longer. I highly suggest this airbnb not only for its homie feeling but also for the excellent host and we were made to feel right at home! ;0)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recommend Greg and Fred's place. It's in a lovely, centrally located neighborhood and was perfect for my needs while visiting family in Middleton.

Greg was personable and friendly, but didn't intrude at any time. I had one of the most relaxing and enjoyable vacations ever. Will definitely go back whenever I travel to Madison."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Greg’s place was possibly the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in, and we’ve been using Airbnb for 10 years. The accommodation is fantastic with lovely views to the garden and great outside space. Shops and restaurants are close and the neighbourhood was very quiet. Greg was the perfect host, not intrusive but very helpful if you required information. I would have given 6 stars if I could 😁😁👍"

The look was a classic mid century modern style with comfortable flare. The space was spacious and well decorated. The bed is comfortable for those who enjoy a slightly more firm mattress and the couch is comfortable for a movie before bed! We loved looking at the collection of books and paintings. Lots of amenities were provided; our hosts were very thoughtful in their creation of this Airbnb. We did not get the chance to meet in person, but Greg was very responsive and made sure he was available at all times for questions or needs. We would definitely stay again!"

I liked the location because it was close to the highway yet very quiet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were welcomed by Greg when we arrived. He gave a very good explanation of the private room. The room is spacious and very comfortable. The view of the garden is great. A sliding door provides fresh air. He provided suggestions on what to do in / around Madison.
We had a great time; saw a Shakespeare play in Spring Green; the Capitol building and its history; the Madison Art fair; the farmer's market. We hiked to PicNic point and walked the UW campus along the lakefront. Especially interesting and nice was the ""Hollander"" bar/restaurant."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a very pleasant stay and truly enjoyed the beautiful space provided by Gregory and Fred. It was quiet, peaceful and easy to get in and out. Gregory was so pleasant and friendly!
My only recommendation would be to loosen the spring on the outer door, as it was difficult to hold open and being a smaller person, it was a bit hard to maneuver bags while going in and out. However, I would highly recommend and give this cozy place a 5 star rating!!! Thank you, Gregory! Warmly, Jody"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Greg and Fred were great hosts. I could stay for a year attempt to read all the wonderful books they have collected over the years.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What stood out to me about Gregory's home was that, unlike almost every other airbnb that I've been in, it truly reflected its owners. The decor, including wall art, books, family photos, and more, all told stories of our hosts.....so much more interesting and fun than the usual Hobby Lobby vibe of other airbnbs! Also, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the shower head was awesome, the chairs and fireplace were cozy, and Gregory was a great host."

One suggestion for him in the future: add a handicap safety bar and and a “no-slip,” bath mat for the great shower. Seniors will feel more secure."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Despite the rain on our arrival, and very short stay, we have enjoyed this beautiful apartment tremendously. Parking underneath the carport was absolute blessing during the rain. Friendly host welcomed us and gave us detailed info on all the features of this place. It is equipped to the gills.

Greg was quick to correspond with us, and then gave us a nice ""tour"" of his place when we got there. His place was easy to find, close to the highway and many amenities in the area.

We sat outside with some wine and enjoyed the peaceful setting. We were in a lower level studio with floor to ceiling windows which allowed us to enjoy the garden from inside as well. The bed was comfortable, bathroom clean and furnished with plenty of towels for our needs. Greg was on hand upon our arrival to give us a tour and answer any questions. The location has easy access to the 12, the neighborhood is safe and we will definitely consider staying here again."

The hosts have created a haven in the garden floor space with interesting objects, plants, books, and they had a well-equipped kitchenette area for drinks and snacks. We appreciated the extra effort the hosts put and and all the amenities provided for our very brief stay. The only thing that would have made it better was a few more days there to enjoy the gardens and the neighborhood."

Guests should remember that they are sharing a home with a family, and they should expect to hear ""household noises"" from time to time, whether voices, footsteps, or TV soundtrack. We felt very much at home."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gregory's place is in a quiet, safe neighborhood a few miles (but an easy drive) to downtown Madison. He has provided menus for a least a dozen restaurants that are located within a mile of the house. We are very experienced Airbnb travelers and my husband rates Greg's place as his favorite! We had the entire lower level of the house to ourselves, which includes a very large living area with a gas fireplace and many floor to ceiling windows overlooking Greg's beautifully manicured flower gardens. He has an extensive book collection on the shelves (travel, art, architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright, pottery, fiction, classics, picture books, etc) so we could have been very happy staying there much longer to just enjoy his books and the view! His house is convenient to arteries leading to downtown Madison. Greg was a source of great suggestions about local events and great places to visit. We would definitely stay at Greg's house again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The listing says it’s in the heart of Madison but it’s in the heart of Monona - on the other side of the lake. Was disappointed to learn that I had a 15 minute drive from Madison.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our time at Lori’s place! Great location close to a lot of activities. The only thing I would mention is if you are over 6’0 you will have to watch your head in the place as the ceiling is low in a couple of areas. Other than that everything about the place was great and I would recommend to stay here!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This basement studio with office space is located in beautiful Monona, close to downtown Madison. We loved that it was quiet, with fragrance-free linens and cleaning products. This rental offers all the comforts of home, down to a curling iron, office supplies, and any kitchen gadget you can imagine. In addition to the natural and fragrance-free products, there is a supply of lotions and shampoos containing fragrances for guests who prefer those. The gracious host was very responsive to our communications.
This small space was the perfect size for the two of us, though anyone over 6 feet tall might feel cramped. This is a basement unit accessed through the shared sun room. The bed and pillows are comfortable. We enjoyed admiring the eclectic/historic art on the shelves and walls. Guests remove their shoes before entering the space, helping to keep it very clean. We slept great here."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Little smaller than expected, but great kitchen, even supplied real half n half. Very steep stairs down to basement, but above and beyond, Lori carried my suitcase both down and up, which was greatly appreciated.
Absolutely fabulous sun room and back garden resembling a small Versailles. Comfortable beds, but only one chair, so the second person had to sit on a bed. Chair does not face TV. Space would be good for one person. Nice quiet neighborhood."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful basement apartment. The residential neighborhood is an easy place to take a walk or run. It’s a ten-minute drive to downtown Madison along the lake. The bed is a bit uncomfortable, but I think that’s true for most places. The space is relaxing and Lori is welcoming."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay. Very clear instructions from the host regarding the rules. The space is downstairs, so would not be great for someone with difficulty navigating a flight of steps. There is a small amount of space shared with the host, but that was not a problem at all. Lori was very friendly and responsive."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Lori’s place - very quiet, clean, a bit smaller than we anticipated for 3 adults (both beds in one room - good thing we were college roomies back in the day) but the shared sun room on the main floor and outdoor brick patio and garden are beautiful spaces and give a much roomier overall feel to the space.
Neighborhood is quiet and beautiful for walks - a great space for a couple, or family with 1-2 small children."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet neighborhood. Close to the Atwood area, plenty of places to eat."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the basement of Lori’s house and it doesn’t feel like a basement. There is lots of space and a 5-11 guy didn’t need to duck. It was also very comfortable on one of the hottest days of the year. Very impressed.
The neighborhood is quiet and leafy, but close to lots of great restaurants on Monona Drive, close to Lake Monona, the Beltline, and downtown Madison. Lori was very communicative and helped us with an unplanned-for storage accommodation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place was great -- clean and comfortable and beautifully furnished.

I really enjoyed my stay!"

It was a real treat to be there."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This basement apartment was in a lovely and peaceful neighborhood. We loved its location and how easy it was to find.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable place to stay. Lori was very accommodating and reached out to make sure we were getting our needs met. The surrounding area was quiet and beautiful - close the the lake. Might be annoying for some taller guests as the ceilings are a bit low.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect kid-free getaway for a couple of tired mamas. It is an adorable little basement apartment and has enough windows that it’s not too dark. It is blocks away from parks and a lakeside beach with a cute little ice cream shop. The neighborhood was beautiful and we spent some time just walking around. Lori did an amazing job on the decor and the landscaping and the little sunroom is a perfect spot to sit and sip your coffee in the morning.
It is about 15 minutes to downtown Madison by car but walk a few blocks in either direction and find beautiful views of the capitol across the lake. We had an amazing weekend!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place despite rainy weather.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lori is an absolutely fabulous host.
This was my second time staying at her property (a friend had booked with her for a trip we took to Madison in June 2022), so I knew exactly what to expect and how lovely the accommodations are for travel in Madison.
Less than three blocks from Lake Monona, easily accessible to downtown or the Beltline, not to mention all of the businesses along Monona Drive, this property lets you live like a local and soak up all that the east side has to offer.
The beds are extremely comfortable and have great linens, there is great water pressure, the kitchen is perfect for cooking meals (or warming up leftovers from any of your favorite Madison eateries), and the WiFi is strong if you need to do some work remotely.
I really appreciate Lori’s aesthetic, her gorgeous gardens, all the extra touches (menus, grocery discount card, labels on light switches and locks), and the sun porch. I’m only 5’5”, so the lower level apartment may feel short to someone much taller, but it is extremely cozy and I appreciate having access to natural light while inside.
In my opinion, it’s a definite must-stay if you are coming to Madison!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable space. The garden is so meditative. Close to many neighborhood eateries.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was a perfect spot for us to land in between activities for the wedding we were in town to attend. The kitchen is well stocked, and the place itself has most everything you could need including a full office set up and streaming on the TV. I may have missed it in the listing but I didn’t realize the unit was in the basement and the sun room shown is at the top of the stairs separate from the u it rather than directly attached to it. It wasn’t a problem at all, just a little something I didn’t realize and worth mentioning in case anyone misses it like I did. The neighborhood is quiet, very beautiful and close to most things in town. Highly recommend staying at Lori’s!"

Lori has great attention to detail and anticipated any problems by having helpful signs and clear, concise instructions for TV, house rules, checkout etc. Lori really thinks of everything, so you can relax and feel right at home. The apartment was immaculately clean, and we loved the fun vintage decor. Plenty of room for 2 adults, as long as you aren't over 6' tall, as the ceilings are low. No problem for me and my 5' 10"" husband. The bed was comfortable, the office nook was handy and the wifi connectivity was good. The kitchen was well equipped for small scale cooking. The bathroom was very clean, well-lit and the shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water and ample towels. Though the apartment is in the basement it is quiet, and it feels cozy and snug, not gloomy. There is also lovely sunroom upstairs, and a garden area outdoors, plus BBQ and fire pit. Early March isn't the best time of year for being outside, so we'll have to come back to make the most of those features :) The location worked well for our activities in Madison, everything was less than a 20 minute drive. In warmer weather we would definitely go check out the lake and the nearby bike trail. Overall, we couldn't have had a more pleasant stay and we hope to come back again--Many Thanks again, Lori!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori’s place was great for me. I especially enjoyed the sunroom and the beautiful view of her garden.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lori....and Lori's place were great. Wonderful location, clean and thoughtful space, and great hospitality. We would recommend to all."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very, very clean and highly recommended. We stayed at Lori’s place for about ten days and it’s really an excellent experience. Lori is an artist and has good taste in decorations, she is very careful and prepare almost everything you may need in the bathroom. The place is so clean that even then kitchen sink is always sparkling. There is also an-amazing sunroom and a beautiful garden here, it’s really cool to sit in the sunroom and listen to the music, especially in rainy days. Will be back someday."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, beautiful yard. We loved our stay at Lori’s AirBnb. Will remember it for future weekend get aways"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lori's comfortable, attractive, spotlessly clean basement apartment.
The kitchen had a full-size refrigerator and was well stocked with cookware; the bathroom included toiletries and other thoughtful touches; and the apartment included a large desk/workspace area, comfortable beds, and a large TV.
We appreciated having a parking spot in the driveway, and liked being in a peaceful, leafy neighborhood just a quick drive from downtown Madison."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and comfy.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at Lori’s place. Very nice and clean living space, great kitchen, and the home was in a quiet and peaceful area. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Madison/Monona area."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lori hosts a marvelous place to stay while visiting Monona or Madison. Very comfortable, very clean, very well laid out. My wife and I spent a week there while visiting our daughter. It was very convenient for us as she lives only a couple of blocks away. It's also a quick drive to the airport, restaurants, groceries, etc.
The space itself is well laid out with comfortable furniture. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, pots, pans, and the like. There's a stove, oven, and microwave. Coffee machine and tea kettle as well. A nice large TV if you're into TV.
Some other reviews mention the two low spots in the ceiling. And they are there! But I'm 6'2"" and experienced no problems or head bumps.
We will definitely contact Lori next time we're staying in Monona or Madison!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in Monona. The basement apartment met all of our needs. We would definitely stay again.
2019-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The space is cozy and inviting, the stairs were a bit short in the step depth so you feel as if you're falling forward and the ceiling height is low but these were the only concerns. The kitchen space was well stocked and the bed was a dream! The office space came in very handy as well! Overall I enjoyed my time here."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable and homey area, close to town and wonderful host."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was perfect for our weekend in Madison! The apartment has everything one would need to be comfortable, and the beds are very comfortable! The neighborhood is quiet, but vibrant with people out walking and biking. We enjoyed our stay very much!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little suite in a great location.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend exploring Madison. Lori's place was very clean and cozy. The beds were super comfy as well!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, make sure you know that the apartment is in the basement. Great strating point for the bike trail around Lake Monona."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was perfect in so many ways. Absolutely will be coming back again. Plenty of space, very quiet, very comfortable."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great stay! It was a lovely stay away from the busy downtown area during the Ironman event. It allowed all of us to get away from it and enjoy some downtime in preparation for the big day. Very easy to get downtown or to other places. We loved Rossi's Pizza and Vintage Arcade! Also the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic church is a block away to walk and lovely. Thank you Lori!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and clean place in a great location.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very well located and beautifully decorated spot with an exceptionally comfortable bed. Be aware that it is in the lower level but there is a wonderful garden and sun porch available to use as well.
2019-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I appreciated Lori's relaxed attitude and the energy she put into making us feel welcome. The well-appointed kitchen area and the apartment's proximity to Lake Monona were particular pluses.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, very clean and quiet! Great weekend spot."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great experience at Lori's place. It was clean, comfortable, and the perfect location for our trip."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori’s apartment was awesome. Super clean and filled with tons of information about the area.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing space to relax and unwind in a fantastic part of the city. Short drive from Madison central means you're not far from a million things to do - but equally away from the noise of the city.
Lori is so lovely and quick to respond/help out. Gave us great suggestions on where to go/what to do, and (hopefully it goes without saying) has an incredible home. It made the jet-lag that bit easier to deal with."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So clean and so hospitable with extra touches like food in fridge. Easy come and go.
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lori was friendly and eager to make us feel at home. We especially enjoyed the sun room and garden and all the comforts provided by our host.
2019-07-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Lori was very helpful and responsive. The garden is lovely, as is the sun room. However, the Airbnb description does not really make it clear that this is a basement apartment. It has almost no natural light, and if you have to spend much time there during the day it is a bit depressing."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was a great host; greeted us and gave us great suggestions! The space was perfect for us for a long weekend, we loved being able to cook for ourselves a few times, and Lori had easy to follow information/instructions for everything in the space. It is also a great location; 15 minutes to capitol square, UW campus, and more. We got lucky being there over the 4th of July; we were just a few blocks from the Monona fireworks and festival, making it an easy walk. Definitely plan to stay again the next time we are in Madison!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's basement apartment was a quiet, comfortable spot to see Madison! We were able to wake up, put laundry in, make coffee in the kitchen, sit in the sunroom out back and enjoy the beautiful garden as we planned our days exploring in the city. It is close enough to take walks around scenic Lake Monona, yet still be a 10-minute drive from being in Madison. The driveway parking spot and separate entrance allowed us to come and go during the day in between seeing Williamson St., State St., the State Capitol, both Monona Terrace and Memorial Union Terrace. Lori was communicative and provided instructions for anything we needed. We would gladly stay again!"
2019-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment is stylishly decorated and was very clean. The queen/full bed was comfortable. The place was easy to find, and Lori was helpful getting us checked in. There was a bit of a moldy smell in the basement, where the apartment is. We turned the dehumidifier on in the hallway, but this only partially helped. It should really be located in the apartment."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's garden apartment is a beautiful, comfortable, quiet apartment in the basement of her home, artfully furnished and wonderfully cool during the hot summer days. It has its own entrance, a little kitchen that has all the appliances and equipment we needed for making meals, and many thoughtful touches such as purified water in the fridge and nice quality towels in the bathroom. A wonderful benefit is the private use of a sun room overlooking the beautiful garden, from which Lori actually gave us a couple of plants to bring home!
Monona is a lush residential neighborhood and Lori's home is not far from the Olbrich Gardens. We came to Madison to visit our son who lives near downtown and the Capitol, which was about a 15-20 minute drive away.
We highly recommend Lori's place!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location, close to everything. If you are much over 6 ft tall it may be a little cramped, otherwise very comfortable."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was a wonderful and very helpful and kind host to me as I am having some difficult back problems.
She was very creative in finding solutions to accommodate my issues .
Her place is spotlessly clean , and the garden is just lovely and serene.
Would highly recommend."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was absolutely perfect for our needs the weekend of the Ironman 70.3 race. She was available to answer questions, she offered helpful suggestions on great places to eat or grab a drink and listen to music. The garden setting, with table and chairs was perfect for morning coffee and meals and time to just chill out and relax. She gave us directions for the bike path and how to get around town. She was so very considerate and kind. She helped make our experience in Madison and race experience amazing and wonderful!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dear Travelers,
We gave Lori the Ganzlin-Kilmer FIVE STAR GOLD AWARD, she could not have improved on anything, she achieved perfection in our opinion. Lori's guest suite and our visit was without a doubt the most wonderful Airbnb experience to date. I will also admit we have pretty high standards, Lori surpassed them all! :-)
Lori's guest suite is absolutely stunning, spotless, magically decorated like only Lori could do, I mean AMAZING décor! The bathroom is very roomy and spotless, the kitchen is perfect, spotless, well equipped right down the very thoughtful delicious breakfast items she provided.
Lori's beautiful glassed in sunroom was just that and so much more! Enjoying a glass of wine in her sunroom, and being in the middle of her amazing English Garden truly made us feel like royalty! My husband enjoyed an early career as a landscaper, we both marveled at how beautiful her garden was, AND, she did every single thing herself! It was truly magic.
While we were in the middle of town, we felt like we were in a little piece of heaven, it was so quiet and peaceful.
The best part was meeting Lori! We loved our visits, Lori is amazingly talented and has a beautiful heart and a warm welcoming smile.
We felt at home from the minute we arrived. :-)
Thank you Lori, you are invited to visit us in the Bay Area anytime, we look forward to our next visit.
Until then, THANK YOU LORI so many hugs coming your way.
Jules and Stephen
Fremont, California"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was perfect for a girls trip to Madison. Lori was easy to reach, extremely welcoming and the apartment is full of really thoughtful touches. The iron and extra toothbrush saved my life!
The porch area is gorgeous and we spent both mornings just drinking coffee and relaxing in the garden. I’ll definitely seek this place out next time I visit Madison!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Lori’s! We found it last minute after we cancelled a camping trip due to weather, and it was affordable and impressive. The apartment is very comfy and welcoming, with cute vintage decor and plenty of spare blankets (always something I love). The entire space was clean as a whistle, and everything you could ask for was provided. There is a queen bed, a twin bed, a working space with a printer, a cozy chair and a small breakfast table. Lots of storage space!
The kitchen sported a full coffee/tea set up, cookware and even some breakfast items in the fridge. We felt so at home that we chose to make dinner in both nights, rather than going out! There is a cute sunroom and amazing garden with seating to enjoy your morning meal.
The bathroom was fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner, lotion and body wash. Spare towels aplenty, a hairdryer and a basket full of emergency personal care items like tampons, a toothbrush, etc. It was a great touch!
Our absolute favorite thing about our stay was the amazingly comfortable bed! It was so cozy that we wished we were staying an extra day. Lori provided a space heater to keep us comfortable, and it was heaven. also the TV is huge and super fancy - we brought along our Roku so we could watch the Game of Thrones finale!
All in all, we give it an A+. Lori was just a message away and made sure we had all of the information we needed for our stay. Stay here!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is incredibly hospitable and her home is immaculately clean. We appreciated the level of detail and artistry she has put into decorating the home and garden. She was a gracious host and very accommodating. We brought our bicycles to enjoy Madison and Lori generously allowed us to keep them safe in her garage overnight. The location is peaceful, calm and convenient. Monona Bait & Ice Cream shop is only a short walk away!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, newly renovated, very clean apartment in historic building. Best shower ever in an Airbnb! Very comfortable bed. We ended up eating out, but kitchen is fully equipped should you want to cook. Appreciated the electric tea kettle for late-night tea. And on top of all that, Shaun runs a great cafe on the bottom floor of the building where we got fresh-baked scones or muffins — and free coffee! — for breakfast each morning. Very convenient and nice not to have to pick up breakfast supplies at the grocery store (or toss left-over food at the end of our stay). My only regret is that we didn’t have a chance to try out the ice cream parlor. Free coffee plus baked goods and ice cream on the premises — what more could you want?!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a value! The space was fun and unique. We felt so welcome with kids and our dog. We loved the neighborhood. The coffee shop and ice cream were such a fun treat. Everything was simple and organized. Loved the easy parking. We will absolutely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was my second stay here and once again Shaun made me feel like I was home. Very friendly and helpful! I’ll definitely be choosing this place whenever it’s open and I’m headed to Madison!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for 4 nights to meet friends in Madison. Easy parking, quiet friendly neighbourhood ( the train did pass once during the night but not a problem for us). Really good cafe below useful for coffee, cakes, breakfast and sandwiches. Good area for my 5k run and for walking and cycling."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shaun's place was very clean, nicely appointed , and convenient location from Madison on a very busy weekend! Shaun provided detailed instructions and getting coffee from the cafe downstairs was a plus! McFarland is a cute, quiet, little town. Ice cream place next door was great too!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the peaceful space. It was cozy, had everything I needed to unwind and get good rest. The bed was a 10 out of 10 (coming from just having recent spine surgery)!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place with everything you could need! Instructions were clear and Shaun responded quickly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very quiet stay in the historic McFarland house. Thank you!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely perfect for what I needed: A nice, little hideaway in the heart of McFarland. Shaun was communicative and helpful, and I would love to stay again when I am back in town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Historic building, heart of McFarland."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved how clean and beautiful everything was! I loved getting to walk down and have coffee and breakfast right there! The staff was so kind and told me my purple tipped hair was “on point” when I really needed that compliment! Thank you so much! I’ll be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Cool historic location, we had a great time in the area for the weekend! I would recommend for anyone looking for a relaxing weekend or vacation!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The space is everything you need for a quick visit. Quiet, cozy, easy to find. and the cafe downstairs is a great plus. Not a huge space but it has everything you need for a short trip. We brought our dog and there are good places to walk including a gorgeous dog park about a mile away. A local tavern and pizza joint are next door as well which was was helpful when I wasn’t able to drive for dinner one night, cute little walkable town. We would stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice cozy and clean space! We loved the cafe in the McFarland house and the employees were very nice. We loved the heated fan in the bathroom! Downstairs neighbors were a little loud but that is expected when sharing walls. Would definitely stay here again and there was a fun pub right next door!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cozy and clean with great cafe below. Owners very responsive and helpful!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! I hope to visit again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay. It was really clean and modern and had everything we needed for the weekend. The cafe on the first floor was great too. There was a great walking path nearby that we and our dog also enjoyed. I would stay here again in the future. Thanks for a great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful private stay in the sweetest little town. With the cafe downstairs, everything you need is in one building!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaun was very responsive and informative during the whole process. The loft was very comfortable and felt like home. Amazing coffee and food downstairs as well. Can’t say enough good things about the loft! Would definitely recommend to anyone, 10/10!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time staying here! Shaun was always helpful, flexible, and responded quickly. For being above a coffee & breakfast place, you couldn't hear anything from there. And it was great to have a very convenient place to have breakfast!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoy staying at the McFarland house. Really enjoyed the coffee from the coffee shop downstairs. The place was clean perfect for two people would not recommend more than that. If you are a light sleeper, then you might not want to stay here on a Friday or weekend as the bar next-door has loud music which can be heard in the apartment. One more thing I’m not sure if this was on the description. The apartment is on the third floor with very narrow staircase so if you require handicap accessible, this is on the third floor. Lastly, Shaun was accommodating on my check in time and check out which I appreciated since I had some delays."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,quick stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful sty and very comfortable. We will be back
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute 3rd floor private apartment. Just as described. Clean and cozy.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great two night stay here! The space was clean and comfortable. Shaun was great at communicating. He made sure we were able to check in easily and that there was nothing we needed to enjoy your stay. Excellent space and hosts!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second stay at McFarland House. Enjoy the quiet location with easy access to Madison
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy and comfortable. Great place to spend a couple of nights. Food in cafe tasty and reasonably priced. Would stay here again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed for nye. We initially used it to get a little closer to devils head resort which was about a 45min drive, then ended up doing a little exploring around as well. If you stay here I highly suggest heading downstairs to the cafe for a coffee and a sandwich. Not only was everyone soo welcoming and nice but both sandwich and coffee were very delicious. Everything was just right from the clear instructions before we got there to packing up and hitting the road! Thanks for such a pleasant stay"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The McFarland House is a beautiful historic location with the lofts being a brand new renovation. It’s a charming mix of classic and modern for an excellent price. And having the cafe downstairs is just an added bonus!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at the McFarland House! Would 100% come back if I’m ever in the area again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay at the McFarland House! We needed a landing pad for a week while we had some work done on our house, so their flexibility with accommodating pets was so much appreciated. And on top of that, the apartment itself was cozy, clean, and a perfect place to work remotely during the week! The cafe downstairs was a huge bonus too! 10/10 would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really comfortable place with a great cafe downstairs!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very nice, easy to find/access, and Shaun was very responsive to all questions we had. I would recommend staying here!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and comfortable place to stay, really enjoyed having a coffee shop just downstairs to grab morning coffee on the way out for the day. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do in the Madison area. Very friendly and helpful hosts, would definitely recommend for a cozy getaway!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a wonderful weekend and the apartment was perfect. The apartment is on the top floor of the McFarland House. It is adorable and very thoughtfully laid out. My family of 4 and two dogs had plenty of space. There are plenty of items in the kitchen, bathroom, blankets and pillows for the stay.
Added bonus Shaun owns the cafe downstairs. Very easy to get a coffee in the morning if you don’t want to make it, and the panini sandwiches at lunch were very tasty.
We also had the pleasure of meeting Shaun in the cafe. He couldn’t be more friendly and had great recommendations of things to do.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"lovely space, tickled by history. very quiet and peaceful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic. Loved the coffee shop downstairs. Great food and prices without having to leave the rental property. McFarland is small but nice and the train did not wake us. It was a welcome change of scenery from campus and we will stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This apartment was beautiful! Our family of 4 + dog were very comfortable. The bed was excellent, the kitchen was lovely and well-appointed, and parking and driving in and out were super easy. We loved the coffee and food at the café downstairs, too. Thanks so much!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the space, it was exactly as described. It’s a great location not far from Madison. We’d definitely stay there again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Shaun's for a week. I was returning to the Madison area after having lived there for years, so I was well aware of the community I was choosing--a small town that was close to everything, but still a peaceful small town. The thing that struck me the most about the lodging was what an incredible job they had done with updating a beautiful old building. Appliances and all utilities were absolutely state of the art, without harming the feel of the space. I will look for this host the next time I visit the Madison area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at McFarland House for a week exploring the Madison area. It truly felt like a home away from home to relax and the cafe/ice cream right downstairs was a bonus perk. Until you actually leave the room, you’d never guess it was downstairs! If we visit Madison again, we will definitely seek our this spot again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint Airbnb nestled atop a cafe. There is a ceiling fan in the bedroom! Similar to a need and breakfast experience but more private
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice space! Shaun is a great host! Very responsive. Perfect for a get away!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, well-appointed, and spacious place! Bed was super comfortable and kitchen was well stocked.
Something to consider, though — despite being on the third floor and not street-facing, you will hear traffic and car noise. Because the location is next to a railroad track, you can hear and feel the rumble every time a car drives over the tracks. Additionally, the bar next door plays music loudly outside until bar close.
If you’re a light sleeper, being ear plugs and a white noise machine.
Other than the outside noise, the place is great."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Shaun’s place is very clean and super comfortable! Very modern with a rustic flooring-loved it! Felt right at home. There was a train that went through a couple times during the night, but I fell right back to sleep because the bed is so amazingly comfortable! Shaun even checked in with me to make sure I got in on the first night and the next day to see
How my first night was. Very proactive host and responds quickly! Great place to stay near Madison! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. Nice and quiet place but close to Madison where there is so much to do. The coffee shop/cafe was so enjoyable we visited a few times!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host gave us the code for the gate and room in advance, so check-in was very easy and private and private.The room is clean and beautiful, fully equipped with kitchen facilities, all brand new, with a variety of condiments and utensils, it is very convenient.The bed and living room sofa are very comfortable, the TV shows are abundant, and sometimes I just want to stay in this cozy house without going out.The host is very nice. We accidentally stained the bath towels with color and are willing to pay for it. The host said that we didn't need to pay for it at all, and let us worry about it. It really touched us!Guests can enjoy complimentary coffee at the cafe downstairs every day, and every clerk is very friendly.Anyway, it was a particularly perfect stay and I will choose this place next time I come to Wisconsin."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at McFarland House couldn't have been better! The space was cozy, comfortable and immaculately clean. We loved the convenience of having private parking, a bike path right across the street as well as the delicious cafe and ice cream shop downstairs. McFarland House was only a 10 minute drive from all the attractions of downtown Madison. We would recommend this AirBnb to anyone and stay again in the future if we're in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great spot! cafe downstairs made it feel like a boutique hotel

Between the delightful coffee shop downstairs and the lovely, friendly pace of the surrounding neighborhood, my time was restful and so fun.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! We loved being in McFarland and staying here! The unit was extremely clean and comfortable! We loved the cafe and delicious food and coffee right here! We would love to stay here again when we return to town!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely LOVED our stay at the McFarland House! Everything was perfect! Very clean (not to mention cozy!) space, tons of amenities made our stay so simple and the cafe staff downstairs was so friendly.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaun and Jess were so unbelievably kind and helpful! He reached out shortly after booking the place to see what all questions I may have prior to arriving, overall they were simply beyond outstanding! We 100% would love to come back just to experience this kind of wholesome environment again!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay! Unit is nice and private, right above a lovely coffee shop. McFarland is a cute little town that reminded me of Stars Hollow from Gilmore Girls, except for the dive bar next door serving Spotted Cow and cheese curds!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"McFarland is conveniently located just outside of Madison and perfect for our visit there & surrounding areas.
Our loft apartment was perfect for our needs - very clean, comfortable & quiet, plus loved our hosts’ cafe located on the ground floor. Excellent coffee!
All in all a wonderful “home away from home”!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Shaun's. It was clean and comfortable. It's always great to have a nice place to stay when traveling with our dog. There were lovely places to walk the dog nearby. We didn't spend much time in McFarland as we were visiting friends in Madison most of the time, but it seemed to be a very peaceful area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely workaction at this picturesque b&b. It's close to a beautiful bike path that leads straight to downtown Madison. Shaun was super responsive, and we had everything we could have wanted."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and worked well for a stay near Madison that I was also able to work at during the week. Cafe downstairs was a very nice amenity and the park across the street was a great place to walk our dog.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot super close to everything!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I both thought this was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever had. The place was adorable and perfectly appointed, and it was such a perk to be located in the same building as the café; we made a lot of trips up and down the stairs for coffee and delicious eats! Without a doubt, this is the spot to stay if you’re spending time in the Madison area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Really enjoyed our McFarland House stay and Shaun was a really excellent host. We're hoping to stay here next time we're visiting Wisconsin! Thanks again, Shaun!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay. Shaun was very responsive and friendly. The unit was large and thought it was a great deal. I was a bit skeptical as the unit neighbors a bar patio and train tracks but ended up being a nice, quiet and peaceful getaway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaun's apartment was beyond my expectations! The bed was so soft and comfy that it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. The apartment was extremely clean, and Shaun provided all the kitchen and cleaning supplies that I needed. I loved the close proximity to downtown Madison and how easy it was to find parking right in front of the building every night. The only issue was that the building is right next to some train tracks, and there was the occasional late-night freight train, so just be aware if you're a light sleeper. Besides that, Shaun made me feel so comfortable and welcome at the McFarland House, and I really appreciated him proactively reaching out to me halfway through my stay to see if I needed anything. I would absolutely stay here again in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a wonderful time! The nicest, cleanest air bnb I’ve ever been to. AND it is in the same building as a coffee shop (that serves delicious food too!) what more could you want??"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, pristine apartment located on the third floor of an historic house. Parking was very easy. The cafe on the first floor has great food and coffee, plenty of vegetarian options. The host was very responsive and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here whether you're planning on staying local or taking the short drive to Madison."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the cutest and most delightful AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed in. Shaun’s space was adorable and fulfilled all of our needs for a wedding weekend in Madison. 10/10!!!

I look forward to many more stays here in the future!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay very much. I only had a few minor issues but they were pretty minor (ran out of hot water fast, uncertain about parking location and the unavailability when it was busy, recycling full of stuff from previous visitors, difficult to watch TV in bed). Extremely clean and very well maintained. Quiet. Easily accessible to downtown area which was a huge plus for me without having to be right in the heart of Madison. Felt very safe. Hopefully I can return again soon to visit so I can experience more of the town!"

The neighborhood was cute with a small commercial area and library. The unit was pristine, beautifully furnished, and just the right size for our family, including our dog! The cafe and good coffee in the morning, just downstairs, were a great added perk to the property."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Space was exactly what we needed with a fully functioning kitchen. Our teenage kid enjoyed his first snow.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great. The attic was charming with rustic furniture and it was recently renovated and looks great.

What a wonderful AirBnB expedience: great linens, comfy bed, clean and tastefully decorated. Communication with Shaun was ideal- he is a natural host, warm, friendly and kind.

Comfy bed, plenty of space, great kitchen, and spacious shower. Plus, the nice little touches (towels, hair dryer, even a dog bed) were much appreciated.
Also, we didn’t expect the coffee shop on the first floor to be as amazing as it was. Full breakfast menu, lunch menu, plus tasty coffee drinks, beer, wine, etc. Service was great, food/drink was delicious. Really a nice “bonus” to have during our stay.
Would stay again in a heartbeat!"

The neighborhood is ideally located for those looking to explore the isthmus. Parking is safe and easy - directly next to your apartment entrance. The house is on a quiet tree lined street with walkable access to both lakes. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed.
As a bonus, Jennifer and her family invited my dog up to their home when I was away at dinner to keep him company. (With my permission, of course). A lovely family and a lovely stay! We’ll be back!"

The kitchen was well stocked and had all the basic necessities. Jennifer had some thoughtful family friendly touches in the space as well- outlet covers, pack n play with crib sheets, and some small children’s toys. Would love to stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place in a great part of town. Jennifer was an awesome host and quick to respond to any questions. Would 100% stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy access and Jennifer communicated fast and checked in during our stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here! I wish I could transport this to every place we travel. Jennifer welcomed us and was quick to respond to our requests. The place was comfortable and had everything our family of four needed. They even pulled out an extra bed so we all had our own comfy place. Hope to stay again and highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer was very welcoming and a good communicator. The downstairs space was comfortable, and it was generally quiet in the evening and early morning. The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was nicely updated, and the kitchenette was a nice touch. The space is very, very clean. The neighborhood was quiet and safe, and it was fairly walkable to lots of bars/restaurants around the capitol."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was an amazing host and made us feel welcome as soon as we arrived. The house was very clean, comfortable, and had anything you should need. Amazing hospitality and went above and beyond to help us out with needs during our stay.
Thank you again from us, and of course, Wyoming!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a visit to Madison. I was with my high school student for a visit to UW-Madison. It is exactly as listed, clean and comfortable."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We meet briefly but great family people and overall a great experience.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute flat in amazing location. Host is incredibly friendly and responsive
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for being tourists. Centrally located to interesting places and quiet, simple, and clean. Jennifer was a great host."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer’s place was perfect for our visit to Madison on our daughter’s My UW day! Bed was super comfortable, the neighborhood is conveniently located about a mile from campus and the bus was a breeze to catch, just 2 blocks away. Wish we could have spent more time at the cute shops nearby. Jennifer greeted us and was very helpful with suggestions!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall 10/10 stay! The place looks even better than the pictures! Luxurious linens, pillows, bed. I even asked for the store Jennifer got some of the items! Incredible location, walking distance to lots of cool spots! Shower was heavenly and the ability to use the laundry machine was great. Many Airbnb’s request you to do many chores despite a cleaning fee, whereas this rental only asks you to clean your dishes. There are a few suggestions I may have to make this space incredible- it is listed as self check in, however, Jennifer asks to meet with you/greet you prior to checking in and giving you the code. It is a safety measure that I totally respect- it looks like other reviewers appreciate being greeted. However, I had a busy day, didn’t check airbnb inbox to see that this meeting was required prior to receiving the code. My in laws got there early & had to wait. I also recommend mounting the antenna to the wall and including directions for the tv, as we were having signal issues."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we loved this place! It was perfect and just private enough but so close to downtown that we couldn't have asked for more. Not only was this place even cuter in person but the beds were super comfy and great water pressure in the showers too! Kitchen has all the amenities you could want, including a hot plate. There's a great corner store less than a block away to get little grocery needs. Johnson Public House had some of the best breakfast sandwiches we've ever had and great coffee to start the days too! Hosts were super nice and flexible, even let us park in driveway - we'll definitely be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great bnb with lots of fun things to do in the area. very clean and comfortable space.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My colleague and I came to Madison for a full week on work travel and wanted the local experience. This place did not disappoint! Nestled in a sweet residential neighborhood walking distance to supermarkets, small businesses, lakeside parks, and nightlife, this home was the perfect balance of privacy and access to the Capitol area. Jennifer was incredibly accommodating, greeting us upon check-in and responding immediately with any questions while granting us the space to feel at home. We loved the thoughtful, tasteful design of each room and truly will miss staying in this comfortable, practical, rejuvenating space!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Convenient, clean and just right for our needs."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We decided to make a last minute trip to Madison which meant we had to bring our dogs with because they didn't have boarding plans. Jennifer's place was absolutely perfect - we walked to the lake with the dogs every morning and it was comfortable and clean. Jennifer was so kind and met us when we checked in, offered coffee shop advice, and was willing to make more recommendations as needed. Excellent host and excellent stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are a family of four adults, in town to visit extended family. Jennifer's place was absolutely perfect for us in every way.
The thing we loved most was the generous selection of really great cafes within walking distance because we are a cafe family. We especially enjoyed Johnson Public House, which sounds like more of a restaurant/pub, but in reality it is an excellent cafe.
We are also a thrifting family, and we were wowed by a thrift shop called Upshift, just a couple blocks from Jennifer's place.
Jennifer's place is comfy and cozy and pleasant and well equipped."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a terrific spot to stay and served as a great homebase for our Madison adventures!

We always appreciate bed side lamps! Cozy and chic seating area with luscious area rug and large television. Beautiful bathroom. Everything was new and sparkling clean. The basement level was not a negative factor due to the high ceilings and good lighting. We didn’t prepare any meals, so we didn’t miss a stove/oven. The fridge, microwave and electric kettle were everything we needed. Really cute place in a great location. We highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was clean and cozy. Jennifer was very responsive, gave is local recommendations, and even lent us her child’s old snowsuit when we forgot one. This place was great!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's in Madison. We were there for both a conference and for a UW campus tour for our high school aged daughter. The location was perfect - just a 10 minute drive from campus and we could walk to shops in the neighborhood. The basement level private floor was very well finished and comfortable, with a private entrance that was easy to access and parking right by the front door for one car. WiFi and TV worked well, and though the kitchen space was small, it had everything we needed. The one bathroom had a good shower. You could hear some noise through the roof from upstairs, but it was not that loud and we got used to it by our second day. Jennifer and her family were very nice and great hosts. We would definitely stay there again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, new, well appointed space, with everything you could need- Jennifer is clearly a very thoughtful host who has made sure the apartment (new) was designed with all the best.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was great in communicating quickly to help us be confident with the rental in advance of our visit.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights here while in town for a wedding. Park your car and walk everywhere - coffee shops, restaurants, grocery + party stores and the Capital are all within walking distance. Everything was new and clean. We didn't cook but the kitchen was well stocked (even with spices!). The room darkening shades and quality bedding made for a good night's sleep. Jennifer was very responsive to our every request and even let us check out a bit late. Highly recommend this lovely home away from home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this cute 2 bedroom flat! The location is great in a quiet safe neighborhood within walking distance of the capitol square. Plenty of bedroom and shared living space to enjoy a comfortable stay rather than cramped in a hotel room. Easy access to the airport as well as highways to visit any spot in the greater Madison area and beyond. The hosts are wonderful people, kind and very attentive to questions as well as flexible to guest needs. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer’s place is a gem. Two bedrooms plus a rollaway bed made it comfortable for a small group. The pour over coffee maker, detailed guest guide, countless USB ports near the beds, comfy sitting area, and other thoughtful touches made it much more of a vacation than just a place to sleep. Jennifer and her family were fantastic; super polite, friendly, helpful and gracious as hosts. They don’t want to intrude on your stay and it shows with how much effort they’ve put into soundproofing the Airbnb space. We never once heard the family above us, not even footsteps. Please treat them and their space with the same respect they so obviously have put into being great hosts!
It’s a short walk to a great coffee shop nearby with excellent breakfast options. Admire the neighbors koi pond and generally beautiful neighborhood along the way.
Thank you Jennifer, we loved our stay."

There were great touches like extra comforters, plenty of towels, and a blanket in the living room. I would definitely stay again."

Parking was on the street and difficult at times- need to follow signs about what side of street to park on for which day, etc However, owners were very helpful with parking advice when we couldn't find a spot during an event at a local field.

Easy check in and check out.
Children were not loud at all and a very pleasant addition.
The location is accurate and just a bit too far to walk to and from campus—If that is important to you—which it has been for us. Jennifer and her husband were v welcoming."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great trip to Madison. Jennifer's basement apartment was perfect for us -- we brought our almost-four-year-old and our 6 month old baby. She provided a pack n play and even toddler utensils. Beds and pillows were unusually comfortable. Sound machines in each bedroom provided some great white noise for the baby's sleep. Also great to have a washer and dryer for baby things. It was easy to watch our children there. The central location (isthmus) was convenient for our purposes -- we were house hunting and towed our kids with us to 12 properties all around the Madison suburbs (every direction!). Great coffee nearby at Johnson Public House, and also within walking distance of some tasty restaurants. The only difficulty we had was trying to find diapers at 9pm. My husband ended up at some campus Target, then a Walgreens, both of which only catered to college students. We were probably just looking in the wrong places. Very glad to stay at this home, and would definitely recommend her place for families like ours!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a great host to work with and the apartment had everything you would need for a great stay in Madison. Very comfortable beds and everything up to date and modern. Walking distance from many stores and sites and a very safe neighborhood.
Highly recommend!"

Kitchen appliances, dishware, and utensils were just what we needed and all in good shape. The location is excellent, with easy access to shops and restaurants. Jennifer is friendly and helpful. It was a pleasure to meet her and her family. We will definitely try to stay in this gem of an airbnb when we are in Madison again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was incredibly communicative and helpful throughout the booking process. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it on this trip at the last minute and so wasn't able to see the space personally. But two other guests on the booking said it was really lovely, and that Jennifer was very hospitable. Wonderful experience!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay in the heart of Madison, fully equipped and nice, communicative, thoughtful hosts. Is stay there again in a heartbeat."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The garden apartment was the perfect place to stay when visiting our son at UW Madison.

The family does live upstairs and do have little kids. As kids do, they run around and play. You'll slightly hear the stomping of the kids throughout the day but never in the night. They also let you know to contact them if the noise is bothersome. Very nice hosts."

Lastly, the induction cook top was perfect, we were able to cook multiple meals using it. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The listing's very accurate! The space is incredibly convenient to many locations, but still in a quiet neighborhood, and the high ceilings and copious amounts of light make it feel very spacious.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far one of the best experiences I’ve had staying at an Airbnb. This flat is spotless clean, cozy, and supplied with everything you’ll need for a comfortable stay.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location is nothing shy of perfect; walking distance to fun but tucked away enough from street noise. The unit itself is clean and spacious. Jennifer was a stellar host who I will absolutely go back to the next time I’m in Madison!

2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came to Madison for the Ironman Triathlon and stayed in Jennifer and Andrew’s home for 5 nights. We appreciated having all the toys for our young daughter and the backyard made our stay that much nicer. Check-in was super simple, and though the home shows its age, it added to the charm of being in such a cute city where most of the other homes are character/heritage houses. So we felt a bit like locals staying here. We didn’t get dirty feet from walking around in bare feet like some places we have stayed in. When we wiped the bathroom floor after a splash from bath time, the towel was clean. In other words, the place was very clean. We had plenty of hot water and the climate control is very efficient. Jennifer and Andrew were very generous in offering their spices and other cooking basics to us. They even offered to put up a child safety gate on the stairs for us, and provided a high chair. There is no microwave, but with a bit of planning, the toaster oven managed
the job fine. Thank-you for hosting us!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lovely Roscoe Chateau is one of a kind! You will instantly feel like you are at home and have all access to Madison at your fingertips. There are so many great places in walking distance from this home and we were grateful to get to take advantage of so many of them.
All amenities were provided and easy to use kitchen, bathroom. The only thing we regret is not being able to enjoy more time in the home with a backyard bbq or front porch happy hour!
Check in is easy as can be and Jennifer communicates perfect to lay out all information!
STAY HERE!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer and her husband's house is so charming. Beautifully decorated with such a cozy atmosphere and all the functionalities you need including a nice big terrace and garden. You really feel comfortably at home. The area is quiet and calm while the house is within working distance to center of town. I can also give all my warmest recommendations.
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,"Well decorated home in a good part of town. The host communicates clearly and effectively.
Our group had a blast."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredibly charming, cozy home! You cannot find a better location in Madison - everything you want or need is within walking distance! The house is cozy, with musical instruments in each room. A note of warning for any tv junkies - you won't find one here! We didn't miss it, and our family members who wanted to watch the games that were on during our stay found it a convenient reason to explore LJ's sports pub 2 blocks away. While the home does have 3 bedrooms, some of the beds leave something to be desired. Make sure you speak with Jennifer before booking if you have multiple people traveling who are particular about where they sleep."
2017-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location and a great hostess! We have 3 little kids (2, 4, & 6) and it couldn't have been a better spot for us. 1 block walk to two different playgrounds. Easy walk out to the grocery store. Nice double lot with plenty of space (and toys!) in the backyard. Super nice/helpful neighbors. Jennifer was great with the communication. Only drawback was the mattresses were softer than we would've liked. Other than that, it was great! Thanks again, Jennifer!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything as advertised. We were surprised we couldn't find a tv but who wants to watch tv when on vacation in such a fun town anyway? Fantastic outdoor space!! Conveniently located, comfy bedding and very kid-friendly."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely home to stay in, as well as an incredible location. It is prefect for families. We have two children under 4 and they were very comfortable here as were we. Our kids loved the play equipment outside, the books and musical instruments inside. We enjoyed two playgrounds within two blocks. This is a nice walkable area which we also enjoyed. The host does a great job at making you feel welcome with organic soaps, nice textiles and such a clean home. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this home to other families!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer's house was basically a dream house in a fantastic neighborhood in Madison. We had an absolutely lovely time staying in the place and would absolutely book again every single time we come to Madison if it is available. As a host Jennifer is incredibly welcoming and accommodating. The communication was quick and frequent. Truly fantastic space and host.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! We have two boys, so were looking for a kid-friendly home, and this place delivered! Our three year old enjoyed all of the toys, books, and instruments in every room, and spent lots if time in the backyard playing in the sandbox, on the swing set, and the see saw. I'd recommend it to a family who is looking to stay in a centrally located home in Madison!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's home is lovely. The living room/dining room have a pleasant spaciousness to them and the bedrooms are comfortable. The front porch is a delightful place to sit. Although we did not have an opportunity to use the deck with the gas grill, we wished we had! I recommend Jennifer's home to couples and to families with children. We stayed there with our adult offspring and had a marvelous time."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Charming house, and really nice neighborhood, and very clean. Lovely kitchen, nicely appointed (although we did not end up cooking). We'll be back!"

2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was an awesome host! She was extremely welcoming and her communication was amazing. The place was exactly as advertised. It's location is a great starting point for exploring Madison, or, if your so inclined to stay indoors, there is a cool selection of board games and instruments to pass the time. If we ever find ourselves in Madison we will definitely consider staying here again :)
Thanks again Jennifer!!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's home was a wonderful place to relax for a weekend in Madison. The beds were comfortable and warm, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the house is in a very convenient location to explore Madison. Jennifer was extremely responsive throughout the whole process and made our stay a breeze. Definitely recommend!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was wonderful to communicate with and her home was clean, warm and inviting. The location was very convenient and off street parking was an added bonus. We are already planning our next stay!"
2016-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great spot to stay in!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan’s place is a cozy, cute spot that is private but also easily walkable to walk/bike paths that take you into center of city. Uber/Lyft rides are about 15-20 min to center of city and always available. Close proximity to airport is also nice. Jordan was a very responsive host and loved our stay here."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Older house upstairs apartment renovated thoughtfully. Photos make the space look much larger than it is, but there was plenty of space for me and two teen girls. Very clean. Very comfortable beds, (loved that there was a King-size bed) all the amenities you need. Nice rack for hanging clothes, nice towels, I would totally stay here again. Only thing is I’m not sure how well my 6’3 husband and 6’4 son Would fit in the shower -you step UP into it Just think about that if you have tall family members!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan’s place was cute and affordable, in a really sweet part of town! The bike path nearby gets you all the way downtown and is a very pleasant walk"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jordan was very nice, and I really enjoyed my trip."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super responsive host. Very friendly and accommodating. Location is great to get around the city. Really enjoyed my stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan was very nice and friendly from the start of booking until check out. He setup an easy checking in and checking out process which was great after a long day of travel and also preparing for travel. Everything was explained very well in the instructions as well. The place is close on location to different things to do in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great private place to spend a few days, Friendly host who was accommodating, would stay again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordans place is so cute, quiet, and truly felt like home to me. Jordan was very proactive with communication before, during, and after the reservation.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's place was nice and in a quiet neighborhood close to downtown and the University of Wisconsin.
He was very responsive to any questions and offered to help with anything we needed to ask for.
I happened to find a very nice 3-mile bike path just a couple blocks from the house, which let me get a nice run in. The Starkweather Creek Path."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is small, clean, cozy, and just what I needed for a weekend in town. Great value for the price and I would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as advertised. Very clean and very comfortable. Apart from the occasional plane, it's in a quiet little neighborhood just off of East Wash & half a mile from a wonderful old-fashioned diner on Fair Oaks Avenue."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan was very responsive and helpful! Had a lovely stay at his loft!

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay here, Jordan is a very great host and is very responsive and welcoming, this place is only a 5 minute drive from downtown and a 3 minute drive to a 24hr grocery store called woodmans. One thing that matters to me is parking and I felt very safe parking my car on the street in this neighborhood"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall a safe and comfortable place to stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's place was exactly as advertised- a quaint, peaceful place to spend time with my daughter. There were no issues with anything. I made reservations a year ago and needed to cancel last year, so it was kind of the host to offer the place up again to us. Thank you for a cozy home base for our visit."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fave!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was overall happy with my stay, it was exactly what I needed and close by to the place I was training at so it was really nice to be walkable distance. I did have a little trouble figuring out how to work the heater initially and the space was quite cold when I got there but otherwise there were no issues! The host was kind and very responsive. Can definitely recommend as a sweet spot to stay in Madison!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay. Was private and quiet. I probably would not recommend for a very tall person due to slanted ceilings but luckily I am not one. Bed and pillows were very very cozy and clean, coffee was perfect and delicious, shower gets super hot!! (Love) also loved the electric fireplace, was a perfect addition."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great!

I felt very at home and welcome and I knew if I needed anything Jordan was available and would respond quickly. I recommend any of Jordan’s property. Definitely would stay again! Affordable and exactly as described. Thank you so much Jordan for making my stay stress free!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little place would stay again.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Jordan is one of the very best hosts I've dealt with. He obviously knows what he's doing and goes to great lengths to get the details right.
Jordan provided excellent instructions for check-in. There's a code-activated lock on the door, which worked perfectly until I inadvertently locked the deadbolt (when it was dark and getting cold. No problem - Jordan had me in in a few minutes).
The space was spotlessly clean and well-supplied with linens, towels, coffee, etc. I had a few questions about how things worked and Jordan replied with detailed answers in 5 minutes. Great host.
The neighborhood is OK...I called it walkable in the review but that's only true if you're willing to walk for 20 minutes to the supermarket. There is a great gym a 15-minute walk away and it's worth it (best gym I've ever seen).
The only negative comment is I don't think the place is a good value for what you get. Kind of a last-minute booking for me."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying with Jordan and I would happily return. Jordan is a reliable, friendly host. It's an attic level space, so as others have mentioned if you're very tall, watch your head. However, I find the compactness cozy and appreciate that the space has everything I need for a visit to Madison. The bed and sheets are very comfortable and the space heater/fireplace feature does the trick on a cold night. The location is really convenient to the trail system and parking is a breeze."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There was much to appreciate about Jordan’s Cape Cod BnB. Nightimes were very quiet, without much auto traffic and no airplanes in/out of the nearby Madison airport. (It should be noted that airplanes were loud during daytime, especially occasional flights of fighter jets.) Appliances worked well, and we enjoyed the wall-mounted electric fireplace for its light and warmth. The stairs were manageable, as pictured in the web views. But the shower could be risky for people with physical limits. We had some difficulty with the angled ceilings (it would be especially difficult for tall people). Bed and blankets were comfortable. Our only suggestion is that a basket of crackers or fruit would be nice for tired, hungry arrivals. There is coffee/tea, but one would have to run out for any food. The price was right and access was easy via the Schlage lock system."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience staying here! Jordan was quick to respond if I had any questions. The space was nice and most necessities were provided. Check out was so easy, and we didn’t have to clean up or do anything. As someone with a chronic illness and chronic pain, it made my morning so much easier not having to rush. It was quiet and easy to find. Would stay again!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great communication
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"loved the place and the host.
the ceiling are a bit low and but it is a loft and you do get used to that quick.
Jordan made our stay a great experience"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love your place, Jordan! Perfect location , we will definitely be back!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and Jordan was a very good host. The location is in the flight path of the airport, so there is a fair amount of noise from air traffic but it didn't bother us too much. I would consider staying here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan is a phenomenal host! He was more than accommodating, and the place is great. I crashed here with a friend while in town for a wedding, and it was perfect. I would highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have rented the whole house 2x and just needed an extra night when the downstairs wasn't available, so we took the upstairs alone. It's a great ""hotel"" space with some homey touches and more amenities than a hotel. I do think it would be helpful to know going in that this space has ample room in the sleeping/kitchen area. The shower is small (less than 3' square). The ceilings are slanted as it is the upstairs of a bungalow. It is accessible only by steps. I'm 5'6"" and had no issues with ceiling height or the shower. My husband is 6' and was unable to comfortably stand to use the toilet due to the pitch of the ceiling. It really is a perfect overnight accomodation."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan was extremely responsive and the location was as listed. I appreciate the accommodations Jordan made to ensure a wonderful stay. Easily accessible and near restaurants, coffee shops and local finds."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute loft space. Beds super comfortable! If you are over 6’ may want to be sure you are ok with slanted ceilings on side of loft. We didn’t hang out in space so was ok for our stay! Quiet neighborhood, easy access!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!
As advertised need to watch your head…not a big deal. Shower was small but the water pressure makes up for that.
Outdoor patio wonderful addition!!
Easy to bicycle from front door.
Lots of restaurants close by. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant time at this Airbnb. The slanted ceilings took some getting used to, but they were mentioned explicitly by the host and are a natural feature of the house. The outdoor patio area was a nice extra touch.This apartment would be great for a couple of friends coming from out of town that wanted to visit some students or the college itself."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, great location"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jordan’s place is in a nice neighborhood.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jordan's attic apartment. Jordan is a responsive, accommodating, and friendly host; heade sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We were attending a wedding nearby and thought the space was perfect for a weekend for two friends; it was an easy walk to Garver Feed Mill area which has cafes, restaurants, and a spa. The beds are very comfortable, nice linens, and the coffee set up in the kitchen was on point. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was working at University of Wisconsin for a couple days and Jordan’s place is just about a 13 minute east drive from campus. The loft was private, quiet, and easy to access! A great spot if you’re looking for something more comfortable and homey than hotel!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan’s space was very cozy and located in a peaceful area with lots of nearby convenience stores surrounding the neighborhood. He was very responsive and helpful in providing us with tips on how to get around in the area as well (: I’d definitely recommend checking out his spot if you’re planning a weekend trip in Madison!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and clean place, nice neighborhood, awesome location a short drive from everything you wanna do in Madison. This was a great place to stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was in town for a conference and needed last minute lodging, no regrets! This was a great stay with all amenities you need for comfortable, peaceful, stay. Would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"overall, my wife and I were very pleased, Jordan was a great host and when we visit Madison we'd be sure to look him up again. thanks for everything"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,exactly as described. Great value.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan's place was a beautiful oasis in an interesting neighborhood in Madison. I felt relaxed and refreshed when I was in it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was exactly as listed - private, peaceful, conveniently located and close to the bike trail system (which was our main reason for visiting Madison). Super easy check in/out and Jordan was very polite and responsive! We were traveling with just two people, but you could easily fit the max of 4 guests- there was a whole second bed we didn't even touch. Great value for the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for our girls weekend of cycling on Madison’s well marked bicycle trails. Jordon was super easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again, and we love that both beds were in the same room. It was like a slumber party for all three of us without the pillow fight lol."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication and space and a nice, quiet location"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a fantastic stay!! Jorden was a very nice host and allowed me to stay at his loft where it was very cozy and clean!! Definitely would stay again!!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's place was perfect for what we were looking for -- a comfortable and well-located spot, in a quiet neighborhood but close to the commercial areas on the east side of Madison. It was a quick Uber downtown. Jordan's communication was great, and check-in and check-out were a breeze."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely lovely stay at an absolutely lovely place. My friend and I were in town for a wedding and it was hard to find a place to stay as younger guests, even though we are the most calm people you will find. The place was exactly what we needed: places to sleep, a table to sit at and enjoy some farmer's market goodies, and a lovely outdoor space. The highlight was definitely the outdoor space. The two hanging chairs were especially nice to enjoy some tea on. There was plenty of street space for parking and check in was a breeze. Thank you Jordan for letting us enjoy one of my new favorite cities in such a welcoming place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Modest space that’s clean and affordable. Jordan’s a great conversationalist and super friendly. Would stay at one of his places again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great spot to relax! Beds are super comfortable, and the price was cheaper than anything else in the area. The bathroom is very small and there isn't a full kitchen (which we knew going into it), but overall it was a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's loft is a cute and comfortable stay on the East side. We had everything we needed for a short stay and the amenities were as described. Tall people, use caution! there are some places where it is easy to bump your head, as noted in the description. Jordan was very friendly and communicated clearly about check in and check out. Would book again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying with Jordan and very pleased. Quiet, clean apartment with very comfortable beds. Really like having a coded door so can arrive late without disturbing anyone. Would definitely stay again when in Madison."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was truly an amazing experience, I cannot recommend this place enough. You’ll have to drive quite a bit but all of the amazing places you can go makes up for it ten fold!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was so cozy and Jordan went above and beyond to ensure I had a great stay! On the morning I departed there was a snowstorm that buried my car in a foot of snow. He moved my check out time back so plows could get to the roads and he helped shovel my car out so I could leave safely. Thanks for making my first few days in Madison great, Jordan!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really good!̆̈ had a lot of different streaming services, shower was a little bit short so if you are tall keep that in mind. Really good price"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 2 nights at Jordan's. It was easy to get in. The whole place was extremely clean, more clean than most average hotel rooms. The beds and linens/blankets/pillows were all extremely comfortable and cozy. The internet worked great. The kitchen had a nice little set up and have everything we needed to get by for a couple of days. It isn't a very big space, but was cute and cozy to hang out in. The bathroom worked ok for us. The slanted ceiling would make the bathroom a little tight for someone who is tall. But, I it is doable. I am overall happy with this booking and would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the stay! Enjoyed the privacy!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was cute and exactly what we needed. Will definitely be back again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to lay your head. The area felt safe and you can not find a better price for that close to downtown Madison. The downstairs unit is also an airbnb but we didn't hear anything from our upstairs unit so it was very quiet. It was exceptionally clean, and the linens smelled nice and weren't startchy.
The loft is not gonna be a place you bring your friends to hang out nor was it meant to be. It is a small space, but it is exactly what I was expecting from the pictures. I'm 6'3"" so definitely had to watch my head when going up the stairs (and when going to the bathroom), but plenty of headroom for everything else.
The amenities were exactly as described and great! When we arrived into town it was 15 degrees, but the heater warmed up in no time and it was nice and toasty.
The host was very accommodating and responsive. The directions for checking in were simply and easy to follow.
If you're looking for a great place to lay your head in Madison this is the place!"

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Jordan was a very communicative host. The bed is incredibly comfortable and the shower has great water pressure.
Cons: The soundproofing between the first floor isn’t that strong and the downstairs neighbor was pretty loud throughout the night."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay here in Madison! The check-in instructions were very clear, and we had no issues finding the place or getting inside. The loft is very close to downtown Madison, and many of the Uber rides we took to restaurants or the popular shops were only around 10 minutes. It's also about 20 minutes away from the hospital, which was the main reason for my trip to Madison. The place itself looked just like the pictures, and it was so clean! The beds were very comfortable, the shower warmed up fast, and there were plenty of glasses and utensils to use! I highly recommend staying here."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent last minute stay! Everything was as described on website. Thank you!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's loft was a wonderful place for us to stay. Comfortable and cozy for a couple, and with the second bed, it would equally be as functional and appropriate for a family getaway!
Only minutes away from pretty much everything you could need, the loft is in a great location. Restaurants nearby? Check! Shopping close? You bet! Entertainment? Check out the Sylvee! Nightlife? Lots of cozy nightspots litter the nearby landscape! History? The Capitol building (and the surrounding area) is merely minutes away by car!
Jordan was an excellent host; we had the opportunity to chat with him on multiple days of our trip and he was always very gracious and kind. We loved the loft and hope to stay there again soon! Thanks, Jordan! :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay at Jordan’s! Such good communication, comfortable beds, and a great space! Thanks so much!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 14 month old son, and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jordan’s place. We were looking for an affordable place that met all our needs while in town for a family meeting, and this place did just that! It’s in a quiet neighborhood easily accessible to downtown and local restaurants.
We would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is very cute, clean, and comfortable. I ended up not being able to stay for a full week as I had planned, but Jordan was very understanding and accommodating. I highly recommend Jordan as a host!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan is a great host. Very communicative and helpful. Gave great recommendations and greeted us every time we ran into each other. Place is private and very clean. It definitely has parts where it is shorter but nothing unbearable. My 6ft husband didn’t have any troubles. The beds are spaced out enough from the ceiling so you don’t whack yourself when you get up. The bed was the softest and warmest bed we have stayed at ever! Plus you can open the windows if you want for a nice breeze.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan was a great host, very friendly and quick responses!
The listing was accurate to the photos provided. Easy check in and access. Comfortable bed. Fast wifi for working remote. Good base camp for visiting friends at UW.
Easy 10-15 drive to Capital/Campus area.
Thanks for having us!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and, 6 year old daughter, and I came to Madison for the weekend for a Badgers football game. We arrived Friday afternoon and stayed until Monday morning. Everything about the stay was so easy. Check in and check out, finding the place (even with construction all around the neighborhood), getting Ubers to pick up and drop off. It was close to everything. 15 minutes from Campus, about 10 minutes from the zoo, 55 minutes from New Glarus Brewing. We packed a lot of fun, and a lot of relaxing in the place, over the extended weekend. Will try to find this place again next time we come to town."

We were also able to walk to a few restaurants/bars and sites. The closest was a 7 minute walk (a Thai restaurant) and the furthest we walked was 30 minutes (olbrich Biergarten and botanical garden).

The beds were so comfy and the electric fireplace was the perfect touch! It was such a clean space and we really appreciated the reasonable price. We only got to meet Jordan very briefly (while he was shoveling the drive and stairs/entrance for us which we greatly appreciated), but he was awesome and helpful and quick with responses! It was only our second time using Airbnb so we still didn’t completely know what to expect, but this loft surpassed all expectations!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great spot. It might seem a little far from Downtown, but it's actually only a 15 minute bike ride, and an extremely pleasant one at that. There is an awesome paved off-road trail at the end of the street that takes you right into Downtown, and fortunately Jordan provides complementary bikes! So basically the entire City of Madison was my oyster! The complementary bikes enabled a week of joyful transportation in a new city, and surely saved me a ton of money on bus fare/rideshare.

Clean and well laid out, full of great amenities, and great hosts! I enjoyed the upper east parts of Madison nearby. There is a great arboretum and garden nearby as well as many small lakes and parks. Parking was never a problem. The kitchen was fully stocked making it easy to cook meals. The washer and dryer were also easy to access and a great asset. Thanks for hosting me and making my stay excellent!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fabulous time staying at Tim and Emily's house. It was sunny and inviting, a great place to hang out. And the coffee shop, bakery, and 2 restaurants less than a block away really added to our enjoyment. It does require jumping in the car to get to downtown or UWI but we knew that and the tradeoff of being in such a comfortable and walkable area was totally worth it. We'd definitely stay there again."

I suppose it worked, but it was nerve wrecking."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tim & Emily’s place was more than I expected! It was so welcoming and comfortable. I wish we were in Madison longer. Great location and they were so helpful with local information and checking in and out. Highly recommended!! Just loved it!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were traveling to Madison during a very intense heat wave with smoke/air quality advisories with our 2 senior pups and this place was great at not only keeping us cool but our elderly dogs.
The neighborhood was great to walk them around with the large shade trees. We thoroughly enjoyed being so close to different eating options as well. We walked to the coffee/pastry shop (Café Domestique) one morning then Ogden's North Street Diner the next (small, loud and def surrounded by regulars, but worth the wait. Next time we will try to hit the Young Blood Beer Company (inside same building the coffee shop is) and Tip Top Tavern since they too were only one block away and had a shaded dog friendly patio.
The unit was just what we were looking for. Cool, spacious, and in a quiet neighborhood. I made a couple recommendations while we stayed and the hosts noted them positively. There is def noise from the upstairs but it was stated in the listing when we booked so it was not a surprise."

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Tim and Emily’s place! It’s in a great neighborhood and is walking distance to parks, coffee shops, bars and restaurants and is short driving distance to downtown. You can’t beat the location! It already had a Pack and Play, mattress and sheets so it was nice to have one less thing to worry about. The house was very clean and cozy.
When we arrived, we parked in the driveway while we were unloading our car and received a message right away about not parking in the driveway. We were planning on moving the car after we unloaded but it made us feel like we were being watched."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 Stars! Tim & Emily’s place on Commercial Ave was perfect. My highest priority is clean, and it was super clean. Everything worked great, & it was decorated nicely. Kitchen has newer appliances and a coffee station with programmable coffee maker, which was a bonus. The 2 queen beds were both comfy, and there were lots of pillows. They even had extension cords on both sides of the bed to plug in our cell phones. Very thoughtful.
Plenty of street parking, and it’s in a great location. Easy access to downtown and the Beltline. Super cute house with door code to get in and out easily.
When we’re in Madison again, we will definitely look up Tim & Emily. Great hosts!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I enjoyed our stay at this quiet off the beaten path location. Very clean and super responsive hosts. Coffee shop close by makes this extra special. Try the “Morning Buns” and you’ll see why. Would recommend.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a terrific place. 10 minute drive to downtown. Spotless, very comfortable beds and furniture, fully stocked kitchen. I was visited my son at UW and it was important to me to be able to cook for him. The kitchen was absolutely set up for that. The host was extremely responsive and helpful.
The neighborhood was pretty quiet, with a terrific coffee place and high-calibre diner (open only for breakfast & lunch), literally on the next corner.
It was very easy to work remotely here as well.
Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you don’t want to stay right downtown but want to be a quick drive/uber then this place was perfect! We were able to grab Ubers quickly to make our way downtown. This place is really great for one or two couples/friends to share. The surrounding area, aside from downtown, has plenty of parks to hangout. It was nice being in a suburb area that was clean and peaceful. I absolutely would stay here again."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unit is nice and clean. Nice attention to detail with flowers and some nice coffee. A little further from the only university than I would prefer but location is fine. Arrived at night in the dark and entering rear of building made it a little more difficult for enter.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location was very close to the hospital in Madison. We were able to walk there and back. It was close enough to walk home for lunch or just a break with nice restaurants, coffee shop and farm to table take out along the way. It was a quiet peaceful place to rest while a loved one was in the hospital. Emily always answered and quickly solved an issue with the city shutting down the water. Many many thanks to her.
The place was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed in a temporary home. There was a steep stairs to get in but once in she provided."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cozy apartment! There was plenty of space for all 3 of us and it was nice to have 2 bathrooms. Couldn’t ask for a better location to get to UW Health! One of the bedrooms is directly above the stairwell to the units so I could hear every time someone came in or out. I’m a light sleeper though… my husband never heard a thing. Otherwise, it was a pretty quiet building. We enjoyed our stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great experience with our 2 little kids here - 3yo and 5month old. Emily is a responsive and very caring host. Some details: We mentioned we are traveling with a baby. They set up a pack and play and used safe plugs on the electric outlets. When the place is missing some shampoo, they brought it in within 30mins. These are really heart warming"

We received proactive communication, easy instructions, easy parking and a great value overall.
Happy to come back!"

Bathroom for each bedroom. Very nice to have local coffee, basket of snacks in the kitchen. Soft, fluffy towels provided in the bathrooms plus a basket of toiletries. Host provided multiple recommendations on places to visit, restaurants and local music."

It had everything we ever would need in a temporary home. Location is perfect as it’s a short walk to the hospital too! Thanks so much Emily & Mike!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This apartment was cute, well furnished and supplied with pots/pans/dishes/glasses and cleaning supplies. Emily was kind enough to leave bus passes, coins for laundry as well as laundry detergent, snacks, milk/butter/olive oil/coffee to get started! Apartment was walking distance to bar/restaurants nearby as well as UW hospital where I worked. Emily was very open and honest about maintenance issues and gave ample notice of when theyay need to come into the apartment. Emily also took into consideration that I worked nights, and made sure maintenance respected my need to sleep during the day. Emily checked in frequently throughout my stay to see how everything was going. At the end of my stay, Emily was flexible in my checkout date and refunded me for nights I no longer needed the rental. I would give Emily 5 stars as a host and would rent from her in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emily was a wonderful host. She was very responsive and accommodating.
