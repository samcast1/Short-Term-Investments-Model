They had lots of giant , fresh, soft and thirsty towels. The beds were fresh , and so comfortable! The front yard was neatly landscaped, and was fenced securely with plenty of room for our furbaby. The back yard was green, sloping and beautiful. Sitting on the back porch watching deer walking around in the evening was a joy.

Paul was very helpful and hospitable during our stay, making sure we had the comforts of home available to us. He made suggestions of local restaurants, grocery stores, and a walking trail (Bay Mountain Park, Lakeside Trail) that were all located close by. We took advantage each one. The cottage was beautiful, VERY clean, and had lots of character and charm. The backyard view was very peaceful, and if the weather had been cooperative, we would have loved to have been able to enjoy the fire pit.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property is beautiful and in a secluded spot. Although, it isn’t very private due to other homes on the property. We also saw deer and turkeys right outside during our stay.
Danny was very responsive and welcoming. We rented both the house and cottage for attending my son’s wedding. Every amenity that we needed was found in addition to welcome snacks! The home was immaculately clean. Danny was very flexible with our changing arrangements.
I highly recommended this property for staying in and around Kingsport."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering booking, do it! It books quickly and your selected dates may not be there if you go checking other listings. You won’t find a better stay or better value in the Kingsport area. The home is spacious for a couple or family, and well equipped with towels, linens, kitchen items, and a treat basket here and there. Danny is a perfect host - close by and available if you need him, but leaves you to your privacy otherwise. Be sure to take time to enjoy the Bays Mountain surroundings, whether from walking the property or relaxing on one of the available decks!"

We would stay again if the need arose."

One of the nicer places we have stayed at."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos do not show how spacious the home actually is. Clean. A lot of extras (snacks, filtered water, toiletries, linens, games). We're a private, introverted family & this was more private than we expected being that the driveway is shared with the host. We felt very comfortable. Never knew they were there. Hosts were accommodating to last minute changes & very responsive.
Got to have an egg hunt for Easter for my granddaughter in the back yard. We enjoyed the stay! Much better than staying in a hotel like we normally do when we visit here."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place with plenty of room. Though we didn't cook in the kitchen it was fully stocked. It was very clean and a great location for what we had planned in the area. Close to town & restaurants. Private with a view of Bays Mountain. We even saw a deer & her fawn who was having fun running & playing in the woods. They even had water & some snacks for us. When needed they responded quickly & we would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the first time I reached out to Danny until our last communication he was prompt and answered all my questions. Unfortunately with our schedule my friend and I did not meet him personally. However Danny did reach out to make sure we had everything we needed. His home is well laid out, spotless and very peaceful. We had the added pleasure of seeing deer throughout his neighborhood and as we were leaving (to go home) we saw thirteen (13) deer within two blocks. A little slice of heaven. I would definitely book again. Thank you again for a wonderful stay."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Mr. Danny was pretty responsive, accommodating, welcoming. The house is pretty, clean, inviting and peaceful. Totally recommend it. It has all necessities and extra. If we go back we will definitely consider this house again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay. The house is tucked away at the top of the hill with 2 other homes. It’s surrounded by lush greenery and is very quiet. The beds were all very comfortable and we had everything we needed in the kitchen to prepare any type of meal. I especially enjoyed sitting on the porch area out front each morning with a cup of coffee reading my morning devotionals. Danny was quick to respond to my questions, even though the answers were already outlined in the house instructions."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to put into words how much we loved this home. We brought my 83 yo mom to visit her remaining family.
She is particular, to say the least, and she LOVED this home. It exceeded our expectations. It's a hidden away piece of heaven at the top of Ridgefields. Accessibility in/out of the home as well as from the back bedroom onto the back porch for morning coffee, was superb. My uncle & aunt that have lived in Kingsport 70+ years were in awe of this place.
It's obvious this couple works hard to maintain this property. They go above & beyond and stock every room with necessity items, which I wasn't expecting. They are quick to respond with any questions or concerns.
It made what was already a special trip that much more special. I cannot thank them enough."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Very happy with our stay. Super clean. Quiet neighborhood. Host was welcoming and responsive.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Danny was a great host. Quick to respond with messages.
The toaster oven quit working while we were there and he replaced it the same day.
They brought over toys for my grandchildren which I thought was very thoughtful.
It's a very peaceful beautiful spot. Our first night, a doe and her twin fawns we walking through the backyard, just 20 yards from us.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book it!! It felt less like an Air BnB and more like we were staying with family. EVERYTHING was perfect! Super clean, extra details thought of, and the property was beyond private and safe. Fireflies in the evening, chirping birds in the gorgeous trees, Adirondack chairs on back porch. Truly idyllic! We were kicking ourselves for not booking this sweet little place longer as our rental house wasn’t quite ready. Would have loved to have stayed longer. Natisha and Danny made us feel so welcomed but never intruded upon. Danny gave us some great pointers for the area and Natisha’s grace for my talkative husband didn’t go unnoticed. Be prepared to truly be on vacation in this beautiful place."

Can’t beat the price!!
Thank you Danny"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay at Danny's place!
We were a bit surprised to receive an extra $100 charge midway through for our parents who joined us last minute, as the house had ample bedroom space for two additional adults, given that it was initially just my partner and I (with our baby and toddler) in a three bedroom house. Haven't been at another AirBnB where we have been charged for extra guests (although, I see now that it was in the house notes). Was a bit disappointing that the charge wasn't initially accompanied with a note from the host explaining why they were requesting additional money.
Other than that, the house was very homey and on such a beautiful property! We would definitely recommend the place and hope possibly to return if we're in the area!"

Plenty of linens, towels, kitchen amenities, etc. More than most Airbnbs. There were even snacks and treats and bottled water left for our use!

The house is very comfortable and the host had the lights on for us before we arrived. Amenities of the coffee pot, microwave, toaster oven, pots, pans, dishes, etc are great to have. Very quite neighborhood with only the occasional train horn heard in the far distance. The train reminded us of time spent with our kids a couple of summers back.

Being a winter visit, we didn't use the outdoor amenities, but they looked nice. We didn't really cook, but the kitchen was equipped with the basics. The little kids really like the hidden playroom upstairs. The only things to note are the 2 upstairs bedrooms are attic rooms, so watch your head! The 2 bathrooms are downstairs."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for more! The house was immaculate and just as described. Our four children thoroughly enjoyed exploring the creek/stream and spent the majority of their time in it. We made memories as we sat by the fire and roasted hot dogs and s'mores. We are already planning our next visit!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We were a group of three older siblings with their spouses and a friend. Since our children are grown, and not exactly hanging out with us anymore, we decided to do a hike to the Devil’s Bathtub and that’s how we ended at Taylor’s place. The best way I can describe Taylor’s cabin is that it is a retreat with plenty of space for everyone. Although we do not have grandchildren yet I noticed that there was plenty provided for young children too. We enjoyed karaoke and a good movie on the flat screen TV. We appreciated the linens, great quality, and all the thoughtful details and information for all the guests. I loved the labeling of where items belonged. It was also very clean and new. I personally enjoyed the swing by the brook and having a quiet time in the porch while it was raining outside. We enjoyed s’mores around the fire pit. Taylor also provided excellent ideas for local hiking.
Would consider staying here again!"

The foldout ottoman turned out to be surprisingly comfortable and the family decided to use that for the 3 of them and give grandmother the queen bed in the small bedroom. Though the hallway could be noisy, inside the unit was quiet and comfortable. The entire unit was clean, neat, and appealing, not overdone. Though not childproofed we managed easily with the sofa and ottoman as limits for the crawling infant. Would definitely stay here again."

The bed was great and having a really newer washer and dryer was so nice. It was cold by the time we got there and it was heaven to see the heat was already on and warm for us. The kitchen was well stocked with just about anything needed (except an ice cream scoop and a pie pan). Loved having a place all to ourselves to relax. Will definitely be staying again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable, and the location was fantastic for a getaway that’s not too far off the beaten path. Amenities galore (e.g. washer/dryer) and an efficient modern touch. We have a 20 month old, so we had to hide the chairs and door mirrors, but we found it to be very kid friendly, especially the open layout. One of the very best AIRBNB experiences we’ve had."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When visiting family, I used to stay in motels in the area. This involved a lot of prayer and strategy on my part as the closest ones were not very safe or clean. A friend suggested Andrew’s place specifically and now after my second use of his home I will never stay anywhere else. It is super convenient to Kingsport and Gate City. The home is super cute, comfortable, clean, and most of all- safe. I hesitated writing this review only because I want this home to be available for me! If word gets out about what a great bargain this is I will have to book further into the future."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our first airbnb stay - The house was great. Very clean and has everything you need for a short stay.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stay at this property frequently. It is a great value. Everything is new and the house is always clean, comfortable and the hosts are very friendly and quick to respond to any communications.

It is within a mile or so of the major roadways to all of the local attractions. It is at the Virginia line so the Virginia attractions are easy to reach. All of this while being out in a country setting. All appliances are new. Home appears to be recently redone. It is very comfortable. Great value for many different types of travelers.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a hidden jewel. You enjoy a quite small community feel but remain close to everything. This place is a perfect option for many different types of travelers. If you are here on business this place is just out of town and literally minutes from the major industries in town. A short drive to Eastman or Domtar. If you are here as a sightseer or want to explore the local attractions, it is conveniently located and access to the highway system is very close. Stores are local and the downtown area is about 5 minutes away. A great base camp for someone exploring the area. A very good safe value. Communication is outstanding and they are extremely responsive and helpful. The property appears to have been recently remodeled and everything is new, nice and works perfectly.

Centrally located for downtown Kingsport we were never more than 10-15 minutes away from where we needed to be while visiting family in the area. The home was recently renovated and it had a modern yet homey feel to it. Our one general complaint was that the WiFi kept dropping out, so movies and tv shows would freeze or stop playing all together. As a result we had to reboot the router multiple times. However this was the most minor inconvenience and the home is lovely. We will definitely be using this home again the next time we visit Tennessee and the Kingsport area!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a cozy little haven tucked away in a beautiful location. It's close enough to the main highway for convenience and far enough away to have some quiet and a sense of seclusion for the night. We had a lovely coffee on the porch and listened to the array of birds singing over the field of buttercups. A great experience overall.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was just right for our family. We had been driving all day and were arriving after dark. The host contacted us to let us know that they went over to turn on the porch lights so we would be able to see to get inside. The area was private and quiet. The temperatures were dropping outside but the house was warm and comfortable. There were several deer that showed up as well one evening during our stay. Overall a great place to stay.

We saw 5 deer and many cute little rabbits. In the evening we were treated to a gorgeous display of fireflies. The house itself felt like going to a mom or aunt's house. Very cozy and homey. I couldn't believe how little we spent to stay there. If we ever go through Tennessee again, we're coming back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet- set back for privacy. Roomy - large airy spaces. Front porch and patio - access to outdoors. Homey- not a fussy place- just comfortable. Accurate description. Very central - 30 minutes to any of the tri-cities, to collegiate baseball (summer) and excellent trails for biking. Added an extra night because I found it so well suited. Great deer, fireflies and birds!"
2023-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Juanita and Gene were communicative, very responsive and caring.
This was a last minute booking while enroute home from a road trip to New Orleans so our stay was only for less than 24 hours.
The home was clean with all the amenities but it was just not our style unfortunately. The home and all furniture within are very old, including kitchen and bedding. Some people likes antique, just not me and my family. The place also had an old smell as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, friendly hosts. They had supplies just in case you forgot something. We enjoyed the nature; lighting bugs, rabbits, deer, and even a skunk! Conveniently located to shopping but set back in the woods so you don't know!"

2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for the night while traveling and appreciated the hosts approving our stay last min.

They gave great instructions and directions and left the light on for us knowing we’d be getting in late making our drive back home from NY to GA. We wish we could have stayed longer, but we will be back when we make the drive to visit family again. Juanita’s artwork is such a nice touch and I love to support local artists so of course I had to make a purchase! Thanks for everything!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Laundry in house would have been nice, the fire place was not available for use.

2022-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"If a cabin in the woods is what you like..then this is your spot. We found it too rough for us...old smell, carpet stained, ceilings stained, would be pretty cramped for 6 adults. I expected a more updated facility.

house. The hosts were gracious about us having to leave the cabin and fair in refunding our money."

Only drawback- no central air and the wall units are loud. Awesome because minutes from town, but set off so feels like in the wilderness."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our week long stay at the older cottage was wonderful. It is a quiet wooded area set slightly back off the road, but close to many shopping areas, parks and recreation places. The yard has plenty of wildlife passing through to observe from deer to so many kinds of birds .The home is very clean and spacious. The outdoor covered sitting area is great for visiting together. The place had everything you needed and was very clean. We will definitely return."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just amazing!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was everything we didn’t know we needed and wanted until we had it. This was my first time back to Kingsport since I was a young girl almost 40years ago. It was a wonderful spot to reconnect with family. We enjoyed visiting on the back covered patio and watching the firefly light show. Deer and rabbits were quite curious making it even more magical. The house is private and feels secluded but it's still close to everything so you get the best of both worlds. Jaunita is an amazing artist. I will Definitely stay here again next time I'm down here.

It’s the nicest place on the block and has plenty of parking! We were thankful it had the privacy fence line and the school across the street, as the neighbors places and such seem pretty run down. We didn’t have any issues with them. It was just you can’t see the neighbors when you rent homes on sites, so when we first arrived it concerned us.
The owners, Eddie and Karen were very responsive and had all of the instructions lined out nicely for the home! The beds are comfortable and it was a great stay overall!! We will definitely stay here again."
