2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,House is very comfortable and a perfect distance to everything. Couldn’t be happier
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We got peace, a welcome message on the chalkboard; tidy, spacious rooms--and a phone call plus texts from Jaimie to say we'd left a laptop behind!! I plan to return to this home with my husband later in the summer. Seneca Falls has so much history, and this visit we were aiming only at seeing the total solar eclipse"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Super clean and a great location. Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend at Jaime and Todd's place! We booked it to have a weekend away from the husbands and kids to reboot. The house was beautiful and just what we were looking for in an Air BNB! My friend had never stayed at an Air BNB before and I think this changed her mind for future trips! Thank you Jaime and Todd!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie and Todd were able to offer us another place nearby, when the place we choose had an unexpected problem. They were able to have the problem fixed at our 1st choice place by our scheduled arrival date. Thank you.
The apartment was as shown on the website, and the note on the blackboard was a pleasant surprise. The neighborhood was generally quiet. Dan loved the grapes that were growing in the backyard. The stairs up to the porch door were a little rickety. Thank you for the Kcups and chips. The TV was easy to navigate, but had one problem with the sound. Dan turned off the TV and started it again, which restored the sound. One minor inconvenience was the lack of the bathroom sink stopper lift handle.

We were instantly comfortable and relaxed upon arriving. And talk about clean...it was Immaculate. All the little touches show how much thought they have put into thinking of their guests' needs.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable apartment. Fully equipped kitchen and we were able to use the fire pit which was nice. Quick response from host.
We enjoyed Watkins Glen, and state parks that were located about 50 min away. There were also very nice wineries and breweries in that area.
It is my fault for not reading the listing but we went with one other couple and there are three rooms and two have single beds. So my husband and I slept in separate rooms which was fine but something to keep in mind if you go with another couple.
We enjoyed our stay !"

Highly recommend renting from Janie and Todd! We had a great trip thanks to having this house as our home base."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No complaints
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"All was as advertised. J and T give very clear instructions about their house rules (shoes off, where not to eat, where trash goes, etc). We were on the 2nd floor , which was nice and spacious. The entryway was a bit daunting in that it has a very antique feel and smell to it, but once on the 2nd floor all was good :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, comfortable, with easy access. Central location for exploration of the Finger Lakes. Decent restaurants nearby. Having a washer/dryer was great! Would book again with no hesitation."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and spacious apartment close to downtown. The canal and main commercial center of Seneca Falls are within walking distance and the building is right on one of the main arteries leading to both Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, so wine trails and lake/park activities are an easy ride in either direction. I did not spend much time in the apartment since I was only in town for a wedding but the place seemed like it would be a nice home base for anyone planning a longer stay. The kitchen was sizable and the apartment can easily sleep 5; the futon is even in its own room/office, separate from the living room. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are three units in the building. We stayed in the Keuka unit upstairs. It's plenty big for two couples with two comfortable bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a utility room, and a bonus extra room with a fouton. Plenty of room to spread out. Comfortable living room for games, TV, or nice conversations. Well appointed eat-in kitchen. Location is only a block or two from the center of town - definitely worth a walking tour. We wouldn't hesitate to return to this one."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a nice time in Seneca Falls. The pictures and descriptions match your experience. There’s plenty to do in the area. You’re less than 10 minutes drive to just about anything you would need (food/supplies). The house was very clean and they provided all the basics. I would recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very convenient spot to stay. It’s close to amenities and shopping, but also close to all things Mother Nature."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Jaimie and Todd's place to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Sentiments and the 100th anniversary of the Equal Rights Amendment.

Very responsive"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My first experience with this type of booking. Clean, comfortable home. Perfect for what it was needed for. My only complaint was the hours of checking out. Seemed rushed 10am on a Sunday morning. But for more $$ it was explained It could be extended.
I definitely will attempt this again. Thank you J & T 😊"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good communication, as described. Staying again shortly."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Keuka room (2 adults, 1 toddler, 1 baby).

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When visiting the Fingerlakes region as well as Seneca Falls, you'll be hard-pressed to find an AirBnb any better. Great for couples, families, etc.. Everything you would want and need. Most importantly, Jaimie + Todd are excellent and prompt communicators so as to ensure nothing short of an exceptional experience. And, this is our 2nd time with them, too. Looking forward to the 3rd. --- Christian"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Keuka House is a wonderful gem. Jaimie and Todd have kept the character of this Victorian house, but have thought of all the modern amenities and details that make a guest feel welcomed and at home when away from home. The space is extremely clean, spacious and well appointed. We loved every moment of our stay! Also Keuka House is centrally located, and we were able to visit many wonderful sights in the area, knowing we had a relaxing and comfortable space waiting for us. I won’t hesitate to highly recommend Keuka House and Jaimie and Todd as wonderful hosts to anyone I know travelling to the area."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW, what a comfy and well-equipped house.
I stayed 4 nights for a work trip. I felt the house was not only clean but also perfect for all my needs. If you feel like cooking on your trip this kitchen is well equipped to make a basic dinner. Loved the big bath for soaking. The office space allowed me to get some work done as well!
The location is great too. Just a short walk to a small business strip and a quick drive to a few state parks!
While it was just me this house would be comfortable for a trip with a few friends.
Will absolutely return again on my next trip to the finger lakes!"

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming upstairs apartment in a central area to explore the Finger Lakes region. Very clean & comfortable. The historic home is on a busy main street, so traffic noise is nearly constant. A white noise machine or phone app helps. (FYI for light sleepers) We visited in off-season for an extended weekend and discovered many restaurants, wineries and museums closed or on reduced hours...but still found great places visit with research & planning. Hosts have a big collection of travel brochures which really helped us plan our days! We really enjoyed Connie's Diner & Penny's Restaurant breakfast, & grabbed picnic supplies at Sauder's Store for a day exploring Watkins Glen. We enjoyed the wineries in the upper Seneca Lake/Cayuga Lake region the most...just 15 minutes from Lake to Lake! Be sure to try the cheese tasting at Murano Cheese too. Had a great visit to the area, stopped at Letchworth State Park (1.5 hours west) on our way back home...perfect end to our trip! Thanks for a great visit...we were unsure about covid-era travel but the house put us at ease!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! The Keuka is charming, spacious and well equipped, in a great location just a short walk to the Women’s History museum.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie & Todd really know what they're doing! They were such kind and communicative hosts, and I loved my stay at the Keuka."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very spacious, clean, and all the directions were easy to understand and to follow. We were at Seneca Falls for school which required silence to study and was well achieved throughout our stay. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants stress free tranquility!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Larger than expected great wifi. We needed a place in a hurry for a family emergency and were really impressed. The place was much bigger than we expected and is a nice walk to downtown Seneca Falls. The wifi was great through the whole floor which is difficult in old buildings with plaster walls. I would definitely recommend for a work/family trip or for calm families.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean space and close proximity to the other towns. Highly recommend!!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly as described and very clean! The exterior of the house is rather older like many in the area, but the apartment we stayed in was comfortable, well decorated, and well equipped with everything we’d need. Had a great stay!"
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and welcoming. A good apartment which can serve a whole family! We really enjoyed our stay
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful building, with equally wonderful interiors. The inside and outside of the property were very neat and tidy. We especially enjoyed the clawfoot bathtub, high ceilings, and proximity to all the local sights. We highly recommend to anybody looking to stay in Seneca Falls!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is very clean, and is set up with perfection... Their location is outstanding.. three blocks to the strip of shops and some restaurants. Very close to the Lake. The town of Seneca Falls is very proactive for Women’s Rights, and the Welcome center is recommended! I enjoyed the museum of Women’s Rights as well. No time to visit the Wonderful Life museum.. so we must return. This is one of the best places we have ever stayed at. My only gripe is that the windows don’t open, and I sleep with the open usually. Everything else was SUBERB⁉️♥️🌹"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was an excellent place for us to spend a week. It was newly remodeled, roomy and comfortable, light filled, exceptionally clean, and Jaime and Todd seemed to have anticipated our every need. The kitchen was well stocked. There were plenty of towels. Although we didn't use them, the washer and dryer are a nice touch. The house is walkable distance to the downtown, and the whole town is charming, the area is easy to navigate. Food stores and eateries are nearby also."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recement this place! It is one of our better Airbnb experiences and we visit the Finger Lakes yearly over the Columbus day weekend. Great location if you are going wine tasting. Jaimie and Todd were very good at getting back to us in a timely manner. The apartment was clean and well maintained. All of the appliances were relatively new and everything was in working order. If circumstances permit, we will be back at the Finger Lakes next year and will look to see if this place is available"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a spacious, comfortable place. Good parking. This is an old house, but in very good condition, and the owners appear to be making continuous upgrades. Hardwood floors are in great condition, and the beds had very comfortable memory foam mattresses. We were very pleased and enjoyed our stay."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay here in downtown Seneca Falls. It’s a second floor walk up with a private entrance. There are two other units in the building. If you are a light sleeper, you may hear the other guests or the traffic passing by on the surprisingly busy street. Nothing terrible, but noticeable if that’s the kind of thing that bothers you. Also shades are on all the windows, but you will get some light coming through. So bring a eye shade if you need blackout conditions for optimal sleep. Very clean, lots of space, and comfortable— the beds are that kind of memory foam/ tempur pedic mattress that many people find so comfortable.
Very close to the historical sites of downtown and the restaurants that made our stay quite enjoyable."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Jamie and Todd’s lovely, spacious and well located Victorian. Highly recommended."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Todd & Jaimie are great hosts! Cute place, great amenities, and all for a great price! Very convenient location to the Lake Cayuga. We were able to park our bass boat with plenty of space to k-turn it around for easy exit. Thanks!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was so much fun staying in this classic home close to Seneca Lake. Perfect location close to everything.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious place with lots of places to sit and relax. It is nice to stay in an older house that has updated facilities but maintains its original cham.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredibly lovely and spacious place to stay in a wonderful location central to all of the best Finger Lakes destinations. Jaimie and Todd were very gracious and responsive hosts, and my boyfriend and I felt right at home for our week away. Super clean and lots of warm touches - we loved having a kitchen to use and how private the whole place felt. We will be back!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jaimie and Todd's place is a great place for that get away you want. Very close to everything needed in a small quiet town. Everything needed is in the apartment and it actually looks and is more comfortable than pictures show. Enjoy!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jaimie and Todd are fantastic hosts. Their home was exactly as described and the extra touches were a nice surprise. Their frequent communications were just right both prior to and during our stay and it made us feel welcomed and taken care of. We strongly encourage you to consider renting from them when in the Finger Lakes.

Thank you both so much for hosting us!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. Location was perfect. Home was very clean inside. Darryl was very quick to respond to any questions.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My husband and I went to Seneca Falls for a memorial with my husband’s two sisters and their spouses and my sister in law’s 10 year old son. Darryl’s place was an accidental find that worked perfectly for what we needed. We all got to spend quality time, watch the PGA Championship together and enjoy downtown Seneca Falls. Darryl was a fantastic host who made our stay extremely easy. With instructions and pics it was easy to find. We were pleased to see that the place was large enough that we each had personal space. Darryl even left snacks and kcups! Pac-Man was a big hit for our nephew and the restaurants and shops on the same block were a huge plus for the adults. Thanks Darryl! I hope we can stay again during our next visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Darryl was great getting back to me very quickly when we first arrived. Everything was as described and we enjoyed our stay greatly!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We visited Seneca Falls for a family function that happened to overlap with the solar eclipse. Seneca Falls is a lovely small town, and the place is very close to restaurants and Women's Rights museum, and it is very convenient to all the region has to offer."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rental was pretty much as described. Well decorated and clean. There were a couple of things in disrepair, the Ms. Pacman game, a few light bulbs out, but overall, very nice. Darryl was very responsive. We had had an issue with the keyless entry, but Darryl had it fixed within a few seconds, pretty amazing. The area was very nice, walkable, with excellent restaurants, and pubs. Would have appreciated a little later check out time. We had to scramble to take care of the household duties and get out by 10 am, but doable. The cleaning fee on top of the rental fee was a little high, but this isn't the 1st Airbnb we've encountered like this. Really don't think anyone could go wrong staying at this listing."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This cute apartment is exactly like the description says. The beds were so comfy and the showers had great water pressure. Lots of cool stuff to do within walking distance and plenty of space for our group of 6.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at Darryl's property with my daughter and three of her friends to celebrate her 13th birthday. It couldn't have been a better place to stay! Darryl's communication was always thorough and very responsive. The apartment was large, clean, decorated adorably and was equipped with hotel quality linens. Despite being February, the weather was beautiful and we were able to walk along the river. We walked to a cafe around the corner, Cafe 19, and it was the most quaint little spot with the best breakfast options. This is the perfect spot for a small getaway with friends, family or your significant other. I plan to come back! Darryl - thank you again for sharing your space!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Adorable decor! The lay out was perfect for hanging out and visiting. Women’s Rights Museum, Women Made Products, Asha’s Closet, It’s A Wondeful Life museum, Little Italy, Wineries, … so much to experience!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place exactly as pictured, maybe even more spacious in person than photos. Parking was not available in the direct parking lot but the back alley all parking is free and easy to get through back door.

It was appreciated that there was flex for both animals and checkin timing.
Would return again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay in Seneca Falls and really enjoyed our apartment stay along the canal. With 4 bedrooms there was plenty of room for me, my husband, our college-age daughter and her boyfriend plus it was dog-friendly and accommodating for our small Havanese puppy. For others that may bring a dog, it might be helpful to know that you have to walk about 100 yards to get to the green space, it isn’t right outside the door. We enjoyed the games, the view, the fun decor and the proximity to a variety of activities! It’s not extremely close but there is a great little cafe across the bridge, Cafe 19 that had delicious coffee and breakfast."

Everything was clean and lovely, and he even included multiple unexpected extras such as microwave popcorn, coffee at the ready, and a Ms. PacMan game to name a few.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to thank Darryl for the amazing accommodations. It is so hard to come to an unknown place and find the perfect apartment. The beds were just clean and so comfortable after spending the entire day outdoors. I felt safe and my guests had the same feeling. There is an arcade machine that took me back some years. I will highly recommend this apartment who comes to Seneca Falls. I constantly use AirBNB in the US and abroad.
Thank You Darryl"

Darryl was responsive to any questions that I had prior and during our stay. He even offered a high chair and pack and play for my 8 month old.

Overall this was a great stay and we are excited to return in the near future!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was a great host and allowed us to drop off perishables before check-in so we could get out on Cayuga early to fish. Driveway was huge which could easily fit 2 trucks with boat trailers. Great boat house just 10 minutes from Cayuga State Park boat launch and 12 minutes to Mud Lock DEC launch. Having a backyard deck was great. I brought my small Kamado Joe for smoke grilling. Kitchen had all the pots, pans, and utensils needed to cook meals. Having a dishwasher and washer and dryer was also great when you come back at the end of the day sweaty and smelling of bass. Comfy spot for a weekend getaway or in our case 6 days of fishing with the Hobie BOS kayak bass fishing tournament to end the trip. Highly recommend and plan to book again next year."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Mike’s AirBnB for about a month and a half, and we had a wonderful time. The house is very neat and has anything you’d need in terms of appliances. It’s close by to restaurants, gyms, and walking paths. The beds are comfortable and the couch blankets are close to heavenly, especially when you come in from the winter cold. On many nights, we curled up in the blankets and watched Netflix (which was included on the TV) before cooking dinner. I’d recommend this AirBnB to anyone looking for either a short or long term stay in Seneca Falls, and I could see it working for friend nights, romantic getaways, visiting family, or anything else of that nature. The host, Mike, is very responsive and understanding. Overall, we had a great time, and I would recommend."

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in Mike and Delores's newly renovated home. They had just finished it the previous weekend and we were their first guests to stay. We are avid waterfall chasers who just needed a place to stay for the night and continue our chase the next day, and found this by luck. It was close by some great restaurants and also the ""It's a wonderful life"" bridge as well. We hope to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We went up to Seneca Falls for a wedding. I was thrilled with Hanks's home - right on the water and comfortable. Beautiful home! My family of 6 fit right in and loved our stay.😊

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, a fantastic stay. Hank is a great host and very communicative. The home is spacious and clean. The kitchen is well stocked with cookware, dishware, and utensils. I loved the location and view of the lake. The sun does come blasting in to the common spaces after sunrise so it does make the TV difficult to watch because of the glare. We used the umbrella from the table outside to provide us with some shade in the dining area. Window treatments would be nice for both privacy and relief from the direct sunlight. Despite this, it really is a lovely place. It was comfortable for our family of eight."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hank’s property is amazing, very clean with spectacular views of the lake!

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved Hank’s lake house!! The home is gorgeous and the lake views are lovely. The home is close to wineries and not far to Seneca Falls to grab a dinner out. The house has all you will need for a great stay, stocked kitchen, comfy furniture, grill and even water toys for warm weather. The decks are fantastic, 2 levels of seating and outside enjoyment. Can’t wait for my next visit to Cayuga Lake!! Would definitely book with Hank again!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We rented Hank’s beautiful home for a few days in October and had a wonderful experience. The house was comfortable, clean, lovely and fully equipped with everything needed to make our stay enjoyable. We had a lot of fun sitting around the fire pit in the evening, stargazing and making s’mores! The location couldn’t have been better with incredible views of the lake from every level of the house. It was a very manageable drive to all the wineries and points of interest in the region. We would highly recommend this home to anyone looking to enjoy a trip to the Finger Lakes!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful! Our stay was just perfect for our annual girl’s trip to the Finger Lakes. The house was very clean and updated, and it’s in a great location. Lastly, the view is just spectacular! With the large windows and spanning decks, you are able to enjoy the lake at all times!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had an amazing 2-night stay at Hank’s home! The property looked brand new and had really aesthetically pleasing and functional design elements throughout the home. The space is very open and not cluttered with unnecessary things, which is important to me when looking for rentals. We had enough room to “move in” for 2 nights and comfortably fit our clothes, toiletries, food etc.
There were enough amenities throughout the home, and we had everything we needed. The rooms had comfortable linens and blankets, and the kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, garbage bags, Keurig etc.
Both levels of decks had enough chairs and tables for my group, and there was plenty of room for everyone to sit comfortably inside.
There wasn’t anything I wished they had that they didn’t.
My whole family enjoyed our stay, and didn’t want to leave! Between the beautiful modern interior, and the amazing lake views, we all had an unforgettable stay and would recommend this house to everyone!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place . Quiet lake setting perfect for wine tour
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous accommodations in a fantastic location. Ideal for our family gathering, with 5 bedrooms and ample shared space including decks for hanging out together (and cuddly throws for extra warmth). Well-appointed kitchen. The home faces east for sunrise views, and the lake is stunning. We saw eagles and herons, and enjoyed evening breezes to accompany the moonrise."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hank was a phenomenal host! He was extremely responsive & professional. He went above & beyond in even recommending wineries & restaurants close by . Hank made the booking, check in and entire stay seamless. The house is absolutely beautiful, very clean & cozy. The view from the house is wonderful. We will definitely be back.

The location was amazing. The view from every window and decks was marvelous. We were close to many wineries, restaurants & shops. Can't wait to rebook for next year."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a beautiful week staying on Cayuga Lake with friends.

The house is beautiful with plenty of room for the six of us to stay!
Thanks Hank!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hanks place was a beautiful location for two families to enjoy a getaway together. The outside space was incredible and we all enjoyed spending time on the decks. I’d definitely recommend his place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had the best time- the view from every window and the decks was simply marvelous. The sunrises were to die for. Kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, living room - all were spotless and inviting. Hank was very easy to communicate, provided us with local Recs. We used the kayaks provided and had a great time. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Experienced and enjoyed perfect lake living!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hank's home is a great place to stay on Cayuga Lake. We rented his home for one week for a family get together. There was 5 adults staying at the home which provided enough space for everyone. Although several of the bedrooms had window treatments, we would recommend some more be place throughout the home for privacy. It would also be helpful in the living room and dining room to help with the bright sunlight that came through the windows in the morning. As Floridians we are use to the sun but it was very bright and we found ourselves turning away from the windows as the sun came up. The TV was also very difficult to see due to the glare from the sun. The porch was perfect to sit on and we enjoyed the kayaks and fishing poles. It was a very fun week in which the time went to fast. We hope to come back one day. Thank you Hank for letting us enjoy your home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House is as advertised. Location is great. 20 mins. to Geneva, Auburn and many wineries. Very close to Cayuga State Park with nice playground. New dock was good and kayaks/tubes readily available. Only downside of note is that interior noise carries throughout the house even with doors closed and at all levels of house., especially at night. Needs more shades on some of the windows downstairs and kitchen area. Upstairs shower curtain way too small. Steep stairs down from parking area. Plenty of parking for 4 cars. Overall, a great place for a family vacation. Thanks, Hank."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had the best stay at Hank’s home on Cayuga lake! The house is beautifully updated, equipped with all the essentials and situated perfectly on the lake for a Finger Lakes escape. Everything from an easy check in, to area recommendations and a peaceful/comfortable home, made for the perfect family getaway. Hank was very communicative and responded promptly to all of our questions and needs, a great host! Would highly recommend a stay here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a great long weekend. The house truly has an amazing view and is just as the pictures show. Everything was super clean and comfortable to all of us that stayed. Even loved the decor of the rooms, from wall colors to light fixtures. Would stay here again. Only thing I’d critique would be to add blinds in the lower bedrooms."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location and house! All the rooms were super clean and modern. Lots of space in the house and balcony, with a great propane grill that we put to good use."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hank's place was beautiful, and the view was absolutely stunning. It was exactly as pictured in the lisiting. The beds were comfy and the home was tastefully decorated . The location was close to shops, grocery stores and lots of amazing wineries. I highly recommend trying the Spotted Duck ice cream place and I think my favorite winery was Three Brothers because of the variety of options there. I definitely recommend trying the beer at their brewery. The view from the deck at the home was stunning. If you are considering this place, you should also know that the driveway is steep and no real good way to get your luggage to the house so be prepared. Hank is excellent at communication and will be helpful if any issues arise. I highly recommend this home if your heading to Seneca Falls."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Hank was excellent! house was spotless & had great views of the lake. local town & vendors were very helpful- overall excellent experience look forward to returning!

The sunrises are spectacular, the perfect setting for morning coffee.
Hank was very helpful and responsive with many local suggestions and recommendations.
I would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is so tastefully done and has incredible views of the lake! Super easy check in and check out instructions which definitely helps! The Cayuga wineries are relatively close to this location. Hank was very informative and helpful. Highly recommend this house!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home, right on the water. Brand new! Was the perfect spot for my cousin’s bachelorette. Close to the wineries, the inns of aurora. Lots of restaurants. The host was extremely attentive, we loved it! Thank you for letting us stay. Would recommend and would return!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"This house is truly gorgeous! The location allows for spectacular views of the Cayuga Lake. There were six of us who came up to the Finger Lakes to enjoy a weekend away and we had a thoroughly good time in this beautiful house. The communication was easy and clear and we had no issues when checking in or logging into the Wi-Fi. There were plenty of towels, sheets, and dishes for us to use during our stay. We drove two mini vans up and were able to easily park our two vehicles, but I wouldn’t recommend more than two vehicles at the house.
Our only slight issues were the physical access to the house and a lack of blinds/curtains in the bedrooms on the lower level. There are no stairs leading down from the parking pad and there isn’t a walking path across the yard to get to the house. In ideal weather conditions, this isn’t likely a problem. However, we had rain on two days of our stay, so the front yard was quite slick and a bit muddy. Hopefully, the host adds stairs and a walkway."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hank’s house is beautiful, inside and out! Everything is brand new inside and looks great. You also can’t beat the view, especially during the sunrise. Hank was very easy to get in touch with for any and all of our questions. We would definitely recommend staying here for your trip to the finger lakes!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this little lake house. The views are amazing - there’s nothing quite like waking up to see the lake right in front of you! We even had a blue heron visitor on the dock while we were there.
The space is small, but it was exactly what we needed, and we loved just sitting on the couch and staring out at the water.
The hosts are super responsive, communicative, and kind. You can tell they put a lot of thought and love into the home - for a small space, it has so many thoughtful storage spots and little things to make guests comfortable.
A few things to keep in mind if you visit:
- The spiral staircase is TIGHT. It’s manageable, but just FYI!
- The house is surrounded by trees and bushes from the neighbor’s side that creep into the staircase.
- There are some cute spaces to hang out outside - be wary that it is very “nature-y” (aka lots of critters and bugs)
All in all, we had a really pleasant stay! Definitely a good home base for a Finger Lakes trip"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience all around!! Cute and comfortable with amazing views of the lake. Michelle was extremely helpful as we were brand new to the area. Can’t say enough great things about the place and host!! Look forward to coming back soon!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little spot for a lakeside getaway. Loved having the grill, hot tub and being able to sunbathe on the back patio/dock. The spiral staircase is a little tight inside, but it is a tiny home! And you can always take the outside stairs. Overall lovely stay!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very helpful in answering questions. The stairs outside as well as the very narrow spiral staircase inside can be a challenge for elderly and those with physical limitations.
The interior is nicely done and clean."

Visited many excellent wineries and nearby Seneca Falls has plenty of great dining options. Check out the Downtown Deli for lunch!

The highlight was definitely the fantastic hot tub with its mesmerizing lighting—it was the perfect way to unwind and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. The paddleboards were so much fun, and the frequent swims in the picturesque lake were an absolute delight. Jeremy and Michelle thoughtfully provided everything we could have possibly asked for, making our stay comfortable and memorable. We felt truly fortunate to have the opportunity to stay at this remarkable location. If you're looking for an unforgettable getaway with breathtaking views, I wholeheartedly recommend this lakehouse."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great things come in small packages. Absolutely loved our stay at Michelle and Jeremy’s place. The tiny house is adorable and lake front location is unbeatable. Wouldn’t recommend for those traveling with a young child or older folks as the spiral stairs to the bedroom could be challenging. But the dock was great for keeping our boat and hosts were extremely responsive and gave tons of amazing local recommendations for food and things to do. Was amazing spot for our short much needed get away on lake Cayuga.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place. Relaxing, gorgeous views and peaceful. The hosts were very helpful and the place was spectacular. Clean, quiet and truly a special place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was absolutely beautiful. The home was spotless and had everything we needed for a perfect weekend getaway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This a nice place in a nice setting on the lake. It is, in fact, ""tiny"" as described in the listing, but good choices were made to maximize the utility of the space. Michelle was friendly and very responsive to all of or questions and made excellent recommendations."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A cozy and comfortable lakeside retreat.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our getaway to this gem and hope to return. The home is cozy, well appointed and sits at the edge of the lake. The pictures provide an accurate representation of the clean and comfortable space. There is a relatively narrow, circular staircase connecting the two floors of the home, which may not be comfortable for some people. Michelle or her husband responded within minutes to our messages."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful and perfect for two. The hosts were incredibly quick at responding and also very accommodating. The neighbors were very friendly and helpful as well. The paddle boards were lots of fun and there is a boat launch right down the road for easy access. The only things I would say are that the home seems a bit expensive for the size of the house. It is listed at a similar price point to other homes in the area that are 2-3 times the size. However, for a couple, the house is the perfect size. I would absolutely recommend this home to friends looking to vacation to Cayuga Lake!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great visit! My husband and I were in the area for three days to explore wineries and are so glad we booked a place on the water. The views were great, and we got to swim and paddle board every day. We would stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed at Michelle’s beautiful tiny home again for an extended period of time. Like my first review, everything was clean and beautiful. I loved waking up to a sunrise on the lake every morning. Michelle is extremely friendly and responsive to all my questions! I cannot recommend this tiny home enough. Would love to stay here again in the future!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place with everything that you need to relax in front of the lake!
The communication with Michelle was also superb!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I cannot say enough about Michelle and Jeremy. Both of them are so incredibly kind and very responsive to any messages I sent them before and during my stay.
I stayed there from November to January, and am already planning my next stay! Perfect for a travel nurse, like myself!
The tiny home is absolutely stunning. Modern and updated, stunning views, and very private. Although there are neighbors around, it’s very quiet and feels secluded. I was nervous about the spiral staircase inside, but it is easy to get up and down the steps. Came stocked with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, which was really nice to see! They also supplied all the pots, pans, and dishes you could ever need! The lock pad to get inside is very easy to use, and makes me feel good to not have to carry a key around with me.
I could go on and on, but I think you get my point of how great it is to stay here!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views of the lake! Michelle and Jeremy were very nice and helpful. Their place is as advertised and beautiful. Would definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle and Jeremy were perfect hosts and this cozy home was exactly what I was looking for to take my parents on a weekend away from the city. This home has everything that you would need for your vacation and it’s perfectly located on Cayuga lake’s edge. The best part - this home is east facing, which meant we woke up to a lovely view of sunrise over the lake every morning. 5 stars all over for this place and its hosts. Cannot wait to come back here again - and I’d totally recommend this cozy home to everyone who wants to stay in the finger lakes region ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of my favorite Airbnb’s! The views you get staying right on the water are breathtaking- what a great host, super clean adorable house! Will visit again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was just as described! The location on the water is ideal- the house is clean and obviously well maintained and you can’t ask for anything else! Waking up right in front of the water was the best. Close proximity to Seneca Falls restaurants, Waterloo and we had dinner in Geneva one night also! Highly recommend stopping at Three Brothers Winery- you could spend the day there! Overall, a nice and relaxing trip for my husband and I! Michelle was also very responsive to messages!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a very nice host. Nice for a stay in a quiet town.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing communication, Great location, newly renovated, very clean and comfortable! We loved sitting by the water and loved the close proximity to so many great wineries and restaurants! We would definitely rent again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick overnight stay at this beautiful lakefront home. It is right on the water, and if you’re standing in the living room it almost seems that you’re on a boat in the lake, without the rocking of course! The home was clean, cool, comfortable and decorated nicely. We only used the first floor but hope to come back with our kids and make use of the upstairs guest rooms and screened in dining area. A really great deal!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We will absolutely be going back to Kim and Mike’s place! The place was immaculate! It had everything we needed and we were able to go kayaking! Kim and Mike were very kind and helpful with any questions we had!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay at the Cape! You really can’t beat the lake view, even sitting in the living room, all you see is the water! I already miss drinking coffee on the porch every morning watching the herons and birds go by. If you’re looking for a peaceful and relaxing place-stay here! It’s within a 50min drive to many great wineries, restaurants, and hiking spots -highly recommend Watkins glen and Taughannock Falls. The house itself was clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed. We loved taking the kayaks out on the lake too!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim & Mike’s place was everything we were looking for, it was clean, decorated very nicely, lots of amenities, and the bed was Soo comfortable! It was also very close to the wineries which was why we went. Also lots of food places close to the house. Very peaceful neighborhood & the deck to sit outside and watch the lake was great! We were 100% satisfied & will for sure be staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice, updated and clean. Overall very cozy and very well equipped.
Our only complaint is that the deck needs a little TLC.
Thank you for a great little get away!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This charming lakeside bungalow was a perfect getaway. Just watching the water right outside the front windows gave us a sense of calm. The house is perfectly tidy, rooms spacious, bed comfortable, well equipped kitchen. We were sorry it was such a short stay and hope to return."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous private spot with gorgeous interior. Well stocked with bath, kitchen and laundry items. Lovely deck with gorgeous views of the lake.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the cape was wonderful! The house was clean and cozy! We loved being right on the water. My girlfriend and I were looking for a relaxing weekend getaway- and this was just the place! It exceeded our expectations. We’d definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking for a place to stay in the Finger Lakes, and we’d love to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for three days in April. The Cape was perfect! We really enjoyed sitting outside watching the fishermen during the day while the living room views were fantastic for watching the sunrise and sunset. We couldn't have picked a more perfect place! The food in town was great and we even took a short drive to Auburn to enjoy the best crab legs at a local restaurant there. The home was clean, well-organized, and fully stocked with all we needed. We would love to go back in the summer!
Thank you Kim and Mike for making our stay so comfortable!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim & Mike were very responsive from the day I reserved and going forward. They were very understanding of a last minute family emergency that caused issues with our trip. I will keep them at the top of the my list of places to stay next time I'm in the Finger Lakes Region.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kim and Mike’s place was just as advertised. The back of the house sits right on lake Cayuga with beautiful window views of the water. The bed was very comfortable as well as the rest of the house. Definitely a peaceful oasis.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful place to stay! Beautiful home on the oak and there is plenty to do in Seneca falls and other towns that are around too. Kim and Mike are wonderful hosts and I would recommend this place to anyone, definitely plan on coming back!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Renee is a wonderful host. Her airbnb is at a prime location in Seneca Falls. Check in was easy and communication with her was excellent.

Thank you so much Renee I hope to stay with you again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location was great for me because I was arriving on bike after riding a portion of the Erie, Canalwsy and Empire State Trails. Upon arrival I was able to park my bike in Renee’s big garage, and then walk into town for dinner.
The breakfast choices offered were perfect for refueling me and continuing my bike journey.
Riding through the farmland, and rolling hills near Seneca Falls was a big treat! The countryside added some nice variety to my canal bike riding time between Rochester and Syracuse."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice clean place to spend night. Renee was great. I had to leave early to get to my destination and she was up and provided coffee and snacks for the road. Gave good recommendations for dinner.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was PERFECT for me. I was solo travelling, but I met a lovely couple who were staying at Renee’s as well, so it is fine for anybody (except probably not large groups). It has the fun and intrigue of a shared space with the privacy of your own room and space too.
There are two cats - Jimmy and Nick - who are lovely and generally just hang around.
Renee is a delight and puts on a lovely breakfast. Seneca Falls is beautiful and historic. A wonderful experience!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Renee's place was nothing short of a 5 🌟 experience. The neighbourhood was beautiful, and the house was a throwback to the way homes used to be built. I was coming to town for a concert at Del Lago Casino Resort in Waterloo, NY and Renee's place was only a short 10 minute drive away which made it the perfect location and way more cost effective than staying at the resort hotel on a weekend night.
The room was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. Renée was very accommodating with an early check-in request and the complimentary continental breakfast was absolutely delicious and included freshly homemade bagels.
I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if find myself in the area. Great find!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming spot was perfect, very comfortable, spotless, cheery, everything we needed as a base for experiencing the totality of the solar eclipse.

Highly recommend staying at Joseph’s place. We would definitely stay again!"

Everyone in our group commented again and again on how much they loved the space. The location is central and walking distance to the main things we wanted to visit while in Seneca Falls. It was fun to sit in the window above the street level (second floor) and people watch. We had fun testing out different teas and coffees that came with the kitchen. I highly recommend this place."

Joseph’s place is located on the second floor of his law office, and it is pretty close to all the wineries and hiking trails we wanted to visit.
The condo is much more spacious than it looks on the pictures, and incredibly clean and well maintained.
From the check in to check out, everything was seamless, and I really think Joseph is an attentive host.
The place had everything we needed including Keurig coffee and trail mix.^^
Our family had a great stay during our 4 day visit, and we strongly recommend this place to anyone!
Thank you, Joseph!"

Not only super communicative (even proactively), but provides everything you couldn’t even think of as an amenity! We were so impressed by all the extras and special touches in the house.
I stayed with my husband and 2 pups and we all immediately felt right at home. The yard was absolutely perfect for getting the pups some outdoor playtime and it’s a beautiful view (caught several beautiful sunsets!).
Everything inside was super comfortable, spacious and had everything we could possibly need. The house is very close to Del Lago Casino which was great for the night we went to a show there, and a short drive to grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants. We absolutely loved our stay and highly recommend this spot!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Tiffany’s Air bnb was beautiful and very clean! It was well kept and she communicated everything you needed to know prior to arrival.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tiffany was the perfect host and responded to our messages quickly and effectively. Her home was ideal for our needs and I would not hesitate to recommend to friends or family. We loved the rural setting and yet it was close to our daytime destinations.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiffany's home is beautifully appointed, and certainly feels more like a home than just a vacation rental. Four of us, cycling from Buffalo to Albany, stayed at Tiffany's, and very much appreciated the washer/dryer, the offer to use the barn space to store our bikes, and the fire pit. Most amazing was Tiffany and Mike's graciousness at driving us to town to get some dinner (Uber and Lyft seemingly non-existent) since we didn't want to be biking back to their home in the dark. A terrific stay, and a beautiful spot in the midst of rolling farm fields. The acres and acres of sunflowers just up the road were particularly magical."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay at this property! Although a little far from “town” and some of the wineries we prefer, the house was perfect for us. Super clean, communicative host and lots of space. Thank you!"

Thank you Tiffany, for being a great host and making our stay at your beautiful house so relaxing and convenient!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiffany is an amazing host! We really appreciated her kindness and attention to detail in all circumstances ! She went above and beyond to be sure we had all we needed for a great stay. We stayed at Tiffany's home with our son, daughter in law,
and labs. We felt at home from the moment we walked in! We found the spot to be very peaceful out in the farm fields, yet close enough to activities in town and at the lake. The ample parking was a bonus for us !Thank you so much !"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic spot. We were driving cross country with a ton of stuff, bikes on the outside of the car, and traveling with dogs.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well I’m not quite sure there is enough stars for this review. My stay here was the best! I flew in from the UK to teach a class in Rochester but wanted to experience the countryside too.
I had the most relaxing stay and it felt just like home. Thankyou to you both for making sure I got here safely and for taking me around the supermarket and town on the Saturday I had so much fun.
Can’t thank you both enough for ensuring I was safe at all times and I really loved meeting you as I was concerned about driving again on the other side of the road 😂 I know you don’t usually meet your guests unless they need something so I’m truly grateful for your kindness when I needed it.
I highly recommend a stay here & I know I’ll be back ❤️"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"All of the great reviews for this unit are spot on accurate! The house is situated on a clean, gorgeous, secluded plot of farm land where the wild turkeys run free off in the distance.
Our two dogs Goose and Baloo had the time of their lives running around as my SO ran the Seneca 7 all day.
Tiffany is also a great communicator! She responded to our questions and requests for accommodations on the spot which made us feel at home.
Additionally her house manual (right of the kitchen sink/counter) made for an easy time touring the area, while greatly assisting with finding/using all of the beautiful appliances found around the house.
If you like a quiet, cozy county house on a beautiful plot of land than this is the place for you!!
10/10 would stay again"

The host was incredibly welcoming and hospitable, making me feel right at home from the moment I arrived. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities one could ask for. It was clear that the host had put a lot of thought and care into making the space feel warm and inviting.

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Tiffany was so helpful when we reached out to her regarding her tv channels and even helped us find what we were trying to watch.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was Beautiful and very easy to find. There was 4 of us for a few days to look around at the finger lakes. We were there in a very cold period ( -25 wind chills) and the home was always very warm and comfy. Close to all the area has to offer, more than we could do with our few day stay. Beds were very nice and comfortable. Home was well decorated, enjoyed fireplace and the open floor plan. Views of farm fields were tremendous. Hope to get back soon. Thank you,,"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice gem outside of Seneca Falls. I was blown away by how quiet it was - especially given how convenient and close it is to the thruway. Even outside at night you can’t hear anything from the backyard.
We stayed with family to have a bigger kitchen to make a Thanksgiving dinner with our small group. The house is clean and the open kitchen and living room was as I would describe “a cooking show TV set” - great big, open space and nice communal living area for your group.
We were there in the winter so we didn’t get to sit out and enjoy the stars too much but the sunrises over the fence and barn each morning were really nice. We brought out city pup and had him running all over the yard enjoying the quiet country road - not worried about him running off."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay. Tiffanys home was beautiful, comfortable, truly like home away from home. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean and well organized. The rural surroundings were so quiet, which we truly appreciated since we live in a busy suburban neighborhood with lots of traffic, neighbors, and families (kids). Saw more wildlife than we did people (not complaining, We loved this!) We had a brief concern that we might not like being away from a town center, but really found it a fresh breath of air! A lovely welcoming change!! A quiet evening glass of wine and early morning peaceful cup of coffee. Perfect. We would stay again and would highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Tiffany and Mark's cozy country home. Everything you would need for a stay is provided and the house is comfortable, super clean and inviting.

It truly felt like we were staying in the guest house of a friend because of everything she did to make it welcoming. The water pressure is great in the showers, the bedrooms are all equally nice, and we loved the living spaces and outdoor patio with fire pit. We had a lovely girls weekend to visit the MacKenzie-Childs Artisan Fest and traveled to nearby wineries and local spots in Auburn, Aurora, Seneca Falls, Waterloo, and Union Springs. The location was just about a half hour from our furthest points. If we return to the area we'll definitely be looking to book with Tiffany again."

Also, Tiffany had the basic panty supplies which are great if you are cooking on the property. We would definitely book again and recommend it to anyone staying in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tiffany and Mike are great hosts. We had one issue and they addressed it immediately. The house was great and centrally located for our antiquing trip. We could not have picked a better home for our vacation. Patti Orsini

The whole experience was 5 star and beyond."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is A+, clean, homey, beautifully decorated, and the location was not too far from all the sites. Our host was extremely accommodating and I can't say enough about how much we like this place. You won't be disappointed."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful country home on a quiet, peaceful spot away from the crowds, yet close enough to whatever you need or want to do. Easy access to FLX wineries, farm stands, quaint towns, shops, and restaurants. If you are looking for a serene retreat, this is the place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful house. Tiffany was an excellent host and very responsive and supportive throughout the trip. When we arrived the house was clean and inviting and it was obvious that the host had put a lot of time and care into her property. There were many personal touches that made us feel comfortable and at home, and everything we needed was available in the house. Beautiful scenery and location, and very quiet and peaceful. We also loved the outdoor space with a grill, patio, table, fire pit, and chairs. We highly recommend this beautiful property and its wonderful host."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gem of a house. The house is situated on a idyllic country road with a huge scenic yard surrounding by corn fields. The home was spacious, clean and had everything you could want. The owners were very communicative. Loved staying in this home and would recommend to others."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tiffany’s home was the perfect getaway for a relaxing weekend trip. The house is cozy and so welcoming. Cayuga and Skaneateles lakes are only 25 minutes from the house. We did the Watkins glen waterfall and Seneca lake on day 1 and went to the house which was only 50 minutes drive. We enjoyed the treats kept for us on our arrival. Tiffany was a wonderful host! We will come again!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"if you're looking for a peaceful and beautiful stay with amazing landscape, this is the place to go. Very clean and quiet. We even had cute little deer roaming early in the mornings! This place is definitely worth it if you're looking to get away from the noisy city life. Our host was very attentive and polite. My family and I will hopefully return next summer!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Tiffany is the most thoughtful, gracious host.
She provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. ♥️♥️ I highly recommend to visit this stay it’s wonderful ♥️ we loved it"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little slice of heaven!! This beautiful house and landscape is simply breathtaking. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights with our small dog and we were honored to be Tiffany’s first guests. We were greeted with such a lovely and delicious plate of homemade cookies and fresh flowers and Tiffany also had dog biscuits and baggies, such a thoughtful touch. The decor was lovely with homey touches, beautiful kitchen with beautiful island and appliances including an ice maker which we appreciated. All rooms were good sized and the master bedroom and bathroom were beautiful with a big corner shower and walk in closet big enough to be another bedroom. While the home was gorgeous and comfy our time was mostly spent outdoors. The view is incredible, farmland, trees, beautiful birds and daily visits from the deer made our vacation truly exquisite. This is the perfect spot for someone craving privacy and peace. Couches in the living room were all recliners, which was very nice, and super comfy. The master bed was a firmer bed but grateful to find a king bed , outdoor furniture was very nice and comfortable. We used the gas grill and there was a fire pit as well. We enjoyed cooking our meals with groceries from our visit to Sauder’s Store, a wonderful Amish grocery store a few miles away and stayed in and enjoyed this wonderful home! We had an issue with the tv which Tiffany responded to immediately. Beautifully decorated, lots of homey touches, peace and quiet with nature all around truly restored our soles for a much needed reset. Can’t wait for our next visit!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Seneca Falls at Renee's place. Renee is a great host, great communication, warm and welcoming. We stayed in the blue room with a private bathroom in the hallway. It was charming and comfortable, and we particularly enjoyed relaxing in the little coffee room across the hall, where drinks and snacks are available all day. There are equally charming common spaces on the first floor for guest use. Breakfast was delicious... and it's true, Renee's homemade bagels and fixings are such a treat! We were also delighted with delicious waffles and fruit the second morning.
This home is easy walking distance to the town, with restaurants, the Women's Rights National Park and museum (being the birthplace of the suffrage movement) and the charm of being considered the inspiration for much of the movie It's a Wonderful Life. It's also about a 10 minute drive to the Montezuma Natl Wildlife Refuge. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend a stay at this Airbnb!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My plans changed a couple times upon check-in and Renee accommodated everyone of them each time fantastic to work with great place great location. HOMEMADE BAGELS!! The best!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We spent two nights in Renee's beautiful house and enjoyed the time there. The room was very cozy and the breakfast exceptionally good. There were homemade bagels and waffles. Renee is a friendly and open host who gave us helpful tips for the area. The house is a former monastery and has lovingly restored rooms. The two cats also create a feel-good atmosphere. We hope to come here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I really enjoyed our stay here! Place is exactly as described and we were very comfortable. Renee is super sweet and made us breakfast!! We would totally stay here again

She was very responsive to messages, and easy to communicate with. The highlight of the stay were the bagels she made for breakfast! They were incredible! The house itself is also very cool, and has a lot of history Renee will share with you. 10/10 would recommend and stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renee was an excellent host. She was always very quick to respond to our messages. Her place was perfect for us while visiting the area. She made us feel right at home and she makes the best bagels! We would stay at her place anytime we are in the area again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renee is the consummate AirBnB host. Her homemade baked goods are the highlight of a superb continental breakfast, which include many high quality options. Her attention to detail is second to none! There are dozens of amenities which show forethought and great consideration of guest requirements. The bed and bedding was MOLTO comodo- VERY comfortable! The 1925 building does not allow for en-suite baths, and you'll have to negotiate a wide staircase (with a solid bannister!) but these are minor compared to the level of service and comfort provided by Renee at a quiet but great location. I'll definitely stay here on all future visits to the area. And there is a huge off-street parking lot as well!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Renees Place is in a quiet neighborhood that is within walking distance to the downtown dining and shopping area. The place was described well and I would not hesitate to stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Small room but comfortable bed. Wonderful homemade bagels for breakfast with optional sweet or savory toppings. Renee was helpful with dinner suggestions.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renee's home is a stunning recreation of a beautiful home from another era. Comfortably appointed for a relaxing stay. Every detail points to a warm welcome. We stayed two nights in a lovely bedroom adjoining a hallway bathroom with all amenities provided in this clean spacious home. Renee prepared a homemade breakfast each morning that was comparable to any elegant inn. Her hospitality and kind manner was evident in all aspects of our visit. We took a leisurely walk to town, visited the ""It's a Wonderful Life Museum,"" and enjoyed two good restaurant meals during our weekend. Finally, we visited the Seneca Lake State Park Visitor's Center and Esplanade...all of which were recommendations provided by Renee. Just cannot say enough about this fabulous Airbnb experience, and we hope to return again next fall, if not sooner!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay. What a treat to have award winning baker provide wonderful breakfast! What a nice complement to my finger lake/Erie Canal/dash to Syracuse airport. Renee and her home were so warm and welcoming. Wonderful stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renee’s place is fantastic. It is decorated beautifully. It could very well be listed as an Historic Inn. It has a handful of available guest rooms and a number of comfortable and classic communal sitting rooms as well. Unlike other AirBnBs which are basically someone’s apartment (and of course - some are very nice), it’s is a TRUE Bed and Breakfast establishment. Renee is a wonder host and she prepares some outstanding breakfasts. A great way to start off the day.
The location is also just a short walk from the main Saranac Falls business district as well as so accessible to the Finger Lakes.
Overall an outstanding and very memorable experience. We highly recommend."

A short and pleasant walk into town where there were plenty of nice shops and food options."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Renee is extremely hospitable. Her house is beautiful and exceptionally well thought-out for guests, with plenty of amenities and two parlours so we could stretch out a bit. I especially appreciated the power cords on both sides of the bed—it seems like a small thing, but when you have been travelling all day, it’s really not. The breakfast was excellent, with tasty fresh (award-winning!) bagels. Thank you Renee!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Previous reviews have said it all. Renee is wonderful and a good baker. It is always nice when Airbnb has breakfast, but Renee takes it another notch. We loved having so many places to “be”; you are not stuck in a bedroom as this is a large place with other rooms to read or play games. The Seneca Falls area has so many places to visit and enjoy. Don’t hesitate to book."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice one night stay and appreciated Renee’s freshly baked bagels & breakfast. Great restaurants and town center within walking distance.

Hometown)! I will return again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super location in the middle of a region rich with sites to see. Renee is a wonderful host. I felt right at home and enjoyed her homemade breakfast. Comfy bed and linens meant I slept well.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Renee’s place for three nights. I was hesitant at first because we never stayed at a bed and breakfast before, but always wanted to. My expectations were met, and then some. From the moment we arrived, until the day we left, everything about her place was absolutely outstanding, including the breakfast! Everything was impeccably clean and she definitely made us feel at home with a warm and welcoming atmosphere as soon as we walked through the front door. The location was perfect as we were able to see and do all of the things that were on our list. I would recommend Renee’s place to anyone! Our visit was nothing short of exceptional from the hospitality to the accommodations with breakfast, and everything in between, our experience was top-notch! If you’re looking for a great place to go to make some good memories, this bed and breakfast is a wonderful choice!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay with Renee! Her home is beautiful, and she's such a kind host. Our room was comfortable and breakfast was a great way to start the day. It's an easy walk to get to the main street and Women's Rights Historical Park. Very glad we stayed!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As a native of Seneca Falls I was always intrigued by the convent and finally had the opportunity to see it! Renee is a wonderful, kind woman who was a pleasure to talk to. The room was clean and comfortable and I was very relaxed there. I wasn’t sure what to expect with the shower as it’s such an old home… the water pressure was perfect and the water nice and hot! Renee makes THE best bagels and breakfast was perfect! I’ll definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Renee was very welcoming and accommodating. We drove our EUV to her location and she was gracious enough to let us park on her garage and charge the vehicle overnight, very appreciative.
Also, the breakfast the following morning was very well done, fresh fruit, bagels, yogurt and granola, was very tasty. I was blown away actually.
If we head to a venue once again in Waterloo we will look to stay again."

Easy and safe parking, too. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Renee’s home was perfect for our needs and exactly what we wanted, as described on the posting. We were in town visiting family. She is a gracious and kind hostess, goes above expectations, anticipating needs and providing a lovely morning breakfast in a relaxing dining room. Great coffee, home made bagels, fresh fruit etc. it was neat to learn some of the history of the home. The location is walkable to Sacketts, a highly rated restaurant, as well as downtown. Lovely home and comfortable room and bed. Very nice sitting room she provides access to, which was perfect for my course work and could serve as office space if work calls.
When we are in town again, will stay here!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home has a lot of charm and personal comforts such as access to make tea or coffee throughout the day. Although we weren’t at the place for much of the day, it was always a welcome place to come back to to sleep and the breakfast in the morning was awesome!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow. What a great experience we had at Renee’s place! Sparkling clean and spacious with a bed that felt like sleeping on a cloud. The house has a really interesting history with plenty of room to find a private spot, or have a great conversation. Renee was happy to share her knowledge of the area, which was very helpful for us. And breakfast was terrific. The fresh homemade bagels alone were worth the drive from PA! Coffee, fresh fruit, juices, yogurt; we felt completely pampered. Thank you again Renee, for making us feel at home We’ll be back for sure."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay. How often do you get your own, separate, ""sitting room"" furnished with Victorian furniture and a side table to make your own coffee and tea? Renee's home was lovely and so full of character. She got up early to make us homemade bagels! She also served us fresh fruit and tomatoes, juice, jam, cream cheese, coffee and tea. It was very easy to get to the Women's Rights National Historic Park ( our reason for the visit). Seneca Falls is very pretty and walkable. I wish we had booked more than one night!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. our daughter goes to college in Seneca Falls and Renee suggested that we invite her for breakfast with us. It was so nice to begin the day without having to find a breakfast stop.
Also, although there is no real EV charger, Renee was very accommodating in helping us get power from her garage.
If you want a real B&B with some nice charm, warm hospitality, and close to the town centre, then this is the perfect place.
we definitely plan to stay here again for our daughter's graduation."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Renee‘s! We stayed there during our roadtrip from Chicago to Boston and it was a great place to come ‚home‘ to for rest and recharge. The bed was super comfortable and Renee prepared a delicious breakfast in the morning with freshly made bagels.
It‘s a pity we just had one night, but we will come back for sure! 100% recommendable!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Renee was a terrific host. Met me as soon as I showed up, gave a tour with all the details, and gave me a place to keep my bike. I needed some thing from downtown, and because it was a bit far, and she was going in anyway, she gave me a ride. Didn’t have to do that. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and I had all the amenities I needed. I would stay there again if I passed through"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Yes, yes of course there is the beautiful home, historic surroundings, and gorgeous finger lakes region, these are all expected from the listing. The unexpected is Renee. She is without a doubt the finest host in the Northeast United States. She is kind, warm, and attentive. I fail to see how any host can match her. She loves what she does and it is clear from the moment you book the listing."

She proved to be a splendid host, offering tips on places to eat, things to see, and the best cycling routes. The house itself (a 1920's property, though seems much older) is very cosy, complete with a well-equipped breakfast room and three cats. I would happily make a return visit."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renee was a wonderful host! She was worried about every single detail and had everything prepared for our arrival.
She worried about making breakfast for each morning with freshly homemade bagels and everything we liked.
Things to note, my wife was a little sick and we needed some things to prepare a special tea, where Renee worried and got them for us (without asking her).
She is an excellent host and her house was amazing, comfortable and welcoming. I recommend staying here without a doubt. I would without a doubt rent a room once again at her house.
Thank you for everything Renee!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our accommodations were very clean. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom had everything you would need for an overnight stay. Since the house was originally a convent, the rooms were not large. There was ample storage space in the closet for our bags. Renee went out of her way to assure her that we were comfortable. There was plenty of parking space. We left the window open and barely heard any cars drive-by during the night. We had coffee in the morning but did not stay for breakfast because we had other plans. Would not hesitate to stay again if ever in Seneca Falls for an overnight."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cyclists take note! Renee’s home is a great refuge and base in Seneca Falls, and she was very accommodating — allowing us to clean and store our bikes after a rainy day on the Erie Canal Trail.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location walkable to downtown Seneca Falls, and a short drive to Cayuga Lake. I could really just say “homemade bagels!” and leave the review at that. But everything about the stay was perfect. Beautiful house, with a comfortable room and plenty of privacy. We would definitely book here again. And there was plenty of room outside for a full sized truck and an 18ft fishing boat on a trailer, as well as a place to plug the boat in to charge the batteries overnight."

She was a stellar hostess who met me at the door and welcomed me into her home. After indicating an interest in the history of the building, she gave me a tour and shared some future restoration plans with me. I was delighted!! Breakfast was simple and delicious.... just perfect for my trek to the historic sites in Seneca Falls. One of my personal benchmarks that determines a return visit is cleanliness, and again, Renee more than met the criterion. I did not get to all of the places I wanted to visit in Seneca Falls, so I look forward to a return visit, and I will assuredly be booking with Renee again!"

Finding Renee’s beautiful home just a few minutes walk to the historic spots in downtown Seneca Falls was a wonderful treat.
I walked to and from town across the historic bridge and immersed myself in amazing visits to Women’s Rights Park and museums. And the Women’s Hall of Fame was a delight to soak in. Beautiful spots to sit and rest by the canal and also on the lake. Enjoyed the Sculpture trail along the canal as well.
I will be back to visit and definitely stay at Renee’s.
I stayed in the Blue Room with a private bath outside my door. Everything was clean and fresh. The shower was great and the bathtub would be great for a nice soak. So very, very clean.
Renee provides shampoo and soaps, hair dryers, lovely towels. In addition to the room, there is access to a sitting room with coffee and tea whenever you want and a quiet sitting room on the first floor for reading or chatting.
Very quiet house, great sleeping, and wonderful to return home to after day of sightseeing.
Great breakfast of oatmeal with yummy things to add to it including warm maple syrup. Yogurt, juice, coffee, water and fruit.
I highly recommend the restaurant on Fall Street 84Fall is the name...I had warm goat cheese, beets and salad greens. One of their Little Plates. Scrumptious
Also Thai Mussel Pot...a lot of mussels cooked with a Thai curry sauce.
Both Exquisite with a glass of champagne with blackberry added.

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy room in an historic house with a lot of character. Convenient private bath right next to bedroom; additional private sitting room with coffee and tea was a nice plus. Parked our car in the garage. Renee was a great host with attention to detail. She showed us around her historic house and grounds - very interesting! Lovely, healthy breakfast in the formal dining room. Only blocks from historic downtown Seneca Falls with great restaurants. Would definitely stay there again when in the area. Very reasonably priced."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We planned a last minute getaway to the Finger Lakes Region and were lucky to find this house. The house was very clean and located in a quiet neighborhood. The house had everything we needed to feel at home. Host was very responsive. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, Jannick is very responsive and kind. However, the place was not in line with our expectations in a few areas. If you are searching for something luxurious you should try a different listing. The driveway is not paved. When we arrived it was raining so we were trampling through 60 feet of mud as we were taking our belongings inside. If we hadn't moved our car further up the driveway we may have been stuck trying to leave the next morning. When we opened the front door we were hit with a foul smell that we could not find the source of and never went away (though we did get used to it and were able to get comfortable with candles and febreze). The house is smaller than the photos suggest (only about 500 sq. ft and the kitchen is very tight) and the floor across the entire home is tilted towards the lake. On the bright side, the view is spectacular and the house was really cozy. Great place for a couple looking to relax and read while looking at the lake."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick’s place was beautiful to stay at for our 5 year anniversary! The views of the lake from the living room and bedroom are unmatched- every morning waking up to the sun on the lake was beautiful! Peaceful place to sit either in the living room looking out to the lake or on the patio with the fire place. The night sky is also beautiful as we have never seen so many stars and shooting stars! Jannick is a wonderful host and she will take care of any issues you have! Thank you, Jannick, for providing a wonderful place for us to spend our anniversary. Surrounding wineries are not too far and the town of Seneca falls has some good places to eat. We would definitely return to this peaceful lake house!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bery very beautiful and fun time!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, we will definitely plan on coming back here!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Lake House! I came with a boyfriend and left with a fiancé. The house was great, water on 2 sides makes it feel like your on a house boat but without the motion! So cozy. Heat worked well, bed was very comfy, and they even accommodated a late checkout since there wasn’t anyone checking in the day we left."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here it was like having a boathouse. The perfect location right on the water!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view was awesome, loved the swivel deck chairs.
Sleeping space was cramped Jannick warned us that might be the case (we are elderly)
Very responsive to empty propane for the fire pit.
Wish there would have been instructions on how open/close the awning for the deck and how to get local channels for the TV.
Overall we loved our stay and would do it again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a peaceful setting on a beautiful lake. The cottage is small, but has everything you need. We spent a lot of time on the deck, eating meals, playing cards, reading, and relaxing, when we weren’t biking, paddleboarding or swimming in the lake. Jannick was very helpful and responsive, and we loved the cottage and our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a special place, we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you for being wonderful hosts!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved the place. It was private and quiet.
We were able to go kayaking, tubing and swimming. It was equipped with a Webber grill on the deck so we had lake front dining any time we chose.
There is plenty to go see or do in the area but it was difficult for us to leave the lake or the deck,
we enjoyed it so much! We would definitely return to this cottage. Thank you for a wonderful, completely relaxing vacation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jannick's place was fantastic. A great location right on Cayuga Lake - so peaceful and restorative. The lake house has everything you would need - we stayed a week and wish it could have been longer! Definitely recommend staying here and we hope to be back soon.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing lakefront peaceful getaway. It had everything we needed- kitchen was stocked with spices, cooking oil, pans, etc. We spent the days hiking & wine tasting; & the evenings out on the deck (right on the water!!) for relaxing dinners & card games. Would definitely book again for a long weekend away from the city."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Jannick’s place. It’s peaceful and easy to get to places but just far enough that you really can relax and enjoy the water and wildlife. The bed was comfortable, tons of pillows, the chairs in the living space were perfect for reading and looking out onto the lake. We wouldn’t hesitate to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful 3-night stay in June. This is a unique property; you are literally on the lake. The house is clean, private, & perfectly cute for two people. It had everything we needed. We kayaked each morning, had s’mores on the deck, used the smart tv at night. It’s near hiking and wineries. Would love to visit again. Jannick was a great host, easy to get in touch. Five stars!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a magical little place. It is right on the water and it’s extremely private. I woke up the first morning to the beautiful view of the lake, which I could see while still in bed, and a great blue heron landed on the neighbor’s deck. It would be the first of many. We also saw a fox and loved the soundtrack of waves and water. We took the kayaks out, which couldn’t have been easier, and the space had everything we needed. The shower has excellent pressure and plenty of hot water. We highly recommend State Baker & BBQ, a five-minute drive away, on weekends for breakfast sandwiches (brisket biscuit), amazing croissants and pastries, coffee, and more. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved staying here. It was quiet and private and a wonderful way to enjoy the lake.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To me I just want a clear idea of what to expect from a place so I can make my decision. I really felt Jannick described the place very well and the photos were accurate. Not every place is for everyone but it was definitely for me and I would not hesitate to stay again! Jannick was very responsive and the place was perfect for me. Right on the water! Gorgeous lake views from the living, bedroom and of course the deck! Great location and the cabin is really very cute and makes it easy to feel home away from home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Jannick’s cottage to everyone! my We had a glitch in the airbnb app but Jannick was an excellent communicator and made everything super easy. The cottage itself is very cute and homey. The views from the cottage are breathtaking. It is so peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed sitting on the deck and watching the wildlife on the lake. The bed and couch were extremely comfortable. I feel so rested after this trip.
Thank you Jannick for sharing your cottage, everything was wonderful. We will absolutely be back!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is heaven!!!! It is surrounded by water so no matter what window you look out you are looking at water. Birds and waterfowl were plentiful to watch. Place was very homey. If your looking for a new modern place this is not it, it is a camp and a very comfortable, relaxing camp with all the extras that are mentioned in the write up. Close to restaurants, wine touring, breweries and site seeing. A must place to stay. We had a very relaxing 4 days."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick was an incredible host. The space was exactly how it was described and it’s beautifully placed on the lake.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the most relaxing BnBs I've stayed at! I enjoyed all the amenities and great views of the lake. I appreciate the detailed guides for guests and excellent communication throughout my stay. I'd consider coming back to enjoy other seasons of the area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic experience with lots of amenities included. Definitely worth the trip.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick’s cottage is magnificent! We stayed in December and absolutely loved the cozy fire, the complete privacy, the gorgeous view, the easy access for sightseeing, and the helpful communication from Jannick (even while she was traveling). We highly recommend her and her quiet little place on Cayuga Lake!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick is super host and you can't get a better spot on the lake. We had a great fall stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the perfect place to recharge. Was a great girlfriend getaway, but I would imagine it's excellent for couples too."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great trip and beautiful location. Jannick was straight forward and extremely easy to communicate with. House was perfect for a home base on our long weekend trip away. The beautiful sunrises and lake views with the sun going down were amazing.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a slice of heaven. The views of the lake are beautiful. The house is immaculately clean. Jannick replies quickly and clearly wants you to enjoy your stay. Don’t hesitate to book!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this cozy home on the lake. We'd return in a heartbeat. We booked this place based on the deck & view & even with a lot of rain it didn't disappoint. We could relax in the comfy living room & watch the water.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick’s place is a perfect lakefront getaway. Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful family vacation at Jannick’s lake cottage. We loved it so much we stayed an extra day.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cute, perfect little getaway cabin on the lake. Great views of the lake from inside and out making rainy days enjoyable. Loved the deck and shallow water for kayaking and floating. Great location for exploring!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view from every room. Host was very communicative.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick is a great host. The place was very neat and clean. The location was absolutely the best. There are a lot of things to do in the area. Jannick’s online guide and recommendations were very accurate and helpful. It was our first time at the Finger Lakes and we already cannot wait to go back. Jannick is very responsive and considerate. You definitely cannot go wrong with this place! Loved it 🥰
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect get-away cottage for the two of us. The cottage is right on the lake with gorgeous views from all windows. We visited in the summer and took advantage of the kayaks that Jannick made available to us. We only used the stove once to cook a quick skillet meal. The kitchen is small but surprisingly functional and equipped,although cooking a bigger meal would have been super challenging due to the very limited counter space. We loved sitting in the comfy chairs looking out the bay window to the lake, as well as sitting out on the spacious deck watching the birds and the boats go by. Although there are neighbors on either side it is very private. Everything was as described. We did have to get used to the unusual placement of the light switches at first, and we also had to take quick showers because the hot water ran out if we didn't. Taking one shower in the AM and the other in the PM worked great. The location was perfect for our liking. I totally geeked out at the It's a Wonderful Life Museum! We visited the Montezuma wetlands, biked the Seneca-Cayuga trail, walked part of the sculpture trail, and of course, visited several wineries!! Our favorite was Three Brothers but Swedish Hill was nice too. We also really liked Wolfies for a casual dinner with a lakeside view. All in all, I would recommend this cottage...great host, nice place, and good location!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing lake views, especially in the early morning. I also happened to need to do some last minute work, and the desk setup and strong wifi were great for that. The accompanying lake views from the office area were a great bonus, too!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The views from the living area and the deck are simply gorgeous! More beautiful than the pictures! Very well equipped kitchen with tons of spices. Everything was clean and accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick’s cabin was lovely. The view of the lake is unmatched and it is close to all of the local attractions. We would stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect base for visiting the Finger Lakes. It's close to Seneca Falls where there are restaurants for in-person dining or take-out. We saw wildlife every day while sitting on the deck -- herons, osprey, eagles, ducks, geese and babies. Having the kayaks available was fantastic, and we kayaked right off the deck twice. There are a few games for extra entertainment."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing overall!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time at Jannick's place. The back deck is a dream. We spent every evening out there reading and playing card games. We would absolutely stay there again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick is a wonderful host. Her place was mesmerizing and right on the lake. It was a amazing stay and very relaxing.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very relaxing stay at Jannick's beautiful home on the water. We would definitely return!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple and beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay at this unique spot.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Restful week on the lake with a huge deck to get lots of 'down-time 'reading in. The wildlife that surrounds the area was a true delight.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cottage on the lake. Fire place and fire pit on the deck were very nice. View was beautiful. Close to attractions too. However, this was more of a camping experience. There was no sink in the bathroom. The washer/dryer combo in the bedroom omitted a mildew smell that we counter acted with air deodorizes we purchased. We bought our own bedding and towels for hygiene purposes. The bed was unfortunately not comfortable as well. The Livingroom chairs however were delightfully very comfortable. We did not try the futon couch, so we cannot speak to that. We did however experience ants near and around the bay window and had to clean the outside of the window as we could not see out due to seaweed and dirt covering the window. As it is on a lake I suppose this is inevitable, but we had hoped that with back to back bookings for this cottage that it would be cleaned. All in all we had a good experience. The weather was nice and we spent most of our time on the wonderful deck."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great small place to enjoy a nice week on the lake. Great amenities—fireplace was a good addition. If it gets stormy on the water, waves can get a bit noisy against the windows (but great view)!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is in a great location! Everything was a quick drive away! We had a wonderful stay! We appreciated the peaceful climate and beautiful surroundings. We loved watching for the two swans, blue heron, and several ducks each day. While we didn’t use them, the kayaks were enticing. We’ll be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time on the lake! House is cozy - perfect for two people, and the sink being separate from the bathroom was never an issue. We loved the gas fireplace and views from the living room. Saw some herons and ducks, and even an eagle. The best part was the deck. We loved watching the changing weather conditions on the lake."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I visited in search of a quiet week to get some work done while taking in a view of the lake and this stay delivered exactly what I was looking for! It’s a simple cottage that sits right out over the water. I didn’t have any unwanted distractions and the WiFi was very reliable. I would recommend this stay for anybody looking to slow down and collect their thoughts!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy cottage. The water views were amazing! It snowed while we were there, but the rooms stayed warm and toasty. The kitchen was small, but had everything we needed. The location was convenient to several attractions in the Finger Lakes area. Would love to come again! Thank you!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! It is right on the water so the view is fantastic. We enjoyed exploring the wineries and local scenes in Seneca Falls, Aurora, Ithaca, etc. Self check in was smooth."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick was great and easy to communicate with. the cottage has a lovely view of the water.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. I’m def booking again in the future.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot right on the lake was a great home base for a Finger Lakes winery tour!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect little spot for my solo weekend away. Waking up to a sunrise over frozen Cayuga Lake was absolutely beautiful. I'd imagine this would be extra lovely in the summer with direct access to the lake from the deck, but it was also beautiful in the snow. Jannick was very communicative throughout the days leading up to my trip and sent me messages while I was there to make sure I was okay - which was much appreciated since I was traveling along.
The location is great since it's right on the water and only a few minutes away from Seneca Falls and around 20 minutes away from Geneva. Definitely recommend for a peaceful getaway!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick is great! Really helped whenever I had questions. The location is perfect, and the place itself will now be filled with wonderful memories. Thank you so much!!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick is superb. She checks in with you throughout your stay and makes sure you are comfortable. the view from the living room is so beautiful and peaceful. This is absolutely a find!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, relaxing cottage"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful little place by the water with everything you need for a pleasant stay. Loved the water views, gas stove, and warm feel."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great little house right on the lake. It's so close to the water that it feels like being in a houseboat :-) Relaxing, peaceful spot. The northern end of the lake is very quiet, and yet it's only a 10 minute drive to shops/restaurants in Seneca Falls. The area has multiple waterfalls with hiking trails, from easy to challenging, within a 40-minute drive. We had a great week here!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this cottage on Cayuga Lake. It was the perfect home base for our hiking and wine country adventures and relaxing at night (and kayaking!! so fun!). The lake views were insanely beautiful and I feel grateful to have stayed here. Thank you for your hospitality! We hope to come back again in the future.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wow.. i was so glad i got this beautiful place at very last moment.. I'll save the long writing and just get to the pros and cons..
PROS:
Jannick (the host) is very helpful, responds in time, lives just 2 properties away. You get complete water view from bedroom window. A huge window in living area and amazing water view. A study desk which was very helpful for me since I had office work to attend to in day time. Very good wifi, no issues with speed and continuity of service there. There are 2 kayaks.. me and my wife enjoyed kayaking, you do see folks boating or jet skiing or kayaking.. not crowdy but good to see a face or two while in the water. A huge deck with firepit.. enjoyed the evenings just sitting there and watching the waters.. you have a neighbor which also I think is on AirBnb.. no noise though. you can hear them but you can't see.. you can just get into water from your deck.. there's ladder there.
CONS:
No wash basin the bathroom but it was not a con for me and my wife to be honest.. it's a silly small thing which i don't count.. that's it.. we enjoyed our stay so hardly see any cons
Thank you so much Jannick.. you were very helpful at the times I called you for help.. We would love to be back sometime again.. Take care!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a wonderful month on mesmerizing Lake Cayuga! Athough the cottage is small, it was clean and comfortable with such amazing views! The deck is beautifully furnished... another great living space. The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful, lovely for walks. Sauders' store has plentiful provisions and there are many shopping options. We enjoyed trips to surrounding cities, enjoying the gorgeous countryside. This little place will stay in our hearts and memories for years to come."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful week here. The views are incredible! It’s like being on a house boat, you’re so close to the water. Jannick thought of pretty much everything so all we had to do was get food when we arrived. She also was quick to respond with any questions we had. The water is easy to access for swimming and kayaking. Deck feels pretty private as you can’t see the people to the left due to trees and the house on the right is a bit further back. We also had some great meals in the area and there are several wineries close by. Nice, relaxing place for two. We will be back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such an amazing and cute Airbnb! We absolutely loved our stay and the location was so private and beautiful! While it is small, it has such a cozy and loving atmosphere that is perfect for couples. Jannick is an amazing host, quick to respond and extremely helpful! The only con we can think of about this place is the hot water does go fast so be prepared for quick showers. But the view, ability to kayak/swim right off the back deck, and the privacy of the location makes it a great place to stay!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy little cottage on the water. We stayed for a long weekend. Swimming right off the deck. Overall a nice stay, but a few things we noted: bugs at night made the deck pretty much only usable without any light/fire (they were attracted to the light)- we’ve stayed at various places in the Finger Lakes and never experienced that so not sure if it was due to the time of year, location, or what. It was disappointing to not be able to really enjoy the firepit. When we arrived we checked the propane tanks and they were both empty, but the host brought a refill minutes after we notified her. The charcoal grill needed to be cleaned out, but everything needed to grill was provided which was nice. Overall, the pictures are accurate and it was a decent value."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Falling asleep to the sound of the water and birds of Lake Cayuga was magical. It was a lovely few days in a small but well appointed waterfront treasure. We hope to return!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing experience for my Husband and I’s one year anniversary. The cottage is much nicer than pictures :)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just a wonderful place to get away. It’s even better and more relaxing than I imagined! Jannick was lovely and we definitely look forward to coming back again.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location! This spot on Cayuga lake is fairly shallow (water not freezing!) and boasts of both sunrises and moon rises. Just beautiful. Also the deck was very livable and had a big table, cushioned chairs and a gas fire pit. We loved the kayaks for use as well. There is no sink in the bathroom but this is a cottage. We were glad for the central air conditioning which is not always the case in a cottage. My daughter and I were the guests and the size was perfect. There are thick hedges for privacy from the nearest neighbors. I would stay here again!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views from every room in the cottage! Close to wineries, parks, restaurants. Great launching point to just driving around and stopping at the villages and cities around Cayuga and Seneca lakes. Very private and quiet."
2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin right on the lake. Beautiful views of Cayuga Lake, great bird watching, cozy gas stove heater for chilly nights and fireplace on deck is great addition."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tucked away right on the water. Feels very private even though neighbors are close by. The view of the water from the bedroom makes it hard to want to get up. Catching the sunrise through the house was so beautiful. A perfect quiet retreat with lots to explore nearby.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location. Cottage was clean and cozy. Spent a few nights for a birthday getaway while visiting some wineries, breweries and other area attractions."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and lovely in the winter
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick’s house in Seneca Falls was lovely. It’s a cozy house situated right next to Lake Cayuga. It had lovely winter vistas, and I could see it being a great place to visit in the spring and summer seasons. I went up with a friend for a comfy, long weekend to enjoy the FLX wine region and enjoy a snowy, lakeside retreat. That’s exactly what we got. I recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet getaway alone with a partner."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Right on the water and private!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t recommend this cottage enough! I went with my boyfriend for a short winter getaway and we enjoyed ourselves so much.
We stayed in late December- we got to watch the lake freeze over and even got a few inches of snow! Despite the cold temperatures, the cottage stayed very comfortable and warm with the help of the amazing cast iron stove and the central heater. The pictures are beautiful but don’t do it justice, you have to go see this place yourself!
Jannick was so sweet and checked in on us during our stay to make sure everything was okay and that we were having a good time.
If you’re looking for a nice, quiet, winter getaway look no further. (And I’m sure it’s just as lovely in the summer!)"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place surrounded by the lake. A great place to relax and unwind.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was exactly as advertised. Cozy and right on the water, close to a number of wineries and not far from Seneca Falls. We only wish it had been a little warmer so we could have spent more time on the beautiful deck. Definitely worth a visit!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! The view from the deck was amazing! Couldn’t be happier with this place.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent a lovely weekend here celebrating our 19th anniversary. The cottage has great views of the lake and relatively close proximity to many wineries, restaurants, and other local attractions and activities, but is still secluded enough to feel like you're the only people around. Everything was very clean, and the space was perfect for the two of us - very cozy. Overall, an excellent value, and a place that we would love to visit again in the future!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is very nice place to visit. You can see the lake from almost window in the cottage. It's very well located and an easy drive to all attractions in the area. A great weekend getaway!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jannick was very accommodating and responsive to minor issues. Awesome views and close to tons of wineries. I would highly recommend a stay there and we will definitely be back !
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We fell in love with the space and the community in a way we did not expect. It was a quaint and refreshing get away and we're so thankful we got to spend our anniversary at the lake. The views are phenomenal and you have to try little Italys pizza and stop by Bees Cafe for some delicious comfort food. Thank tou Jannick for sharing your space with us!
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and cozy place. So beautiful to look out and see the water. This is right next to about 15 vineyards. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back get away.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy, charming cottage . We celebrated our 28th anniversary. What a fabulous deck . We ate dinner out there and enjoyed the fire pit. The views are amazing, and you are right on the water. Even when you are inside you can enjoy the views from every room of the cottage. Jannick was quick to respond and was very accommodating. We will definitely return."
2019-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is quite small - you have to close the bathroom door to enter the bedroom and vice-versa. Since it is built on the water, the humidity level inside makes it tough not to smell a bit moldy, especially the towels."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house right on the edge of the lake. Really peaceful. Very clean.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an adorable little cottage that sits right on the lake. You wake up to see water right outside the bedroom window which is a rare treat! The cottage is perfectly described in the write-up...everything except the sheer delight at being right on the water. Enjoy!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time relaxing,fishing and enjoying the beautiful scenery. Our grandson visited for 2 days and he’ll have a memory for life of fishing right off the deck and catching his first Northern Pike! He didn’t catch it the traditional way but his fishing line wrapped around his gills. We were able to release him unharmed, yet he got the thrill of the big fight and catch. A wonderful memory maybe one day he can share with his little boy or girl.
The cottage is perfect for two but we had plenty of room for 3 adults and a child. We found no inconvenience in using the kitchen sink.(bathroom doesn’t have one) Hot Water not a problem at all for us either. Kitchen totally sufficient for preparing meals. Jannick was so cordial and even invited us out on her boat. We couldn’t go but a note that there’s a golf course 10 minutes or less up the road.(my plans for that particular day)
To sum it up, if your really looking for some down time, this is the place. You can leave all your worries at the road and just relax.
Another thing worth mentioning is AIRNB. We had no problems booking or contacting our host through the app. We had to cut our trip short by a few days and cancelling was no problem and we were refunded the next day.
Thanks again Jannick, for the use of your cottage “on the lake” and the unforgettable
memories.
Rich&Diane"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, quick responses and accommodating."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view of the lake, close midpoint to auburn and Seneca falls, Montezuma is amazing! The canoe was a ton of fun (extremely heavy!). The chairs in the living room were heaven! Beautiful bay window view."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The cottage is described exactly as it appears. The location is great for wine lovers and waterfront active folks. It also may be a romantic getaway. Highly recommend.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick's place was an amazing location right on the lake! Jannick was very responsive beforehand, and check in and check out were extremely easy. As mentioned in the description, there is only one sink, but that didn't cause any issues for us. The place was very clean and although a small kitchen, it was perfectly functional for what we needed. There were plenty of extra blankets, towels, etc. and we also used the kayaks. We loved the little cabin and would definitely come back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing you'll notice about this home is that you missed it when driving past. All but impossible to see from the road, you're looking for an almost invisible driveway hidden behind a hedgerow. Once you find it, you find a cute little cabin that is really out on the water. A code lets you in (way better than a key!) to a cozy cabin, with wood floors and enormous windows looking out over the lake.
You get access to a lovely patio out back, with a wind-out awning, a number of chairs, and a picnic table all to yourself. There are kayak's to take out on the water (though the paddles seem to be a little worse for wear), or you can just climb off the dock and swim around in the water.
The location is right on the Cayuga wine trail, though getting a Lyft is not exactly an option. I'd recommend buying your wine on the road, bringing it back to the house, and enjoying it overlooking the lake or around the gas fireplace/stove in the living room. In a similar vein, all the major food delivery services aren't set up around here as of yet, so ordering in food has to be done old-school: over the phone!
Montezuma wildlife trail is super close, and is a great day trip (they have many bald eagles!), or you can hop over to Seneca Falls, a lovely little town close by. The actual neighborhood where this house is located is not really walkable, but driving wasn't an issue.
One thing we didn't realize before booking is that there is only one sink in the house, in the kitchen. The bathroom consists *only* of a shower and toilet. There's also a hairdryer, but no outlet in the bathroom either, so a morning might consist of the wife blow-drying her hair in the living room while you brush your teeth in the kitchen. For two adults this place is perfect; for more than that, or if you have kids, this might be a tighter squeeze.
Another small issue was that the house gets buggy. There's not much to do about this, but you will be sharing the space (inside and out) with some spiders, moths, mosquitos, and carpenter ants. The house is not air-tight, you're in a very biologically dense area (on the lakeshore), you're going to see a few bugs.
Overall, we had an amazing time at the cabin. It was romantic, cozy, fun, and relaxing. We whole-heartedly recommend this to any couple looking to have a week/weekend out in the finger lakes."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went here on a trip from NYC to escape the noise, however, be aware the neighbors are very close and one neighbor is also renting their space on airbnb. While we were there the neighbor rented the space to 6-8 young college men who blasted their music throughout the night. We asked them to lower their music and they would for about 5 min. We contacted our host, who in all fairness did her best and contacted her neighbor to let them know about the noise. While I am sure this won't happen to others it did happen to us and stating this so renters know there are neighbors very close. The inside of the rental was SPOTLESS. We did not mind using the sink in the kitchen for brushing teeth etc. I do not think the hot water lasts a full hour. For two people taking 10 min showers water started getting cold toward the end of the second shower. The Patio area was not very clean. There were spider webs EVERYWHERE. I counted 10-12 huge webs. If someone were to have cleaned the night before or even two to three days before there is no way there would have been so many webs. I cleaned them so that I could enjoy the patio. The hanging chairs on the patio were not in great condition. Overall we enjoyed our stay visiting many wineries and the lakes."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location. Can’t get any closure to the water as you are literally on the water.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view, close to some great wineries and lots of stuff to do nearby. I will definitely go back."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The views from the bedroom and living room are great but the HUGE deck is the best part! The kitchen is small but functional. Has all of the essentials needed. The only downside is the hot water. We didn't find that it lasts a full hour. That being said, it's definitely doable for two people and may just take some coordination to not get stuck with cold water if there are more people. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. It's a good bang for the buck given the peaceful location on the water."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such an awesome place to stay!! The location is absolutely perfect!! Definitely recommend.
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"ON the lake; nearly in it. Really spectacular site as photos indicate. A bit shabby on the exterior but neat and clean, old time knotty pine cabin inside. Slightly sloping floors but ""character"". Well equipped kitchen, bedding, furnishings, TV, gas fire, AC, deck. One quirky thing; the bathroom has no sink, so you must use the kitchen sink for hand washing, etc. We did not use the kayaks. The host lives remotely."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The next best thing to having your own cottage on the lake. The views across Cayuga from the windows and large deck are stunning. Inside has an updated ""cabin-like"" feel, with a big gas stove to keep things warm and comfortable.
Kitchen and bathroom are small but functional, and things that seemed like they might be inconvenient really weren't: the one sink is just feet away from the bathroom, and the limited hot water is fairly easy to pace out.
Self-check in couldn't have been easier, and Janik was thoughtful enough to leave charcoal and igniter for grilling on the deck (don't miss Sauder's Amish Market down the road). She also sent helpful instructions for use of the canoes -- we didn't take them out as the lake had grown windy and choppy the day we planned on, but it would have been easy to do (next time!).
We were happy just to explore the lakes then relax out on the deck -- few things more beautiful than a full moon on the water. This place has a great host and all but guarantees a wonderfully private, peaceful stay."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very quite and romantic spot for a couple to get away. You can look out the bedroom window at the sunrise over the lake. Our host was extremely responsive and ensured we had the best stay possible.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick was a wonderful host. She was responsive and welcoming.
The view from the living room window is really beautiful.
We came up for the “It’s a Wonderful Life “ festival and our stay with Jannick confirmed that!
Mike & Amanda"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and a great host! Had a wonderful cozy stay.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, fantastic host, amazing location! Perfect for our Fall getaway!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick’s cabin on the water was the perfect place for a late-summer week in the Finger Lakes. Directly on Lake Cayuga (and I mean ON the lake), the cabin provided lots of opportunities to engage with nature: watching Canadian geese float by as they took a rest from their migration south while drinking our morning coffee on the deck, kayaking around the northern end of the lake before an afternoon of wine tasting, etc. It’s location at the northern end of Cayuga also provided the perfect home base from which to explore Skineatles, Seneca, Ithaca, and everything in between. We would be happy to stay here again the next time we find ourselves in western NY."
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and clean
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A pleasant cottage with wonderful proximity to water.
2018-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jannick was a great host! She’s very quick to respond and the “Love Shack” is the perfect getaway. Waking up right on the lake every day and having coffee on the deck...it’s unbeatable! Location is close to everything, just know you’ll need a car to travel to the local spots.
Thanks, Jannick, for allowing us into your home!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location and amazing host. House is as advertised and clean. We had a fabulous stay.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a get away, host was great and the view is worth a million dollars."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy space and convenient location overlooking the beautiful lake. The area allows for many adventures and the return to the deck for meals and relaxation and a glass of wine under the stars was exceptional. I would definitely go back!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I spent two relaxing weeks in this cozy rustic cottage. It is very private, right on the lake and we spent most of our time on the huge deck. The area was surprisingly quiet; more people fishing or kayaking than driving motorboats. The one drawback is that the stairs leading into the water looked a bit awkward to get on. Jannick was very agreeable and accommodating. When we asked how to get network programs on the smart TV, she kindly had a UHF antenna installed the next day, so we were able to watch the World Cup as well as 17 other over-the-air channels. We would definitely recommend the cottage for a couple and also highly recommend Sauders Mennonite market, about 4 miles away and so much nicer than regular supermarkets."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cottage is as advertised. Perfect for our family of 3. Great location convenient to many attractions (the lake being the best). Jannick was great, easy to communicate with."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The “love shack” is a fantastic place to stay with an amazing view of the lake! The place is cozy, intimate and in a great neighborhood. We loved using the canoes on the lake and the lounge chairs on the deck!
Only downside, which is small, is that there is no sink in the bathroom so we washed our faces and brushed our teeth in the kitchen sink. Strange, but not a deal breaker.
Overall very clean and lovely little spot!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This space was perfect! Our kids enjoyed spending the past few days on the lake. It was so serene and we made many memories.... fishing, kayaking, sun rises, board games... just perfect! The location is great for navigating over to local cheese shops, wineries, fudge shops, or just a good museum tour in Seneca! Thanks for having us and we will be back soon!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is really a lake property, you are literally on the lake. Absolutely stunning location & we were spoilt by the weather during our stay. There were filters for the coffee machine but no coffee so don't get caught out. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & I would be more than happy to recommend this property."
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is lovely, with a water view and a patio outside. It was really nice to just drink tea and sit on the chair watching the water. The cabin is a bit small, we had 3 people and it was perfect, but probably will be a bit crowded if you have more people. The patio however was quite big, and you can go into the lake from there. The hot water is limited every hour or something - the details were in the guide book but we probably didn't plan well so hot water ran out during my shower. Jannick was very responsive, and kindly let us check out a bit later to give us more time."
2018-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Very nice view and location. Very clean. Host was very reachable and quick to respond. No issues with check out or check in.
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. The location was very nice. Due to the unfortunate bad weather when we happened to be there, we needed to spend a bunch of time in the house, but with the window overlooking the lake, that did not feel so bad. Since the house sits right on the edge of the water, it feels like being on a houseboat. Hopefully, we will get a chance to return."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely retreat! The kitchen is small, but well stocked, so you can make nice meals and stare at the lake. Loved sitting by the fire and looking out at the lake."
2018-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at jannicks place. We loved sitting by the fire place and enjoying the veiws!
2018-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the Lake front view Stunning! Ice skating on the lake and WINERIES, and Great hospitality!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great stay (see other review). Highly recommend.
2018-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this cottage is really unbeatable. Right on the lake, yet also close to anything you might need. Although, we loved the privacy. We spent hours in front of the bay window literally just staring at the gorgeous, iced-over lake while sipping coffee or wine.
The space itself is a bit rustic (could be notable to some that there’s no sink in the bathroom, and the bed linens could use a slight update), but we really made ourselves right at home. We brought groceries for several days and were able to cook up a storm in the well-equipped kitchen. The gas fireplace heats up the place in no time at all - it’s so cozy, even when it’s 5 degrees outside - and the smart tv was awesome! We had our own Spotify music on (or Netflix show) almost all the time.
We sincerely enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to stay another day! Jannick was immediately responsive and accommodating to our change of plans, even though it was New Years and she was in another country! We highly recommend staying here during ANY season."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this adorable lakeside cottage! The view is gorgeous and the gas wood burning stove kept the place cozy and warm. There is also a lot to do in the area. We had a fantastic meal at 84 Fall in downtown Seneca Falls and took an interesting trip to the nearby Women's Rights Museum. We also picked up a tasty bottle of red wine at Montezuma Winery right up the street. During the week, we ventured down to Taughannock Falls State Park and hiked to the base of the frozen waterfall and it was stunning. We then spent some time strolling around the shops in Ithaca, had a lovely dinner, and brought some tasty treats back from Ithaca Bakery. Jannick was very responsive whenever we reached out with a question. We hope to return again."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This lake front cottage was so cute and quaint! Perfect location to everything you want to do in wine country! Would love to return when the weather is warm so we could kayak and walk right into the lake from the back deck.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Veronica’s place. The Loft is industrial design, beautifully decorated and gives a cozy feel. Amenities are great we loved the wine & snacks. Nice not having to pack shampoo, etc. Full kitchen for use, although we took advantage of the variety of restaurants in walking distance. The view is serene on the canal with Wonderful life bridge. I thoroughly enjoyed the morning walks with the sculpture trail and canal walk. Seneca Falls is a quiet town with lots of history. The surrounding area is filled with wineries, galleries, waterfalls, and many trail walks. Worth a visit and stay at Veronica’s. My husband & I both had a nice anniversary vacation. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Veronica’s place is impeccably decorated, clean, and in a wonderful area within walking distance to many bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend and loved the loft apartment! Veronica was a great host from early instructions to checkout! Every possible item was topped off! All the needed amenities were provided- water in the keurig, coffee options, snacks and bottled water. Veronica even left us a bottle of wine to celebrate our Anniversary! The loft was tastefully decorated and made it enjoyable to be there! Cheers!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is the perfect spot to experience Seneca Falls. It's right in the heart of things but it was quiet on a Wednesday night, right on the canal. My friend and I walked over the bridge to get some dinner at a fantastic restaurant. The unit itself was immaculate, well equipped, comfortable, and quiet. I could easily imagine spending more nights here."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Veronica spent time turning an older building apartment into a clean and modern apartment with thoughtful amenities. We would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a clean, well-appointed, and comfortable apartment near restaurants, museums, and the canal. Great place to stay in Seneca Falls."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What Veronica has done with the space is absolutely amazing! You can tell how much heart and care she invests in her space. It was the most adorable space I have stayed at. Even though it was an apartment feel, it was so quiet and so cozy! My mother is a very harsh critic, especially when it comes to cleanliness, and she was SO impressed.
Every single detail was thought of, down to the toilet paper being folded to a triangle design. The snack bowl was such a perfect touch and came in handy for our drives to different surrounding areas and on the way back home.
The location was perfect! We were able to walk to everything -- restaurants, historic spots and the shopping was right outside of our door. Really cute coffee shop right across the street as well!
I would highly recommend Veronica's space and hope to stay there again when I return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Veronica’s place! The apartment was very clean and well-maintained. From the apartment you can easily walk to many downtown restaurants, a brewery, and other local attractions. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seneca Falls."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was beautifully decorated and comfy beds. Place was cozy and well-stocked with everything we would need. It was quiet and we loved the canal walk and being close to the shops. Vanessa was very responsive. Definitely recommend.
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,Perfect location in Seneca Falls and right in the heart of the action. Very responsive and communicative host. Thanks!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. The host was communicative and clear with instructions so check in and out was easy. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay and beautiful views along the canal just steps away from the rental. Veronica was easy to communicate with and the place was cozy and clean. We’d absolutely come back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply lovely and by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Veronica’s place was spotless, conveniently located, and oh-so-homey. It is within walking distance of all local eateries and has a beautiful view of the canal. Super easy to drive to nearby wineries and farms. The kitchen is fully stocked - wine glasses, pots, bowls, utensils, everything. And everything is beautifully decorated! My family couldn’t stop raving about the apartment days after we left. Coupling these factors with the great price we paid, booking Veronica’s Airbnb is a no-brainer."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. The location was beautiful and Veronica was so helpful and quickly responded. It was probably the cleanest place we’ve ever stayed in. I highly recommend!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Veronica’s place is Wow!
You open the door and the space takes your breath away.
The space is large, open and offers cozy inviting spaces to enjoy individually or with your guests.
The attention to detail for every comfort was very much appreciated.
The color scheme and space planning with attention to scale and design make it the perfect balance.
The soaking tub, coffee station and reading nook were favorites. The water view and proximity to town and local tourist attractions were perfect for our autumn weekend getaway!
We highly recommend.
Joan Marie and Ron😀"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I planned a surprise trip for my wife and mother-in-law, and Veronica was onboard from the very beginning! She even asked what kind of wine they enjoyed so that a bottle was waiting for them when they arrived! My wife couldn’t stop raving about how great the place was - full of wonderful books, stocked Keurig/tea bar, snacks available, beautiful location, and so much more. My wife and her mom walked everywhere around town from Veronica’s place. When they went to a farmer’s market, they even had a fully stocked kitchen to cook dinner in. They especially loved having separate ares for themselves, and kept talking about when their next trip would be. During their stay, a water line came loose from the bathtub. Veronica and her husband Jeff were on top of it as soon as they were informed! They fixed the issue, provided fresh towels and a clean bathmat, and they made sure to keep my wife informed of their progress the whole way. Thank you Veronica for making their trip a success!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a beautiful loft. We. all walked in and couldn't believe we found a place this great. Price was good too! Location is a short distance to the bars and restaurants and right on the water which I forgot about. All linens, towels and washcloths provided and plenty for 4 women.
Only downfall is the mattresses on the bunks are not comfortable at all and two of us were very sore the next dayMaybe bring a mattress topper if you plan to use them.
If you're looking for a clean, private, quiet place to stay definitely don't look past this booking! Thank you to the host for sharing their great space."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Veronica's airbnb was fantastic! It was beautifully decorated and absolutely immaculate. We loved staying there and would highly recommend it. It was also so well stocked. She was not missing anything. We loved it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful loft apartment in downtown Seneca Falls. The perfect location for my friends and I to stay and explore the area. Veronica’s place was clean and had everything you could possibly need for your stay. It was a great place to relax after visiting wineries in the finger lakes. Would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio in a great town. Super cute layout and great decorating. Veronica was super helpful and responsive. Extra accommodating when we accidently left some clothes behind. A beautiful bowl of snackies were perfect after a long day of activities. Plenty of parking and a gorgeous morning view for coffee on the shared deck. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great loft for a small family. The location was perfect for easy access to the canal and downtown restaurants.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay here again in a heartbeat. The place was immaculately clean upon our arrival and looked exactly like the photos. It was so clear how thoughtfully the space was laid out, and there was just about every amenity imaginable. Veronica left very easy to follow instructions for check in and check out. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for one night at Veronica's loft while driving through the Finger Lakes region, travelling with four children - two teens and two youths. Veronica's place was spotlessly clean, and super comfortable for our big family. It had everything we needed, nicely decored, great shower, lots of linen and extra blankets. One of the best AirBnB's we have stayed at and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Veronica’s place was a fantastic stay for the weekend. Very clean, organized, and spacious. When I return to the local area, I will definitely try to stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Loft of Veronica is stunning, even better than on the pictures!!!
We regret not staying longer. Everything was perfect and colorful and with style! We miss it already."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I am from Seneca Falls but have not lever in the area for decades. I come back to visit friends and family and I have stayed in every combination of places. Veronica's is the best I have stayed in my over 2 decades of travel back to the area.

I highly recommend, and would love to stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This loft has such a great vibe! So fun to walk along the canal just outside the door. The space was larger than I expected and very well appointed. Appreciated the K-cups and tea options. The shared deck space was thoughtfully shaded and overlooked the canal. Veronica was very accommodating with last minute changes to our travel plans and made the visit a pleasure. She really went above and beyond my expectations!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was so much larger than anticipated and great for a mid-size group! Walkable and right in the heart of downtown Seneca Falls.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Veronica was an amazing host and the way she has set up this apartment is really amazing! The apartment is beautiful with an amazing kitchen and even better bathroom. There were enough towels for our whole group, we didn't have any sort of extensive checkout instructions, one thing that can be potentially irksome about some Airbnb's nowadays. Veronica accommodated a last minute check out time extension and was really polite in my conversation with her! Really loved the apartment and would definitely love to visit again 😄"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful apartment in a perfect location in Historic Seneca Falls. In the heart of downtown, very close to restaurants and shopping.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place right on the Erie Canal. Stocked with everything I needed and super clean. Easy walk to downtown and Veronica’s guestbook was helpful to find a place to eat. I had a Rueben at NY Deli that was delicious. There is a history museum on the walk back and Women’s Rights national park the next block down. Farmers market and brewery also on the walk back, and in the evening there was live music outdoors. Definitely would stay here again."

Binder full of recommendations and things to do around town.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"what was not to love? Everything from how it was described to the cute little touches throughout the house made this the most comfortable and easy stay for my family.
After I reserved the rental on Airbnb the host was in immediate communication. - offering recommendations answering questions. calming this southern's concern of northern snow 😂. the host also gave me insights about the rental before we even got there! wonderfully proactive communication.
Check in was super easy!!! We received a message with all the check in information in such a prompt manner. Once we were checked in we checked out the house. So many cute wonderful little touches!!! the Duck 😂 we loved it. there were drinks and snacks provided that my boys dug right into 😂. The rooms were so clean and great. One room even had a table top video game console that the boys enjoyed. The welcome was such a wonderful welcoming touch!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy white house was exactly as described. A home away from home for sure! The location is perfect for so many things.

Check in/out were smooth & easy. Kudos to Jamie & Todd!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice cozy quiet place.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the c
""cozy little house"" very comfortable and extremely clean. Everything was as described in the listing (maybe better) hope we can come back in the future"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great property for our needs. House is the same vintage as Seneca Falls, with walking distance to all historic sites in town. Personal welcome message was nice touch. We would use this property again if we come to the Finger Lakes to tour vineyards, as it is well located"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and great location! Walk to the town centre in minutes. Thanks!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house has an excellent location, so convenient to the historic sites of Seneca Falls, as well as restaurants, etc. The hosts provided excellent communication throughout, as well as a thoughtfully prepared guide to the town and the house's facilities and amenities. All the rooms were spotlessly clean."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay thanks!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean, well-stocked and well-appointed with all the supplies and amenities we needed for a 3-night stay including the much-appreciated coffee bar.
The little reminders here and there and were helpful in maintaining the house rules.
Found the location very handy for exploring the Cayuga & Seneca lake areas: loved Sackett’s Table for dinner, Thirsty Owl and Knapp Wineries for lunch, War Horse & Bottomless Breweries for beer & hard cider."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent stay. We enjoyed the charm of the house...very comfortable. Jaimie and Todd were very accommodating and the whole experience went smoothly.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie and Todd’s listing is exactly what you get. The place is super clean, the upstairs bed is very comfy. I definitely appreciated the tv in the master. I am grateful to have been able to stay there as were moving back to the area and needed to get things done."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jaimie & Todd are fantastic hosts. Communication before booking and during our stay was fast and accommodating.
They very accurately described the property - it’s an old home. The kind built well before central AC! Knowing this ahead of time, we knew what we were getting - creaky stairs & all. Reminded us of our grandparents old homes, but with some updates and extra comforts.
The in-window ac units kept the place cool enough on the hot humid July days. The one bathroom was roomy and had enough vanity space for our family of four to keep our toiletries. And, the shower never ran out of hot water! The kitchen/dining area was spacious and had everything we needed. The living area was super comfy. The perfect spot to relax for a bit after a long day exploring the Finger Lakes. The bedrooms worked just fine for sleeping. The room with the king bed was great. The other two rooms worked for our kids, but might be a bit small for other adults?! Our family was up early most days, but we did note the sun shines bright into the rooms in July. Just something to note if you’re light sensitive. Best of all, the home was very clean! Always top on our checklist.
The location fit our needs perfectly. Seneca Falls is a quiet, charming town with a great women’s rights vibe - being the “birthplace” of the suffrage movement. From the statues and parks, to our favorite breakfast place, Cafe 19 (as in amendment), you really feel the heart of the town. We loved the pizza at Little Italy and the ice cream at Love’s (right around the corner from the bnb). Anything you want to see in the Finger Lakes is reasonably 10 minutes to 2hrs away. And, there’s always a winery or brewery to make a pit stop at for those longer drives.
The value that Jaimie & Todd are offering can not be beat. We are so glad we booked with them for a longer stay versus other places that were double the cost. Along with a clean, comfy place, they allowed us to have the most important thing of all: more time to spend as a family enjoying the Finger Lakes!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House just as described and seen in the photos. Very clean and comfortable for 4 adults. Due to the hot weather, we appreciated the air-con having been turned on before our arrival. Entry via door code was easy. Snacks, water & coffee pods were a thoughtful addition. Great location to walk to Seneca Falls main street with breweries & restaurants. We were there for the Canal Fest July 1-3 so enjoyed the carnival and especially the fireworks."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet house in a great location! We loved the walkability for exploring around Seneca Falls. Arrival and check-in was a breeze - everything went very smoothly.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean premises, quiet neighborhood, clear instructions and communication from Jaimie & Todd. Plenty of good information/flyers left in the living room, on things to do, places to see, restaurants to eat. No complaints."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place, extremely easy people to deal with. Very accommodating and the nicest people."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"second stay with Jamie and Todd, another great experience. House exactly as stated, great location for walking into town."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very quiet and clean house in a convenient neighborhood near restaurants and the women's history museum. Very spacious with a shady backyard.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good clean place in a convenient location, quiet at night, a good value. Master and another bedroom on the second floor and bathroom on the first, but we managed. Jaimie and Todd took care to make our stay comfortable. We liked having our own house instead of a room in a house or hotel. We recommend. -Stacie and Barry"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot. Place was clean, just as described, had everything I needed for the weekend. Owners were cool on the e-mail exchange. Would stay again!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our two weeks at the house. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the place was in a good location for both walking to town and exploring the area. The house had lots of rules to follow but I liked that as the place was clean, well kept and it shows the owners attention to detail."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at Jaimie and Todd's Cozy White House in Seneca Falls. Upon arriving, we found the home to be exceptionally clean and easy to access with their instructions. We appreciated the work that has gone into restoring this home, and there were a few touches that made our stay enjoyable. The towels provided were nice, and the main bed has a foam mattress topper that lent to a restful night's sleep. There is also a fun arcade game upstairs to spend a few minutes enjoying. We'd suggest adding a couple sheer curtains to both the side door, and the kitchen window for added privacy, especially since the bathroom is off of the kitchen on the main floor. Some curtains in the main bedroom might help with light as well, but that's mainly because we're late risers. Overall, we thought the price was fair, and the location (just over 1000ft to the main strip) was walkable for those looking to explore the town. This was a great first experience up in the Finger Lakes!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious house. There isn't any backyard privacy due to the neighbors so we mainly used the front porch and added sheets to cover the door windows that had no shades. There is a no shoes policy in the home but found the floors to be less than perfect.
Overall, it was a decent stay for the price."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very considerate hosts. Will definitely be staying here again next time we come to Seneca Falls.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place very clean and perfect house to stay at

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience. House was clean and spacious. Recommend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The ""Cozy White House"" was certainly that...cozy and great! I highly recommend it. The hosts were a pleasure to meet and get to know. It was convenient to all locations of interest for me (Rochester to Syracuse). And, I also took advantage of the local establishments and places Seneca Falls had to offer. The hosts thoughtful consideration to provide all items needed for comfort and ease of their ""Cozy White House"" is a huge plus for anyone wanting to stay long or short. I look forward to staying again in the future."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jaimie & Todd were great. We had some last minute changes to our reservation and they were super accommodating and quick responding. The location is great and there’s plenty of cool places to check out near by. The house was super cozy.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for the week long stay I had with my friend. The instructions are clear, a nice number of amenities are provided, and the owners make it clear that they want to know if anything goes wrong during your stay."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie and Todd were great! Super responsive, polite, and helpful. They had enough cookware for us to cook a bunch of food for a mini Thanksgiving dinner. We were right down the street from shops and food. Would stay again if I'm in the area!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are recommending Jaimie and Todd's place as the house is clean and comfortable, and located in the convenient driving distance from the most famous waterfalls parks , lakes, wineries . Jaimie and Todd are caring and responsible hosts."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and easy
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Older home fixed up and cleaned well! Second stay here - couldn’t beat the value!
Cons: Very strict rules. Signs with rules throughout the house plus a large binder with rules including no shoes allowed in the house. Was charged for two towels that they claimed were still stained after being washed. One was definitely visible but the wash cloth did not have much to be seen.
Again cheap stay and fee so I paid but just beware"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute space for a quick get away with the girls or family! Location was perfect walking distance to local food shops and historic sites. Space was clean and had extra towels/wash clothes. Cooking utensils were provided too! WiFi went in and out.

2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older home as advertised and as such it has it's quirks. It is in a nice location, central to both Seneca and Cayuga lakes. There is a lot to do that is not drinking involved. There are four state parks nearby, a national wildlife preserve, loads of great ice cream places, and a drive in restaurant."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie and Todd's place is a great place to stay. Don't let the outside deceive you -- Jaimie and Todd did some great renovations on the inside of the house. I agree with other reviewers -- it's super clean.The house is in the town of Seneca Falls where the Women's National Historical Park is located although it is temporarily closed at this time. The location was central (~40 min- 1 hour) to many places we visited including Watkins Glen, Taughanock Falls, and all the lakes and respective wine trails. It's also an hour from the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester. The house was great to come back to after a long day of hiking and driving. We literally would plop on the couch and just watch movies on their big screen TV."

The carport in the driveway was perfect for parking our boat under, and all the amenities in the house really made the space feel like home. The location is within walking distance to the main street in town, and the quick access to highways made getting anywhere else in the Finger Lakes region a breeze. Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie and Todd's place iz a quiet cozy little place. We stayed there while we duck hunted the finger lakes. 4 guys fit comfortably there, the price was very reasonable and having a kitchen to cook in after the hunt was perfect. Nice big TV in the very comfortable living room provided afternoon entertainment as we are up early each day to hunt and didnt spend anytime out and about so this was much appreciated. Very clean and well kept."

The house is well-located in a lovely town, beautiful, quiet, easy access and convenient.
There are some reminders for other guests: the small bed to a little short for tall men and the quilt is a little thin(you can fetch the warmer one in the cabinet）"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Jamie and Todd thought of everything to accommodate for us as guests.

A cute little town and the house was only a block away from town, so we could walk to all the restaurants and shops, which was very convenient. It was a very quiet neighborhood without a lot of noise throughout the day or night, which we were very happy about. The house was clean and had everything we needed for our stay, with a few snacks and coffee ready for us. We would definitely come back and would stay here again."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice house very conveniently located to the main street shopping and attractions. Thoughtful touches throughout such as coffee machine and umbrellas. And quick communication from our hosts!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this house for our 30th anniversary. A great place for a couple or small family. The house was spotless. They supplied nice shampoo, conditioner, and soap as well as nice towels and linens. There are church bells that go off but they sounded pretty and the train only went by once in mid morning when we were there. The house has a nice big TV in the living room and a nice size one in the master bedroom. Great for a couple to relax after a day at the wineries."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect location for visiting the Finger Lakes area. Just a couple of blocks from main street Seneca Falls with restaurants and shops. The house has everything you need with really hot water and all mod cons. Great value for a family. TV programming is somewhat limited.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and location. Will definitely be back!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay at this lovely place. It was very comfortable and clean. The location is great and within walking distance to many restaurants and other attractions. Would recommend!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is great and the house is comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay. We had a little trouble with the door lock at first (it took a few attempts to get it to open) and the hosts fixed it so that it worked smoothly.
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jaimie & Todd’s place was welcoming, clean, and within walking distance to the Women’s Rights Museum, the canal, the Ludovico Sculpture Trail, and more!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jaimie and Todd’s place is in a great location with an easy walk to downtown. It is a lovely old home which they have done a great job bringing up-to-date. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Thank you both for all the nice touches, especially the coffee and snacks! If we ever find ourselves back in this area, we would definitely stay here again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy place and a great value. Train comes by but thankfully not late
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie and Todd's place was so charming, and the cold water, snacks, and coffee were much appreciated. The location was excellent as well! I walked from the house to breakfast and parks/trails downtown. Overall a great place to stay!"
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Basic accommodations that are clean and a nice alternative to a hotel. Loved the updated technology available. Jaimie and Todd are amazing hosts that offer extra touches during your stay. They are in constant communication and make your stay memorable!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great find. We have used Air BnB twice now to visit the Finger Lakes, and this was our first time staying in Seneca Falls. The house was nice and cool when we arrived and had coffee and water in case we needed it. It was clean and comfy and within walking distance to several great bars and restaurants downtown in the Falls. It was about a 20 minute drive to our fave wineries (3 brothers etc) but within only 6 minutes or so of Montezuma Winery which we loved. Highly recommend this place, if the price point doesn't change too much, as I'm sure it will be a hit, we will definitely stay again next summer."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place! My girlfriends and I had a lovely time. We explored the wine trails and had a relaxing evening at this cozy little gem. Jaimie & Todd have so many thoughtful amenities and little things that made our stay wonderful. Quiet, safe neighborhood within walking distance of downtown and just a few minutes drive to the lake & wine trails. Thank you for a great vacation!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect house in a perfect town! The house was super clean. Jaimie and Todd have a fully stocked house with everything you might need for your stay. We loved the extra snacks and coffee they left. We didn’t have the opportunity to use them because we had places to go, but it was a great touch. The king bed was incredibly comfortable. This house is very close to a number of activities in Seneca Falls and the nearby area. All of the downtown area is easily walkable and the walk and back and forth was safe. Overall, this was a perfect location for us, it gave us plenty of walkable activities after days full of driving. We would definitely stay here again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A comfortable home in a quiet community. So convenient for walking to national women's rights historical park and other local sights! Nice kitchen and living room space for quality family time.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely home only a few steps away from downtown Seneca Falls and perfect outpost to visit the fingerlakes region. We stayed only two nights but felt at home right away. Checkin and checkout couldn't be easier. The home was clean and full of welcome touches (snacks, tea and coffee, water in the fridge). A big TV, comfy chairs and sofa, and three bedrooms were perfect for us (a family of four). The house has A/C (central air downstairs and window units upstairs) and, even though a bit noisy when ON (especially the window units), it was nice having them. This is recently renovated old house and will probably be improved further by the owners but it already has everything you need (including high quality shampoo and body wash!). We highly recommend it!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and nice place, very friendly host. Recommend"
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place walking distance to everything in the downtown area. It was quite a bit bigger than I expected. Communication with the hosts was great too, they even gave me a heads up for when they mowed around the property which I really appreciated."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless, thoughtful touches, quiet, blocks away from main street of Seneca Falls and pretty canal between lakes"
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice place for our short getaway to the finger lakes region. Centrally located between Cayuga and Seneca lakes we were able to take in the best of both lakes and the surrounding areas. We loved that they had a full array of items to cook with as we brought food and cooked meals at home almost every day. The coffee and snacks provided were a nice touch as well. The place was very clean and quiet. We tried a number of the restaurants they recommended and all of them were wonderful and a few were walking distance from the house so we were able to get to them without worrying about parking. All in all we really enjoyed our stay - thank you for the hospitality!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great kitchen appliances. Very nice home.
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very thoughtful hosts. House was very cozy and comfortable. Would love to stay again.
,,,"Horrible oder throughout the house. Smells like a cheap motel: mildew, smoke, cheap cleaner? Many windows do not open and several others have screens missing. Would not have stayed if had not prepaid. Bathroom clean. Due to smell would not have considered using the kitchen st all. Overall appeared clean. Spent little time there. Beds not comfortable. Soft foam on top of mattress in larger bedroom was terrible. Entry to property is seamless. Carport is good. Good location for visiting Seneca Falls. Worst experience that I have had with Airbnb."
