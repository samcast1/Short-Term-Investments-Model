2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My dog and I felt like family at Lynn's house. This was the best Airbnb experience I have had (I have stayed in Airbnb's in multiple countries).

It was great to have access to a variety of breakfast foods in the morning."

He said he will for sure keep it as something to book again if he ever goes back to Douglas."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dania
Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your space. We truly appreciate your ability to communicate so efficiently and effectively. The home was extremely large and well-maintained. It looks exactly like the photos. The yard was humongous and would‚Äôve been a great place to do a cookout. The area was not too far from the main area of town so you were able to access local restaurant by car fairly quickly. The home was spacious and had plenty room for storage. The kitchen was fully stocked as well as all the amenities needed. Toiletries were provided. Overall great place to stay. Thank you so much."

I was in town for work, but it's definitely the kind of place that would be nice to bring the family."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted by some of the friendly farm workers and, of course, the farm dogs. We were given a farm tour and told we can walk around and enjoy the grounds on our own as well. The kids got to pet the horse, play with the goats, feed cows, see chickens laying eggs, and tour the farm equipment and fire trucks, among other activities. There was plenty of pre-cut firewood for ease of building a fire. The cabin was beautifully designed, clean, and had plenty of kitchen supplies and towels. Having a full washer and dryer was very convenient.  The host family greeted us warmly and made us and our dogs feel welcome. Thanks to the positive communication, well thought out cabin and environment, this cabin stay made for a stress-free vacation and lots of great family  memories."

I miss being there , I always want to go back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Miller Family farm was absolutely perfect! What a peaceful and beautiful piece of property!! The Miller's were incredibly kind and welcoming. The farm animals were so sweet and got along well with our pup. We loved riding on the golf cart, taking walks around the property, and canoeing on the lake. We had bonfires every single day and night. There was plenty of wood for us to burn. The cabin was very clean and stocked well with anything you could possibly need during your stay. There is a WalMart conveniently 15 minutes away too. The pictures really don't do this place justice. Thank you for a wonderful Thanksgiving away from home!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family absolutely loved our stay on the farm! We were welcomed and taken on a tour as if we were old friends. The kids loved the sweet farm dogs and making daily visits to pet the horse and goats. The location is a little out of the way but that‚Äôs exactly what we were looking for.

It‚Äôs not often you get to experience the joys of a working family farm - the peace & solitude, the joy & freedom of riding on a golf cart & paddle boat, the funny antics of all the pets & farm animals, touring the expansive rows of corn & equipment - it was all so magical & unique! It exceeded our expectations on every level! We are also forever grateful for the opportunity to share this slice of heaven with our pups - Lucy & Riley! The dogs had the best time of their lives! They certainly lived their best lives on Miller Farms as did we! The cabin was absolutely perfect-cozy, comfortable, & equipped with everything we could possibly need with comfy beds to boot!

The house was extremely spacious inside and the property is GORGEOUS! All the animals are great and friendly. Chase and Molly the resident dogs are good with our kids and with our dogs.

I already want to book the place again soon because it was a rare find and we were happily satisfied with all they offered. We have been to other AIRBNB places and nothing compares to this one, it was worth the price. Regarding things in the house we were impressed: there was literally everything we could think we needed which made our vacation easy!
The whole experience of having the golf cart to explore the land was outstanding. The animals, the dogs, the ducks, the little goats, cattle‚Ä¶ we felt we were in a fairytale! The lake and the paddle boat was great to appreciate the sunset.
Thank you again Mr and Ms Miller!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"a piece of heaven in middle of Georgia.
Could not have been a more pleasant and enjoyable stay. By far the best place for my children, and us as a family.
Rodney and Kendra are the nicest people and helped us in so many ways. Such a clean and modern cabin, everything you needed down to the last details. Surrounded by a lake and farm animals that kept the children entertained the entire stay.
There are so many amenities. Outdoor fireplace, horses, cows, boating, golf cart, swings and slides..
This place is DISNEY for RELAXATION and CALM living.
Definitely want to return here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is incredible! Kendra, Rodney and their family are lovely people. Their home was exceptional. All of the amenities you could ask for. The picturesque surroundings had us smiling from the moment we pulled into the driveway. The rooms were comfortable and plenty of space for everyone to be comfortable. We loved exploring the grounds on the golf cart and had a lovely time chatting with the hosts. You will be blown away by how beautiful this place is! They have goats (so cute and friendly) horses, cows and the best farm dogs you‚Äôve ever met! It really was one of the happiest places. My dogs loved the exploring and so did we. Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a peaceful trip and see the beauty that small town GA has to offer! Will be planning a trip back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family spent the weekend on the farm and honestly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a lovelier place or kinder hosts! From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted and made to feel welcomed and at home. Rodney & Kendra have gone above and beyond in creating a relaxing and fun farm experience for their guests. The house itself was incredibly comfortable, and provided everything we could‚Äôve possibly needed (including ample towels, pillows, blankets, toiletries, cooking supplies, etc.) as well as extra touches like nightlights, reading materials and super fast internet, just to name a few. Then there‚Äôs the outdoor space, which is any nature lovers dream! There‚Äôs so much room to explore on the farm and Rodney told us many times to make ourselves at home & roam wherever we‚Äôd like. We enjoyed riding the golf cart through all the trails, visiting Jason the horse, petting Zoyie the goat and our girls made best friends with the farm dogs, Chase & Molly. We absolutely can‚Äôt wait to come back!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely worth rate! Very, very peaceful. My family enjoyed swimming in the lake. Hubby fished from the boat (that was included). We use the golf cart to explore the property which is huge! Beautiful lay out. The cottage had everything you could imagine. The host covered her ground well!
From waters, soda, pellets for the smoker grill. Even threw in some fresh burgers from the farm.
We enjoyed having a washing machine ,WITH detergent. Cute coffee set up. We had a wonderful time. Smoke brisket and a picnic. GREAT PLACE! LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICS!! I highly recommend!!! The Moore-Fraziers"

The place was very nice and clean. I have absolutely no complaints. I will definitely be booking again."

The bed is a queen, with a fold away cot in the closet. The kitchen was lovely, but you have to provide your own gas tank to use the grill. We had a fire in the fire pit both nights, and it was unbelievably beautiful watching the moon rise over the water. Plus the fishing was spectacular!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Firstly the photos of this listing does not do the home justice. This home was far better than I expected. It‚Äôs a perfect size and very clean and cozy. If I need a place to stay again I will defiantly be looking at this listing again. Sam was quick to respond anytime I had a question and he had two dogs Remi and Tracker who are so sweet and nice. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and the lake around the house is beautiful. If you are looking for a place to stay in Douglas book here. You won‚Äôt regret it!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A little pricey, but you get what you pay for - access to the pool and the use of Sam's kayaks. It was just right for our needs.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I felt it was a great place to lay your head while on a trip, but I have never had an experience that the host had not gave me all the details, or had things out to actually find.
We never got a message after we booked our trip, no info no nothing, and I have just never had to reach out to a host ever.
We had a very limited amount of towels for our stay, no extra sheets blankets nothing, she did not give us the WiFi password and wanted us to find it and couldn‚Äôt, had to search for towels that were set up in a drawer out of the bathroom.
Just nothing extra to make it worth over $300 sadly.
I would probably stay here again, as it‚Äôs a great location for my family trip. But these things to me make a huge difference for me! Just make sure you have absolutely everything you need to make this stay comfortable yourself as this does not offer any extras."

The house was a charming updated Ranch - a minimalist vibe with crisp white decor and a few well-selected decorations, which was ideal for us. Very clean and fixtures/appliances worked well! Douglas can get hot in spring and summer, and the AC/ceiling fans kept the house very cool. We had a few questions about the area, and the owners responded quickly.

The house has recently been redone. Everything is very clean, and rooms are spacious (except bathrooms).
Our dogs loved the fenced grassy backyard.
The house is located between 2 one-way streets in a more commercial area. Once we figured out the one-way streets, it was easy getting around. It is close to downtown, great for eating out.

I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend booking with Lynn if you‚Äôre staying in Douglas!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,You need to be an animal lover. She stated she had dogs and they were just precious! She also had cats but one particular one came and got on our bed was like we had known him all of our lives. lol First time I had ever just stayed in a room and not the entire house. It was a pleasant experience.Glad we were offered a fan. I am hot natured and temp in house was warm to me but using the fan at night worked like a charm. The only thing I would suggest to make it a better stay is maybe have donuts or muffins offered with the coffee in the morning.

A mile away from my cousins houses and yes, very quiet. There were some trains that you could hear at times but we loved them.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The green cottage is situated in a middle class neighborhood, just two or three blocks off main roads.
We were greeted by a neighborhood kitten, seemingly waiting for us in the hard pack driveway. Two steps gets you on the patio and front door.
After that, wide spaces, no clutter, and low step showers. This is a good spot if you have mobility issues.
Ceiling fans in both bedrooms were adjusted by remote control, so no problem with that.
The only complaint is lack of a dish rack to air dry dishes."

Always answered my questions and was very flexible since i had an unknown window of time and was u sure when I would be coming in exactly.
Nice place and very open environment for a single or couple.
Plenty of things in town if you need them as I chose to go out once a day and grab food instead of cooking.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with this place and definitely with the price. Best thing was I was able to do a weeks worth of laundry while watching a movie‚Ä¶.just like at home!"
