2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great! Beautiful home!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Was in Batesville for my son's wedding. Great small house. Had 3 twin beds and 1 queen. She definitely needs to upgrade bedroom curtains to darkening curtains in the front bedroom. Alot of traffic on high beams. I would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of our guests recently had dental surgery, and when I asked Melissa if they had a blender, she went out and bought one! Thanks. We came for the eclipse and had fun at the Melba theater and checking out the Batesville art galleries."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so excited to see the Rockhouse Cottage was available for renting again. Melissa was very helpful and made the check-in process completely stress-free. She answered all of my questions very quickly and was always friendly. We love the Rockhouse Cottage. It feels like home away from home. They made some renovations since the last time we stayed here that just made us love the place more. If you are looking for a cozy place to relax away from home, Melissa and the Rockhouse Cottage will not disappoint."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and tidy
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a comfortable stay. There were some scratching noises heard regularly during the stay that were not identified. We think it may have been birds on the roof and side of the house. This is a good place to stay if you want to be near Batesville without being directly in the city. There was a good view of the stars.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at the Rockhouse Cottage for 3 months and it really started to feel like home away from home. When I checked in, everything was clean and the heater was on, Thank you ( it was 28¬∞at the time üòÖ)! It is a cozy little atmosphere, very nicely decorated. Wifi is great and the tv has a ton of apps. It has everything you may need for cooking, laundry, and cleaning. My pup and I loved the big yard, especially when it snowed. I felt safe when a few storms came through the area and we never lost power. Melissa was very responsive whenever I needed to ask her something and always seemed willing to help. I would definitely recommend this location to others who are interested in the Batesville area! And I would stay here again ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the Rock Cottage while moving our son in to college. It was like a home away from home. The house was cozy and very clean. The beds were comfortable. Matt was very responsive to all my questions before, during, and after the stay. We will be making many trips back to Batesville over the coming years and plan to stay here as often as we can."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute cottage! Easy to get to from google maps, great location, nicely decorated, and surprisingly very cool temperature inside (we were worried with Arkansas Summers!).

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a good place to stay when visiting Batesville for a family.
There were a few bugs that found it‚Äôs way inside, but hey that‚Äôs Arkansas for you."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Has all the amenities that you need. Easily and comfortably fits 5 adults. If you are staying in Batesville, this is probably cheaper than multiple hotel rooms. Communication was great. Check in and out was easy. I will definitely be staying again if I need another bnb in Batesville."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location! Cozy and comfy!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a quiet, restful weekend just as we had hoped! Accommodations were exactly as described and had no trouble."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great as always
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is adorable and very affordable to stay. We went to Batesville specifically to visit Marshals Dry Goods store and had a wonderful time in Arkansas.
The house was neat and tidy, the beds were comfortable, and this little house sets outside of town so you have some privacy and quiet, but close enough to town to be convenient for shopping in the little shops down town and any other activities there.
I would definitely stay here again without hesitation."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great as always!

Very clean, cozy, and peaceful! Matthew Is very available to his guests and friendly, he responded immediately to me when I texted him."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay and priced perfect! Mathew had done a great job with this house and I can see why it‚Äôs sold out all the time. We stayed 6 days and it felt like home!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! The decor is so cute and modern! Everything was spotless, would definitely recommend to anyone!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matthew‚Äôs place is just a short drive (10 mins or less) from Batesville. Far enough from town to be in the country but still close to everything. The space is very cozy and clean. I had everything I needed to cook meals as well! Another thing to note is how well I slept - the bed I used was SO comfortable. Overall a great experience and will 10/10 be staying here again when I need to travel to Batesville for school!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable stay! Quaint quirky charming. So clean and peaceful. Love the linen bedding!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So happy with our choice to book this! The house is located in a prime spot- close to the town but tucked out in the country as well. It went above and beyond in expectations for how well they decorated this house! Mattress was extremely comfy and man the towels are thick! Thank you for such an awesome stay. We will definitely be back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"really nice place, I felt at home."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay. Good upgrades in bathroom, &kitchen"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bed is very nice here, the pillows are also 10/10. The house across the street is very cluttered and it did have a smell outside on certain days- so I‚Äôm not sure where that comes from I figure the home across the street. The area is flat and easy to find. The house had a lot of amenities and the rooms are nice sizes. There was one chair that said it was broken. The house had a day bed in the the back room with nice lighting. I would stay here again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Rock House Cottage! The space is comfortable and in a great location for exploring Batesville and surrounding areas. The house was exactly as we expected and the hosts are very easy to work with. We will definitely return!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd like to say that we were in town for a family member that was at the medical center. We had to extend our stay and with the expense of the local hotels and having no kitchen we decided to look at Air BnB‚Äôs in the area. We fortunately stumbled upon this gem which was a god sent because it accommodated us in every way and allowed us the opportunity to relax during this stressful time. The house was very clean and charming and everything was well thought out. We loved having a cozy cottage to call our own for a short period and it provided all the comforts of home. The towels were fluffy and the down blankets made for a well restful night. One of the biggest accommodations was the washer and dryer which allowed everyone to wash their clothes because of our unexpected extended stay. Communication with the host was great, and he even checked in on us, as we were there during the recent ice storm. The cottage beats any hotels in Batesville, hands down and we will definitely book again if we find ourselves there again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you‚Äôre fortunate to find this spot available do not pass it up! It is so peaceful and perfect, just a few miles from Walmart, great coffee shops and food. But in a quiet country spot. The house is very well furnished and comfortable. And Melissa is truly a super host, very responsive anytime you reach out. I really can‚Äôt say enough good about her and her home! So glad I found this!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for hosting us!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was awesome, very quiet but near things. Will be staying there again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Cottage. We got to see the eclipse out in the big back yard and found the peace and quiet VERY relaxing. We are, however, of the Grey-haired set and going up the back stairs and getting in and out of the tub was a bit challenging. All and all, it was a wonderful place to put up our feet and rest."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Just a wonderful stay, every time I was there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Always a great stay!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great experience, super helpful and responsive every step of the way!! A+++"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice quiet cozy cottage. Furnished with a mix of modern and antique. Pet friendly which is so nice. Back steps are very narrow to the outside but there is an easier accesss out the front. I would recommend using that for safety. Melissa checked in with us via text and answered all my questions promptly. I would recommend staying here.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming 1920's cottage with all the updates you need. It was the perfect place to visit my Lyon student and make him a few home cooked meals. Melissa is very responsive host. We'll be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cozy cottage. Clean and comfortable. Melissa communicated with us constantly. Excellent option in Batesville!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I travel from out of town to visit my daughter on a regular basis and this property is perfect.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoy a peaceful cottage with a huge fenced yard for the dogs. There are beautiful furnishings and an awesome washer and dryer (for those of us who needed one!). Batesville has everything you need and highly recommend Fred's Fish House down the street.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Anyone looking to rent out a beautiful cottage with serene and quaint surrounding, reserve your stay with Melissa!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Melissa is a wonderful host, responsive and accommodating. Would characterize the house as quaint. Lovely verdant trees in the yard too. Could have been better without the midnight train honking though."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Melissa is a wonderful and flexible host. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend her cottage to anyone with a small family or pets that need a fenced yard. The cottage is close to town but private and quiet. Loved it!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed staying at the cottage, everything was clean and she provided nice touches like having a fan, coffee, and a nice fire pit."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My sister and I very much enjoyed are stay were thrilled to find somewhere to stay that accepted dogs and had the fenced in backyard.
However, I would not recommend it to seniors with mobility issues. While the clawfoot tub was beautiful, I did not feel secure standing to shower in it as no non-slip mat was provided, and it was very slippery. It was also difficult entering and exiting through the back entrance because the storm door did not open fully and the steps were steep and shallow, not to code. The front door was not accessible to us and no key was left for it. Our host left some written instructions saying the TV was not on cable but was connected to wi-fi, we couldn't figure out the remotes so never used the TV's."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I am a single dad traveling from out of state and can only manage once a month. When I come I try and stay for three or four nights to have as much time with my daughter as possible. Lodging, meals, gas and any ""fun"" things all take money. This Cottage has been the best price and accommodations for what I need AND price wise."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Get place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We spent four weeks at the ‚Äúcottage,‚Äù and felt right at home with everything we needed and more. The location is private yet close to all the stores and restaurants. We will be back!"

IT has it all, Cozy, privacy, extra clean, easy parking, nice large fenced in back yard, carport, lovely outside sitting area, and even an adjustable bed! Location is perfect as well. We loved it!!

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cottage near the heart of Batesville. A quiet, serene sanctum that let us relax in peace, but was so isolated as to have pack all of our supplies in. And the owner was amazing; delightful and helpful in any query. Cannot recommend enough."

He has fans in every room and two small AC units which keep the place comfortable for those hot southern days! (Also has plenty of heaters and a wood burning fire place for the cold winter nights) I highly recommend this place for a weekend in the mountains or a longer trip you won‚Äôt be disappointed! Only down side is no Wi-Fi and with T-mobile and Verizon reception is spotty. Not really a big down side when on vacation but just make sure to finalize any calls or emails/texts while in town! Thanks again Jonathan! :) looking forward to our next stay!

Very cozy little place to spend the week at! The second bedroom does not have a door or curtain though for privacy/sound reduction, my kids slept in there so it wasn‚Äôt too much of an issue but we couldn‚Äôt use the tv after they were in bed since it was too loud. Over all would definitely stay here again!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location of this little cabin, the steep driveway is worth it, the view is outstanding. The inside is nice and cozy, the living area is large and open, with a full kitchen setup, towels were provided and everything was decorated with cozy Arkansas inspired touches. Jonathan responded as quickly as he received our messages, as there is limited cell signal we sometimes waited until town to text. The Batesville Walmart was about a 15 to 20 minute drive away for supplies and food, we went hiking in the Ozarks and stopped at several ghost town‚Äòs and it only took two hours to drive there and back making it a nice day trip during our stay.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When driving up the night of check in, we were welcomed to a beautiful, cozy cabin up on a hill in the middle of nowhere. Upon waking in, a smell & a sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home‚Äù slaps you in the face. The cabin was extremely clean & tastefully decorated. When we laid down the bed was very comfy, if you like a firmer bed. The place has every amenity that you will need if you want a secluded, romantic or family getaway. There is no internet or cable but that is what we were wanting & it fit us perfectly. There was plenty of firewood for a cozy fire inside the fireplace or outside in the fire pit. The fire pit was the perfect set up to make s‚Äômores or roast hotdogs. The charcoal grill is great for any of your outdoor cooking, just be sure to pack the charcoal. There is a swing and rocking chairs for enjoying the porch with your morning coffee. We enjoyed all the wildlife around the area, from deer behind the cabin to the birds & squirrels eating right in front of the porch.

I highly recommend this space if you want to hang out and listen to the crickets, sit by the camp fire, read a book on the front porch, or cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place and we will be back!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time in Batesville and we had the apartments on Central N Ave recommended to us by friends. It is in a fantastic central location. We were only a couple minutes walk from plenty of great restaurants in the middle of town, and all the boutique stores Batesville has to offer.
There was plenty of parking, loads of space inside with a well equipped kitchen. The lounge and dining room was all a nice open floor plan and was all very well decorated. The kids loved their bunk beds and there was plenty of room for us to spread out, and have our own space.
The apartment building itself is very memorable - it's an old stone commercial building that looks out across the giant retro Coca-Cola sign, which was a very nice touch! It was very modern, clean and spacious and we look forward to visiting again next time we're in town."

2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is in a great location and parking was not an issue. It‚Äôs modern, and the decor is very nice.
With that being said, I wish I knew just how inaccessible it is for anyone who cannot walk or climb stairs well. My daughter has a broken foot, so she wears a boot and could not navigate the stairs without a lot of help. The stairs are quite steep with one rail for assistance. The other option would have been to park in the back and have her walk down the drive to the back door. However, we did not feel safe parking in the back as it was quite dark. There was also a car that parked in the back with their lights on for over an hour‚Äî the lights shone through the kitchen window, and whoever it was never exited their car. Needless to say, it was jarring.
The function of the living room does not meet the form. It‚Äôs beautifully done, but the television is mounted on the wall with a cabinet in front of it. The television‚Äôs sensor is covered by the cabinet, so one has to stand and angle the remote to turn the volume up or for any other function for the TV itself. There are also two seemingly pointless armchairs facing the couch which must be moved to the side to allow view.
The kitchen is absolutely wonderful.
The bed area is also beautiful but difficult to navigate. The end of the bed is less than two feet from the wall, so I frequently hit my shin on the bed while attempting to dodge the mounted television. The bed was also incredibly uncomfortable.
It honestly irks me to criticize such a beautiful area, but I wish I had known these things before booking. I would have chose another space."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hidden gem provides high end finishes in a roomy space that offers multi-purpose spaces for relaxing and working. The linens are luxurious and pillows abound. Two large televisions provide a variety of viewing choices. The kitchen is fully equipped for preparing meals or snacks on the go. A washer and dryer is available inside the closet. There are cute shops/eateries just outside the front door up and down the main street area where the apartment is located. There are parking opportunities both in front of (stairs down to apartment) and behind (flat, direct entry) the unit. Definitely a unique property!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the perfect little spot to just unwind and take in downtown Batesville! Super clean and super cool hideaway! Will def stay here again
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was incredible!!! Stylish with lots of premium finishes. The bed was very comfortable and there was extra bedding available. Two large tvs, and DIRECTV with DVR. The swag bag was a really nice touch also. I would recommend this spot to anyone. Its a gem. A+"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here and will again when I‚Äôm back in town. Beautiful, private space. This would be an amazing find in any city, much less Batesville, AR. Love the cozy feel, modern aesthetic, and cleanliness. The bed is super comfortable."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the hideaway! It truly does feel like a hideaway too. Tucked into downtown Batesville where you would least expect it. We love the area.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Kristi's place for a 24-hour getaway. It is a basement apartment, but with some natural light in the back. Probably not the best place if you have small children (given the steep stairs), but an amazing place for a couple or single to retreat. Very stylish, with many nice touches (sound machine, washer/dryer, all kitchen utensils stocked). You'll enjoying resting at the Hideaway! Also in a great location of historic downtown for a great small town!"

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristi has crafted a sleek and stylish studio apartment in a historic block of Batesville. I grew up walking on this street, where my father was a pharmacist down the block, and I never thought I would spend a few nights on Main Street!

The place is beautiful and comfortable. Make sure to bring your own kayaks, boat, and whatever else needed to enjoy the White River. We had an amazing time. John was super helpful and very communicative. There is not much to do in town but honestly the house and the river is more than enough, we loved our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John's place was exactly what we needed! The Honeycove was very spacious for the 6 of us that showed up, the home can easlily accommodate more! we really loved the location being off the beaten path and along the river.

We spent most of our time on the deck enjoying the view and the sounds of nature. I only had one small disappointment with the property. The walk way did not go all the way to the water and the bank of the river was not where we could get to the water for fishing. Not a deal breaker though! Highly recommend this property!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a short stay , very beautiful place gorgeous scenery ,definitely want to come back to actually enjoy this beautiful place pretty much just slept there got up showered and had to go but oh my sooo breathtaking ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

From stargazing at night, the soft beds, patio, to the incredible views of the sunrise/sunset, it is the perfect getaway.

Some pier homes shake and feel unstable, this house felt like it was on a concrete slab and construction was great! Very nice place!

The beds very very comfortable. The back deck is heaven especially after dark. We loved sitting and listening to nature and watching the gold fish swim in the pool. During the day the pool was wonderful! Full sun at around 9am till 4pm. The pool deck was perfect to lounge on during the day and have lunch outside. We also loved exploring the different waterfalls that came down to the pool. It was a dream. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was having to leave! We will definitely book again. Donald and Shelia were excellent hosts!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"While they are still working on expanding the venue, I really enjoyed our stay. Quiet and peaceful with beautiful surroundings.
Would love to see it when they finish the fishing pond.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A unique stay in the foothills of the Ozarks. Our stay was spent mostly outside at the spring fed pool. I was told by Don that the deepest part is aprox 9ft. Cool and refreshing.
We ate meals outside on the covered deck. There is a propane grill on the front of the house.
Inside was clean and there‚Äôs one private bedroom downstairs. Upstairs loft has two beds and was good for our family."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The outdoor space was definitely the highlight of this place. So beautiful! I will say the lack of common space to just hang out inside, as well as it being a loft with 2 beds (not 3 bedrooms), was disappointing. Overall, it was a great place to crash but if you are going with a group, you should know that there is very little privacy."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ground is unlevel so be careful. The serenity there is awesome. Everything you need is there for you. Big fire pit and lots of wood, places to walk around, birds singing and the pool is beautiful. Best vacation we've had in years and we got to take our 4 Yorkies who had a blast also!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Neat cabin, peaceful setting, w/a natural spring fed pool. Don and Sheila are friendly and accommodating hosts. We enjoyed meeting them and hearing about some of their process in creating this woodsy oasis. It was just the two of us with our doggy, but this would be a neat place for kids, too, especially in warmer weather for the pool. Just a really unique and wonderful airbnb experience!"

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The hosts were great! The cabin is small but that‚Äôs all we needed. The kids and dogs had a great time exploring while my husband and I relaxed on the porch. We didn‚Äôt swim much due to the temperature but that did not stop us from having a great time!

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool and Interesting Caboose with some neat gadgets.
BUT to be honest, when walking up to find where we enter was a bit uncomfortable. It was a messy around there‚Ä¶ stuff laying around the caboose and the rail cars including an old toilet. The chairs to sit in, we would not sit in. The grill‚Ä¶ we wouldn‚Äôt use for it was dirty with used cooking utensils still on it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very unique property. If you‚Äôre looking for some cookie-cutter rental this ain‚Äôt it. But, if you like quirky, fun places to stay this is absolutely it. Great place, will definitely rent again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique stay! Well done, very creative use of an old caboose. We rented this airbnb for a couple of friends who came to town. My 8 year old explored the caboose before our friends arrived, and he was disappointed that he didn't get to stay. So much fun to climb up to the top bunk to look out. Our friends were comfortable after getting the thermostat to the right temp - they had to turn it up a little higher than they normally would at night. Would definitely recommend to visitors looking for something out of the ordinary!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a blast staying here. We were only minutes from anything we needed or wanted. Ross was amazing and made our stay an adventure. It was so much fun going through and finding out what all the switches did and learning the history of the caboose itself.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"My husband and fellow football coaches attended a conference in the area, and we were very happy to find this location which was only a 10 minute drive from the conference. The coaches were able to each have their own room and space that was much better than staying in a hotel. Maria was amazing to work with!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house and views. Only problem we had was location it is pretty far out of town. It only has one tv in living room and a very small one in game room. No tvs in any of the bedrooms. We stayed in the winter all rooms stayed nice and warm except master bedroom and it was freezing cold. There is no curtains in Master bedroom so if you‚Äôre getting undressed someone can see you if they are outside, in living or kitchen areas."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a family of 8 that came to visit for a Graduation! Maria was more than helpful at any time I had questions.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place to stay in Batesville. Jimmy and Lindsey are the best hosts. Lindsey helped me get everything just right.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Batesville is a thriving small town in AR. Unlike other towns, the residents have turned the town around. The hosts are part of that team. Great location for all you want to do. The property was excellent, great bed, very very quiet and private. Would use again."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This quaint rental is the best place to stay in Batesville! I come every 6 months or so and have stayed various places. I was so impressed with the space and amenities! Included is all your bathroom needs - Qtips, cotton balls, extra toothbrushes, face wipes, lotion, shampoo/conditioner, and many more. Oh, and the shower pressure is amazing! The living space has a comfortable couch with a cozy blanket, 2 extra comfy chairs in front of the window, a desk, a small settee table, and a large flat screen TV. It also has a fridge with flavored creamers, a Keurig with all kinds of coffee and apple cider options, hot coco in the drawer, and different teas. The bedroom has a charging station for any brand of electronics you may have on the night stand. So handy! The house is on Main Street which is the cutest road in the city with so much historical magic to it with shopping, food, and coffee (The Pinto is the best). Great for a nice walk! You have a covered parking spot with an enclosed gate - making a secure location for your car on the property. The hosts are accommodating and very nice. You will enjoy your stay!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The rooms were pristine and spacious. The weather was cold, but this beautiful old house was cozy and comfortable, very tightly sealed. We went to see our granddaughter, but she tested positive for covid soon after we arrived and was placed in quarantine. We were enjoying our accommodations so much that we stayed on for a few days. Because of the weather and the quarantine there wasn‚Äôt much to do so we spent lots of time sitting at the windows drinking hot beverages provided by our hostess. Lindsey asked several times if we needed anything. I would like to be the visiting Grandma. If we return to Batesville, I hope this home is available. ‚ô•Ô∏è"

The accommodations were clean and modern, with a vintage flare to it as well. Lindsey was always prompt in her communication, and she was very accommodating. She was sure to ensure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend Lindsey‚Äôs AirBnB to anyone and would gladly stay there again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lindsey's place is absolutely stunning. It had every comfort I could've asked for on the first of many stops along my road trip route this summer. The place was spotless, incredibly spacious (the pictures don't do it justice!) while also cozy and thoughtful. I immediately felt right at home and wish I could've stayed longer to soak up even more of this historical home's sophisticated charm. The desk space was the perfect nook for me to work with a cup of coffee - I wish I could've stayed longer! Lindsey and her family were respectful of my privacy but she checked in periodically (through the app!) to make sure I was comfortable and all my needs were met. Should I ever find myself back in Batesville - I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere other than with this 5 star hostess. THANK YOU!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about Lindsey's place was amazing - the decor, the coziness, the small thoughtful touches, the location, the ease of check-in, communication, cleanliness. We have stayed at many Airbnb's across the U.S. and this is was definitely one of my favorites. Even though we tend to bring our own necessities, we did not need to bring anything but our clothes. We had all toiletries, many Keurig choices, cold water in the fridge, and even charging cables next to the bed! I would highly recommend Lindsey's place to anyone staying in or near Batesville. We hope to return someday!"

It‚Äôs got historic charm with fun, lighthearted decor, and the hosts have thought of everything! A desk workspace, a reading nook, and a comfy couch for movie night... my partner and I both liked it so much, we agreed that with a fill kitchen we would live there! After a long, hot hike we got much needed showers with shampoo, conditioner, soap and clean towels provided. We got local tips for great food (we loved the recommended steakhouse) and felt like we were at a movie theatre for the two movies we enjoyed. One of my favorite Airbnbs so far... it‚Äôs clean, communication is great, and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!"

,,,The place was an overgrown mess. The pictures in the Airbnb site are at least 5 years old . The furniture was old and worn. The steps to the front porch were hard to climb. I would not recommend.
