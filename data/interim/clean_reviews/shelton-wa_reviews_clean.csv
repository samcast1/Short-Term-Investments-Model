2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to refresh your mind and mentally reset yourself this is a wonderful place to stay. The forest, birds, walks, deer, chickens, and much more. My only problem not enough time should have booked longer. Wonderful place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here. Loved the serene vibes and peaceful surroundings. Lori is a great host and I think anyone will enjoy the cabin‚Äôs intricacies.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, peaceful place to recharge. The property is on a peaceful walkable road and is a quick walk from the trails and beach at Jarrell Cove State Park. The house was comfortable and immaculate and the well stocked kitchen was a huge plus. Lori was great to communicate with and even left chocolates she made."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was just what we wanted to get away from it all. Very quiet and serene. We felt very comfortable here. There were plenty of supplies in the kitchen; no shortage of coffee and tea. The ""Happy Anniversary"" chocolate was a very nice touch! Walking distance to Jarrel Cove State Park."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was such a thoughtful and great host. The house is immaculate; Definitely the cleanest Airbnb I‚Äôve been in. She has everything you need and was very thoughtful of her guests. The house is on a very peaceful and pristine piece of property. I would love to stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Top of the class in kindness and communication. Lori was quick to respond to questions and her eye for detail and added touches made my stay a top 5 all time best. Location is tucked away back in the woods and private. Fully tooled kitchen for a cook of any season and a tea collection that would make the most traveled steeper blush with envy.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time my girlfriend and I have stayed here and it was as lovely as we remembered it! We really appreciate the stocked fridge and pantry. The space feels very homey and comfortable and the chicken/bird decor everywhere makes it feel friendly and lived in. The setting is private and tranquil and just minutes away from Jarrell Cove. We will be back again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very communicative host. The cabins lovely. Definitely helped recharged our batteries.. thank you for everything Lori.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay here in Shelton. Although further away from the cities, Lori provided some good local areas to eat and shop. Would recommend for a cozy stay anytime in the PNW"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful spot in a dreamy PNW forest location on a hidden little island in the midst of water & forests & mountains . . . if you're location for the consummate Pacific Northwest experience, this is one great way to do it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was beautiful, and the home was nice and cozy. The surroundings and animal life were fun to watch."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has a very cozy and homey vibe to it. Felt like being in my own house.
Definitely wish we could've stayed longer to fully enjoy the place (as well as the rest of the island). Until next time - thanks, Lori!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is a perfect getaway. Loaded with amenities and personal touches. Extremally clean and spacious. The property is very well cared for, including her pen of happy chickens. It was a grand treat to stay here! There are also some nice trails at the state parks on the island. We ventured to McMicken Island during low tide, what a wonderful adventure!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place was perfect for a weekend getaway! The house is very clean and inviting. I especially loved the fully stocked kitchen and the hammock on the back porch. The property is beautiful, quiet, and serene. It‚Äôs a great place to relax and unwind!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful is an understatement when looking to describe Lori‚Äôs home and surrounding area. Everything was clean, organized, free of any odors, free of bed bugs (we checked), and her home felt very cozy. Lori was very responsive and helpful when we asked any questions. Rules of the house were clear, concise and not over the top. She had anything you would need for a comfortable stay. Very transparent in the description.
Her place felt very safe, peaceful, quiet and the view is immaculate. Bed was nice and warm even during cold nights with the blankets she has. Bathroom was clean and the shower was great. 11/10 Definitely recommend staying here especially with the price she‚Äôs asking for. Will be eyeing this Air BnB again if I‚Äôm in Washington ever again! Thanks Lori! üòÅ"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a good time at Lori‚Äôs place! The place was clean and spacious, the kitchen was well-stocked and spotless, the house was at such a comfortable temperature. We also watched deer graze the property most mornings and evenings! Such a fun stay, would recommend, and would definitely stay there again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house was clean, affordable and comfortable. We had good access to the national and state parks around. Great place to stay in."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, off the beaten path with deer in the yard and a gorgeous forest landscape. Host was thoughtful and communicated well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place was so beautiful, peaceful, and accommodating! The home has an inviting feel as soon as you walk in. Her place has everything you could need, and she is very thoughtful. I enjoyed that she left chicken treats out to feed the chickens on the property. Lori even welcomed my stay with a ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù chocolate! I highly recommend her place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Love love love!!! My husband and I live in Brooklyn, NY and we always wanted to visit the beautiful state of Washington and to get out of the city a bit. After a lot of research, we fell in love with Lori‚Äôs home. So peaceful, beautiful, and breathtaking. She went above and beyond providing us with everything we needed, it literally felt like it was our home! Her home is extremely clean as well. She also has the most adorable chickens we can engage with and feed! They‚Äôre so lovely and have such personalities. We will always come to Lori‚Äôs whenever we go out to Washington. An unforgettable and phenomenal experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a weekend away in nature, look no further! My husband and I have spent a long weekend in March here every year since 2021 and we look forward to returning next year! The chickens, trails and tranquility are wonderful. Lori is exceptional as a host and is incredibly helpful. I would recommend this stay to anyone looking to escape the city for a few days."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great places to enjoy the outdoors and to get away from busy city life. I had an amazing time there, and I would definitely love to visit again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful spacious place that allowed us to enjoy the beauty and peacefulness of the surrounding forest and nearby beaches. The space has many thoughtful touches and is kept very clean and tidy. There is lots of light coming in from the big windows. The kitchen and bathroom are generously stocked. We loved how we were able to make our meals with all the supplies and equipment we could want. The WiFi was great for basic needs and allowed us to stream our favorite shows on the provided TVs. We came during a cold snap and Lori made sure we had access to extra space heaters to supplement the propane furnace and the electric fireplace. It was also fun to visit and feed the chickens on the property. We enjoyed being able to walk the short distance to Jarrell Cove State Park to see the water and walk the trails. Another day we visited Harstine Island State Park, a little under two miles away, and walked one of the many trails down to the beach. We hope to return."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, charming getaway! My husband and I loved our stay at the Island Chalet. The place is so cozy, well-equipped and had so many thoughtful touches. It was a very peaceful location on Harstine Island, and there are several lovely state parks and natural scenic areas to explore. Definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place was spacious, cozy, and overall very comfortable with lots of natural light and cozy nooks. The house is stocked with everything you might need, from travel books, to flip flops, to cooking utensils. Lori was very friendly and responsive."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has been one of our favorite airbnbs ever. It really felt like getting to experience a little bit of Lori's life in her house. There are a few things I have to say.
- The kitchen was better equipped than my own back home. It had every utensil imaginable, spices, teas, coffee, appliances. Pretty much every thing I could have imagined using, was available.
- The space was big, but super cozy. There was lots of light coming in through the big windows. The house is surrounded by the forest and it feels super calm and relaxing.
- I had missed this when we book this place, but there are chicken in the premises of the property. They are super friendly and Lori leaves treats for you to give them.
- The decoration was fantastic. It is bird themed. My wife and I were thrilled to keep finding them like easter eggs.
- The internet was fast and reliable. No problem with 2 people zooming at the same time.
- Lori is a great host, super proactive and helpful.
100% recommended!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was amazing. Super clean, and cozy. The vibe was relaxing and peaceful. Definitely coming back"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can honestly say this was the best airbnb i‚Äôve ever stayed in! Everything was so comfortable, clean cozy with a cool modern-farm-chic vibe. I loved the spaciousness of the main room and general layout of the space. The bed was so comfy (with heated mattress pad!) Being out there near the woods, I felt more connected to myself and nature than I have in a while. Wish I had stayed longer!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect if you want to stay out in the woods. Lori provided us with a clean and safe stay. We were able to communicate quickly when something came up. I definitely recommend this place as she even left some snacks for us. Thank you Lori for this amazing stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and serine. A perfect cabin in the woods get away"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The listing is very accurate accessible via a gravel road. It is a beautiful spot and a perfect location on Harstine.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome place, nice and private. Lori was great, super quick responses and had everything ready for us when we arrived.
The cleanliness was top notch.
You can tell this place is cared for and that your comfort is thoughtfully prepared for. If we ever get the chance to come back to Washington we will definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a wonderful experience. I enjoyed the cleanliness of everything, the warmth, the quiet, and so many considerate extras to make my stay perfect. Deer in the front yard every morning and evening, privacy all round, and everything I needed to cook, and relax inside or out. Wonderful!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the only place I try to regularly get away to. It‚Äôs far enough away from the city to feel disconnected, but close enough to easily take advantage of its general proximity to so many places to explore. Lori has provided all the amenities we need, and the best addition to the place was the new hammock, where we laid at night when it was clear and watched the stars. As always‚Ä¶ we will be back! :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is a super host as she was very responsive and accommodating. An absolute haven, the perfect spot for a pieceful getaway. Everything was immaculate when we arrived ang instructions to get there were clear. The house was exactly as photographed architecturally stunning, well thought out layout and well stocked kitchen, equipped with all you need. The best Airbnb experience I've ever had, we would love to go back again! I highly recommend this place!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay if you're in the area! It's super quiet, private, clean and, well, just perfect for us! While Lori's place has wifi, be aware that the entire area has sparse cellular service so map your way while you still have service. Think of it as a way to disconnect and enjoy the surroundings! It's a gorgeous area üòç There's not tons of places to get food so we recommend you bring your own by stopping in Olympia. Not a problem for us at all! (We're not super familiar with the area so there may be more we weren't aware of at the time). We did end up having breakfast at the Spencer Lake Bar & Grill, which was surprisingly not too shabby. If you're in a pinch, there's a tiny grocery store across the street from that bar. We had everything else we needed!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Very private and peaceful stay for our 29th anniversary. Lori always responded right away with any questions. I'm not sure why anyone would complain about too many rules. We had no problem with them or following them. If it was my Airbnb I'd probably have the same rules, so keep up with what you are doing, Lori great job! We will definitely be back again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. It was refreshing to be able to show up after a long day of travel and have such a nice place to retreat to. We have not used AirBNB before so this was a perfect first for us.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, peaceful, immaculate home. Everything is thought of and provided. It is in a great location to just enjoy, or be a home base to explore the island. Loved the chickens :) Can't wait to come back!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the cutest house in such a great location. The woods are surrounding the house creating a very private escape. We drove off island to see some other things we had planned but there is also so much to see on the island. We will definitely be returning. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable, clean place with all the comforts of home. There was not anything we needed or wanted that we didn‚Äôt have. I love the secluded area and the quietness of the day and night there. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is a little slice of paradise. If you're looking for a peaceful and lush setting, this your place. The house is so cozy, comfortable and super clean. Attention to detail and all the comforts of home. We can't wait to return."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lori's place is fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to stay here again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is the perfect house to stay in. The kitchen is equipped with everything one could need for any kind of cooking. The house is beautiful, private, and perfect for relaxation. Lori was super easy to communicate with, and Harstine is lovely. We will return for another stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place definitely has amazing, thoughtful amenities. The kitchen is stocked with spices, lovely snacks and the host provides eggs from her chickens. The place is well taken care of. The only downfall I encountered is the amount of rules and regulations. I know that's how she keeps her place so nice and I understand that but some of the regulations are a little too much. She doesn't like foods that smell being cooked there like fish or garlic. There's not any good restaurants in the area and I like eating fish and seafood when I come to Washington (I'm from the desert). I was unable to eat fresh seafood during this trip and I found that disappointing."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place. Very quiet and a great place to get away, yet still not so far from stores or restaurants if needed. The house is very nice and there's plenty of room in the kitchen for cooking."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had another wonderful stay at this awesome place in the woods. Truly a luxury destination. Kitchen has everything you need to whip up most any meal. Walk in the woods or nest on the couch with the electric fire and streaming services. The chickens are a hoot! Definitely going to go again first chance we get.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best stay ever!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a dream come true for a weekend getaway. A beautiful space with so many amenities, and a very communicative host. Quiet and solitude were acheived, it is a very cool location to experience. She also has chickens which was a plus! 10/10"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loved so much about my stay. Cozy, quiet, comfortable, great extras. Wish I would have know. that I would not have phone signal as I am trying to finalize a new job and a move, but was able to work everything out using the landline. Was still able to use my phone to text and of course connect to wifi."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori‚Äôs place is very cute and comfortable! It was perfect for a vacation with my partner!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderfully pristine and cozy place to stay. Super quiet and in a beautiful setting. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin. Seriously, you will regret NOT staying here. It is so private, tranquil and perfect for a getaway from the hustle and bustle. Lori is a wonderful host! She was quick to respond and even came over from her chocolate workshop (by the way, she makes AMAZING chocolates) to help out with a minor issue within 5 minutes of us realizing the problem. Her home is incredibly clean and well stocked if you enjoy making leisurely vacation brunches like I do. The chickens are adorable and will steal your heart! I only wish we could stay longer and recommend this property and host to pretty much anyone."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a truly wounderful place that is great to get away. beautiful and mystical.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great stay! Lori‚Äôs house was thoughtfully put together. 10/10 would recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful, cozy and comfortable. I loved the fully stocked kitchen as well as watching the deer out on the grass. A perfect place for a quiet and relaxing weekend."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is comfortable, welcoming, in a beautiful quiet spot, and Lori made me feel at home in so many ways."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place! So peaceful it was a great place to get away from the city for the weekend will definitely come back
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the space Lori provides is impeccable. She has carefully arranged everything so that her guests have a seamless, lovely stay. The location is really delightful, being just a short walk to Jarrell's Cove State Park and surrounded by forest."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute!! Wildlife and chickens to hangnout with in a beautiful setting. Cozy place to stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle for the first time and didn‚Äôt mind driving long distances. We found Lori‚Äôs home and it was love at first sight. The house is so welcoming, warm and cozy. The view from the porch is unreal and looking up at the stars at night really adds on to the experience. We would definitely recommend Lorins house to anybody visiting the area and wants to enjoy a peaceful stay."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great location for a quiet getaway in the woods. Beautiful home and beautiful area.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place is perfect. Beautiful space, lovely grounds and very well equipped kitchen and house!
We plan on coming back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I adore this place! The amenities are wonderful, the house is cozy, you can take a beautiful walk right from the front door. I imagine anyone would love a stay here!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was a great host. Answered all of our questions within minutes. Was able to have a private getaway and not have to interact with the host in person through the entire process (great for an introvert), although I'm positive she would have came by had we wanted."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to get away to for some rest and reprieve! The house felt as welcoming as my own home from the start. It was clean, cozy, exceptionally well appointed and had thoughtful details throughout. The property felt entirely private, and there was very close and easy access to park trails for gorgeous afternoon walks. :) The chickens were very sociable, and I had a chance to meet Lori as she was dropping a bag of holiday goodies by, who was warm and nice to chat with as well. - I guess I could sum it up best by saying I booked another stay while I was still there!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful, inviting, and very comfortable to be in, and Lori was an excellent host and very accommodating. The kitchen is very well furnished, and the house was clean and well kept. We had a wonderful and restful weekend stay here, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get away for a nice quiet stay out of the city!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To say a place is perfect seems like an exaggeration but in this instance it is not mere hyperbole. Lori has thought of everything. The bed was the most comfortable in any rental or hotel we have ever stayed in and includes a heated mattress pad. The kitchen is so well appointed that I wished I had planned more complicated meals to utilize all of the dishes and cookware. I collect glassware and often bring my own cocktail and shot glasses to a rental but no need here as she has a glass for every occasion. It is so peaceful and quiet on the island and so cozy in the rental with a fireplace and hours of entertainment on the smart TV. I highly recommend the nearby Wild Felid advocacy center were you can book a tour to see tigers, snow leopards and other large cats while supporting an awesome nonprofit. The pictures don't due justice to this perfect rental."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's home is wondeful and so clean. I loved that it felt like home and not just a generic house in the woods. Lori was quick to respond with any questions. I can't wait to go back
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori has a beautiful, private and comfortable home on a spacious and quiet lot. We very much enjoyed our stay and felt relaxed and at home."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything is amazing and gorgeous location. Lori is so kind and accommodating. You can‚Äôt beat the price. Will be coming back for sure.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lori‚Äôs chalet was beautiful! Everything was very clean and well maintained. The house was easy to find but very private. We had a wonderful week at the Chalet.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful location way out on an island near Shelton. With it being on a gravel road, you are guaranteed privacy. This place has a beautiful layout and everything works great."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is a gracious host, responds quickly, and is very helpful. She left us some (very, very good) cheesecake slices! Feeding the chickens was fun and the nearby parks were beautiful. I highly recommend Lori's place. She's kind and a great host!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and perfect for a solo trip. It is a little difficult to find the location at night but other than that 10/10 recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was very relaxing and quiet. The yard is great for hanging out in, also a pretty good tv to stay in and watch. When we arrived to the cabin we noticed there were a lot of rules everywhere, it made us a little nervous, we started looking for them like Easter eggs- some were also very funny like one inside a jar of decoration pasta in the kitchen reading ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat!‚Äù ü§£ but after meeting Lori she was very very nice and chill and the rules didn‚Äôt seem so bad! They all really are there to keep her cleaning fee down I‚Äôm sure. It was affordable and a really nice spot on a cool tiny Steven King kind of small town wooded island. She makes chocolate and they‚Äôre super yummy and also has chickens that are really friendly. This place was also STOCKED with amenities. The upstairs was strictly prohibited, and one of the two bedrooms were locked, but we had a lot of space and enjoyed the back patio a lot and ate dinner on the front patio table. Worth it! Would go again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a beautiful anniversary weekend here. The home was very nice - it had everything you needed. It was right in the woods so there were lots of paths and walks,. The history of the area was so interesting - we drove around the island and Lori provided some great books. We will definitely be coming back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, secluded spot with an ornate bird motif and super friendly chickens to visit a short walk from the front door :) The place was fully stocked in the kitchen, bathroom & bedroom. You may not have cell service, but there is wifi so I used Whatsapp for phone calls. Would love to come back, thanks!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Lori‚Äôs Airbnb was wonderful. The place is somehow even bigger and better than in the pictures. If you‚Äôre looking for a calm, relaxing, comfortable stay, then look no further. Lori was easy to get ahold of, and paid close attention to small details that really made a difference: complimentary snacks, stocked fridge with special coffee creamers, comfortable blankets throughout the house, and clear directions on appliance use. A much needed relaxing weekend getaway‚Äîthanks again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place. Clean, comfortable, and quiet.
Funny to hear the chickens happy sounds when they were getting cared for.
Plus we got a very clear sky one night.
Really enjoyed sitting out and seeing all those stars! Beautiful!
Highly recommended for a quiet stay in nature.
Lori is indeed a Superhost.
Looking forward to when we can stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our stay on Hartstine Island. It is such a peaceful location and the cabin has everything we could possibly need. This home is a beautiful and well kept place. And the grounds are meticulous, tucked away in the woods. If you are needing a place to escape and unwind, this is it. I highly recommend this to anyone needing an escape to recalibrate. We will certainly be back when we are visiting Hartstine for an extended stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean easy to find quiet and relaxing
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wbile the rules seem overwhelming at first, they actually aren't asking too much and once you see the place, you understand. It is a bit secluded, but we appreciated that fact. We stayed in 3 Airbnbs and this was by far our favorite. Probably lucky it was our last stop or the others would have had much lower reviews!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was very clean, cozy, beautiful, had anything you might need to cook with and was in a quiet area. The bed was comfortable, TV worked properly and the water was warm. The host is very descriptive about the many rules and it is a lot to remember. We found ourselves more concerned with following the rules than enjoying our vacation. If you are not a rule follower I would not recommend this spot. If you are though, it could be perfect for you. It is very secluded and not too close to a lot of stuff, which can be a plus or minus depending on the type of traveler you are or the type of vacation you are wanting. We were a bit disappointed when finding out you had to contact the host to get a key during certain hours to use the washer and dryer. The upstairs was off limits and one of the two bedrooms was locked. We did not need those areas, so I am assuming they were closed off to reduce cleaning after our stay. I will say without exposing personal details about the host, that the host was under the weather so this might not have been a normal thing. If you can get past the strictness of the stay, it is lovely. The host was friendly in our conversations and made the cabin feel like a home. Overall it is one of the nicest Airbnb‚Äôs we have stayed in."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was a perfect out of the way cabin with all the amenities in the beautiful forests of Washington. It was clear that a lot of attention was put into setting up this spot for their guests as everything was clean and clearly explained in the house manual. Would highly recommend this location to others coming to the area.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is just lovely! The home is immaculate and she provides
some lovely breakfast staples to enjoy. The one thing that would
be good to know is there is no cell service, so be sure and get all
the info you need before looking for her home and also getting
into the house. Due to being without cell service for a few days
prior this was a challenge for us. I would highly recommend staying at Lori's."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this place. Absolutely beautiful inside and out. Lots of room to spread out and a quiet location. It's a luxury cabin in the woods.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Chalet is beautiful‚Ä¶perfectly tucked away in the woods. Lori‚Äôs place is the cleanest Airbnb I‚Äôve rented to date.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin makes an amazing and peaceful getaway surrounded by forest and far away from the hustle and bustle of normal life. The house was immaculately cleaned and organized, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything you need to prepare and serve excellent meals. A great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is perfection. If you're looking to be in a secluded, beautiful forest, with a cozy house and all the amenities you can imagine, book now! Her house is clean and cozy and perfect as a base camp for adventures in the OP or as a place to arrive and not leave for 3 days. I appreciated the blue book with all the expectations and explanations of how to use all the items in the house and to keep it nice for the next guest as well. :) Thanks LORI! we'll be back, for SURE."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time in Lori's home! The home is very comfortable and is situated on a beautiful lot with plenty of space to explore and enjoy a peaceful trip. The chickens are an absolute delight - we enjoyed interacting very much. My only criticism is if anything there was lots of rules which made us nervous to settle into the home. But hey that could be my people pleasing paranoia. That said I slept better than I have for months so I would highly recommend this beautiful home!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was easily one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in. It was perfect for me. The location is beautiful. The kitchen was amazing. I highly, highly recommend it!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean and very comfortable. The location was wonderful, not terribly far from Olympic, and Harstine Island is beautiful! Plus there are chickens! We stayed for 2 nights and would definitely stay again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy beautiful house. Secluded but not too far from local groceries and restaurants. Big Bubbas Burgers is a really good. About 1hr 45mins to Olympic National park. 2+hrs to Mt. Rainer. Neither drive feels anywhere near those times with such little traffic and beautiful views along the way. Would definitely book again in the future.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my wife and I had such an amazing trip and a wonderful stay at Lori's place. it was very clean and no details went unnoticed. the kitchen had any cookware we could think of. it was quiet and private with stylish furnishings. we can't say enough good things about this place and would love to stay here again. thank you Lori üòä
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place is stunning. I came in spring and the songs of the birds were amazing. Loved making friends with the hens, and reading my book on the deck. The kitchen has everything to cook full meals and keep leftovers. A short walk to the cove & state park which is beautiful. The shower is spacious and good water pressure. Amazing value!! One of my favorite Air Bnb‚Äôs. Thanks Lori"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful! Everything we needed to get away and relax. Lori has done such a great job at making this a ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù for guests to enjoy! At first one may be put off by the idea of the house rules and manual, but we didn‚Äôt feel restricted at all. It‚Äôs basically just treating the house as if it were your own so it can be enjoyed for years to come. We loved going out in the mornings to feed the chickens, and catching a glimpse of deer walking through the yard. We would definitely recommend this place and we hope to be back again in the future!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this Airbnb. Lori‚Äôs place was nice and wonderful to stay in. Also got a chance to see a deer up close. Definitely coming back soon.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely a five star stay. Lori‚Äôs home is peaceful, clean, and well-stocked beyond belief. Everything you could possibly need is there to stay for a vacation. There are also desks and wifi, so you could easily work remotely if you just need a change of scenery.
Lori is quick to respond via text or phone, though the instruction book provided answered pretty much any questions I had. A huge plus are the chickens on the property! They‚Äôre so sweet and talkative (but not so loud that you can hear them from the house).
Would love to stay here again sometime soon :)"
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Lori‚Äôs place! It‚Äôs pretty far out (almost 30 mins go nearest grocery store and no cell service) but perfect place to disconnect and enjoy nature. She‚Äôs also well equipped for WFH with 2 desks and pretty good wifi, which we appreciated. Bed was super comfortable!! We also loved the chickens next door and being so close to beaches and trails."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful nature and home, really enjoyed our stay"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Housewas very clean and tidy and location is secluded, perfect for a relaxing weekend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place was the perfect getaway for a long weekend. The kitchen is large and well stocked for cooking your own meals. The house is comfortable with lots of nice touches and decor. Two state parks on the island, one within walking distance and another just a short drive away. Some on here have mentioned the many rules but I did not find them onerous at all...treat the space as you would your own home and you will be fine. I would highly recommend Lori's place for anyone wanting a few days in the woods!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to have calm and peaceful time out of the busy city lifestyle.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time on the island, walking to both state parks despite the occasional rain!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Cozy and peaceful. Would stay again.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and relaxing environment in a beautiful home.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely retreat! Lori's home is immaculate and plush. The kitchen is FULLY equipped. Seriously -- there is nothing you won't be able to cook there. The bed and furnishings are very comfortable. The surrounding nature is unspoiled and beautiful. It was so nice to be able to walk to Jarrell Cove State Park. Lori was helpful and quick to respond to questions.
Be aware that the house has a lot of written instructions inside (dos, don'ts and other particularities taped up here and there in addition to the several pages to read upon arriving), which made us a bit anxious. However, it was still relaxing and we would be happy to stay here again someday."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin with lots of privacy. A bit further out than what I was expecting but a beautiful setting.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came up for a romantic weekend and this was the perfect place for it! The place was clean and organized. The kitchen was well-stocked and the whole cabin was cozy and comfortable. It snowed the weekend we were there and Lori was great with responding quickly to messages and gave some great tips on getting to the cabin. Thank you so much Lori!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely space! Everything was sparkling clean, nice natural light throughout the house and comfortable furniture. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more! My boyfriend and I both love to cook and the kitchen had everything we needed and more. You won‚Äôt regret staying here!!"
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loris place was even better than the description, my only complaints are with the cleaning/property use policies which are likely to result in extra charges (more on that later)
The house was sparkling clean and had all of the modern amenities that one would expect from a place in the city, which was a very pleasant surprise given how remote it was. There were multiple TVs with streaming video, a fully furnished and functional kitchen, very comfortable beds and couches..when inside the house you had no idea that you were actually out in the woods.
The property was also very nice - fire pit just a few dozen feet from the house in the middle of a nice big lawn, a stream and little wooded area right behind the house..it felt remote yet very safe and comfortable.
My only complaints are regarding the cleaning / house policies - they are in my opinion restrictive and I haven‚Äôt encountered anything like them in my years of staying at Airbnb‚Äôs (my wife usually does the booking hence why this is my first review). These policies made me nervous during my stay since I didn‚Äôt want to rack up extra charges. Despite being very careful, I was still billed for extra cleaning charges due to what (in my and my wife‚Äôs opinion) was normal wear and tear. I think that if you don‚Äôt leave the place exactly as you found it, you‚Äôre going to get extra cleaning charges.
For example, it rained my entire time there so if you walk around outside your shoes naturally get muddy. The huge lawn by the house gets very swampy. I was very careful about not tracking mud inside the house, which wasn‚Äôt easy given there‚Äôs no covered porch or anything on the deck where you can easily take off your shoes, but I still made it happen. I left a few muddy foot prints on the deck and a little mud on the door (taking off your muddy shoes outside in the rain is very awkward) but none on the carpet or anywhere else inside - Lori tried to charge me a cleaning fee for this. I also apparently trampled some grass by the fire pit trying to start a fire in the rain - she also tried to charge me for this as well. Again, the lawn turns into a swamp when it rains so if you walk on it enough the grass is going to get trampled. In her defense, she didn‚Äôt follow through with the charges when I explained that it was raining and I felt this was normal wear and tear, but I was still very surprised.
Other cleaning policy/property use complaints:
* No sleeping on the couch
* Don‚Äôt cook anything with strong odors (not sure what constitutes a strong odor?)
* Only eat at dining room table or kitchen island
* Keep place neat and tidy during your stay and it should look the same when you leave as when you got there
I understand that Lori has probably had some bad experiences in the past with people damaging her place, but I feel like the policies go too far and it feels like the guests take on the burden of keeping the place clean rather than the host. I feel like most normal use of the property and house will result in additional cleaning charges.
If you don‚Äôt mind the cleaning / property use policies then I think Loris place is fantastic and a great place to stay."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for peace and quiet, Lori‚Äôs place is the perfect choice. It‚Äôs so silent and calm that you can hear yourself thinking. It‚Äôs very clean and cozy. It has everything you need and even some breakfast food. There‚Äôs a park nearby that you can walk to, and it‚Äôs a beautiful and peaceful walk. It exceeded my expectations completely. Highly recommend this place. And Lori is so helpful with anything you might need."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely house on a peaceful piece of land!! Kitchen was fully stocked and has everything you might ever need in terms of gadgets.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's home was beautiful - the giant southwest-facing windows were incredible, and the furnishings and amenities were everything I could have hoped for and more! I loved the location. It's a super short walk to Jarrell State Park, and I was able to go on a run to Harstine Island State Park a bit further away. If you're ambitious, you can try to bike around the whole island. The island's parks felt just as quiet and cozy as the home, and I have never felt so rejuvenated ever! Would highly recommend!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing time at Lori‚Äôs place. She‚Äôs very sweet, the place has a lovely touch and it‚Äôs incredibly cozy! It was the perfect gateway!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with amazingly quiet get away. Great location being walkable distance to a state park and potential swimming spots. Surely recommended
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time this year staying a Lori‚Äôs place! It is a great spot to get away from it all. All the best for 2021 Lori, hope to stay again soon üôÇ"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,I had a wonderful stay. The space was very comfortable and the location just beautiful. Worked remotely and had no problems with the Wi-Fi. Highly recommend.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was everything I could ask for. I have sensory processing issues with light and sound - the cabin is situated on a private, quiet chunk of land surrounded by trees and a sweet little clearing to watch the sunset. I felt my nervous system settle after just the first night. The kitchen is dreamy, stocked with every tool I could possibly need, plus some pantry staples like oil and spices that were super helpful for cooking delicious meals. There‚Äôs a HEATED mattress pad for the coziest possible sleep, and the living spaces feel warm and inviting. The house was also super convenient to get to the rainshadow of the Olympics, just about an hour away from a bunch of gorgeous hikes. Plus, Lori helped me make friends with the chickens. I had a wonderful time and hope to come back again next year!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! My husband and I needed a little weekend getaway-we do not work from home and have been feeling the stresses of working with the public during this wild year. My only complaint is that I didn‚Äôt take enough time off work to stay longer! It was so quiet and secluded which was our goal. You could see the stars at night and hear owls as you fell asleep. We had a lot of fun feeding the chickens and relaxing in front of the fireplace. The bed was super cozy too! It was also very clean which was another concern of mine during this time. Definitely recommend and we will definitely be back!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in, very cozy, and cute! Would come again!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lori‚Äôs chalet is a hidden gem. When you see this place in person you will be in awe of how beautiful, serene, cozy and absolutely gorgeous it is. The details and design she put into this chalet helps you to feel right at home. She provided everything you need to ensure you‚Äôre stay is definitely one to remember. And it‚Äôs surrounded in nature‚Äôs forestry, deer are always walking around the yard. It‚Äôs a quiet little getaway.. A must see."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Amazing secluded house with everything you need. Quiet, private, and well situated around Olympic Ntl Park, Mt Rainier, and other parks. Stayed for 5 weeks and Lori was a great host. Internet was fast enough for remote working, kitchen fully stocked, and the house was very clean."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was absolutely fantastic very friendly and the place was very well kept loved every min of the stay
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Usually it takes me a few days to acclimate to a new place, but I relaxed into Lori's place within a couple hours. A collision several years ago gave me hypersensitivities to light and sound, and I think everything about my stay here rejuvenated my senses. The full sleep, the hospitality, the loveliness of nature all around, and the peace.
Lori is very thoughtful and has an excellent guest manual ready at check-in - a relief for my intermittent troubles with memory. There is good signage as well. She takes COVID-19 seriously - which is important to me - and I did not worry about whether or not it was safe after reading and seeing how she was incorporating pandemic-conscious health practices into her hosting.
I highly recommend this place for people who deeply need quiet and nature, but also need to have access to wifi and modern domestic amenities."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What you‚Äôll expect from staying at Lori‚Äôs house is a really comfy beautiful house with amenities like a fully furnished kitchen, complimentary food, a super comfy bed, and a clean living space. On top of that, you‚Äôre really tucked away so, if you‚Äôre looking for a getaway or just a place that‚Äôs in the middle of nature, this is your place."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place is very secluded and extremely well kept. Everything was very clean and well labeled so that everything was quick and easy to find/understand. Lori has clearly put a lot of thought into her place and it shows. Make sure to try 1 or 2 chocolates in the fridge! You won't regret it!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place was super clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the peace and quiet, had a fire in the fire pit, and gazed at the stars.
Lots of guidance on what to do / how to go about the space which is helpful - though kind of a shame to have to spell so much out on how to be a decent respectful human being!
We loved the whole space and enjoyed our time on the island. Schedule a visit to the wild felid advocacy center and see some wild cats - they were beautiful!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is perfect place to go for any get away. Its very private, quiet, with the comforts of home and then some. She provides everything you could possibly want or need. With care to make it an interesting stay."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and tranquil location.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I came out to Lori‚Äôs absolutely beautiful cabin while we‚Äôve been working from home so that we could get a change of scenery, and it was the perfect stay! Quiet, secluded, cozy, and totally welcoming. It was the perfect retreat for us to work at home-away-from-home and we would definitely come back next time we need an escape from the city."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place was a great long weekend getaway from the craziness that is going on in the world right now, feeding and loving the chickens was great stress relief! üòä
We really enjoyed the location and made the most of the 2 state parks on the island, one of which is walking distance from Lori‚Äôs place (Jarrell Cove). We also made the drive to Bainbridge Island, which is only 1.5hrs drive away.
Already planning our next trip to this island getaway!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot if you are looking for a quiet getaway. Lori's home is very quiet, private, and cozy. The time and care that she has put into making her home a welcoming space for visitors is apparent from the moment you walk in. We immediately felt at home. We LOVED the full gourmet kitchen and had everything we needed to make multiple meals during our stay. There are many outdoor activities nearby; the Jarrell Cove State Park is within walking distance. This was a wonderful spot for a relaxing weekend away!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay for a vacation! Have everything you need in the kitchen, very cozy. The island itself is beautiful and quiet. Lori is a great host, responds really fast and she is very thoughtful."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars. We stayed for a week and the house had absolutely everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Fully stocked kitchen, tons of amenities and free food/beverages, lot's of thoughtful touches. The best value of any airbnb I've stayed in."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean and quiet. Away from everything and everyone
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is nestled just off the beaten path - enough to feel surrounded by nature without being cut off from the world. The property is beautiful and peaceful, the bed comfortable and warm with heated pads on each side, and the kitchen space generous and well-stocked."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place was such a dream. It truly left my partner and I speechless. Grab this place is you have the opportunity!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is well-tended, clean, and lovely. There is a sweet little State Park within walking distance and you can see deer, hear the seals ( I think), and watch bats at night. Comfortable bed, awesome snacks, and great clarity on expectations. If you want to do any serious hiking, get a Northwest Forest Pass first. Most of the longer trails around require it."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was a great host, always responding quickly with all communication. The house was super clean and had thoughtful amenities. Would stay again!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place is very clean and very well appointed. The kitchen was large and very fun to cook in. Harstine island is adorable. It feels isolated but is also not too far from civilization. The perfect balance. Lori was kind and quick to communicate! Also, a deer came to trim the grass one night and that was neat. Will definitely be back!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is everything and more so beautiful and inviting! Def will be coming back.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect getaway if you‚Äôre looking for some place quiet to stay while you explore the wilderness of Washington.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I were visiting Harstine Island to scout out potential vacation property. Lucky for us to find Lori‚Äôs place. It was super clean, comfortable and the perfect location for us. She provided very clear instructions so there were no questions as well as coffee / snacks. Her place is very relaxing and in close proximity to two state parks. We would recommend it for couples or singles and hope to return."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect is the only way to describe Lori's cabin.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful home, very stylish and well-appointed. Peaceful setting, great place to relax and unwind. I would highly recommend!"

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice quiet place to get away. Lori is very generous and a great host with fully stocked kitchen and great amenities. Cleanest Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in! Thanks again.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, what a nice and private and quiet place to relax! Comfy bed too. It was much nicer than I thought it was going to be. Pictures were nice, but they did not do the place justice. Had a great stay and would recommend to anyone who likes cozy and getting away from the hustle and bustle of life! Thank you Lori for opening your home!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Lori is so thoughtful in detail.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful private setting in the woods, loved listening to the birds with my coffee in the mornings. The cabin is very clean and has all the amenities you‚Äôll need plus more! Wonderful kitchen to cook a nice dinner and a lovely spot to sit out on the deck and enjoy nature. Not far from a beautiful lake or drive into Olympia or Tacoma. Great location! We loved it! Lori was very polite and helpful with suggestions. Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. We appreciated detailed Instructions for our stay. Place was very clean and well stocked with kitchen and bathroom necessities. Would definitely recommend.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs home is quite beautiful. The kitchen being my favorite part which was well stocked. The home was clean and tidy. As for the area it is an amazing view during the day, at night it does get a bit iffy as there aren‚Äôt that many lights. But the house and the view in morning more than make up for it. Nearby is a park where one can take a walk through the woods (which we very much enjoyed:)."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Her house is in a beautiful location! We had a great time staying there for two nights. Hope to be back soon.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is just as relaxing and wonderful as the photos! My husband and I stayed here for our 18th anniversary get-away, and loved how quiet and peaceful the property is. We would definitely stay here again."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so awesome! I loved it wish I could have stayed longer, I was traveling for work and it was such a wonderful space to relax in during off hours!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I believe getting away to a quiet place to re-energize is so important, and I've tried several didn't places in Washington, all beautiful and relaxing, but not to the level of our stay at Lori's. Harstine Island is a small, private island that does not cater to tourists. There is limited signage on the island. They do not advertise. The only way to stay on the island is by staying at Lori's place or other rentals, if you can find them. Two places I'd recommend while on the Island: Olympic Bakery and Wild Felid Advocacy Center of Washington."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori‚Äôs place is a great hide-away when all you need is an island ;-) Cozy, well equipped and quiet in a fantastic location on Harstine Island. We were there in the spring but it feels like the perfect place to spend time year-round. We will definitely be back. Lori was very responsive and her well-stocked kitchen allowed us to prepare our own meals very easily."
2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, scenic, and very clean. We would love to stay again. Also pretty remote, so come prepared. We had a wonderful time and look forward to coming back."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a romantic retreat for two. We enjoyed the privacy of the grassy oasis in the middle of the woods. The assortment of bird d√©cor had my husband and I calling it The Bird House. We had an amazing time cooking together in the large kitchen. Everything was so clean and easy to keep up with! The bed was cozy, and the entrance to the back deck from the bedroom was awesome. Oh, and the chocolates! My husband couldn't stop eating them! We will definitely be back."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous and green. Amazing amenities and a beautiful cozy house. The only thing to consider is you may lose phone service. But, there is wifi and a phone to use there! Nevertheless a wonderful escape into the woods with the city close by. It felt like home."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is amazing! The location is extremely peaceful, and the home is cozy. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals, and the pantry extras were a welcome surprise. Lori is a great communicator, and was so sweet to have chocolates waiting for me at check in. I hope to visit again."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You'll be hard pressed to find somewhere so nice and comfortable. A wonderful place to stay and relax. A wonderful host.

Hope to return for subsequent race weekends."

Very quiet, the rooms are spacious, and everything was super clean. The kitchen was fully equipped. We loved the firepit outside and sitting outside on the porch.

The house was well stocked and clean, and very peaceful.
It is close to several recreational areas. We spent two days exploring the Olympic park, hiking, and enjoying incredible views, including waterfalls and Giant trees.

We really liked it here."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, well kept home with a deck overlooking a very lovely wooded back yard. In a very quiet neighbourhood where deer roam around freely. One of the deer took a nap in the back yard under a tree for a couple of hours. We were looking for somewhere peaceful and tranquil and we got what we were looking for! We enjoyed our last minute getaway very much!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're a repeat customer and we enjoyed our stay at the ""Vacation Retreat."" The house is well-stocked and clean, and there is plenty of space for parking in the driveway. We'll be back!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri was more than an outstanding host. The place was beautiful and we had a wonderful time. So peaceful and relaxing. We watched the deer walk through in the morning, in the front and back yard. It seemed to be part of their daily path and they didn't care when we walked outside.
They had everything we needed available to us. Everything was top notch and I recommend the location to anyone."

I cant wait to get a chance to stay here again ."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri is a great host. We had one question upon arrival and she was quick to answer it. The house is very well stocked and our stay was extremely easy and comfortable. The lack of air conditioning could become an issue if climate change keeps raising the temperatures in the summer. The directions to find the house were easy to follow. I recommend you read all of the information she sends you ahead of time so you understand the use of the lake, etc."

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is wonderful! So peaceful and comfortable! All the amenities you could ask for! The only thing (which wasn‚Äôt a big deal and I was prepared for) was the checkout list. If you are in a hurry to leave the morning of checkout. Get to the list beforehand, it‚Äôs a page long."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is top-notch clean and ready for a relaxing vacation. Every kitchen tool we could imagine was available in the kitchen, with labels for where to return stuff. The kitchen fit our small group as we each took part in cooking and cleaning.
The sofa and chairs were comfortable and encouraged deep relaxation. We loved the back porch and the sweet deer that stopped by each night. We even saw the fawn get a case of the ‚Äòzoomies‚Äô as it tried to get the mother to play.
The area is quiet and peaceful. We had coffee each morning on the porch, without hearing neighbors, road noise, or lake activities.
The house was close to a bunch of places to kayak. We got out each morning and enjoyed Lake Kokanee, Lake Cushman, and more. We missed seeing the skeleton in Benson Lake due to the wind.
I highly recommend this house as the ideal family vacation retreat!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing home will fill all your needs, plenty of space, clean and modern,

We worked remotely one day and appreciated the comfortable space with fast internet. Highly recommend!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was looking for a little getaway outside of the main city and this place was perfect. The city of Shelton is so beautiful and quaint. Sherri‚Äôs place in particular was immaculate. Communication was very quick and fluid, and Sherri was extremely helpful in finding things to do in the area. The place was huge and sparkling clean and the backyard porch was the perfect place to relax and play some board games with friends. I would highly recommend staying at Sherri‚Äôs place and if I‚Äôm ever in the area again I will definitely be back! Thank you again Sherri for the wonderful hospitality!"

We enjoyed having full access to the various lakeside locations near the house.
We hope to visit again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute house in a nice community. Very clean and spacious. Very well stocked kitchen! Good value for the money.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is a wonderful place! A few of my family members and I stayed here while we raced at Shelton Ridge. Because we were at the track most of the day, we didn't spend a lot of time at the house. However, had we spent more time at the house, we would have been able to enjoy the wonderful amenities even more! The house was very clean, and everything was as expected. Plenty of places to sleep, and a nice kitchen a living room to relax. Sherri had wonderful communication with us before and during our stay. Overall, a wonderful place and we would look to stay there again!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time kayaking and swimming in the lake, cooking meals to share in the lovely kitchen, and chatting by the fire.

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to get away!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had this beautiful getaway over 4th of July weekend and we were delighted during our whole stay. The house was just what we were looking for -the description was very accurate; very private, quiet, peaceful, surprisingly spacious, with all of the comforts you could possibly need. The kitchen, in particular, was a joy to cook in. There were plenty of activities for our kids to burn off some energy at the lake just a 5m walk away. We also enjoyed some hiking and were rewarded with beautiful views of Hood Canal. If you are looking for a break from the city hustle and bustle, the value is hard to beat. We're grateful for the memories!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a haven! We were in town for the daunting task of moving our parents, and needed an oasis. Sherri‚Äôs place was above and beyond! Spotlessly clean, beautifully furnished, a wonderful kitchen with plenty of space and amenities, and restful bedrooms! We ended up choosing one upstairs because it was just so cozy!
Deer came through the yard, and if we had more time we would have loved to enjoy the fire pit out back. We definitely want to return on a trip that we can enjoy more time at the house and lake!"

2020-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Sherri and Steve‚Äôs place was exactly what we needed for our large family! It was also extra special as my husbands family lived in lake limerick years ago. Beautiful house with amazing amenities and a very responsive host.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,It was a wonderful place for a large family. There was everything that we needed. And it was a very kid friendly place. My daughter and nephew enjoyed playing with the toys. Super clean! We would love to visit here again!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay, thank you!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely as advertised and we enjoyed our stay there. We did not have an opportunity to explore the lake as we were attending a conference all day Saturday and Sunday and arrived on Friday very late. We did have the opportunity to work on some music whole we were there without any distractions like we often have at home so that is a plus. Lot‚Äôs of space for amps and guitars. The lot is fairly private even though it is a lake community, the fireplace is very pretty, and the master bed is very comfortable.
Sherri is a very responsive host and checked with us to confirm our arrival time and that we had no issue getting in. She even turned the heat on in advance of our stay, so it was warm when we arrived.
We will stay here again if we are in the area."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful well kept home with all of the comforts you could imagine. A wonderful, quiet and comfortable place to stay for our family. You won't be disappointed!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,If you‚Äôve looked at this house don‚Äôt even consider it we need to keep this one a secret! LOL this house is amazing!!!! Every possible detail you could think of was caught up in this house. And it‚Äôs immaculate! and then there‚Äôs the bonus of getting to know and work with Sheri who is an absolute joy!
2019-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, it does get hot at night upstairs because of no air conditioning, but very nice home."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with all of the amenities. Absolutely clean with everything one would need. It‚Äôs as advertised with no disappointments.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. Very quiet and relaxing. Perfect getaway spot and was close to where we needed to be. We had the perfect number of beds to accommodate our family and the location was very nice!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house was well appointed and clean. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need. We stayed for the month of July and prepared our meals 96% of the time. We were there to hike. This location was central to Olympic National Forest, Mount Rainier and Mount Saint Helens. There is no air conditioning, but the shaded lot (with big beautiful pines) kept the house comfortable for our entire stay! Plenty of room and a great layout for a family or couple. Sherri is great at communicating and has a goal for you to have a great experience. The covered porch overlooking the natural backyard was one of my favorite places to sit!"
2019-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying at Sherri‚Äôs place. We were in town for a wedding and all of our family lives in this area. The house was very clean and Sherri was very quick with responding to messages if we had any questions.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely home in a lake community. Great for walking, swimming, and biking."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, nicely furnished, lovely wooded setting.
Recommended"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean, comfortable space as described."
2019-04-01,3,Group trip,"This is a very beautiful house, however very noisy neighbors. We were reported to the owner for having a party. No party just adult children (who were staying else where) came by to see where we were staying. After that call, it was very uncomfortable. Will not stay there again."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Sherri‚Äôs house has so much to offer and I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed my stay here! The house is immaculate and the kitchen was a dream to cook in!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly don‚Äôt even want to leave a review, because I‚Äôm afraid the secret will get out about how wonderful Sherri & Steve‚Äôs home is. I‚Äôm a clean freak and very particular about the places we stay when we‚Äôre on vacation, and this is the first place we‚Äôve stayed where it was my level of ‚Äúclean‚Äù (like I‚Äôm pretty sure that you could eat off the floor and not worry about germs clean). All the criteria we were looking for were met beyond my expectations. I cannot thank Sherri and Steve enough for keeping their home a pet free zone as I am severely allergic and this was the first time ever I didn‚Äôt get sick while on vacation! I feel as if I‚Äôve found my soul sister with her meticulous standards. Our kids (one a college sophomore and a kindergartener) were both able to find their spaces in the home and we all felt so comfortable. When you‚Äôre able to walk into a home that is not your own and still feel super comfortable, it‚Äôs the best feeling. We didn‚Äôt want to leave. Although for some people the house manual might seem intimidating but not for us, we greatly appreciated it. The attention to detail shows how much pride they have in their home and how nice they want it to stay for when others visit. When we were able to drag ourselves out of the house we checked out Oakland Bay and also went to Twanoh State Park to wander about. We saw a seal swimming (pretty cool) in the Sound close to shore and saw all the chum salmon (mostly carcasses but some were still wiggling their way about) that came up to spawn. It was great for our 6 year old to be able to learn about nature and the life cycle of salmon. This is a beautiful house in the forest where you can make a ton of memories and we can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay I would highly recommend it. Everything was thought of to make our stay amazing.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, highly recommend. Lovely hosts."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri's house is a lovely space. Everything was just as expected and we had a great stay. The rooms were big, the bathrooms clean, and it was really helpful to have the master on the main floor for my elderly parents to get around. Sherri was easy to communicate with and I would highly recommend staying here!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was incredible! Clean warm and had everything needed for a great stay! The home is beyond functional for families and the community offered amazing parks and nature! Sherri was wonderful! She communicated quickly and offered a personal touch to your stay! It felt like home away from home!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go back
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful house beautiful and huge in a peaceful neighborhood / country club. There is cheap golf nearby so bring your clubs. The house was very clean and Sherri runs a tight ship. Everything was labelled and prepared for our visit. Thanks so much and hope to stay here again!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and well stocked home with room for a lot of guests.

2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home. The photos don't do it justice.
2018-08-01,4,Group trip,"The lake home was very beautiful and clean. Location was excellent. Sherri was very responsive with timely replies to my texts. She also gave us lots of tips for things to do in the area.
A major complaint was not having access to the laundry facilities
in the house. There were handwritten notes stating Not to use. With 5 of us in the house going on daily hiking trips it's unreasonable to not allow laundry to be done especially when you've booked for a week. we chose to rent a home over a hotel for a reason.
The home was a bit stuffy and one bedroom didn't have a screen in the window, the large jetted tub wasn't working either.
Sherri was great and I would recommend this property for sure."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful here. The house was very well put together we had everything we needed. It was my family's first time in Shelton and they definitely enjoyed it to the fullest.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sherri is the first super host that I had and you can clearly see the difference. She‚Äôs very specific with the rules of the house and even if you have any questions about anything she‚Äôll answer in the next our for sure (sometimes less than an hour). She gave us great recommendation about places we could go or things we could do around the lake. If you go during summer time the house is a little warm but you can find the way to stay chill with the fans and by opening the windows at night. We would definitely like to go back during the winter. Thanks again for everything and all the patience!!
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you like a cozy place near a lake, this is the place to go. The house has everything you could ask for. There is not air conditioning but the house is under the trees and fans help keep the air moving. The hosts are prompt in responding to questions or concerns too."
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great family retreat. Plan to stay home and enjoy the house and lots of neighborhood walks.
Enjoy!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful secluded house in the outskirts of Shelton, 10-15min drive to town. We rented this house for a couples weekend with one other couple and it worked out perfectly. This is a beautiful, immaculate home and the owners expect the guests to treat it accordingly, which was no problem for us. Very spacious, lovely decor and spotlessly clean. We loved the outdoor fire pit! We also made use of the gorgeous kitchen, which had all the needed utensils and tools. There was great water pressure and temperature in the extra large shower with 2 shower heads. The mattress was on the firm side. Bring your own firestick, etc. if you want to watch Netflix."
2018-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"First things first. One of the super responsive host i have seen so far. Any question you ask within few minutes you will have the response with detailed answer. She even went out of her way to provide me tips to cover Olympics National Park and surrounding areas. The house is well made and kept with all required amenities. We were two families ( 4 adults and 3 boys) on a road trip to ONP area and we really enjoyed the time together in Sherry's place.
There are some things which may be considered for improvement. Firstly the front lawn was not clean and that gave me very bad impression while driving in. Secondly before couple of days of check out we received a long instruction document and checkout checklist. If these were given to us before the booking we would have scared to book. May be a smaller set of instructions to be displayed before booking for full transparency. Finally, the bath tub in master bathroom was not accessible due to some electrical issues, which we came to know only after checking in. Disclosure of that while booking would have avoided the surprise."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherri was quick to reply to any questions I had. Her expectations are clear and easy to follow and the home was beautiful. I will be staying here again on next year's trip for Olympus Rally 2019!
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherri's house worked very well for our needs: housing a group of family members. The house is comfortable and big! Communication with Sherri was always prompt and easy.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sherri's house is very comfortable and well equipped. The house is clean and expectations and explanations are documented clearly.
The pictures are accurate. Perfect place for our family to stay."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and clean home with plenty of amenities, including nearby private lake. Thanks Sherri!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A spacious, clean and modern home with 4 large bedrooms. 4 queens and a full that were comfortable. Kitchen was well stocked and they had an outdoor grill so steaks and burgers are easy. Great internet but no tv except vhs tapes and dvds. Cell service is very limited or no service so if you need to stay linked with your phone it isn't for you. Travelling 1 or 2 miles and I had service. Clean, safe , upscale neighborhood/ lake community. I was happy!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a quiet lake community. Equipped with everything needed for a relaxing vacation.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay in this spacious home and the kids especially had fun with the toys and games provided!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is just as you see in the pictures. We didn't use any of the outdoor fun (fire pit, lake, etc) as we were mostly at my sisters house on Mason Lake. But the option was there to use all of the water activities at Lake Limerick. Everything available for a family (or even two families)! Great space. And two beautiful deer were seen in the yard almost every morning, a great way to start the day!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very recommended, Sherri made this an very smooth stay with my family, home was very clean and comfortable, it has everything you need, i recommend this home 1000 % if not more :) just because of how Sherri, made us feel like home."
2017-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice house. but amenities are limited.
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are a group that goes to Shelton for The Ridge Motorsports Park several times a year so we use a lot of Air BnB's for lodging in the area. This one is close to the track, great for 3 to 4 couples, has a well set up kitchen for cooking for the group, and Sherri was a great host to work with."
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is awesome. Such a quiet place and friendly neighborhood. If you want to have a quiet, peaceful or cozy place to stay, this is definitely a good choice."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Sherry's place made our family Thanksgiving one of the best ever. The neighborhood was quiet, and after dinner we went for a walk to the lake down the street. Such a beautiful place , very relaxing and peaceful. The house was absolutely gorgeous and plenty of room for our family of six."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sheri was wonderful to work with and the house was absolutely perfect. We came in for a bodybuilding competition and it couldn't have been more perfect. We each had our own room and the house was big enough to where we weren't waking the entire house up eating every 2 hours. Very comfortable and they had everything we needed and more!
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"For us it was a perfect find...good location with all the amenities we needed. Comfortable home near the lake. Great, problem-free stay."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is in brand new condition and is incredibly well appointed. This is a wonderful and private forest getaway and we love the lake as well.
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri's house was perfect for our trip to Shelton. After a long day at the track, the house provided us with a great place to unwind and relax. The surrounding is very quiet and the house has everything you could possibly need to make our stay stress free."
2016-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House was as described, the neighborhood was very quiet and the entire family enjoyed our stay."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful home-away-from-home for our team during our work retreat! Thank you!
2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic Airbnb! The cabin is beautiful, located in a great neighborhood away from the city. Great modern appliances to cook your favorite meal and plenty of space to host 3 - 4 couple for a fun weekend.
Very detailed instructions in how everything works and should be taken care of.
Sherri is lovely and very accommodating. Definitely look forward to coming back for a second visit."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous home. House is to an excellent standard. Very large rooms, high quality appliances.
Host is very good, very good communication prior to our arrival. Very detailed welcome pack."
2015-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Sherri for sharing your beautiful house. We had a great time, board games and kids toys were added bonus. Everyone had a great time. We certainly missed using the fire pit, but we understand the limitation due to burn ban.
Sherri was very prompt to our queries and provide good suggestions around the area.
We would love to return in future. Thanks again."
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing AirBNB home stay! We thoroughly enjoyed the amenities of the home and area (right on a country club and steps from lakeside swimming and boat launch-great for kids!!). Sherri was a wonderful host, checking in well before and during our stay, was easily accessible and responsive for questions by text and email.
The home itself is really a ""home away from home"" and has been obviously cared for very well and stocked full of beautiful furniture, linens as well as a gourmet kitchen, well equip for those who love to cook. The porch and backyard area are just beautiful and situated in a forest setting so that all the windows in the home look out into quiet natural beauty. It was very hot (unusual for this area) during our stay, and the fans in the main room and bedrooms helped, but there is no air conditioning (not unusual for this area). We much appreciated how this lovely home allowed us to have a comfortable and beautiful home base during our travels. We would love the chance to stay again in the near future!"
2015-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,Listing was accurate. Very comprehensive information available about how to manage in the home.
2015-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a wonderful home in a beautiful place. We spent most of our time around the backyard fire pit. Everything was exceptionally clean and well thought out. Any item you could possibly need seems to be tucked away in the first drawer where you would look for it. It felt like spending the night in a family members home while they were out of town.
2015-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house was outstanding. Anything you need in the kitchen and plenty of comfortable beds. Host was very welcoming in her emails and on the phone. This was a great experience and anyone looking for a weekend retreat or a home away from home Sheri is the right one to rent from!
2015-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sherri was very warm and welcoming. Her home is beautiful and surrounded by large trees that are famous in Washington. I would highly recommend staying and experiencing a tranquil location. We are already planning on future visits.
2015-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"Lovely home in a quiet, safe neighborhood with a dream kitchen. Reasonable rental fee for the size of the home, but because we picked up the cleaning fee, it became an expensive one night stay without the amenities of a hotel, ie:hot tub, coffee, breakfast, etc."
2014-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful home!! The pictures can't begin to describe how cozy this home is. Our family had a great time bonding and cooking here. There was a slight problem and Sherri was available to take care of it immediately. The wifi had a very strong signal, we streamed movies without any problems. I recommend having a skype or VOIP acct to make calls. Our ATT didn't get very good reception in all of Shelton. Facetime worked well for us. There is no TV reception which was nice to keep the family focused on each other but I admit I missed watching the news. Again, we all could check the internet easily. The kitchen was complete for our needs, we baked and prepared a lovely Christmas dinner with everything she had in her gourmet kitchen. We will stay here again if we need a place to stay in Washington. Aloha, Candy"
2014-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at this home. It's very cozy yet spacious enough for a family gathering with extra tables and chairs available. Absolutely beautiful surroundings! Very well furnished kitchen, etc. Sherri went the extra mile to provide us with a turkey and platter, roaster, lifters, gravy boat and festive Thanksgiving napkins! The fireplace was a big hit with everyone. Thank you for your hospitality with your lovely home!"
2014-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Sherri went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The house was very clean, spacious, and well stocked for our weekend get away. We especially enjoyed the kitchen, back porch, grill, and fire pit. The house is a short walk from a lake in a quiet wooded neighborhood. This would be a great place to take a small group for a retreat. We felt very at home here and would definitely rent this place again."
2014-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sherri was very welcoming at her home. She even helped us to remember the entry code to her lock box when we arrived! She made sure that things were in order during our stay & visited to introduce herself.
The home was very well appointed with all of the items that would be expected at a rental home. It was, in fact, larger than what we had expected with 4 bedrooms available. It was very clean and orderly when we arrived and that was much appreciated.
Overall, I would give high marks for a lovely home with a pleasant backyard."
2014-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful time and the house is absolutely beautiful. Everything we could have possibly needed was provided. Every time I had a question I texted Sherri and she responded very quickly. I highly recommend this amazing vacation rental!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location - on the lake.
The house is beautiful.
There is a new Thai restaurant (Tham Authentic Thai Cuisine) - excellent
Enjoy the house and your time in Shelton."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When we arrived the family immediately felt comfortable and loved the set up of the Lake house. The lake view wasn‚Äôt a disappointment it was beautiful!
This was the second time our family has rented this Lake House and we‚Äôre planning another stay October 2024:)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well equipped and nicely furnished Lake house. Everything we needed for cooking meals was found easily. The lake is beautiful! Very nice house and environment. Will book again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is on the lake, the morning view was amazing coming off the lake when I woke up."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,The only thing they need to be aware of is that the email and text message had different codes to get into the house. And also different places had different times to check out. But the house had everything you needed. It was very clean and comfortable. The beds were comfy too. Loved being right there in the water
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The view from this home was beautiful and it was perfectly suited to our needs. It is just like it looks in the picture. We had a lovely stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,great place to unwind and enjoy the view
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful lake house with everything you need to have a good time both inside and outside of the house. they have Foosball, table tennis, ample number of garden chairs, life jackets (kids and adults), campfire pit, firewood storage..I mean everything. we had such a good time in this beautiful and peaceful place, even Safeway was within 2 miles radius"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint little house on the lake. Beds were super comfortable. House was well-stocked with plenty of activities to keep us busy (kayak, SUP, cornhole), even on a dreary day (ping pong, foosball, big tv, board games & puzzles)! The kitchen was really well-stocked, and we appreciated the coffee bar. We appreciated the patio heater on a chilly evening. Really nice yard/landscaping. Good wifi & cell service too. Would recommend packing water shoes if you want to go into the lake, as the bottom is a little rocky on the feet. Great stay overall!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We‚Äôll stocked, comfortable home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This well-equipped house sits on a small lovely lake. We enjoyed the kayaks and SUPs as well as just sitting by the lake enjoying the quiet and eagles and osprey.
The kitchen was well stocked with basics, and great set of pots. We cooked diners on the grill and ate all our meals on the table on the back porch with views of the lake. Very peaceful and quiet."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,My family had a fantastic time and we all want to come back next summer. We love it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!!!!! This rental was perfect for us and Kelli was so nice to work with. It had everything we needed for our stay plus some. Most importantly it was a reasonable price and clean! This property offers the cozy home feeling with a relaxing and fun backyard. It‚Äôs right on the lake with lots to do. Highly recommend!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful house on the lake! Lots of fun boats, toys, and yard games. The perfect spot to keep the family busy."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"this was a great house! The house was better than photo. House was clean and nicely decorated. The yard was perfect for relaxing (me), fishing (my husband) and paddle boarding (young adults)
Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Kelli's piece was very comfortable. The quality of the furnishings was very nice. It is clear they wanted a very comfortable home. There was plenty to do from kayaking to Cornhole. Overall, it was a very pleasant location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fresh and comfortable. Well stocked kitchen - I loved the new sponge and empty fridge (no leftover junk). The beds were comfy. There were MANY outdoor options for hanging out and we used them all! It was close enough to run to the store easily but felt miles away. The fireworks at the lake were the cherry on the top.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked all of June to get the monthly rate and it was totally worth it. The place is great and honestly just felt like home from day one. The lake was great, there were more than enough kayaks and paddle boards and fun games the hosts have at the property. There‚Äôs an awesome walking trail nearby in the neighborhood with a full frisbee golf course at the end of the trail. The wind gets pretty bad some days directly at the house but I think it‚Äôs just part of being in that area. Grocery stores were close and it‚Äôs so close to exploring parts of Olympic national park. We even drove 1.5 hrs out to the beach a couple times. We definitely plan to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelli and Michael‚Äôs place is a great place for anyone looking to relax and chill. The lake is beautiful and the neighborhood is quite nice as well. A great gem!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is absolutely gorgeous, kelli and Michael had thought of everything, it has games and water sports, lots of chairs in the patio and wood to make a fire, our stay was absolutely perfect, the host were also super responsive and helpful. I highly recommend you stay in this lake house. I will be back again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property and lovely house! No better way to enjoy a hot weekend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful house with excellent owners. It was a pleasure to stay there.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Shelton is a very special place for my family and I, so to have this place to come while we celebrated the life of a family member was such a perfect fit for us.
It had the perfect mix of nostalgia and new comfort. There was always something to do and so much fun was had.
The scenery was picturesque and everything was so accessible.
We highly recommend and would absolutely come visit again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful house on a beautiful beach in a beautiful location. We would love to come visit this location again we had a great stay. Amazing hosts, what else can I say. I loved it!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Place was great, had tons of fun"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place with great views of the lake. We enjoyed it very much.
Property managers could improve communication. We received no response when inquiring about later check out and making fire in the fire pit."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,lovely home on the lake! Very well stocked with absolutely everything we needed. Super clean and cozy. The lake was wonderful for swimming!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is just perfect. The house is super clean. The A/C is amazing. The activities provided are awesome. Loved everything about it.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Wow! What can I say besides this was one of the best Airbnb homes we have ever stayed. We enjoyed ourselves with all of the fun activities they had available for us to use! We used the SUP boards, kayaks and played corn hole. The lake is gorgeous and so peaceful,! The kitchen and rooms were wells stocked and the attention to details in the decor were amazing! Thank you for the tray of goodies and the best weekend! We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you so much. We loved every minute of our stay in your beautiful home. Everything was absolutely perfect. The house was clean, everything worked perfect. The game room/ garage was pretty cool. The water toys (2 paddle boards and 4 kayaks) were perfect for a family of six since were all able to go on the lake at the same time. The owners are very easy to communicate with and were always available to answer any questions we had. Overall, we had a perfect stay in a well thought out house. We hope to visit again. Aloha"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Island Lake House was exactly as advertised. It was a perfect getaway in a very beautiful setting.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Island Lake house! The water was so beautiful and fun to swim in. Great opportunity for kayaking and other water fun in a super relaxed setting. The outdoor space was perfect and the house was really comfortable.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at the lake house for our sons race at the ridge racetrack. House is beautiful, well stocked, and comfortable! Location to the track was great as well."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing home! Truly felt like we were in our own home away from home. Super peaceful, and the sunset were stunning. You can not go wrong booking ."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful area on the side of the lake. House is clean and very well maintained.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the island lake house. It was a wonderful setting with beautiful views. The house is well equipped. It‚Äôs slightly inconvenient having two bathrooms for three families but the house is exactly as the pictures advertised.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"At the last minute, I needed to come to the Shelton area to help out with a family emergency. The Island Lakehouse was the only rental available on such short notice, and it was a bit bigger than I thought I needed, but I took it. I am SO glad I did! The house is adorable, very well appointed and immaculate; the view is magnificent; and the assistance provided by the owner was very helpful during my time of tremendous stress. Each day, when I returned to the house, I was so very grateful for a safe, relaxing, and comfortable haven. I highly recommend this property and will surely try to stay here on all future visits."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Island Lake House was a charmer! We arrived to a winter wonderland, with plenty of snow and eerily beautiful mist over the lake. In spite of our day-late arrival due to flight cancellations, we experienced impeccable response times and flexibility. Lights and heater were on and front door shoveled upon arrival. We felt especially welcomed with a few seasonal decorations, lights and a delicious welcome basket upon entering the home. The kitchen is extremely well appointed (we enjoyed smoothies and fresh ground drip coffee each morning), decor is on point, and bedrooms are very comfortably furnished and decorated. The fireplace added instant charm and warmth given the season and the central location to groceries and nearby family was ideal. The home is well updated and every detail seems to be accounted for. If it had been warmer we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to take advantage of the lake amenities (outdoor lakeside seating and kayaks). I would absolutely stay again when visiting family in the area. Thank you to our wonderful hosts!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place on the lake, very clean and neat home. Great layout spacious rooms with very comfortable beds and furniture. Kitchen equipped with quality cookware, BBQ on the patio first rate, pride of owner ship show‚Äôs. We are looking forward to staying again soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house is everything a lake house should be. We were welcomed with the perfect gift basket of goodies. The views from the back of the house are perfect and relaxing. We started every morning with coffee on the back patio, under the heat lamp, looking at the lake. We spent the days fishing (2 bass and a rainbow trout!), kayaking, running on the nearby trail, and relaxing in the sun. We sent the sun down each evening with a bonfire. Everything was clean and updated. Someone took great care in making this a sanctuary and it shows. we will be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really this is one of the best AirBnB I have ever stayed! It sits next to a perfect-sized lake which let you enjoy all the fun on the water while having the privacy. The owner apparently knows how to decorate a guest house to make it aesthetically appealing in and outside the house. I certainly would recommend it to anyone and we will definitely return.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This Lake House is amazing and exactly what the host had described. The sunrise and sunset are the wonderful time to be at the lakeside back yard. There are apple trees with delicious fruits. The house were fully equipped for what you need and tastefully decorated. There are 4 kayaks and 6 life vests in different sizes for your water sport enjoyment. Or just have a nice evening at the fire pit with a glass of wine to relax.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful house on a peaceful and serene lake. We were looking for a peaceful place for a family vacation and had a great time.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Jerry‚Äôs cabin was exactly as described. The cabin is beautiful and cozy! Everything you need for a home away from home vacation.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jerry was an excellent communicator and the photos really don't do his cabin justice. Secluded and down a gravel road, his cabin is absolutely wonderful. Clean, well-stocked and very cozy, we had a wonderful time staying there. Would love to come back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jerry was a wonderful host. He answered any questions quickly and provided great suggestions for the area. Note that this is Jerry's home, and while most personal items were in closed rooms, you can expect food in the fridge and cupboards."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Friendly. very nice place to wake up to. Awesome treats.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erin was an amazing host. The guest apartment was wonderful and very comfortable for our six night stay. The property was also incredibly lovely for our boys to run on the lawn and through the woods. We would love to come back sometime. A stay with Erin felt like a warm reunion with family.. Thanks for everything, especially the extra birthday surprise!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely, peaceful getaway! My family loved the outdoor space, especially the hot tub and fire pit. The host was so helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this little place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Erin and Bob's place as a getaway for spring break. Just as all others have stated, we highly recommend this place!! It was a wonderfully comfortable place for our family of four. Our kids didn't want to leave! We loved the ducks, deer visiting in the evenings, hot tub and tranquil setting. But more than anything, you'll love Erin's truly thoughtful touches - what a treat to get warm biscuits, homemade jam, cookies and a thoughtful note when leaving on top of a lovely stay. Erin is extremely easy to communicate with and responds quickly. We recommend 100%!! Thank you, Erin and Bob for sharing such a special place!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing weekend stay at Erin's. She is so responsive about messaging and once we arrived was also very friendly in person. She dropped off a basket of hot delicious biscuits and a jar of homemade jelly after we checked in. When I mentioned wanting to make lasagna, she provided us with a baking dish and then baked the lasagna in their oven upstairs (since there isn't one in the rental). She also gifted us some amazing caramel corn on our second day.
The rental itself is great. Soft pillows and plenty of blankets. The kitchenette area is in the main bedroom which is a little awkward, but it was very functional with an electric skillet, toaster oven, and microwave. There was plenty of tea, coffee, and instant apple cider.
The hot tub is an inflatable model, which is very comfortable for lounging in.
The woody area around the cottage was fun to explore. We walked down to the creek, fed the ducks, and enjoyed the two small swings as well as the porch swing. We'd love to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin and Bob were humble hosts to my sister and I. Our trip definitely was relaxing. OMG! the biscuits were like no other Erin.ü•∞ Thanks for allowing us to share your world view from your home. We both said "" Keep baking on!"". üß°
Briana and Sis üçä"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to stay. My baby girls and I had great getaway vacation. The property is stunning. My girls had a blast seeing the deer, ducks and of course playing on the swings. Erin‚Äôs cookies and biscuits were delicious and just made you feel even more at home. I enjoyed speaking with a fellow military man. Bob was very helpful with things to do around the area and restaurants to go to. Both were Amazing host, thank you üôÇ"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute a place to stay!! Erin‚Äôs biscuits were delicious and everything about our stay couldn‚Äôt have been better.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin and her husband where wonderful hosts from checking to make sure everything was good to bringing me yummy homemade biscuits and jam. Everything was as pictured and very neat and clean. Wonderful commuicators and very speedy reposnes. I enjoyed my stay very much. I live across the country in NC and was there for a work trip so not sure I'll ever get back to Shelton but would highly recommend their place to anyone. Thank you Erin!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erin‚Äôs home is beautiful and peaceful. It is very private and gives you the nature feeling right out the door. She gives very good instructions and is very responsive.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place to stay! The cottage was clean and very well taken care of! Got to see the ducks and the deers grazing in the yard near the charming pond! And the fresh hot biscuits and cookies were AMAZING!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erin and Bob were both incredibly warm and inviting. I can't begin to say how great this stay was for our family of 5. Every single day we were impressed with their kindness and the beauty that surrounds their place. Erin bakes the loveliest biscuits and treats you could ever imagine! Couldn't have asked for a better host and overall satisfaction. Every detail is so meticulously designed and serves a purpose. You can tell they take this all very seriously and are genuinely passionate about giving their guests the best experience possible. There hasn't been anywhere more magical than here. Every morning we saw a ton of wild life as well. My partner and I already want to come back and when we do we will ensure she is available and plan everything else we have planned around when we can come back to this exact location. I would genuinely just live here permanently if I could. Absolutely rejuvenating.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful place to stay. Erin and Bob are wonderful hosts, attentive but giving plenty of privacy. Erin‚Äôs bake are phenomenal and the cottage has such amazing surroundings. Full of wildlife and so peaceful. A truly special place. Thank you for sharing it with us üòä"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for visiting the Northwest! Erin and Bob are great hosts and Erin made us delicious baked goodies during our stay. Their property is very peaceful and we saw deer everyday. Was nice to relax in the hot tub at the end of each day after exploring and hiking.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"thank you Erin for hosting us generously
the scones, muffins, and cookies were great"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for us. We're meeting friends at a local Teamsters camp site, but alas we don't have camping gear! We were able to enjoy time with our friends, and travel easily back to our location for a good night's sleep and quiet mornings.
Erin was such a great host, making us her great biscuits and jam, and even blueberry muffins! The surroundings were great as we laughed at the ducks when they met us at the door in the mornings and we really enjoyed sitting out on the swing as a doe and fawn tried to reach apples on the trees. We were even lucky enough to see 4 bucks right up close the last night we were there. We would highly recommend their property!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Words cannot describe this magical place. We didn‚Äôt want to leave, will definitely be back and felt it was the best Airbnb experience we‚Äôd ever had. Thank you Erin and Bob!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful cottage, comfortable, very clean, with a great host. We love the patio area with a lake, ducks and beautiful plant. Erin bake for us delicious cookies and biscuits. Our family will stay in her place again. Thank you Erin for your kindness!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My sis and I felt so at home. My host is a great baker she accommodated us with vegan dessert homemade biscuits and apple pie so delicious
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin went above and beyond to accommodate my last minute needs.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and peaceful. will definitely stay again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is cozy, beautiful, and so peaceful. The cookies and biscuits and jam Erin delivered were delicious. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say our stay was incredible would be a vast understatement. Erin though of everything and the treats she delivered were divine! The friendly ducks were a cherry on top! I would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful place and I already have! I hope that we can come back again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place - very peaceful and serene. The kids loved playing outside - feeding the ducks and watching the deer walk by. Went for a little walk to the creek bed and played on the swings. It was such a nice relaxing area. Inside was spotless, didn't feel cramped at all. The kitchenette had all the supplies that we needed to cook a clam dinner on the patio. Grilled some oysters on the outside grill as well. Also, can't forget the treats that Erin made! Those biscuits were delicious!! Erin was also very responsive and helpful with anything we needed. It was a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An ABSOLUTE DREAM! After camping with the family for a couple days, this place was heaven. The grounds were beautiful, we were greeted by homemade treats, friendly ducks and sweet deers snacking on the trees. The A/C was cool and the bedrooms were perfectly done. I cannot say enough amazing things about this place. I would move here Tomorrow lol. Also, the hot tub was a HUGE hit with us all. THANK YOU Erin and Bob for being such loving and gracious hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the BEST airbnb stays we've experienced. The listing is exactly as described, with the couch being bigger than we expected. We had my mother in law on the twin bed in the bunk room, and she claims it was the most comfortable airbnb stay we've taken her on.
As we were pulling in, there was a deer in the yard to greet us. It wasnt long after getting settled that the ducks came by to say hi.
The day before we were to arrive we messsaged them letting them know we planned on going to the drive in theater and asked if they had any chairs we could use. They so graciously left some out for us to use!
The hosts made them selves available without ever feeling like we were imposing on them or they were pushing themselves on us.
We would absolutely come back here and recommend it to our friends."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erins place was amazing! The yard was perfect with a pond, ducks, deer, beautiful flowers, a creek and a firepit. I read her bisquits and jam were delicious but thay is an understatement! We devoured them! Erin was so kind and hospitable. We wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erin and Bob‚Äôs cottage is only the face of this verdant patch of paradise. The local fauna, the deer and ducks, felt so comfortable and at home that they‚Äôd come up from the gully and pond on the back of the property and spend dusk and twilight under the Apple trees only a few dozen feet from the patio and hot tub where we‚Äôd soak after a day we‚Äôd spent in the nearby national forest, national park, quintessential main streets of the small towns or local farmers market held every Saturday. We woke to smells of a country cottage home, fresh baked biscuits or snickerdoodles filled the home and then shortly after our bellies. Erin‚Äôs skills as a baker are second only to her gift as a host, she made us feel like family coming home! Between her and Bob we always had solid recommendations on picturesque experiences and memorable activities from a true local perspective. We‚Äôve fallen for this hidden gem of an area, close enough for day trips to the big city OR the unique beauty of Olympic Park"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing experience. Erin‚Äòs hospitality is beyond what we expected. Her place is clean, beautiful, warm and peaceful. Simply excellent!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was GORGEOUS! So peaceful and quiet. I loved seeing the deer. The bed was very comfy and we definitely took advantage of the many DVDs to watch! The sitting area was very cozy. Erin made us feel like it was a home away from home, especially with all the delicious homemade baked goods!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was amazing. It was clean and homey. We were exhausted after a long drive and were delighted to find still warm, home-made biscuits and jam on the table when we arrived. The property was even better than the pictures and offered a marvelous view from the hot tub. Our hosts even popped down half way through our visit with fresh cookies. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a bit of peaceful R & R."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful retreat of a location, easy parking and private entrance into garden level suite. Extremely well-equipped kitchenette in main bedroom. Very friendly host, generous with their time and baked goods!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunning and peaceful location! Erin is a host with true hospitality, she made us feel right at home. If you are looking for a place to be a home base for exploring the peninsula, this is it. You will not be disappointed with the surrounding or the wonderful hosts."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful location, worth every penny and the homemade biscuits and jam were to die for. if you need to get away in Washington and relax/ unplug this is the place for you. 10/10 would book again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property itself is absolutely gorgeous and is a great spot for a family or a group of friends. Fire pits, a hot tub, loads of exploring, a creek, and a pound that looks even better on a calm night.
Erin and Bob were both incredibly friendly and Erin went out of her way to give us recommendations nearby for our specific interests. The biscuits and jam were amazing and we were even brought fresh cookies on two separate occasions. It's like living below the friendliest bakery!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is seriously our favorite place to be. Erin and Bob are so nice and accommodating. Erin always brings fresh baked cookies and biscuits and they are amazing! Apart from the amazing hosts, they have such a beautiful space to be outside and enjoy nature. It's a great place for an intimate gathering with friends or family.
We definitely plan on being back again! - Britnee and Claryssa (the bunny bunch)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage in beautiful natural surroundings. We loved the cozy hot tub with the sweeping view of the gardens and pond. Erin is easily available and extremely welcoming and helpful. The warm home-made biscuits and jam are a very special extra treat! We had a fantastic stay here!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I did a weekend getaway at Erin's home. It was such a relaxing time to wander in the woods, play games, and enjoy the hot tub and grill. Erin was so thoughtful- cookies upon our late arrival and biscuits and jam (to die for!) the following morning."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Family had a great time at this place. Surrounded by nature. We got to see some deersüòç Place was clean. Erin was a great host, always responsive when we need something. We also enjoyed Erin's homemade biscuits, cookies and apple pie. So delicious üòã"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most amazing experience I have ever had with an Airbnb. Erin was absolutely wonderful. The Airbnb itself felt like home, and the surroundings were beautiful. We were able to have a lot of fun in the hot tub and in the surrounding woods. Aaron even graced us with her baked goods, which were amazing and incredibly thoughtful. I could not recommend this Airbnb more. Erin did everything to make the experience as wonderful as possible."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved the place, a nice home base for exploring the area but also just a nice place to be cozy. The yard is beautiful even with some drizzle and it‚Äôs nice to feel like you can explore it. Very peaceful and the baked goods are a wonderful addition."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply amazing! From the property views to the kindness and generosity of Erin and Bob. Thanks for providing such a beautiful place to get away! We will visit again in the future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin and Bob are the best of the best you can find out there. Erin's biscuits are so very delicious. They went above and beyond for my husband's birthday with a little added something (cookies) I only felt comfortable and at home . It was private just like they said for our little getaway. Love These guys.
Serena And Steve Mohr"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best Airbnb experience we have ever had. These hosts go above and beyond. It is much better than the pictures. Highly recommend!!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin and her beautiful cottage was amazing! Her place was more than we asked for! It was clean, homey, inviting, and comfortable. Plus her homemade baked goods was the cherry on top! She was a very good host and I would recommend her cottage to anyone looking for a quiet, country spot."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my best Airbnb stay ever. Not only the area is great (and in my opinion underrated), but Erin place has very friendly and homey set-up with all amenities you can think of. On top of that, Erin goes an extra mile to make the stay nicer."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Biscuits and Jam is what Airbnb meant to be shared when starting Airbnb. A home you borrow and feel welcome, taken care of. There is only one spot like this.
Erin & Bob are quintessential hosts. Homemade warm biscuits & homemade jam from her garden or local woods welcome you and a hot tub warms you. It‚Äôs also a very clean space. Erin is a true baker and it shows. They are good biscuits! The location is end of the road, serene and peaceful.
The view in the mornings with the coffee provided is perfect while sitting on the swinging wooden bench overlooking the lawn, pond and into the forest. The deer were a delight and the birds were plentiful and fun to watch. As I wandered out at night into the hot tub, the moon, stars and planets amongst every changing clouds were visible. Wander into the forests for a swing placed between trees and feel the peace and quiet of nature. I felt the tranquility and essence of my environment. It‚Äôs a place of serenity and calm. There‚Äôs a nice creek running through the property and there is room to roam into the woods and enjoy the Pacific Northwest at its finest.
I joyfully had to extend my stay as some work filtered in, yet I had plenty of days to enjoy this wonderful Airbnb. I was treated with the colors changing in the trees as my trip was lengthened. A place of true respite, which is why I come.
This is my third stay and I will come back.
That says it all."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, great hosts.
We (30s couple) stayed here in between a weekend in Seattle and a week camping on the Olympic Peninsula. It was a great place to relax, recharge, and get some remote work done.
""Downtown"" Shelton such as it is is a 20 min drive away, and we went up to the Staircase entrance of ONP during our stay which was an hour drive. There might be more close by for activity but we didn't explore much, that wasn't what we were doing these days!
Various baked goods during our stay including the namesake biscuits were delicious and appreciated!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this Airbnb. It was very clean and the beds were really comfortable. The kitchen is small but it was perfect for us. It has a beautiful patio that overlooks a big backyard and pond with ducks. We loved having coffee and breakfast on the patio and watching the deer and ducks. The hot tub was clean and amazing to end the night with. Erin was an amazing host with her baked goods and special touches in the house. My grandkids had so much fun staying here. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved all the extras, like the friendly ducks, a soak in the hot tub, porch swing and bistro table to enjoy a yummy breakfast of biscuits and Jam.
This daylight basement was private, the property was so pretty with everything we needed. Games, toys, movies and trails to wander and tree swings. Deers wandered by while we were in the hot tub.
Great for a family or a girls weekend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying in a part of an owner's home as usually we stay in entire houses. However, Erin & Bob are lovely hosts & have created a sweet place. It's a lower level, like a daylight basement, converted with homey touches, a small heater, good linens, etc. Fresh baked treats a bonus. Nice keyless entry. We felt safe & secure & my sister plans to return to stay again on her own.
The mattresses in the bunkbed room aren't as comfy as the full bed -- THAT is really nice.
The small hot tub is nice - while soaking we were visited by deer - although it turned itself off the first night, and was beeping while on the patio having morning coffee.
We enjoyed the quiet country setting and lovely landscaping. The property is dreamy! A sweet break for this city gal!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Had such a lovely time at the Biscuits & Jam Country Cottage! The space was comfortable and my party and I feel right at home. Erin and Bob are wonderful hosts and displayed great hospitality during our stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can‚Äôt say enough about how great this stay was. This is probably our favorite Airbnb stay ever!
Starting with the property which is lovely. Complete with woods, trails, a pond and ducks (who were simply adorable). The cottage is comfy with little touches here and there that make you feel right at home. We spent every morning and evening sitting outside enjoying the weather, watching deer and bird pass by.
To top it all off, we were greeted with warm homemade biscuits when we arrived! Erin was lovely to talk to and very welcoming. She also made us some more baked goodies later on. We are so spoiled now!
I definitely recommend staying at this lovely cottage. You are in for a treat!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful stay! Our family loved this Airbnb and it was perfect for a relaxing weekend before school started. Erin is an attentive host that really goes beyond anything expected. Her biscuits and jam were delicious and not one cookie went to waste. It thoroughly felt like she enjoyed sharing her property and we felt welcome.
The cottage was cozy and plenty for my family of five for the weekend. It was stocked with just about everything you could need. My kids loved their bedroom, the bunk beds and the closet full of toys to play with.
The property is so beautiful and provides a great opportunity for relaxation, nature watching and exploration. We visited with the ducks on multiple occasions and each time a deer walked by we all got as excited as the first time. We explored the trails down to the creek and played on the giant swings. Ending the evening in the hot tub and cuddling up on the couch with the movie was the best. There are so many to chose from!
This spot is a gem. Not only would I recommend it to others, we would love you come stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful place is understated in description. It‚Äôs a treasure, a haven in the woods, plus a woodland adventure for kids. This was originally a short stop over for us on a longer journey, but now we want to return. Amazing property and hosts."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will say everyone should come for a visit. Most gorgeous place ! Erin and Bob are very sweet too ‚ù§Ô∏è
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erin and Bob were wonderful hosts! We were greeted on arriving at their lovely place by Erin, ducks, deer and a plate of warm biscuits and jam! Erin was handy to answer any questions and help if needed. Their cottage is lovely and it was fun to explore a little around the pond and sit by the fire pit and play games!
We would all highly recommend this place as a lovely, quiet retreat - even our thirteen year old granddaughter loved it!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We use Air BNB all of the time. The pictures and description do not do this stay justice. Erin was an amazing hostess- very attentive. The cottage is very cozy. The overall vibe of the cottage and property lends itself to relaxation and exploration. We absolutely loved our stay and appreciated how ‚Äúcentered‚Äù it was in terms of approximation to Seattle, Portland, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier, and Olympic National Park. We highly recommend Erin and the cottage!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The guest suite is lovely, with a beautiful outdoor space. Erin's baked goods were delicious, and she was responsive and friendly. Many thanks for a comfortable stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erin and Bob have created a relaxing and beautiful space. Kid friendly to the max! They are accommodating and kind and knowledgeable about the area. My stay at their AirBnB ranks as my top AirBnB experience ever!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I absolutely loved the home and the property. All of our needs were met and everything we needed was there. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a beautiful quiet property and enjoy nature. My kids loved running around the forest and making s‚Äômore‚Äòs. Loved it and would love to stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was impressed! What a charming and delightful place and hosts! It is a beautiful setting, comfortable and very well maintained. The biscuits and jam were delicious. We also bought 2 pies to bring to our friends bbq which also were devoured. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for being a great host! Kids and both of us miss the location already
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Biscuits and Jam is the reason we stay in Airbnbs and not hotels while we travel - to feel a closer connection to the people and place we are visiting. The amount of thought and love that Erin and Bob have put in to this property is evident because literally every possible need that one might have while staying is met. The cottage was fully equipped with everything we needed and more and traveling with two small kids, it was invaluable having a bunk room full of toys and books for their entertainment. The hot tub has just what we needed after days of hiking, the property and gardens are absolutely gorgeous. Warm homemade biscuits upon arrival was a sweet treat! Erin is so kind and welcoming and we will 100% come back whenever we get the chance!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful and beautiful place to spend time. The best way to describe this is as a retreat. A place to rest in beauty and comfort. A place to enjoy being with friends or family. A place to relax in nature or inside on the couch. One has the choice to walk through a forest of varied trees, sit by a pond with friendly ducks, or be inside a truly comfortable little home complete with anything one would need. The biscuits were delightful!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Biscuits and Jam is a really unique little slice of heaven. A retreat on a lush, beautifully landscaped and secluded property. Bob and Erin are wonderful hosts and available if you need anything. All the comforts of home with special attention to detail. Not to mention delicious homemade treats at your door! Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can‚Äôt say enough about Bob and Erin. They were both were so accommodating and made our stay a memorable one. From all the yummy treats to helping my daughter feed the ducks one morning, this is a place we will definitely be back to. One of the first things she said to us was ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt worry about making too much noise‚Äù. This set the tone of our trip. As a mom of 5 that is always my biggest concern but she truly did not care. It helped us to breathe a bit and realize that we truly were on vacation. For once, I got to actually enjoy it instead of trying to keep everyone quiet. This place is nothing short of amazing. It was everything you read and beyond. I wish we could keep this place all to ourselves, it was that incredible. I am so grateful for our time here and can‚Äôt wait to come back. These were some of the kindest people we have ever met. Truly the best AirBnb you‚Äôll find!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were such wonderful hosts, we would definitely recommend for others"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This was without a doubt the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. Erin and Bob went above and beyond to make sure our stay there was comfortable. It‚Äôs very evident that they have a true passion for hospitality. Would strongly recommend this Airbnb to anyone who is considering staying in the Seattle/Tacoma/Olympia areas!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolute gold. My family and I stayed here for a couple of days and had a blast! Erin makes THE BEST biscuits, jam, and chocolate chip cookies! They are to die for! Highly reccomand!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely perfect way to spend a weekend. The property is beautiful, we saw deer, ducks and lots of birds. Hot tub is a perfect end to a busy day. Erin was so sweet and brought us baked goods during our stay. Would highly recommend, and would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Very comfortable and reasonably close to several state parks. We loved exploring the backyard forest area, spending time with and feeding the birds, and relaxing in the hot tub. The biscuits were delicious!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin and her husband have created a wonderful space to share with others. There are so many personal touches they have put time and thought into. Our time at the property was short due to our busy schedule while in the area but we were able to sit on the porch swing this morning and take in the beauty of the nature surrounding their home, watch the ducks swim in the pond, and a deer graze in their yard. Erin‚Äôs biscuits and jam are amazing and we were also greeted at the end of a very long day with some delicious cookies. We can not recommend them enough and will be back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing stay. great view. very kind hosts. would definitely stay here again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Another great stay in the most peaceful, quiet, relaxing setting. Erin & Bob are the best hosts and the Biscuits & Jam upon arrival are the best! The kitchenette, is small, true; yet very functional and the BBQ tops it off for cooking great meals. The non stick skillet worked for so much and the toaster oven and microwave topped it off. The hot tub is hot and quite a treat before bed.
The animal life we enjoyed is a treat as well.
Can‚Äôt say enough about our stay. We are looking to return again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Erin and Bob have everything you need to enjoy your time in their home. Their hospitality is felt with every detail, right down to the home-cooked goodies!! Theirs is a special place, for sure"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is beautiful with plenty of space to walk around and multiple fire pits with supplies. My friend and I had a great time and Erin made biscuits and cookies which were amazing.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint and quiet getaway! The place was super clean and well kept. Erin was a helpful and responsive host and we were the lucky recipients of her baked goods! The toy closet was a big hit with my three year old. The kitchen is small, but cleverly organized, though washing dishes after a family meal was a little challenging in the small sink. beautiful setting - we saw many deer!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was so kind, communicative, and surprised us with baked goodies. The property is beautiful and tucked away. Agate is quite a ways out from Shelton or other cities, so it‚Äôs perfect for quiet getaways."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want peaceful and serene, this is the place for you! Bob and Erin are so kind. Erin is also an amazing baker! She brought us warm cookies, biscuits, and jam throughout our stay. They have a large and BEAUTIFUL property with everything you could want‚Äîmultiple fire pits, s‚Äômores kits, large yard to walk around and/or kiddos to run around, hot tub, and more! It was lovely waking up to deer, squirrels, and cute little birds roaming the property. It was the perfect getaway!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a great quiet place to walk the trails, stargaze, and see some wild life literally in the backyard. the hot tub and the porch swing were great places to relax and watch the tiny birds. it was a great getaway for us and our work crew. biscuits and cookies were so warm and amazing...we will be back, often üòå"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay the biscuits where AMAZING! Thank you so much for sharing your lovely home.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another perfect little getaway. Erin and Bob again went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and happy during our stay. The baked treats are heartwarming, and the hot tub and scenery are so relaxing. Until next time, thank you!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erin was an amazing host -- great communication and super cute spot!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time! Cozy cottage with lots of places to explore and roam around the property. The biscuits are delicious! We devoured them within the hour. Very family friendly with games and activities. Can be a bit tricky to find the turn at night but pretty simple. Erin is a great host - answered all our questions, offered suggestions of things to do around the area and helped any time we needed something. Very much enjoyed our stay, exactly what we were looking for :)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Biscuits and Jam country cottage is an excellent place to relax and unwind in the midst of nature. We will definitely be going there again in the future!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a magical place! Erin made us the most delicious baked goods we‚Äôve ever had! The space was decorated so beautiful for Christmas- and it was so warm and cozy! We didn‚Äôt make it into the hot tub but saw that it was hot and ready for a dip! The rooms were spacious and we enjoyed having a near full kitchen to make a few items on our own vs. doing delivery each night. We‚Äôll definitely be returning!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Biscuits and Jam Country Cottage was truly amazing. The location was great and all of the necessary amenities were provided for us. We would definitely recommend staying here!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in‚Ä¶quiet , nicely decorated, small touches for the holiday season‚Ä¶,and fresh baked treats given daily‚Ä¶a wonderful warm host.."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely lovely! And really wonderful hosts!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax, lovely little hot tub and cozy atmosphere. Thank you, Erin!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was great. Very hospitable and curious. The place was great, very clean and quiet. Great value."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very generous hosts. Calm setting and enjoyed the soaking tub. Very clean and you can tell the hosts have gone out of their way to outfit the space. Not as private as some might want (it‚Äôs a downstairs unit), but we felt very comfortable, had enough privacy, and enjoyed our stay immensely. Great value, too."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Biscuits and Jam is a charming property. Beautifully maintained with everything you need right on site. The inside is warm and cozy, perfect for a couple or small family. Very kid friendly. The outdoors is designed to provide many additional activities in good weather and a covered hot tub to relax in even on a stormy day. The hosts are on site and easy to contact with any questions. Be sure to order one of Erin's pies and spend some time with the most entertaining ducks!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our experience staying at Biscuits and Jam Country Cottage. Trust me, all the 5-star ratings are well deserved. Reservation process/responsiveness to questions, check-in, we‚Äôre all top notch. Accommodations were exactly as described - no surprises. Ultra clean living space, and very cozy. I could go on and on‚Ä¶The outdoor amenities / opportunities were hampered due to weather while we were there‚Ä¶I can only imagine how enjoyable that would be. Erin was the most kind and hospitable host. Greeted us on day 1 with warm biscuits and jam that were sooo good! A couple of additional follow up baked goodies during our stay as well. She truly went above and beyond to make our stay special. We absolutely loved this place!"
2021-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Erin is very sweet and generous with the baked goods and the location is beautiful. I do think that the listing is a bit misleading. To call this a cottage is a stretch as it is really a daylight basement with an inflatable hot tub that didn‚Äôt get hot during our time there. It‚Äôs also important to note that the ‚Äòkitchen‚Äô is a very small kitchenette installed in the closet of the bigger bedroom and the living/dining room is small and has no windows.
Overall we felt disappointed in our stay; perhaps our expectations were too high because of the positive reviews. I will say it‚Äôs very hard to leave a less than glowing review given the kindness of the hosts. I am grateful for their hospitality but I wouldn‚Äôt go back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you'll want to pay attention to Erin's directions because Google maps will send you further than the actual turn. my sisters & I had a wonderful relaxing time, just what we needed to recharge so that we can go back to ""adulting."" it's rare to have an airbnb host take time to come say hello in person & bring yummy goodies to boot. it was amazing to relax in the jacuzzi after a nice long hike in the woods. time & weather didn't allow us to light up one of the very thought out fire pits to make smores & hang out... maybe next time."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. Beautiful, peaceful location and the biscuits were excellent. Erin was a fantastic host. We‚Äôll be back again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erin and Bob are wonderful people who maintain such a beautiful property. There are great exploring options and lounging around a bonfire. The rooms are clean and offer everything you need. It feels very warm and welcoming. The biscuits and jam are to die for. Our sons loved staying there so much we asked to extend our stay! We are very grateful for them allowing us to stay there. We highly recommend booking this amazing forest retreat.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin and Bob's guest suite was absolutely perfect for my weekend getaway in the countryside. I was truly touched by Erin's hospitality and her willingness to go the extra mile for her guests, whether through her delicious home-baked treats or her willingness to give us driving directions when we got lost in the dark, were so very appreciated. Their guest suite had everything we wanted, the WiFi was great, and it was tons of fun to spend time with the ducks. Highly recommended!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Great place. Great hospitality!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a jewell. The grounds are beautiful.and include a firepit, a pond,, and friendly ducks. The indoor space is very clean and comfortable, and although it doesn't have a full kitchen, the microwave, toaster oven, electric fry pan, and outdoor grill provide the capability to prepare a decent meal. Erin and Bob are very nice people and we were fortunate enough to spend a little time conversing with them."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"2 busy moms needing a break & found it in this relaxing environment. Erin was so great & welcoming. The ducks were truly a treat to watch. The only thing I wasn't aware of was the distance from everything. Perfect if your not on the go during your stay, but Agate isn't close enough to anything. We ended up driving miles & miles to eat & etc... I also felt we lost 1/2 a day of our stay w/ the late 5pm check in. By the time we got checked in changed & went to get dinner it was 7pm before we got to the restaurant. I would have preferred even a 3pm check in. That said I definitely got what I went there for. I sat each morning on the swing & watched the ducks on the pond clearing my head & reflecting & relaxing. Both of us agreed it definitely was the most peaceful setting & everything we needed."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a bit of luck that when my plans fell through I found this gem on Airbnb. This property is quiet, private and gorgeous. Erin and Bob have clearly channeled their love into the entire place. It is the ground floor of their lovely home. There are huge operable windows in the spacious apartment and a private patio with a perfect spa. All was enlivened by touches of autumn: a few dried leaves next to the bouquet on the patio table, a pumpkin placed among the plantings in a half barrel, autumnal themed decor on the walls and couch indoors.
The place is spotless, inside and out. Perfect little set up to be able to eat in and prepare light meals. Great towels, even for the spa, and so many treats!! Mints on the bedside table, handmade chocolates, the famous biscuits delivered to the door after a long drive‚Ä¶so many simple pleasures of life were abundantly shared by generous hosts.
I would love to return, again and again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,10/10 Stay!!! Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely thoughtful and hospitable. We loved the cozy location with touches that go above and beyond, especially the biscuits. Would stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time not sure where to begin. Perfect little getaway for the family. Without exaggerating, Erin makes the worlds BEST biscuits. We enjoyed a hike, feeding the ducks and chickens. Even used some of the chicken eggs !!!!!! Thier dog Nutmeg is super friendly. Greeted us right when we arrived. We played board games. Watched some of the dvds they had. Also took a 20 minute drive to the Skyline Drive in and watched a movie. Had everything we needed there. We will DEFINITELY be coming back. Thank you Erin, Bob, Nutmeg, Ducks and Chickens for having us !!!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I from Wisconsin visited Biscuits & Jam for a week vacation over Labor Day and were BLOWN AWAY with how awesome our stay was. Erin is amazing, she was so helpful in the process as this was our first AirBnb stay, and she made us feel very welcome. We were out exploring the state most of our trip, but the time we were at the cottage was very relaxing. The hot tub was amazing after a long day, and the place had everything we needed from towels, makeup wipes, dishes, extra blankets, a washer, and everything in between. Not to mention how amazing the homemade biscuits and jam were! The house was also very clean and super cute. We don‚Äôt have children but there was another bedroom with three beds and toys/games, and many movies to pick from. The backyard view of the pond and woods were exactly the Washington getaway vibe we were looking for. The peace and quiet of this location and fresh air is not something you will get just anywhere. 1000/10 recommend staying at Biscuits & Jam!! We will hopefully be back one day. üòä"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was incredible. The kids loved it. The biscuits and jam were everything we had hoped. We loved exploring the property and feeding the animals. This property is a rare gem, and a must stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a slice of heaven! We had such a great time here. Our toddler loved feeding the ducks and chickens as well as picking blueberries from the garden. Erin and Bob are wonderful hosts that made us feel very welcome. The place is cozy, clean, and had everything we needed. We are looking forward to our next visit!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids loved the bunk beds, books, DVD selection, board games, and exploring the forest. Their favorite part was feeding the ducks. The beds are comfortable and the kitchenette was perfect for making coffee and heating up leftovers. It was super clean, peaceful, and cozy.
We were visiting the area to go to Vance Creek Rail Riders, and the rest of the time just enjoyed the air b and b. A lot of thoughtfulness went into the decorating too - loved the coordinated grays and dark reds throughout the place. Even the fresh-cut dahlia bouquet matched. :) The warm biscuits and jam were to die for, and we snacked on the generous amount throughout the weekend. The host Erin was very sweet and thought of everything to make a welcoming environment. Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place for respite and relaxation. A simply gorgeous forest view, ponds nearby, ducks visiting, deer frolicking in the yard in the evenings‚Ä¶fresh homemade jam and warm biscuits on arrival. Warm cookies at night while we were visiting my oldest and his newborn. We also ordered a delicious pie as Erin also has a pie business and she did not disappoint! The place was comfortable, very clean, had loads of movies if you wanted to be inside‚Ä¶. A nice TV, a comfortable bed, nice towels and the hot tub was a treat as well. The BBQ outside worked great and we were able to have and make great meals with just the toaster oven, microwave and BBQ! Plenty of dishes, bowls for mixing and utensils. Nice Keurig and coffee. Basically a great place as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed something! Including missing the place now that I‚Äôm home!
A short 20 min. walk through the forests and you are at a beach‚Ä¶ sitting in the sun on the porch swing was the best with morning coffee. Sitting in the sun in a lounge chair was divine. It was a dream spot, a wonderful place to relax and unwind; very peaceful. Communicative was stellar and we were incredibly pleased. We are now talking about how we can go back and when."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful area and a clean comfortable space! My kids had a lot of fun feeding the ducks and chickens and listening to the crickets at night. Erin was helpful and responsive too!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"What an amazing place! Erin is beyond kind and went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and had a wonderful time. Every need was met, and then some on top of that. The house is very clean and well stocked with linens, dishes, and such. The biscuits and jam really are to die for, and Erin even surprised my daughter with homemade cookies and a card when she heard it was her birthday. Just amazing. The air conditioning was cool and the hot tub was hot! We really couldn't ask for more, and we look forward to making plans for our next visit! Thank you!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This stay was a little piece of paradise. We absolutely loved the biscuts...didnt even have room for dinner. The property was perfect and the kids loved adventuring in the woods behind the house and feeding the ducks.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house and host was awesome and very kind with great cares
Our family was so touched and thankful
This big yard and nature was really beautiful and peaceful
Absolutely highly recommend for all guest"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had a great stay with Erin. The property is beautiful and there is a lot to do for kids which was perfect for my 4 and 2 year olds. Some nice walks are possible including a 20-25 min walk (one way) to basically a private beach. Highly recommend doing that if you stay here.
We were fortunate enough to meet Erin who was very friendly. Lots of nice personal touches in the space and the biscuits were delicious. The beds were really comfortable and the room for the kids was perfect. The space could not have been better for us. Thanks again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What amazing place to stay! ERin is a super host! She brought bisquits and home maid jelly that she made. So delicious! ERin was so helpful looking for a place to eat dinner and even made a chocolate pie! I would dwefinately recommend this lovely cottage and even has a hottub! Thanks again erin!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a place with charm and peace. A perfect place to come for relaxation and peacefulness. Though it is not in a highly touristy area, it is in a great location to get to Bremerton for a day trip (ferry) over to Seattle. The Olympic National Park is very accessible. But just snooping around the Shelton area, there's lots to discover. It you enjoy flowers, check out the Dahlia Farm in July and August. But so much more. Olympia, the capital, is close enough for a visit."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming to the Biscuits and Jam Country Cottage was a DREAM!! The check in was a breeze, the instructions helpful, and the (warm!!) BISCUITS and JELLY delivered soon after arrival were delicious! Accommodations were comfortable, cozy, and clean. The kitchenette is just that, not a FULL kitchen; so prepare accordingly, and then enjoy a relaxing view of pond, forest, and gardens, complete with porch swing, hot tub, and fire pit! The landscaping is beautiful! The proximity to both Olympia and the Olympic Forest made for an idyllic and delightful place to stay for visiting the Olympic forest by day and relaxing by night. Erin was so kind and generous. I definitely recommend this enchanting and well managed location to anyone looking to stay near the Olympic Forest and experience some wonderful nature and peace!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great environment and very welcoming people
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This AIRBNB's location is breathtaking. Its peaceful and relaxing. Deer, ducks, chickens, and other nature animals can be seen and heard during your visit. Its childfreindly with a baby gate and pack and play available. Outlet covers throughout along with movies, games and toys are onsite. Our welcome gift was so delicious. We had planned to explore the property when Mrs. Erin was at the door holding a basket of warm biscuits and jam. We enjoyed those first before exploring. Some bathroom and laundry essentials were available ie: shampoos and stain spray, dryer sheets and detergent. If you need a break from the busyness, you'll enjoy your stay here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a magical place! The hosts are very welcoming and, as others have mentioned, the biscuits upon arrival are delicious! This was a wonderful place to hangout with our kiddos, feeding the ducks and chickens, swinging in the tree swing and exploring the stream. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. I highly recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You‚Äôll be greeted by their sweet little dog, Nutmeg. This place is everything it claims to be, and more. They have ducks that are so sweet, and funny, and will eat out of your hands. Hosts are beyond welcoming and friendly. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre staying with an old friend or a family member (that you like lol). It‚Äôs such a peaceful property! Be sure to order a pie or two. The biscuits are amazing, and the pie is DIVINE!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! My sister and I couldn't imagine a better Airbnb experience. The beds were comfy, the house and surrounding forest were beautiful, and Erin went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. Also, their dog, Nutmeg, is one of the sweetest dogs we've ever met. We didn't see her much, but it was always a treat to have a moment with her.
Erin welcomed us with delicious biscuits and homemade jam upon arrival and the next day she surprised us with cookies when we returned from a long day of hiking. Her kindness and generosity meant a lot to us, and our own private hot tub was the icing on the cake.
We can highly recommend booking with Erin and look forward to coming back one day."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down the cleanest, comfortable place we‚Äôve ever stayed. Biscuits and jam that Erin delivers are to die for! Thank you so much Erin for such a good stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely magical. This was our first air b&b experience and I feel like we lucked out. The biscuits were delicious, the house was fully stocked with everything we needed, including kids toys & a pack n play! Loved the decorations, even though I had to move some up so my 18 month old didn‚Äôt play with them. The hot tub was relaxing. The ducks and chickens were a huge hit with my daughter. The short walk to the beach was totally worth it and we saw hundreds of crabs at low tide- such a great surprise!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erin's Airbnb was ideal for our family for a few days. Peaceful, quiet, and full of fun country activities like feeding the chickens and ducks, having nice campfires with s'mores, and enjoying Erin's namesake biscuits and jam. The 2 bedrooms are comfy (kids loved the bunk beds!), nice living room with a TV and internet, and the little kitchenette in one of the rooms was good to prep breakfast/lunch. We enjoyed some nearby waterfront restaurants for dinner...and before bedtime we loved a soak in the new hot tub :). All in all it's a great stay in the country and Erin is just the sweetest, nicest host who genuinely wants to make sure her guests really enjoy their stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is WOW!!
Erin is an extraordinary host! I booked this place to unwind and relax, boy were my expectations surpassed! The biscuits + jam at the beginning of my stay were such a hospitable touch. I instantly felt right at home. The aesthetics of the property, the fire-pits, and the inviting hot-tub offered a solace that made relaxation pleasantly unavoidable. And just when I thought, I had experienced it all; I discovered the DVD collection to be quite extensive. Thank you again, and may God bless you both!
-Sergio"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful peaceful getaway! We took our daughters to celebrate a birthday. We all had a wonderful time! Biscuits and jam were delicious! Everything you need was there, so comfy and well thought out. We will definitely go back and highly recommend!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best stay yet! The host was extremely welcoming. She made the most delicious fresh biscuits and jam for us and provided local tips on what to do/where to go during our stay. The space was sparkling clean, cute and they thought of everything you may need during your stay; whether it‚Äôs a huge dvd or game selection or fire building and s‚Äômores. There‚Äôs a charming garden space under the deck with the hot tub right there. Such a peaceful and beautiful oasis. Nearby parks and walking trails lead to the water. Highly recommend staying here!"

The kitchen was well-stocked and it's the first time there have been so many condiments and basic supplies available.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay with Caley and Ross. They went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable and well taken care of during our stay. The beds were some of the best Airbnb beds I‚Äôve slept in. They didn‚Äôt have any specific check out directions too, which is always a plus. :) they had a huge living room which was perfect for our 10 month old to crawl around, and it was perfect for our stay! Thanks Caley! (And go vols!!)"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carley's place was clean, and exactly as described. Enjoyed the amenities and especially the extra blankets for the bed as I am a Californian and not used to the cold weather. Even though it was cold my daughter enjoyed using the hot tub and relaxing at the end of the day. I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Shelton."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy little place was perfect to host our family as my husband was working on a contract in town. Comfortable beds, everything get very clean and the fireplace was an added cozy element. We enjoyed some time in the hot tub and visits from Tim the kitty and some deer that walked right through the back yard! (My daughters favorite). We arrived with hand written notes and a fully stocked coffee bar and drinks/snacks. It was a great place, especially for the price! Will stay here again if we are ever in town."

We will definitely return here during the summer with family and friends. There's plenty of room to roam around with more than 4 acres. My kids had a fabulous time playing and running around the property.
The hosts are so helpful and responsive. They share ideas for activities and their favorite local eateries and dishes.
Definitely one of the best Airbnb we have stayed in. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The house is right on the water, in a breathtaking setting surrounded by peaceful nature, with a beautiful garden, beautiful brand new lawn, and a nice public park and playground next door which our little kids loved. We enjoyed having kayaks available for our use.
Adam and Mari are fantastic hosts! Quick to respond, great communication, ensured we had everything we needed. We felt at home and were able to relax and enjoy our vacation! Thank you so much! We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The stay was great. Beautiful views. The only downside was the internet was very slow.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family had a lovely time. The house and the surroundings were exactly what we needed to relax after spending our days exploring the peninsula.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tolan‚Äôs place was quiet and comfortable. Tolan replied quickly when we had questions about the home. The home had the most beautiful view doing sunset. I‚Äôll most definitely stay here again if in the area again. I recommend Tolan to host anyone.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I stayed at Tolan‚Äôs place during the holidays. We had a really great time and enjoyed everything they had to offer including the full kitchen to cook our Christmas dinner. Tolan was very communicative, friendly and made sure we had a great stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful views from upper floor and decks. The sleeping rooms downstairs were nice and quite and the bed covers were snuggly and warm for those cold winter nights. We only had access to two of the bedrooms but if you like a soft bed they were snuggly and soft. For our group of 3 we had so much room to spread out and relax.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for a wonderful stay and this great home. We really enjoyed the two decks and walk down to the beach and deck. Easy to get into town too for a quick trip.
Thank you for being so responsive to questions."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we were looking for and more. The waterfront place is located on a beautiful privacy lot surrounded with lots of trees and plants all around.
The layout of the rooms is well designed so the place is very cozy and comfortable. The whole place was very clean. The bathrooms were recently updated. The kitchen has everything that we needed for all of our cookings.
All of the decks, multiple level decks, have great view of the water.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The view of the beach is amazing, especially at night with the moon. House is very neat, spacious and has everything my family needed for cooking. The location is very convenient and very close to all shopping stores. We come up here every year and this was the first time we stayed at this home (due to th its location) and it is the best place so far. The price was also low comparing others around this area and the host was very responsive to our questions. My family had a great time.
There were plenty of parking spaces and the garage is huge. The clams from the beach were delicious. Overall, this was the best place so far."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the decks and the water was amazing.
We had a seal visit us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time at this beautiful home. It was quite an experience to be so close to nature. The oysters and clams were literally in your backyard. The host was very responsive to our questions. And the house was very clean and well equipped. Would love to come back again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Waterfront Shelton Beach Retreat is a great property in a beautiful location. Our family spent nearly a week here and we can't say enough good things about the experience. The home is full of amenities that will make your stay comfortable, the decks are a great place to have your morning coffee or an evening glass of wine, and the beach is literally out the back door. We spent the majority of our time in the water either swimming or kayaking. A curious seal joined us daily and watched us have fun in the water.
I highly recommend this location for anyone interested in a relaxing and peaceful vacation."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and peaceful. Super host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at this beachfront Airbnb house was absolutely incredible! The host is very nice and generous. From the moment I walked in, I was blown away by the stunning ocean views and luxurious decor. The house is impeccably furnished with high-end appliances.
The bedrooms are all spacious and beautifully decorated with ultimate privacy. I especially loved the master bedroom, which features a king-size bed and a private balcony with views of the beach.
The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need to prepare delicious meals, and the dining area has a large table that seats eight. The floor-to-ceiling slide door offer a panoramic view of the beach,.
The outdoor area is simply stunning, with comfortable lounge chairs and tables. The beach is just steps away, with full of delicious oysters and clams
Overall, my stay at this beachfront Airbnb house was an unforgettable experience, a vacation that I will always remember. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay here again!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed the house very beautiful views, peaceful"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can‚Äôt say enough about location. Great place to stay and enjoy the surroundings. Beautiful view of the water.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tanya was a fantastic host. Her place was tidy and as described. Great spot and a convenient location for an annual event I attend. I‚Äôll be back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place for weekend getaway for exploring and relaxing. Railroad Tap Station is great restaurant as well as walking Bayshore Preserve afterwards with the beautiful wild birds. The host was friendly and the place was spot on as described. The serene lake and bikes were enjoyable. Definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd time we have stayed here and it‚Äôs perfect for what we needed. Very quiet and peaceful. Easy to get in and out of. A great place to relax and get away.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tanya is a gracious host. Her place was cute and charming much like her personality. The property is lovely as well as the surrounding neighbors. We drove 14 hours and upon arriving into 104 degree weather - Tanya was so thoughtful to have the air conditioning on when we arrived. ‚ÄúWorth It!‚Äù I highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very clean, cabin matches description well. Hosts are very friendly and helpful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,When we needed assistance she was there! Checked in on us since we checked in. The place was well kept and comfortable! Would go again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This gem was perfect for me to decompress after my multiple work trips overseas. The Lake behind the house was so serene and peaceful. There is a park called Springer Park where, if you walk the perimeter of it, you will get your 2k+ steps in. The park is quiet and has the occasional visitor in the mornings (I went early to enjoy the peace and quiet). There were numerous deer around the neighborhood. They had a mother with her 2 yearling fawns. Seen a really big 4 point buck, scared the dickens out of my dog because we didn't see it until the last minute. This is a great place with 2 beds. I highly recommend this place if you're looking to decompress and relax. Tanya and Bo were the greatest host and was able to meet them the weekend before I checked out."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanya & Bo were extremely kind, response with all questions within minutes. Private and very clean little place, enjoyed using kayaks and perfect little row boat we were able to take our pup in. Great hosts!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. It was comfortable and quiet. The use of the kayak on the lake is a nice bonus, not to mention to have a cup of coffee at in the mornings. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tanya was a wonderful host! She was very responsive and so sweet‚ù§Ô∏è Honestly felt like home at this Airbnb. Will definitely come again! thank you so much Tanya. God bless you and your family üíñ
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tanya's guest house in a peaceful and pretty area. The lake is very nice and would be a good place to float on a sunny day. The place is clean and the bed was comfortable. There is no kitchen per se, but this is noted in the description of the property. There is a nice sized mini-fridge, toaster, microwave, etc. It's a nice place to spend a quiet weekend and explore the south sound area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"cozy little lakeside spot, just right for us. place was very clean and comfy. Tanya was exceptionally personable and communicative. not a thing to complain about."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cute place with great access to a lake. the WiFi was very spotty during the time we were there so beware if you are working remotely. But it was a cute place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great time for what we needed on our trip
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a beautiful stay with lots to do. Perfect for a quiet weekend away!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was cute and quaint, very clean and in a great location. The price was great for what we used it for; So it served it‚Äôs purpose.
Overall we had a great experience with Dad and he really enjoyed his stay as well.
We look forward to using your place again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A room of heaven
beautiful place with the lake view in middle of nature
Thank you for hosting us
A√Øssa"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet spot. Loved the use of the adventure items. Host was prompt w information. Perfect for our needs.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean stay. Parks and playground equipment nearby."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tanya was great. Great communication, great place to stay. Loved the lake. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful spot with so much care and attention. Was super cozy and well stocked. Cute and homey. You can walk over to the little lake, and great options to use Kayak etc. Thank you for everything and I will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the stay we had a blast.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice little place. It was a great value for the price you pay. If you need to work remote, keep in mind there is limited Wi-Fi, limited cell service. It is a converted garage. Unfortunately, we booked it for the 2 hottest days with record heat. Having said that it was great for the value, nice and homey. You will need to walk past the small storage building, and along the aside of the main house behind the garage to get to the lake, so keep that in mind if you are worried about looking for the lake, you will feel a little invasive/nosey looking for it as there are no signs."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great jumping off point into your outdoor adventures. This is clamping at its finest. The house is nicely decorated and the bedding is wonderful. Lots of beds! There‚Äôs not enough hot water for everyone even if you do RV style showering (get wet, turn off water, soap, rinse off) but that doesn‚Äôt matter too much when you‚Äôre mostly using the space as a launch pad for local outdoor experiences."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Thanks Tanya! Our family had a great trip!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Tanya's guest house for two nights and enjoyed the space as it was peaceful, clean, and accurately described. Beds are spacious and comfortable, and the artwork in the guest house is really nice! We enjoyed using the picnic table outside for our meals; if the weather is bad though, it might be a bit tricky since there's not too much space indoors to sit and eat or to prepare food. Overall very happy with our stay--thanks Tanya!"
2022-07-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed from Tuesday to Sunday, and the first couple days were just fine. The hosts remodeled most of the detached garage to be a living space, and the end with the garage door is still a garage. It was a little hot inside, but we knew there was no AC and expected such and the provided fans helped with the window open (we also brought our own fan). It is a little far from town (about 25 minutes to Shelton) and the only options for cooking is a microwave or the hosts grill/barbecue on the deck of the main house. The coffee pot was also filled with old coffee grounds when we went to use it, so we bought some instant coffee and used the microwave to heat up water instead. There is one sink in the bathroom, and a small shower. The hot water heater is VERY small, so you may get a hot shower for a couple minutes before it gets cold. The water pressure for the sink was also lacking.
Our main issues began on Friday, when we woke up at 8am to the sound of power tools outside the door, and the garage opening and closing multiple times. This continued everyday from 8am to about 5-6pm until we left on Sunday. It is the hosts property and their right to do what they want, however we received no notice that they would be doing work outside during our stay, which would have been nice considering it was 4 feet from the door of the unit and the garage is sharing a wall with where we were sleeping. Whenever we went outside while they weren‚Äôt working, there were power tools and materials everywhere making the space difficult to be in, especially with a dog. We ended up spending the rest of our stay trying to keep our dog calm as she is a blind rescue and the sounds scared her. We chose this Airbnb for the privacy of staying in a rural cabin, but we could barely open the window majority of the time."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super friendly and responsive, proactive host. The cottage was easy to navigate to. Instructions were clear. Beds were comfortable and the Roku TV has all the apps you could ask for. everything worked great. the little lake was a fun paddle in the provided boat and it was warm enough to swim in. overall a very pleasant stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was awesome, great location. Was clean, beds were comfy, can watch t.v when you just want to relax or go out on the lake. Lots of bass!!!! And trout if thats what ur into. Really felt at home and Tanya more than helped with that. She consistently checked up on us and made sure all our needs were fulfilled. Definitely 10/10 host and house. Thanks again Tanya."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the place so relaxing and serene! It had everything we could need. And Tanya went above and beyond to make our stay special! Highly recommend staying here!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amaziiiinggg!!!! For family of 4 was so peaceful and fun get away. We love small towns, the nature is our thing. Felt like we where Glamping. It‚Äôs like a guest home. Behind the main house witch is in front of the View for rowing the boat. We stay for 2days and we saw deers early morning, there‚Äôs a park down the block for kids and pets. The main stores or restaurant under 20mins wasn‚Äôt bad. We BBQ with there bbq pit and worked great. They don‚Äôt have a kitchen setting so make sure to bring paper plates and utensils. If you don‚Äôt want to cook there‚Äôs a lot of restaurants in Shelton ."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy place. We were visiting family that lived closer by and this was perfect. A lot better for us than driving to downtown or Olympia for a hotel. The beds were very comfortable and we had all the amenities necessary for a pleasant stay. Thank you.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Traveled into town for shaker meeting at Mud Bay Indian Shaker Church, toiletries were a nice touch.
It is set in a garage, so can be cold. Overall, really nice."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely perfect. Super clean, super comfortable. Tanya‚Äôs communication is great. For the price you seriously can‚Äôt find a better deal."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Tanya‚Äôs place is cozy and clean. However when I booked it I was under the impression it was in Olympia and it‚Äôs not. The drive was far and difficult in the dark on many winding roads.
But if you don‚Äôt mind being in a remote area this cottage is sweet üôÇ."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tanya was an excellent host. Their guest house was cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would love to go back if they will have us.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location, and a great place to stay. It was clean, convenient, and comfortable. It was also nice that they let us borrow their rowboat to spend time on the lake."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in-between Olympic National Park and Mount Rainier National Park. Perfect guesthouse for two people. Tanya is a great host, thank you!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cottage with comfortable beds (we didn‚Äôt use the bunkbeds). Tanya is a thoughtful host. Be sure to read all of the details of what is available.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a cute place. It was quiet and clean. It was great to have bunk beds for the kids. There is a dog park that is a two-minute walk, which was great for the dogs."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Tanya is a gem Among hosts! The guest house is very cute, on a quiet cul-de-sac among tall evergreens. The lake is peaceful and Tanya provides chairs to sit on the banks and relax.
I had the queen bed which was very comfortable. It is two rooms with a ‚Äújack ‚Äòn jill‚Äù bathroom between. Both rooms have doors to the outside. The larger room has the kitchenette. Note, there is no kitchen sink. We had a couple minor issues which Tammy responded to immediately. She is a 5 star host!!!"
2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This place is cute, clean, and has plenty of places to sleep. It‚Äôs a guest house that sits kind of behind the main house so you are not right on the lake, but Tanya and Bo let you access the main house deck and their row boat which is generous. The area is beautiful with plenty of places to walk and a few parks nearby that we enjoyed. You are a bit of a drive from towns (20ish minutes from Shelton and 45ish minutes to Olympia), so if you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful getaway this is it. The downsides: there is no table to sit and eat or drink at. There is a nice counter you can stand at, and I bet just adding some barstools there would do the trick. It was the right size for my husband and I, but it may be a bit tight for six people. The wifi really only worked in the room that‚Äôs closest to the main house which wasn‚Äôt too problematic for us as we could easily move to that room if we needed it. The little patio attached to the guest house was nice and we enjoyed it. We were happy it was dog friendly, as we had our two dogs with us and they enjoyed the local parks. Tanya and Bo kept in communication with us before and throughout our trip and were very hospitable, which we appreciated!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was sweet, clean and had comfortable beds. My whole family loved it and we will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute oasis on the water. Great retreat with well stocked and thoughtful touches.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Teresa and Steve were great hosts! Very friendly and helpful! Teresa thought of every last detail and amenity. The place was spotless and the views are gorgeous. The best put together Airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve ever stayed at. Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, cozy place that is very unique with great service and amenities!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect spot for a girls relaxing beach get-away. Plenty of cozy charm tastefully decorated with amazing panoramic views of the beach even from the bed! We loved the deck and all the places to sit and relax, in the yard, by the fire-pit or in the cozy deck furniture. There were easy to access kayaks for paddling during the day, which we took advantage of! The hosts were so gracious to include breakfast snacks in the fridge for the next day. The covered parking and ample yard games were so fun! Highly recommend! The bathroom was very nice and felt like a spa retreat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay, right on the water. The small breakfast items and snack provided were a great addition. Kayaks available are also a great extra! The view from the bed is superb, a great place to drink my morning coffee. Hosts were responsive and helpful. Would definitely recommend and stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can‚Äôt wait to come back to Hammersley Haven! The private, waterfront setting cannot be beat. We were treated to a grey whale, sea lions and a seal on our morning paddle. Teresa thought of everything and we so appreciated the breakfast items and cold beverages waiting for us. Our kids loved the lawn games and s‚Äômores kits. What a special place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"RARE! Beautiful views and cozy place to stay was what we needed for a girls weekend away. Teresa was very helpful, communicative, and very accommodating. We had our own covered parking spot and lots of treats and snacks! You can tell that Teresa has put a lot of thought in this rental property and cares for her guests! I would highly recommend this location to anyone! We will definitely be coming back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are sweet and responsive. The place is beautiful and an remote. They had cooking ware, a small fridge, Netflix and prime tv. They also were thoughtful and provided us with some snacks and drinks (juice, wine bottle, coffee) for our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time at this Airbnb, and, just like the first time, everything was perfect. Thank you so much for another wonderful stay. We‚Äôll be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa was a superb host, super helpful and very responsive, an A+ . The house was beautiful, clean, amazing views and had all of the perks and little extras you want in a good vacation rental. The only negative is that the curtains don't cover the top windows so if you want to sleep past sunrise you should bring a mask, but why sleep in with a view like that!? We would definitely recommend staying here though and would repeat for sure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, perfect home, great experience!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You always hope the pictures match the place described when you arrive at somewhere to stay. Well we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the place we chose, as soon as you enter you see the clear attention to detail these hosts of put into the place. We have never stayed in a place with such great attention to detail with both amenities and personalised items. From every kitchen gadget you could think of, two tvs with programmed streaming sites, luxury bath items, board games, heated mattress and the list goes on and on. The hosts provide kayaks which we used on the stunning river right on the doorstep. We loved seeing seals swimming around and made a great experience for me and my partner. We couldn‚Äôt have chose a better place to stay and would recommend it to anyone staying in the area!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the serene, quiet cabin beach vibe. The deck and fireplace setting was beautiful. The cozy space was open and well organized, to include, directions, informational labels and tips about the surrounding areas. The extra touches of Costa Rican coffee, snacks and drinks made us feel right at home. A great place for someone looking to relax, catch a glimpse of the harbor seals and enjoy nature‚Äôs quiet. Our hosts Teresa and Steve do a wonderful job of communicating before , during and after your stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem! The property is gorgeous. Right on the water with great views in both directions of the inlet. We saw tons of wildlife right off the deck - family of seals, Eagle, cormorants, etc. The kayaks were great and super convenient - a double and 2 singles. The deck was amazing - several comfortable seating areas that are well shaded, a grill, fire pit, a place to eat outside, etc. The unit itself is super cute, well decorated, very comfortable and has everything you need. We were there when it was high 90‚Äôs and inside was cool and comfortable. Teresa is so thoughtful, communicative and really goes the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. She left us breakfast food, juice, snacks in the fridge. Even though the unit is next to Teresa‚Äôs house it felt very private. We have stayed at many Airbnbs over the years and this is definitely one of our favorites. We can‚Äôt wait to go back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place. We walked in and the first thing that we noticed was how lovely the furniture was laid out, how clean it smelled, and the individualized note that was left for us. We had such a lovely experience here. We enjoyed the lawn games and the kayaks. Got a chance to enjoy the breakfast items and the surrounding area. We loved it and would love to come back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was amazing. Such thoughtful touches everywhere you turned, from welcome note to breakfast goodies, to the eye mask.
The outdoor space was perfect to relax or to eat breakfast while keeping our eyes out for our friend the otter.
We enjoyed having yard games to play too.
Beautiful home, I would stay here again and again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second time at Teresa‚Äôs place‚Ä¶first time was for my husband‚Äôs birthday and this time around was for our anniversary. Teresa is the most thoughtful host! We love her!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! All the amenities plus! Teresa was very responsive to any of our needs and very friendly! Would definitely recommend staying at this beautiful and peaceful place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most amazing time at Teresa and Steve‚Äôs place, and it was one of the best birthdays I‚Äôve had in a while. They clearly worked hard on renovating it and putting everything we needed for our stay including fresh fruit, oatmeal, energy bars, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and so much more. They were also very considerate, putting a birthday balloon and a sign that said ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù. The highlight of our trip was getting to see orcas up close from the kayaks they supplied! We also saw great blue herons, seals, an otter, crabs, a starfish, and so much more. Thank you for an amazing stay! Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is top notch!! So peaceful. The decor is perfect‚Äîlots of attention to detail.
They provided breakfast even!!
The bathroom and shower are great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will be back if I find myself in Shelton, WA. Highly recommend, the place was absolutely beautiful. Felt very safe, comfortable, and was in a very relaxing area.
Teresa thought of EVERYTHING. From home decor, to extra pillows + blankets, a printed guide to the house and local restaurants, make up wipes and wine for our girls trip."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Teresa's place is a slice of heaven!! Honestly, we wish we had stayed longer but we were only there to sleep (graduation celebration nearby) Teresa puts so much detail into her airbnb. She literally furnishes everything you need from toiletries, to snacks and wine... She even supplies kayaks, life vest, games, cell phone chargers ect..Her airbnb is meticulous. The patio set up and view of the beach inlet is so tranquil (my husband literally fell asleep on the lounger) It doesn't get better than this. Thank you, for sharing this gem with us. I am greatful we found this oasis and will definitely book here again if we are in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Teresa‚Äôs home was beautiful! Every little detail was thought of and Jeff and I felt right at home. The view is lovely and the deck has lots of outdoor seating. We took the kayaks out for a quick adventure on the water‚Ä¶it was perfect. To say Teresa is a Superhost is an understatement. Thank you for such a memorable, relaxing, fun time‚Ä¶complete with wine and delicious coffee from Brazil!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is a great place. It had all the amenities we needed. Coming from the DC suburbs, it was startling how quiet and peaceful it was. Even though it seemed it was out away from civilization, it was a short drive to all there is to do in Olympia. It was fascinating to watch the tides coming in and out, covering and uncovering the oyster beds; and watching the sea birds.
We place to stay here again the next time we‚Äôre in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved it! The interior was beautiful. The furniture and bed were very comfortable. The deck was great and we used it daily. We didn't use the fire pit but it was very pretty. The views are absolutely amazing! We were right on the water and we saw seals! Teresa and Steve were great hosts. They're very friendly and responsive. We got to meet the three doodles on the property which we loved--we were missing our own dogs so the dog love was needed. We would definitely book this place again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great views of the water, very clean place, some good breakfast was also provided. Teresa was very good at communicating how to check in (including pictures of the front). Quiet area for the most part, lots of amenities like extra blankets, snacks, and a coffee maker that grinds the beans. My only issue was the sofa bed which was very lumpy even after trying to flatten it out. The main bed in the bedroom was good though."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I were in the area for a bridal shower and found Teresa's place on line. It is perfect! Beautifully decorated with every convenience you might need. Perfect tranquil location on the water and incredibly quiet. We enjoyed taking the kayaks out and watching the seals. Teresa has a nice offering of snacks and breakfast items and was great with communications-and responded quickly. My soon-to-be daughter in law's parents live about a mile away and we made them come check out the place in case they ever have guests who need a place to stay. We will definitely book it again when we are in the area. We have stayed at vacation rentals all across the U.S. and this is one of the best we have seen! Do not hesitate to book it.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos and description of this Airbnb were spot on! I simply cannot say enough, the cottage was absolutely beautiful, everywhere you looked there was something lovely or interesting to look at! Down to every detail, everything was perfect! She even provided local snacks, breakfast items, and a lovely bottle of wine!
She was extremely friendly and accommodating! She Even brought over an iron and ironing board!
We had a wonderful time!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book it! One of the greatest stays we have ever had. From communication to the place itself, Teresa was so lovely. We were blown away how beautiful, new, cozy and comfortable this place was. They have absolutely nailed every detail and have created this beautiful oasis away from the city. If you are looking for a quiet luxury getaway- this is it!
Special thanks to the host for leaving us some welcome gifts like local wine, snacks and breakfast egg-bites etc, really thoughtful and we appreciated it!
Bed and the bedding were superior. Large private deck on the back, great seating, beautiful fireplace. We didn‚Äôt have time to use the kayaks but they looked brand new and easy to use :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is by far my favorite airbnb from the past few years, and we do our fair share of exploring the PNW. The minute I stepped in the door, I felt relaxed. There were so many unexpected amenities and thoughtful touches. It's the perfect spot for a relaxing couples weekend or a fun little getaway for a small family. The gorgeous view from the bedroom and the easy access to the beach were my favorite parts. We'll be back for sure."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, beautiful views. Very thoughtful host!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really love staying here, it was exactly what we were looking for.
We have a relaxing time and very private, very clean and comfortable. Teresa always respond in time when I have a question. The view from the room it is a plus!!!
Definitely I‚Äôm coming back to this beautiful and peaceful place.
Thank you very much!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands down one of best Airbnb we have ever stayed at to date! Kudos to the hosts for their great work in making this place awesome. We loved everything inside and out. The place was clean and airy as well as luxe and comfy. Loved the beachy decor inside, and the snacks the hosts left for us. We also loved that they had kayaks and life vests that guests can use, which was one of the main reasons we booked our stay here. We had so much fun kayaking. We even saw a couple of seals swimming behind us as we kayaked. The highlight of our stay was how peaceful and quiet it was. Loooveed this!!
The hosts truly put alot of thought to this place and it didn't go unnoticed. We seriously can't wait to stay here again. üôÇ"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is absolutely a 5-star place. Everything about it is 5 stars, from the host/hostess to the space itself to the views from the bed. My husband and I were looking for a small place with a view, and this place is way better than described.
Teresa is wonderful, thoughtful, and responsive host. I felt very pampered with their rain shower, bathrobes, scenic views, luxurious bed, and array of snacks.
I would recommend this private space to anyone looking for an unassuming and breathe-easy getaway."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands down the best played Ive ever stayed! Super duper highly recommended. Make sure you stay here at least a week. Don't ever stay at a hotel again or another Airbnb in Shelton again. This is the kind of place that you would want to live at permanently and maybe retire :) Every detail to this place is 110% from the awesome phone/tablet charger stand with the cables to great indoor heating and alot of attention to some great snacks. The view from this place is super epic, probably one of the nicest ones Ive seen in the puget sound/hood canal region. The house is only about 10-15 minutes away from alot of things in the area from shopping to restaurants etc. This place is a must to stay. Hosts were incredibly accommodating about everything from me bugging them alot about my friend visiting last minute, late check out and they even closed my car door for me when I left it open for a few hours. This place is a must stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely, private, peaceful spot. Great view and right on the water. Place is clean, comfortable and thoughtfully arranged. Thank you Teresa."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I want to give this place a poor review so I can keep this get to myself. Of course I can‚Äôt do that though. Teresa and her airbnb are both wonderful. She makes special touches standard and sets the bar for Airbnb hosting. If you don‚Äôt stay here, you‚Äôre missing out."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, we were blown away at all the details Teresa put into her home!! She def has an eye for decor, she did a great job making this home comfortable, appealing, and functional. She also communicated very well with us, making sure that we had everything that we needed. We have stayed in many Airbnb‚Äôs but this has been one of the best yet! It was very peaceful and relaxing for our anniversary getaway. We even got to kayak, and saw a seal right away right beside us - That was such a highlight!
Thank you so much for hosting us - we would love to come back here again! Very clean and overall, just an AMAZING experience! We will be back and tell our friends about your place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is magical, and even though I was there less than 24 hours Teresa made me feel so special. Seals, otters, crabs, fog and glassy water kayaking: it was a dream stay. I only regret I didn't stay longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a GEM! Best Airbnb in all our many years of travel! Loved everything about this Getaway! The moment we stepped in we were struck with COZINESS & attention to every detail! There's a big open living space with comfy furniture, pillows, blankets. Everything, including the fixtures, was of high quality! The kitchen had all you need, along with a wonderful suprise snack tray! If you like coffee, there's a delicious Coffee maker with a coffee bean grinder built in!! Nothing like having fresh ground coffee with a pastry and sitting on Adirondack chairs looking out at the water watching seagulls and seals pass by!!
The bathroom was another ""wow""...beautiful polished pebble flooring that spills into the delightful ""rain shower""!
And the bedroom was full of tranquility as the bed faced directly out to the water view!
Although our unit is connected to the main house, we felt complete privacy!
We just can't say enough about this place. Teresa definitely poured BLESSING into this guest home!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hammersley Haven , honestly a true gem in the woods. Delightful beach so relaxing to be steps from the water and listen to the little waves at night .
I loved the decor ! Great combo different then the red , white and blue of a traditional Maritime look. My birding colleagues were a bit jealous I had found such a sweet retreat , opposed to the boxy(boring) hotel they stayed in.
Good Luck Teresa in your future rentals.
Crystal
P.S. I‚Äôll be back !"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"we loved our stay here this was a beautiful location, The view was amazing, super comfy bed, extremely clean, thoughtful little things around the house to make the stay amazing. we are already making plans to come back and stay a few days in summer. great place to come and unwind and chill and get away from people and have quiet. got to see an amazing sunset and a sunrise even Stars!!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the most beautiful, clean, and classy place that we have ever had the privilege to visit. The home was immaculately clean! This property is stunning inside and out. The view of the water is second to none, the landscape was perfectly groomed, and the property was a dream in every single way. The beds and the pillows were so comfortable. The bathroom towels were huge, clean, and cozy. The pool table and the extra room downstairs makes a great place to gather and to hang out. The decor and the furniture is classy and inviting. The natural light in the home is stunning. Sue was responsive, professional, and friendly. She was an amazing host. If you have the opportunity to stay here you will not regret it. This place is perfection."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much. The space was great, very clean with big wrap around deck. We were visiting family in the area and it was very convenient to get to them. We loved the living room with their comfortable chairs and high ceilings. Lots of small touches in the kitchen and bathroom to make our stay very nice."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Joe was a great host, always responsive and helpful! The house is really nice and spacious. Everyone in the neighborhood was really kind and friendly. Great wifi and living room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a five night stay at Joe‚Äôs house. The interior might be even nicer than the pictures. All the appliances are brand new, dangerously comfortable couches and nice bed/linens. The mini split A/C works great, keeping the main living area and primary bedroom cool. Great wifi and a sit/stand desk if you need to work.
A huge deck with a super cool umbrellas to create shade no matter where the sun was in the sky. There is some road noise, a Bluetooth speaker came in handy to help block while hanging outside.
Joe was quick to respond and easy to work with. His place was an incredible value and I would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, very spacious. Clean and comfy. A little hard to find the driveway but convenient if you are looking to explore the the Olympic National Park."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Stayed here for a week and the hosts were extremely accommodating. We were traveling with a 4mo infant and they were kind enough to help arrange a pack and play for our baby. House is completely newly furnished and has all new amenities so it was a pleasure to have our stay here. It‚Äôs a busy location but good one if you want to keep this place as your base and do day trips to Olympic National Park. Grocery store and restaurants are within minutes of driving.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and comfortable good location
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. Everything was clean and the place was convenient and cozy. We loved the back deck. So many little extras and everything that we needed. Communication was wonderful. The hosts reached out to me to let me know things specific to my stay, and they answered all of my questions right away. This was my mother's first time in an Airbnb, and she could not stop talking about how wonderful it was. She said it was very comfortable, and every time she turned around there was a new piece of artwork or something else to discover. Having a picture of the front door was very helpful since I wasn't quite sure that I was in the right place when I arrived."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe's place was perfect for my trip to Shelton. Beautiful deck and the home was really spacious. Beds were comfortable and the desk with charging station was really appreciated. The location was perfect and really close to all the local restaurants and coffee spots.

Everything was very clean, there was no odor or signs of bed bugs, and her Garden and pets were very lovely. She really has a awesome spot up on a hill! House rules were very reasonable. Recommend this place!"

We‚Äôve had many great conversations and Donna had some funny stories to share. She did give us many great recommendations what we could do in the area and all of them worked well for us.
Her house was super duper clean. You really could swipe over the surfaces with a white glove and it wouldn‚Äôt have any dust on it. The bathroom was impeccable.
Thank you for an awesome stay Donna!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had 2 very nice stays at Donna's house. Getting a good night's sleep is my number one issue and Donna is extremely quiet in the mornings and evenings, her house is quiet, and the street noise is minimal. In addition, she keeps her house super clean, the landscaping is pretty, and she has plenty of outdoor seating so guests can enjoy being outside. Donna went out of her way to make my stays pleasant and relaxing. She is super friendly and considerate. She made me feel at home in her house and in Shelton. She baked some very tasty berry cobbler and shared it with me. She also pointed out a couple of local music events and invited me to join her and her friends at one of them. She even brought an extra folding chair for me. I've been visiting Shelton for 20 years and seeing the live band in the park with her and her friends made me feel more at home in Shelton than I had before."

The bed was very comfortable and there was a desk large enough for my (rather big) laptop and a notebook. Plenty of closet and dresser space if you're looking to stay a while too!

She is an amazing host, very helpful and respect your privacy. She can talk to you about her adventures or going with you for a hike if you want to. She can recommend places to visit and is very active most of the day.
She loves baking and does it pretty well. If you stay at Donna's house you mostly have a chance to try her bread or another things that she makes, and it's really good.

The queen bed was quite comfortable. In the summer camping in her yard would be fun. This place is peaceful. She was very accommodating.
