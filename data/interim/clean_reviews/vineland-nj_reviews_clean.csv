2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly lovely, peaceful, comfortable stay in this adorable ‚Äòlittle‚Äô house. Karol has thoughtfully provided for every need. Location is perfect for mid Jersey from the coast to the Pine Barrens. Will definitely keep on my wishlist ü•∞"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't recommend the Little House enough! My partner and I had a wonderful stay here for 2 nights and we already can't wait to come back! The space itself is so cozy and sweet, and it had everything we needed and more to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. We especially appreciated Karol providing local recommendations, which we tried several of and loved. The surrounding land and area is green, beautiful, tucked away, and peaceful. We enjoyed sitting out and eating and enjoying coffee in the mornings and evenings (with birds always serenading us!) Perfect place for a quiet and relaxing getaway with lots to explore and enjoy in surrounding Hammonton and S. Jersey :)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy place to stay while we explored the beautiful Pinelands. The ""little"" house had plenty of space to relax in the evening, and we also enjoyed eating lunch outside. Everything was comfortable and clean. The check-in was easy and Karol was helpful and clear with the instructions. It's a pretty and peaceful location, surrounded by farms and fields, but at the same time doesn't feel too far from civilization. With the helpful list of recommendations, we enjoyed some great food very close by. It was also easy to get to different parks to hike and learn about the history of the region."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would like to start by saying that the pictures shown do not do this place justice!
My husband‚Äôs and my stay was wonderful. It was peaceful, private and quaint, which made it the perfect escape. Our hostess was a delight to communicate with and you could tell that she had thought of every detail. I hope to find the little house available for future visits to town."

Thank you Karol!
Kate and Charlie"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My partner and I needed a little getaway from home and work and this little home was the perfect place! I recommend this place 10 out of 10.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karol‚Äôs place was such a beautiful little getaway for my girlfriend and I! Even though we only live about an hour away, it was nice to get out of town for the night, check out a local winery and explore the area. The place felt like a little ski lodge with all the unique skiing decorations and beautiful little touches. I really liked the flower garden right outside and the birds chirping in the morning. I plan on coming back here again later in the spring when it‚Äôs a little bit warmer. I highly recommend this cozy, comfy, welcoming little tiny house for anyone passing through the area that wants a little piece of home away from
home. Karol was very flexible with the check in time and even left the door unlocked for us so we didn‚Äôt have to fumble around with the key while it was raining. Keep up the good work and we can‚Äôt wait to stay at your little place again sometime soon! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüå∏üåªüòá"

I walked into a warm, cozy and pristine little cottage. It is decorated in the most charming way. Karol has all the added touches to make you feel welcome - toiletries, snacks, water, etc. I knew she was just a message away if I needed anything. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to the area and hoping that The Little House will be available and waiting for me!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karol was lovely and so was the little house! Karol was a responsive and kind host. The house number is on trees near the street which was so helpful when trying to find the right house. Karol had the little house ready for us with the lights on and valentine themed decor, with a sweet valentines background on the TV. The space was perfect for the two of us. Very private and nearly silent inside. The shower hot water lasts long, which is a nice change from our apartment üòÜ everything was clean. The bed was so comfy. We got to indulge in the drink and snack bar. The grounds outside are beautiful! Absolutely recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cute, quiet, and cozy house. Very conformable and very private. The little room. Karol was really nice and checked in on us from time to time, there were lots of restaurants and fast food around. Overall really great for the price."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Little House is a Gem in Hammonton, NJ!
Karol is super easy to chat with, gives excellent instructions on how to get in and where to park! She had some snacks and waters for us upon arrival & the TV Fireplace was crackling, as we walked in!
I was a local in the area for 41 yrs & all of Karol‚Äôs suggestions for places to visit were spot on(laminated lists on bed tray & on listing)!
This lil home is the perfect place to stay for the night or the week, we simply adore this place and can‚Äôt wait to come stay again!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Little House was perfect for a couple nights visiting family in the area. I just needed a place to sleep that was clean and safe. Everything you need and way better than the crummy motels in the area. Very comfortable bed and bath towels. Roomy hot shower. What more can you ask for?
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying at the little house, super relaxing and comfortable. Loved it."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol was extremely helpful and flexible. I truly appreciated her help during the stay.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karol's Little House is an absolute gem. She dressed it up for the holidays and set the TV to greet us with holiday music. The photos are accurate and although the bathroom is only partially shown on her page, it is adequately spacious and includes a nice shower. Karol, Bill, and their daughter are wonderful people and they were ready at a moment's notice to help with any questions or problems. The Little House is completely private and is located on the owners' beautiful property. The bed was very comfortable and the entire house is super clean. I highly recommend it for anyone who would be comfortable in a smaller living space. My husband and I were quite content in it. We would definitely return there if we are ever in the area again."

We need to get into the place a little earlier than check in Karol made that happen.
Great communication.
Super cozy little house. We loved it.
Highly recommend Karol!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I had such a cozy stay at the cabin. The host was very communicative and was willing to help me out when the wifi wasn't working.

I would absolutely stay here again

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House is exactly as described by Karol, the host. It's a beautiful, quiet spot surrounded by farms, but not far from town. The bathroom was actually a bit more spacious than I expected! The house is perfect for anyone traveling for business or leisure. Karol is also extremely responsive. I would highly recommend and hope to go back someday!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! Definitely would come to stay again. It‚Äôs great for a little getaway that‚Äôs different from the typical expensive areas people vacation in. Everything was close to drive to and cute downtown area to experience. Overall super CLEAN! SMARTLY DESIGNED! COZY!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Like most of the visitors to the LH, I give it a very high rating. It is well described in text and photos, so I had positive hopes for my stay, but it exceeded my best expectations. The care and effort put into making it very nice is evident at first glance. Perhaps more impressive are the little touches that may surprise along the way - further making one aware of Karol‚Äôs care.
Not only did I find the property and landscaping quite pretty and peaceful but the local area also. Each morning I took a walk on the nearby streets.
Note: it is not hard to imagine that some people could find staying at the LH for multiple days to be a challenge in terms of its size and livability. In fairness, the LH does not pretend to be other than what it is - ‚ÄúThe Little House‚Äù! (see text & photos). That being said, I stayed over a week, and it worked fine for me as a key part of my project being in the South Jersey area.
My gratitude to Karol & Bill. (incl. Karol's thoughtfulness re. extra coffee)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I love this place. It was perfect for my personal retreat. The connection I felt was incredible. Every detail inside and outside are unique. Karol is a super host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very cute space. Just a bedroom and bathroom but high ceilings keep it feeling big and the bathroom is actually large. Small touches like gourmet chocolates and creamer for coffee make the place really comfortable. The towels, pillows and sheets are very comfortable. This was great for me and my boyfriend to sleep over before our kayaking and camping trip in Wharton forest. I would definitely come back."

To keep air going open the windows a little I learned that trick . It was just the right space you need same as if you were in a hotel room but more private . Checking in and out went smooth and my daughter and I took a walk to see the beautiful horses on property before leaving . Karol took my request last minute as my other host canceled and she was very friendly and responsive I would definitely stay again if I am in the area ! Oh her local recommendations are on point penzas pies was delicious !! Thanks again Karol !"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cute and peaceful place! All sorts of amenities; this is a host that really cares about you having a great stay. Even though the cabin is in the backyard, behind the hose, with a studio and another rental place, she's done a great job of setting up a private outdoor seating area. Sitting there in the evening or in the morning was delightful."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Cozy little house with nice attentions from Karol, very clean and perfect for a little place to relax. We didn't not visit anything around it because we only stayed there as one last night to our trip before finishing our long drive home, but the location is close to the stores without feeling like it's close to it, it feels more like the country. We were a little over 1hr from Cape May. I recommend! :)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,2nd time at the tiny house. Had a lovely time again. Karol is an excellent and responsive host but gives her guests privacy and an overall great experience. Next year we‚Äôll definitely either book again or go to steamboat Colorado.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karol's Airbnb is a masterclass in hosting and hospitality. There is no corner or counter in that Little House that isn't thoughtfully arranged and organized with something that you didn't know you needed. From the stocked mini-fridge to the quality shower supplies and everything in between, this was an amazing home base to explore the Pine Barrens (a 1,000,000 acre coastal pinewood National Forest) from. This is my favorite Airbnb that I've been to out of the 15 or so I've visited over the years. Not to mention Karol letting me extend my stay by a day past my booking when a friend of mine decided to visit me and check the Pine Barrens out for themselves - she really is the definition of a Super Host! You can't do better for a cozy getaway for a few days for 1-2 people"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol‚Äôs ‚ÄòLittle House‚Äô is clean and cozy and was a perfect spot for us to rest along our road-trip. It is well equipped with all the necessities- above and beyond really. The town is about a five minute drive away with a lovely downtown. Karol was readily responsive to any messages that I sent and check-in was very straight forward
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karol was a superb host. The tiny house was exactly what we needed. It is located in the quiet country with beautiful flowers and wind chimes. We slept so well since it was so quite and we were able to control the heat/ac. Also opened the windows to enjoy the fresh air. The tiny house was very clean and welcoming. Karol provided easy instructions for accessing the home. I decided where to stay based on the reviews and thankfully it was just as we expected!! We look forward to returning again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol's little house had everything we needed and was such a cute space! Really enjoyed all the attention to detail and decorating :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I agree with all the other reviews. The house was cute and tidy. Karol, the host is a great communicator and her suggestions were quite helpful. During our stay, we visited Batsto Village and walked the trails (well kept), went to Berlin Farmers Market (pretty cool), walked the town of Hammonton (restaurant / shops only take up a few blocks but the Mazza & Sons Antique store was cool), saw a Linda Ronstadt tribute show at the Kathedral (highlight of the trip - it is a church converted to a venue) and ate at Joe's Italiano Maplewood (fantastic, authentic). To be honest, when I went on Airbnb website, I wasn't zoning in on staying in Hammonton I only found this place because I entered low to high for places to stay within a couple hours of my home, but I am SO GLAD I found this place (then I planned the trip around staying there). I have already told others about this awesome little house"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I locked myself out, but with some help from the neighbors they were able to get me back in quickly."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Small studio ""tiny house"" space exactly as pictured/ described. 15 minutes from Batsto, 1/2 hour from Camden - great option for access to South Jersey/Pine Barrens area. Nice little downtown just a few minutes away. Marquez Mexican is a great no-frills spot for a delicious and filling meal."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very delightful. Let us extend our check out an hour or two and that saved our butts. Definitely will be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect little house! Karol has decorated it with impeccable taste and provided so many little touches! The surrounding neighborhood is peaceful and so pretty.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Karol's place for a weekend away from Philadelphia and it was the exact much-needed respite from the city. The house was so cozy! We opted to get takeout from one of Karol's recommended Italian spots and bring it back to the cabin for a lovely evening of calzone and cannoli (and movies).
The location is great -- in close proximity to both trails and downtown -- while also providing a level of privacy unmatched in its price range.
Thanks so much for hosting us!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay can not be beat for the money! Great host and great house.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol was an awesome host from start to finish !!!! She helped my wife and I throughout the Airbnb experience and offered us additional help because my wife got sick prior to our reservation. Again Karol by far has been the best Airbnb host I‚Äôve ever had

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Me and my boyfriend decided to get an Airbnb last minute, and Karols place did not disappoint at all. If you are looking for a cozy, get away from the city noises, and just hear nothing but the jingles outside then reserve this place. We are definitely interested in going back again! It was, so far, our favorite Airbnb :)"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I love this sweet place! We come to Hammonton for holidays to see family. This brown building is cozy and welcoming. It has so many nice touches- snacks, tea, water, honey, ample storage room for clothes. It is quiet and private, on a large piece of lovely land, well-kept and warm. The owner is very responsive.
Traveling is not easy. This place feels like a home away from home."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol‚Äôs tiny home was everything we needed and more. It is perfectly equipped and wonderfully cozy. We will be back in a heartbeat if visiting NJ in the future!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karol's location was a really beautiful place down to every last detail. If you have any hesitation about staying here, you can safety dismiss it. The attention to detail was superb and no stone was left unturned. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the room immaculate. Karol is well travelled and really thought of every potential comfort. There were snacks on the nightstand, there were various drinks in the refrigerator. The TV worked perfectly, and you could even login to your own netflix. We went out to a nice local Italian restaurant and brought food back for a late night snack. We were pleasantly surprised that in addition to the microwave, she even had glasses, silverware, and a snack tray for the bed. If you need it, it's probably at Karol's location. Coffee's included. The bathroom was just as amazing having everything from reading materials, to a make up towel to even make up removing pads and q-tips. It was all very impressive. The bathroom is much larger than expected given the tiny home layout and everything is impressively clean with wonderful hot water. Karol was wonderful with communication and getting into the location was super easy with parking right next to it. We really couldn't ask for a better stay and this is truly a 5 star location that we would definitely visit again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place makes hotel rooms look like the middle ages! I absolutely love it here. the outside is quaint & aesthetically maintained, the interior is stylish; rustic yet modern & has all the necessities for a long or short stay. mini fridge & microwave, temperature control, wifi, television & 10+ outlets.. like I said, this place outranks any hotel I've stayed at in the area & I have no complaints! its also worth noting that in my professional housekeeping opinion, this place is insanely clean üëå the host is super nice & friendly too. thank you so much for your hospitality karol!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"An amazing stay!
I know what you‚Äôre thinking. It‚Äôs a small place, is it really worth?
I‚Äôm here to tell you yes.
For the price, you‚Äôre getting a sort of hotel room sized place with just as much, if not more, amenities. Check in was very easy, bed was comfortable, parking free. They have everything you need in there! If I want to nit pick, the onlyyyy thing I can think of is that there‚Äôs no direct path leading to the house, rather it‚Äôs just grass, so be careful if you have white shoes. Outside of that, I loved it here!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful little place with the most amazing host, Karol! This has to be one of my favorite airbnb experience ever. The little house is so cute with all the things you need. From all the amenities to toiletries. They even have a microwave and a portable speaker :) Karol even have great snacks and water and other drinks in the fridge for us. She‚Äôs very communicative and also make sure we have everything we need. Thanks Karol for everything! Can‚Äôt wait to go back when I‚Äôm around Atlantic City :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This guest house was perfect for my boyfriend and I for the night. We were in town for a wedding and we wanted something close by and affordable. Karol was a kind and accommodating host. And the scenery was beautiful! A bit out of the way, so transportation was a bit tricky since we didn‚Äôt have a car with us, but we luckily were able to catch Ubers and get food delivery. I would also like to mention it is more spacious that it seems. It was the perfect size for one person or a couple."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Karol‚Äôs place is like a tiny house and totally adorable. Everything you need in a small space. It was very quiet and peaceful and the bed was super comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Karol‚Äôs tiny home, a perfect and peaceful oasis surrounded by open fields yet not far from charming downtown Hammonton.

The location was very South Jersey (think farms and long stretches of roads) and it was pleasant to take walks around! The house itself was very clean and had cozy touches throughout. Karol had a wonderful guide in the space and a few books and magazines. The bathroom had lots of clean towels and toiletries, and there was a small snack/ drink preparation area that served us well for the length of our stay. Overall, I couldn't recommend this place enough. You won't be sorry!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karols little cabin was everything we had hoped for and much more. We felt wecolme as soon as we stepped foot on the property. The cabin is prestine. Much of what we needed was alrrady provided such as coffee, tea, water, snacks, and shampoo. Karol was very pleasent and communicative. I will look forward to stay in the cabin in the future. Loved everything about it!"

Well worth every penny, honestly wish our stay could have been longer!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House was in a convenient location for my wife and I as she was riding in an MS Ride starting in Mays Landing. It was close to a diner and restaurants in Hammonton. Check in was quick and easy with the code to the lockbox. The house was small but immaculately clean with some snacks, drinks and toiletries. The surrounding area was nice and quiet. I recommend this listing if you want to try something different."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Cleanliness, attention to detail, including having coffee, water, and snacks available, as well as the coziness of the home was much appreciated. Karol was communicative before and during the stay. Beautiful and peaceful overall!"

For a tiny house, there was a good amount of space, things were quiet and I got a good sleep, parking was nice and easy, Karol was pleasant and helpful both in her communication leading up to my visit and when I came across her as I was leaving.

I usually go once a month down to Philadelphia and New Jersey hopefully I can catch it available the next time I come through. Rachel The Host met me and showed me around which was great very different from just renting a hotel where they just give you a key and you find your way. she gave me a tour and let me know where all the information I needed was. Made checking in and checking out very easy.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy little place for our 1 night stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a lovely stay. I enjoyed the peace and serenity of the studio. The working studio part of the place was neat to pear at things like you are in an art class. I grew up around art supplies and this felt like home.

Frankly, there isn‚Äôt much inventory on the South Jersey side of Philly. This property stands out among the few others.
Do t risk other properties. This one‚Äôs a gold standard imho."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Can't say enough good things about Yolanda's house: it's a recently remodeled, nicely appointed, well equipped and comfortable little house that looks just like the photos. The kitchen was very clean, with a nice stove, plenty of dishes, utensils, pots and pans and even a couple of decent knives which is a unusual for short term rentals. Very comfortable beds, lots of towels, and a comfortable couch - plenty of room for 2 or 4 people.
Not shown in the photos was the lovely deck out back with an umbrella, table and chairs and a very pleasant view of nice old trees in their spacious backyard.
We lived in the area for 24 years and enjoyed visiting some of our old favorites like Wheaton Village and Gardella's Italian Deli for the amazing ravioli's. Southern New Jersey can be a bit quirky and fun to explore and Center City Phili, the Cherry Hill area or shore points are only 40 - 50 minutes away, so for a rural area it's pretty convenient.
We'd definitely stay in this little gem again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cozy place. We really enjoyed it

I was thrilled to find this cozy warm abode. From the start, my hosts were ready to answer my questions about the area and my drive to Fortescue from Bridgeton. Although my weekend was centered around the tagging event and looking for migratory birds, coming back to their peaceful place was a gift and another lovely experience in itself. My dog loved it, too! I am looking forward to another visit to the area and another stay at this very special home away from home!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were so happy to find Zane's place. It is like an oasis in the desert, as there are few, if any, places to stay in the area that are clean, comfortable and accept pets. The apt is laid out very nicely with a big tv and well-equipped kitchen, a cozy bedroom and the bathroom has a super shower! Everything is pristine. Plus there was coffee and snacks - a big plus because this place is tucked in the woods, miles away from shops or even a convenience store. They really thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and care-free. It was a little hard to locate because the street number is not prominent but we did find our way and the instructions for entry into the apt were very clear. We regularly visit family nearby and will definitely be back next time."

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great for large family
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We booked this home for my daughter's soccer tournament nearby so we wouldn't have to make the 2+ hour drive from North Jersey to get there for that weekend. Teonnah was very responsive from the beginning and answered any questions I had about the home as well as when we first checked in. It is a very beautiful home, clean, spacious and check in was very easy. It is in a quiet neighborhood and close to major retailers in case you need to get something or go out to eat. The only concern was the home's proximity to the highway (Rt 55). If you currently live or grew up in an urban area, busy road in front or in the back of a home and are use to road noise or it doesn't bother you then read no further. But if you are not use to road noise, then it is something to be made aware of. The highway is in the back yard....meaning from the home's backyard deck to the asphalt of the highway is about 40 feet. It may be a seasonal thing but it is loud. I mean kids could not enjoy the beautiful yard outside because of the cars whipping by all day and all night...the noise died down a little bit around 3am and started back up again around 6:30/7am. 2 of the 4 bedrooms back up to the highway so you will hear it even with the windows closed (windows were closed the whole time we stayed there). It was rather disappointing as it is such a beautiful home and the road noise really put a damper on it for us but as I said before, if it is doesn't bother you then I wouldn't think twice about staying here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, spacious house, nice backyard space, easy check-in/out process."

2019-11-01,4,Group trip,"Teonnah‚Äôs the most responsive AirBnB host I‚Äôve ever had! Her house suited our needs well - a nice big kitchen, gas stove, big fridge and freezer. I will say though that the house was clean but not sparkling. The linens, bathrooms, and kitchen were clean, but there were cobwebs around, particularly upstairs. We also had one person with mobility issues, and the front entrance stairs were difficult for her. The stairs are steep, and there is no railing. The house is just a short drive to the Cumberland Mall!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, quick responses, highly recommend!"

2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication with Teonnah was a breeze. We rented her house for a weekend to visit NJ Motorsport Park. There were 8 of us, and there was plenty of space. The house it's kept tidy, with clean sheets and linens in all the rooms
We did not get a chance to meet Teonnah, but that was not a problem as we had a large group. Theater room and game rooms are a must if you don't plan on leaving the house much during your visit. There is a nice patio area and a good amount of back yard space as well. Would recommend and will try too book again if we are in that area."
2015-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Teonnah had the house well prepared for us, and we had a great time. My colleague and I were in town working at the New Jersey Motorsports track and this was the perfect base and a great place to come back to after a day's work."

The setting is so SO much better than any photos could ever depict. The little sheep and chickens running around were so charming. Dragonflies flitting on the lake. Ducks paddling out to the little island.
The cottage has everything you can ever need for a short term stay. The bed and chair are very comfortable and the linens simple and lovely. Words cannot express how happy and grateful we were to be able to stay with Connie. Thanks üòä"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay at Connie's mini farm was relaxing and enjoyable. The pond was nice and hearing all the bugs and frogs at night was amazing. Easy to get to everything but far enough away to make it seem deep in the country. We will ve back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed briefly at Connie's for a quick stop over while driving through the area and it was perfect.

The Airbnb was quaint and mostly very tidy. The only minor thing was that the bathroom soap holder was full of at least 5 previously used bars of soap just piled on one another, which was easy enough to for me to clean up and replace. All in all, a nice place to stay."

In all Connie‚Äôs place is fantastic!"

My daughter had just graduated from USCG boot camp and was looking forward to soaking in a bath, but there's only a shower. Connie had guests the first night at the pond, so we shied away from it. Otherwise, our stay was comfortable and restful, which was our goal. The accommodations are a good value for the area."

2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A peaceful retreat between points A and B on an otherwise busy vacation. Connie is a gracious, thoughtful hostess. Her place was very comfortable, with lots of thoughtful little touches. I especially appreciate a quality mattress, not a given even in some pricy hotels. We enjoyed a little time with the animals, as well as sitting by the lake, but if you're not outdoorsy, the suite is quite pleasant to hang out in. As advertised a microwave, coffee maker and small refrigerator are included. Kitchen is roomy with a nice table, plenty of plates, cups etc."

It is perfectly placed right between all the major shopping centers, local markets, state park and a Wawa only a few minutes away. I love nature and animals, so this place was perfect for my girlfriend and I. I was able to visit my family and come back at the end of the day to this nature haven. We were greeted with snacks, a pitcher of lovely lemon water, and all the local travel info on the dining table. If you desire a getaway from it all and don't mind some cool animal noises, then this is for you!
Thank you for being an amazing host, you allowed us time and space to relax and be to ourselves which is important for us. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy it all over again. And thank you for the blinking solar lights, they help so much at night to distinguish your driveway, a lifesaver."

2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed at Connie's Place when we attended a wedding at The Grove at Centerton and it was a great experience. The property is beautiful and relaxing complete with a lake and horses. The property is conveniently located if you are attending an event at The Grove or local wineries.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful get-a-way! Quiet and tranquil. Connie is so hospitable and very respectful of your private space. She was there in a minute if I needed anything! Her animals are well loved. Her horse was magnificent. The lake/pond outside the room is a lovely place to sit. I wish I hadn't been there on business so I could have sat next to it for a while.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place with even better hospitality from both Connie and Jen. Very rustic and scenic location, but modern and comfortable amenities.

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Connie's farm is a beautiful, relaxing place to stay. I enjoyed coffee next to the pond in the morning, while listening to the sheep in the field. The space is very nice, with a separate bedroom, private bathroom, and kitchen/dining room. It's in the country, and it's still close to Rowan University and other area attractions. Connie is a great host, and I highly recommend her place!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quite and peaceful place.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Connie is very nice and welcoming. Thank you for your hospitality. Connie‚Äôs place is nice and quiet. Great for a weekend away from the city.

The private entrance walks into the kitchen, which has French doors leading to the bedroom, and another door that leads to a short hallway to the bathroom. The bedroom also connects to the hallway. There is ample closet space and a large chair and a half in the bedroom.
I have cat and large dog allergies and the host was extremely accommodating to make sure the space was extensively cleaned and provided two air filters specially for me. They are very considerate of personal space, respond quickly to messages, and went above and beyond. It was a great Airbnb experience!"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Excellent house
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Catherine's place was amazing. It was exactly what I had pictured. The property private with an awesome place to sit outside and have a small fire. We were there in the late summer so there were lots of fireflies to keep us entertained. The house is huge and has a lot of character. On top of the house being awesome, Catherine is a fantastic host. She is very attentive to her guests and very responsive to all our communications. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Catherine's home is just beautiful and the furniture matches the age and feel of the home. My family and I enjoyed our stay immensely. Catherine prepped the house with extras and she was very attentive to her guests needs. She left helpful notes regarding things to see and do while visiting the area. She also left the ingredients to make smores which my pregnant daughter-in-law greatly appreciated.
I met with Catherine as we were leaving and she was just wonderful. She is very friendly and I can't wait to visit her home again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was very pleasant. The house was very spacious and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in Bridgeton to visit family and Catherine's place was perfect! There was plenty of space to stretch out and we loved all the treats Catherine left for us. Can't wait to come back. Hopefully we'll have more time to use the fire pit. Would have loved to have done it this time but we couldn't fit it in our schedule.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome space for a friend group reunion. The instructions were clear, she was very communicative, and the space (including the outdoor fire pit and porch!!) was lovely!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Love it! To be in town, but have your own space is pretty special:)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed Father's Day weekend at Catherine's place while visiting nearby New Jersey Motorsports Park. The house was really cool with a historic vibe, spotlessly clean, with ample space and amenities. Catherine was also a super responsive and friendly host. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Epic spot for a relaxing and private stay, but super close to everything. The amenities can keep everyone engaged and entertained - when was the last time you actually had a camp fire and made s‚Äômores? It‚Äôs been a while for us!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I stayed here for my wedding weekend, and it was absolutely perfect. The house was so beautiful, and Catherine was so friendly and welcoming from the second we got there. We absolutely loved our stay!"

Catherine was so helpful and was a wonderful host providing us with surprises."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"this house is amazing. the downstairs is a bit cold, but it was 13 degrees outside, and its a grand old home with lots of big windows. catherine was great and responded immediately to all questions. we will definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"I can‚Äôt say enough to fully express my appreciation for this host and her place!
Our thanksgiving plans were upended due to Covid and we weren‚Äôt able to join our daughter, son and his fianc√© in Bridgeton ‚Äî what a huge disappointment! Thankfully, Catherine helped our kids feel warmly welcomed for the holiday, with seasonal decor, sweet treats ‚Ä¶. PLUS she even supplied them with a fully cooked turkey on Thanksgiving Day!
All reports and photos from our kids confirm that the house is charming, spacious, and clean as a whistle. It has all the comforts one needs to feel at right at home and plenty of room for a family gathering. While our kids were at Whiskey Bridge, their car battery died and Doug was kind enough to give them a jump (above and beyond!!). There were a ton of great recommendations that Catherine provided that the kids took her up on from the Green Olive to live music.
We‚Äôd be thrilled to book Catherine‚Äôs home again in the future (hoping we can all be there together as was planned for this holiday)!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is perfect ! thank you Catherine for sharing your beautiful home with us! House is very spacious and clean!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was fantastic!
Only downside that we stayed one night, we would‚Äôve like a longer stay!
House is beautiful inside and outside, looked just like it was pictured, we actually found because it looked like that from the road.
Rooms are furnished with nice touch and plenty of space for everyone!
Catherine was efficient with responds and checking in on us.
We will definitely come back in the future!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! In town for family wedding so we needed rooms and bathrooms for all our family. Plenty of room for all of us! So many little touches made it an amazing stay! 15 min away from our venue was even better. Would gladly stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This site was very comfortable for our family who stayed and for visitors to stop by and spend some time at the firepit. I would use this place again. So much better than a hotel in that it was closer to where I needed to be, and accommodated more family and socialization."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the wonderful home you shared with my family and I. We loved it! It was worth the value . And not to mention the house is huge every one had enough space to spread out and still enjoy each other

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is one we will always remember! We loved the historic and modern mixed decor, the fresh flowers and donuts to greet us, the amenities and full kitchen stocked with all the utensils you could need. Nicely sized bedrooms, cozy outdoor space to enjoy a fire and super easy check in and out process. Catherine was very responsive to all my messages! Definitely a steal for the price and a great choice for us!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is just amazing, the special treats all around the house, food, snacks, firewood, laundry soap and extra blankets and towels were so appreciated.

Catherine is great. She always answer fast, and it is easy to communicate with her."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A group of us have stayed at Grandpa‚Äôs many times over the past few years. Very conveniently located for NJMP. Kathleen is a wonderful host, responsive and friendly. We already have another weekend booked in a couple months."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathleen is an excellent host and the place was very comfortable.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Probably my 5th or 6th time staying here with a group of friends. Huge surprise for me, they got Wifi! After all these years staying here it was a welcome addition. I didn‚Äôt mind disconnecting, but the convenience factor can‚Äôt be denied. It‚Äôs also always the perfect location for what we‚Äôre doing, very convenient to the event we do every November. I‚Äôm always reminded how well appointed and comfortable the house is, especially for a large group. Kathy is always a spectacular host. The property itself is also very peaceful and unique. I‚Äôd recommend that guests just take a quick walk around the grounds to explore. Wonderful weekend and hope to book again same time next year."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Booked a stay at grandpa‚Äôs house for my car club to go to NJ Motorsport Park which was only 10 minutes away. The driveway although it has some divots is still low car friendly and being set back that far off the main road felt safe and secure. Very peaceful and quiet property we had a bondfire and BBQ‚Äôd overall had a very fun time, and it was a great place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay for the weekend. Enjoyed the quietness and nature all around. House was beautiful and had everything you needed for the stay.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great quiet spot for a reunion. Charming old but renovated house with lots of room for all of us. I enjoyed drinking my coffee in the screened-in porch early in the morning while listening to the birds. So peaceful. Kathy was super nice and responsive.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathleen was an awesome host, she answered all my questions when I made the reservation. she also contacted me on the day of the reservation, which was helpful. The house was in a very quiet setting, there were four of us, so four bedrooms was more then enough space. The living space downstairs is very spacious with plenty of areas to lounge out. The house had everything you would need for a great stay. The cellular internet router worked fine for all four of us.
This house is a hidden gem and I would look forward to staying here again given the opportunity to do so.
Thanks for your hospitality Kathleen!
Ray."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpas house was such a great stay! The fire pit was such a nice addition to our trip! Responsive and friendly host, would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place. Well water is something you have to get used to, but otherwise, its very secluded and cozy. The kitchen is great with high end appliances. There are amazing family of wild turkeys that roam the property. There is plenty of space for ten or more. I would stay there at again."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This house was great - very clean, and lots of cozy space to be together (living rooms, dining room, screened porch, outdoor porch) and a well-equipped kitchen, plus four large, private bedrooms for time apart.
We enjoyed exploring Millville, Bridgeton, Vineland, and the surrounding areas by car and bicycle.
The house was a little hard to find from the road, but Kathleen gave us helpful instructions so it wasn't a problem.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this large, secluded home in an area with more to do (restaurants, museums, nature) than you might think."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only thing it needs is a marker that stands out in the street. I went by the place almost every time.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had another wonderful stay this year. We love the laid back, and beautiful setting of Grandpas house for our family reunion. We look forward to another trip to make more lovely family memories in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we really enjoyed our stay. everything was just what we were looking for.
humidity was high for us being from the west coast. unfortunately kicked in our copd. which was totally out of anyone's control.
we would recommend this place to everyone.
thank you Kathleen for your hospitality"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely love Grandpa's House. We plan to go twice a year for as long as we are able. It has everything we need for a visit with family. Kathleen is the best at communicating! I always get quick and thorough answers when i ask anything.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful stay! The property was very quiet but close to all the restaurants and stores we needed. My two year old loved seeing all the wildlife. We will definitely stay again if we're in the area.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place if you're looking for a quiet retreat! Very peaceful and lots of great nature nearby. Kathleen was a great host.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can‚Äôt thank Kathleen enough, for being so responsive, helpful and for letting us stay with all our dogs. House was cleaned very private would definitely recommend to anyone staying in that area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely fabulous place to stay. Exactly what we needed. Very private and quiet. Plenty of parking. Awesome for having the dog. Just perfect in every way possible.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"What a treat to find this gem! We are a small family, who needed a break from the city, with friends, and there is no better spot then Grandpa's house. Kathleen was quickto respond with any questionswe had before arrival and getting us checked in. We had 7 people total, and plenty of space to cook, hang out, relax -all of it. The home is so cozy, beds are comfy we had everything we needed in the kitchen. The grounds are beautiful , wild daffodils everywhere!! Truly a gift to be able to escape the city and just be able to hear yourself think - this is the place. We will definitely come back to this space!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,This was an amazing home.. very warm and family like. ‚ù§Ô∏è my family enjoyed every bit of this place. Highly recommend this home. I will definitely be back to visit.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My family drove from SC to attend a wedding. We did not want to stay in a hotel so when I came across this property in Millville, I booked right away. The pictures don‚Äôt do this home justice. House was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. Fantastic kitchen with plenty of utensils and cookware. It did feel like home away from home because I don‚Äôt think there was one thing that was not provided to make our stay convenient and comfortable. Host was super responsive and location of home was only 15 min. from wedding venue, convenient to grocery store, yet when we were at the house felt like we were in our own private retreat. Will definitely consider booking again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpa‚Äôs House felt like we were staying with family. We loved the home and simple decor. The house had everything we needed. It was a little scary traveling down the long lane to a very secluded area where the house is located, but we enjoyed the woods around the house. We would have liked some curtains downstairs in the living room to close at night and maybe something other than sand leading into the house so we didn‚Äôt track sand into the house and our vehicle. Other than those two things, we were very happy with our stay. Kathleen was very quick to respond whenever we had a question."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We visit this location twice a year and absolutely love it! The kitchen is amazing and has everything needed to feed my army of a family. Kathleen is always just a text away and we really appreciate her attention to us while we are there.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Grandpa's House was amazing! Kathleen was a wonderful host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed another great stay at Grandpa‚Äôs House! This is our third visit in the past couple of years, and we‚Äôre so grateful to feel at home when we‚Äôre in town to visit with our grandparents who now reside in the Vineland Veterans Memorial Home. Kathy is a wonderful and responsive host. We always make use of the fully stocked kitchen (our Thanksgiving turkey cooked beautifully in the oven!) and the outdoor firepit is exactly what we need to unwind from city living. Thanks again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Grandpa's house is a treasure and Kathleen is the most gracious host. We'll be back again and again!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This is probably the 5th or 6th time I‚Äôve stayed at Grabdpa‚Äôs House and it‚Äôs always an absolute pleasure and has everything anyone could ever need. Kathy is the best host and always goes out of her way to answer questions or make sure you‚Äôre having an enjoyable time. Will continue to book on annual basis if money and time allows.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house and great host. Nice to walk around the property and explore different areas. Great porch and lots of scenic locations within a very short drive. We would love to come back and discover more of the surrounding areas. Thanks!!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to get away with your friends and family. A good place to unplug- it‚Äôs quiet and away from the city.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at the house. We were in town for my mother in law's celebration of life from Virginia and our children came in from South Dakota and Sweden. We were only there for a weekend but would have been happy to stay longer. We loved that the house was set so far back from the road and the kitchen was top notch. Kathleen was super responsive and easy to work with. There is no wifi in the house (clearly stated in the description) which was no big deal until we realized that the Eagles-Cowboys game was on
Sunday night! In the end we were able to use our phones as hot spots and watch on computers. Crisis averted. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time! Great place. Will be booking again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and Kathleen was a great host!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful property! The house was very, very nice and Kathleen was incredibly kind and easy to work/communicate with. Would absolutely recommend if you like being secluded!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"5 friends and I stayed at Grandpa‚Äôs House and had an absolute blast! The pictures don‚Äôt do the downstairs justice; it is a HUGE open concept space. One highlight was definitely the large speaker system. Another was the incredibly comfortable beds. I highly recommend Grandpa‚Äôs House to groups of friends who want to enjoy their time together without worrying about disturbing neighbors, or large families/groups of families because of all the sleeping arrangement options. We are so happy we stayed at this gorgeous and comfortable house and only wish we‚Äôd been able to stay longer to explore the grounds. Kathleen the property manager is a delight and is super communicative, which made our check-in and overall stay easy and stress-free."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The place is gorgeous and surprisingly private for NJ as a tourist. Even more impressive when you see the price tag!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,I recommend Grandpa's house. Off the beaten path and still convenient. Priced competitively.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we loved it here! The house is in a wooded area so very private. The house is lovely with lots of room and a great kitchen. we saw deer, turtles, and a woodchuck in the yard. The host was very responsive and nice. it was a perfect place to connect with family.
if we ever return to the area, we will definitely want to stay here again!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Amazing space. House is so big! Love the style and outdoor escape feel you get. View is amazing in winter and summer! Advice: Bring DVDs for family Tv!!! We are staying here EVERY TIME we are in town!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Phenomenal experience
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful centrally located place to stay. Feels like a real home ‚Äî with fantastic facilities for cooking and dining esp ‚Äî and the secluded setting in the woods is magnificent! Do bring your own draining water supply and bug spray. Our dogs also loved it here and we all hope to be back in the future!
2022-07-01,3,Group trip,Very outdated home. The beds gave a few of us back problems for weeks
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Grandpa‚Äôs house was beautiful, spacious, and clean with plenty of room for our family. Kathleen was kind and easy to communicate with. There‚Äôs a coffee machine, but no coffee at the house so be sure to pack your own. Cell coverage was also very spotty if you have Verizon."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Grandpa's House was great! Very comfy, lots of space, great for entertaining and tons of fun!
If you have Verizon, find some kind of wireless internet if you need cell service / wifi.
If you are sensitive to metallic tasting well water, definitely bring your own drinking water.
Would come back and stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My kids came through the door and immediately headed towards ""their rooms"". I love that it is a home away from home where we can be a little off grid and just be family together. This place is great and Kathleen is just the icing on the cake with her communication and above and beyond attitude."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Kathleen is the sweetest host and very responsive. The property is beautiful and a great location for those seeking a retreat or more secluded feeling. The house is very spacious and you pretty much have access to all of it. The price is amongst the lowest in the area.
Cons: Many windows lack curtains/shades, which is inconvenient if you are trying to sleep in. Three of the beds are located in the attic and it was extremely hot in there, even with the wall-mounted air conditioner and provided fans. Bathtub curtain and tiles were either dirty or stained."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best. Responsive host, clean, everything avaliable....exactly as described, no stress.."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place to stay. It was out 2nd time at Grandpa‚Äôs house. We will be back.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 was in town for the 24 Hours of Lemons event at NJMP. With 3 kids, and turning this into a mini-vacation, we decided it would be best to stay somewhere instead of camping out. I‚Äôm so happy with this AirBnB! The house is beautiful and incredibly spacious. It honestly reminded me of home as a kid, only bigger. Everything was clean and we had everything we needed and more. The house is tucked away in the woods so it was also private, as an added perk. It was only about 15 minutes away from the track, so highly recommend to anyone staying in the area for NJMP.
The best part was the turtles and the cat! The kids loved being on ‚Äúturtle patrol‚Äù all weekend as driving up the driveway you have to keep an eye out for turtles crossing. We moved probably 6 turtles total for the weekend, which was exciting for all. There is also a cat that comes around the house, so the kids loved keeping an eye out for her, as well as putting out food and fresh water.
I also have to add that Kathy was a great communicator, friendly and very responsive. It was such a pleasure keeping in touch with her before and throughout our stay.
Looking forward to staying again next time we‚Äôre in the area!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a secluded getaway. The house was perfect for our family reunion. Kathleen is an awesome host.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, clean and all the household items you could need and more! Location was great and close to town but secluded enough that you feel like you‚Äôre really away from it all. Kathleen was very responsive and provided great info on surrounding area and things to do."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet , wooded area , very peaceful, just relax enjoy the views , there are games to play which is nice too"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely love this property. It is close to everything but you feel like you are in your own little world. The seclusion and peacefulness is what makes this property stand out. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Very prompt communications and pleasant to deal with.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Kathleen is a great host. Grandpa's house is the perfect place for a nice weekend getaway with friends or family. I look forward to another stay.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house. Kathleen is wonderful and very communicative! Amazing experience and highly recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house is tucked away from the main road leading you to a quiet area all to yourself. The house has charm warmth and comfort that makes you want to sit right down like it's home.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay. Close enough to stores but far enough from hustle and bustle of city. Amazing view of nature. Lovely bamboo trees!! Everything exactly as it says. Great for families and those who like outdoors. Kitchen was wonderful to maneuver around and cook in, everything you need. Host is so sweet, helpful, and in communication if ever needed. Fully intend on staying whenever I come to town if available."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathleen is a very gracious and kind host and Grandpa's house is a beautiful and stunning house that feels tied off from the rest of the world but is still not too far from easy things like WaWa or Dunkin. The view when you get to the end of the driveway is breathtaking. Amazing stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful time. The house has lots room, is very clean, and the kitchen is very nice. The weather was cold, windy, and rainy but we were so very comfortable inside. We all enjoyed being ""disconnected"" during our stay. We all sat around, played a few games, and talked to each other; a perfect family get-away."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great home, very clean, quiet location. Would stay again."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I love it here. I think this was fourth visit as a little getaway from Philadelphia and I always look forward to coming back. Kathleen is super accommodating and lovely. Thanks again!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Kathleen is absolutely amazing to work with! She was willing to drive completely out of her way to meet one of my family members to show them the house. I reached out with questions multiple times and she answered immediately and was always amiable to anything I needed. During our stay she went above and beyond by bringing us her own towels as our large group had ran out. The property is secluded and my family took some amazing pictures around the house. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Kathleen is the best host I‚Äôve encountered on AirBnB, and they have all been good! The driveway may be a little bumpy but it‚Äôs most certainly worth the couple bumps!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time! Descriptions were very accurate as listed.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I absolutely loved this house! The location is peaceful and quiet. It‚Äôs in the country yet close to town. If you love nature, you‚Äôll love this house. We had a visit from Gus the hedgehog, the Tom turkeys and several deer. There‚Äôs also a little kitty who lives on the property. The house itself has been beautifully remodeled . The woodwork and cabinetry are amazing. The house is very spacious. Plenty of room for families with 3 bedrooms and a huge attic space. Huge yard for family games etc.. Everything you could possibly need for cooking, you will find in this well stocked kitchen. Our host Kathy was simply amazing! Very gracious and accommodating! I loved meeting her! We loved this place so much, we booked it again for next year. Thank you Kathy!!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Communication was awesome between us and the host replied very quickly to all our questions. The location was perfect as we were only a few miles from our event in the Pine Barrens. We would def stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Grandpa's House is cute and comfortable. Kathleen is great! The cell service was a bit tricky but was nice to unplug!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great overall stay, the area was incredibly spacious however the beds are a bit uncomfortable if I‚Äôm being completely honest but the hosts response time and attention to detail is unparalleled."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,The house was very spacious and clean. We had a great time hanging out on the wrap around porch and massive yard. The house was just a few minutes from town. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area.
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"A lovely rustic home on a great property. We enjoyed a restful week in the country with family, just an hour to lovely Cape May, NJ, plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby ( try the Irish Pub in Millville)."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was our 2nd stay at Grandpa‚Äôs House this year, and it was profoundly successful in reuniting members of our family who haven‚Äôt been together in quite some time. The space of this home and property provide sanctuary for sharing meals, playing games around the table, and playing music around the outdoor fire pit! You can expect a fully stocked kitchen with professional grade appliances and barebones furnishings in the upstairs bedrooms. We came across a few ticks during our stay in May, but we did not see a single tick during the wet days of our stay in August. Kathy is a wonderful host and we are grateful for her direct, prompt communication and her energetic spirit. We look forward to future stays at Grandpa‚Äôs House!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Nice secluded place if you want to get away from all the hustle and bustle of the cities :) Communication with the host was excellent. My family and I had a great time. Thank you!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay the fire place was our favorite part.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for a quiet and private place to stay then this is the place for you. The house has been totally remodeled and is geourgeous. Hard wood floors throughout, quarts countertop, nice new showers, and large bedrooms. The small bamboo forest, fire pit, charcoal grill, and ruins are the cherry on top. This is a truly amazing getaway location."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"So glad to be back at Grampa's House. Missed it so much! Kathy is such a gracious and kind host. You feel right at home here. The house is spacious with all of the amenities we needed. We love that the house is peaceful and private, but is also minutes from the friendly local stores. If you want a relaxing oasis, this is the place for you!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Grandpa‚Äôs house! My family all stayed there over the weekend to celebrate my moms 70th birthday and it was a success! It was extra nice that the house felt cozy and almost like you were staying with family. We got lucky to find this!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Spent a full week at Grandpas house, the wife and I and all the kids! It was so close to all the destinations we had planned for our trip. And there was PLENTY of room for everyone! The ruins were so cool to walk and explore! At night when we would return from our adventures we sat on the porch and watched all the fireflies, it was amazing. And our last night we had deer in the yard, so cool! Its a A+++ place to stay in our book!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Grandpas house is the perfect getaway for you and your family. Our host was very communicative with us and it was an overall great stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone.üëç
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpas House didn‚Äôt disappoint. It‚Äôs definitely secluded, if you plan to be gone until after dark be sure to leave the porch light on. The house is clean and the kitchen had everything you need for cooking. It met all of our needs."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a repeat visit for us and it did not disappoint! We were less than an hour from the beach and boardwalk. Our family could visit us and we enjoyed meals together thanks to the large dining room and awesome kitchen. Kathleen was so responsive. We look forward to our next trip to Grandpa's House.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa's house is as described - big, bright, & the ac felt great on the three 90 degree plus days we were there. The kitchen is large, modern & well equipped, bathrooms are clean and updated, the house is rustic w/out feeling too old. We were able to access the river from the property - we drug our kayaks the 1/4 mile or so down the path. It's overgrown but passable for the adventurous - wear boots and use tick repellant (to find this path head back out the driveway about 30' and then it's off to the right.) The kayaking was great but keep an eye on the tides - the access gets very low at low tide. We enjoyed the ruins and the small fire pit there one night. Careful where you park - the grounds are popular with turtles. Check in was easy and Kathleen's communication was excellent. We enjoyed Glasstown Brewing & Cedar Rose Vineyards - easy 20-30 minute drive."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a marvelous celebration with family at Grandpas house. We would highly recommend it for gatherings. It has everything you need. The grounds were beautiful and it was so nice to hear the birds early in the morning. The host is so easy to communicate with and very kind. We really appreciated the fresh flowers and tablecloths - very thoughtful. Not having wifi, was an adjustment, but we were there to spend time with family so it wasn't the end of the world, lol. Nearby East Point Lighthouse park was a nice place to watch the sunset, just magical. Shopping and eateries are nearby, so it is a super win if you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy that is close to everything."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa‚Äôs House was a sanctuary for our family this weekend! It‚Äôs been very difficult to be away from each other for over a year during Covid, and we truly enjoyed our time cooking meals and gathering around the table. The pictures and description are accurate as I expected and received a fully stocked kitchen and dining area along with bare-bones furnishings in the bedrooms. The yard was great for our dog to play catch, and we enjoyed a couple nights of campfires. Ticks are abundant in South Jersey so be mindful that you will encounter them on this land. Kathy is a gracious and attentive host who promptly responded to any questions. Our stay was everything I hoped it would be, and we would certainly return!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,If you were looking for great hospitality and seclusion this is the place for you! My family had an amazing time at grandpa‚Äôs place! Can‚Äôt wait to stay there again next year!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,A secluded house with a great porch for and outside picnic.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Grandpa‚Äôs house. Plenty of room for our 4 adults and 2 children. Loved that we could bring our dogs as well. Kathleen was always very quick to respond the few times we had questions. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Millville was nice. The website gives an accurate description of the property, but to summarize the positives and negatives for us:
Negatives- the yard was a bit run down with collapsed buildings, the porch didn‚Äôt have a railing, the deck was collapsed and wooden slats were just laying in the yard. The sheets/linens could be updated and the bathrooms could use a deep clean. The kitchen table top was not attached to the legs and it was precarious if you put any weight on it. One of the 2 showers started to leak through the floor into the kitchen while we were there.
Positives- it was quite off the main road so the traffic noise was not an issue and it was peaceful. 2 of the bedrooms had king sized beds. There were some toys and games our 3 yo enjoyed. Kathy was quick to respond to our messages and check on us. The price was right for what you get at this property.
Other things- as many reviews state, the water tastes of iron so we brought gallon jugs. Glad we did. There is a cat who lives outdoors on the property."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place was a beauty. very comfortable, clean and lots of space. We will be back again!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Grandpa‚Äôs house is a perfect place to step away from the city or busy life and enjoy the outdoors. The yard is giant and has a beautiful wrap around porch which was perfect during a rain storm one night. Between the fire place and kitchen appliances it truly felt like visiting a family members house. Not only was our stay cozy and fun but Kathleen was wonderful at communicating and made us feel at home. This was actually our second time coming back because we loved it so much the first time.
2021-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"An old house that shows it's age. The water is undrinkable and the furnishings are well worn.
The long, dirt road to the house is potholed and overgrown with brush and brambles, so don't bring your sports car."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely home with plenty of room to spread out inside and out. Just 45 minutes from Philly it‚Äôs the perfect getaway from the busy city, and even better if you have dogs who love to explore the woods. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
However, if you‚Äôre even the slightest picky about your drinking water I would recommend you bring your own bottled water. The house has well water and some of the people in our group couldn‚Äôt take the taste."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,enjoyed the stay
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of space, comfortable accommodations, great kitchen, dog friendly and a five minute drive to the trails!!!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house for groups!
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect for family gatherings or family vacation. House is clean, wonderful and cozy. Property is great for outdoor activities. Absolutely enjoyed not having internet. Private stetting in a quiet area. We will definitely stay here again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Grandpa's House was great for our family of 6. It was so roomy and has everything we needed to enjoy a full week visiting family nearby. It was truly a home away from home and we loved it! Kathleen was amazing about responding quickly to any questions we had. We plan to make it a regular reservation each year.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool house in a beautiful location. The house is really big and would be great for get-togethers. We really appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and spending time in the outdoor spaces. It‚Äôs a quiet area, and the house feels really private."
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"The driveway will definitely throw you off a bit, but don't be fooled, once you get there, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great amount of space and Kathleen's communication is top notch. Couple of tips, you're basically in the woods, so be prepared. Bring bottled water(they're on well water) üëç overall good experience and would recommend to anyone looking for a secluded ""cabin"" in the woods."
2020-11-01,3,Group trip,"Our family loves to cook and we booked this place for Thanksgiving for the updated kitchen. However, the dishwasher had been broken for a month and the piece to fix it 2 weeks late but we were only informed of this the night before check-in.
When I said that I wished that I was informed earlier they owner told me to use a bucket and hose outside to wash the dishes (the weather called for 33f weather). When I said that that was not an acceptable solution the host said ""This is not the Hilton"". On the second day the host offered disposal plates but by that time we already had bought it and didn't want interaction due to COVID.
Besides that, the place was clean and the beds were comfortable. But guests should be aware that:
- The house is next to hunting grounds and we were awoken by gunfire most days at sunrise
- The canoe from the pictures has been broken
- The wear wear the firepit is filled with little wolf spiders, it's actually quite beautiful at night because their eyes reflect back light and you have hundreds of littles eyes shinning back at you like a little light show...my wife wasn't as enthusiastic about it as I was though
Overall, I would stay here for a night to break up a drive but not to relax."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,We were able to accommodate all the groomsmen for my son's wedding and with plenty of room to spare. Everything was comfortable and easy to find and locate. The kitchen was a big plus as we were able to cook meals as needed. Well equipped. This was a perfect venue for our needs. Kathy kept in touch and answered all my questions almost immediately. Would highly recommed Grandpa's House for a quiet get-a-way.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kathleen is great, description is accurate."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to get out of the city for a few days. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"The house was exactly what we wanted. Big, Comfortable, and Exclusive. Our big group had plenty of space to sleep and cook in the big spacious kitchen. We went in the fall and the outdoor scenery was breathtaking. The deer, the turkeys and the occasional squirrel üêø made us feel like inside a Rockwell painting. Would absolutely positively come back and stay again. Kathleen was a great host who was always just a text or call away. 5 stars."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"On the plus aide, super friendly host, amazing kitchen, great secluded home.
On the downside the the near by motor sports park created an annoying ‚Äúangry buzzing bee‚Äù noise for half our sweet time
If you are particular about water, bring your own drinking water we didn‚Äôt care for the taste.
Note to renters, Verizon cell coverage is marginal.
We would stay here again! Beautiful space to visit family and make it fun and relaxing!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,The house was perfect to reconnect with our family it was peaceful and relaxing just what we need it.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was as described, clean and tidy"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,This is my second stay at this lovely home. The property is so large and can accommodate many different types of needs. The house is spacious. Kathleen was an amazing host. She's very sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. I would highly recommend staying at Grandpa's house!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Grandpa's house was a lovely retreat for me and my extended family. We were a fairly large group and there was plenty of room, supplies, linens, places to sleep, etc. We cooked many meals in and the kitchen was equipped with every single thing we needed. Kathy was a wonderful host, lovely, upbeat and responsive and had so many good suggestions for local places from butcher shop to local takout. Bring DVDs - enjoy the lack of WiFi - we enjoyed being a little bit cut off, it was a great stress release! We ventured out to the East Point Lighthouse one day, it was a lovely little quiet beach and you can tour the lighthouse. We look forward to staying there again in the future. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Highly recommended for a relaxing time close to nature.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't beat sitting on the porch in the afternoon, or having your coffee and watching the rain come down. The big open kitchen and dining room worked so well with feeding and relaxing with the whole family. Felt like we were in the middle of nowhere without having to drive far from the city. Would surely visit again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Kathleen‚Äôs place is what a great experience all about, and I would say there isn‚Äôt a second house in Jersey that is more unique than this, and for the price it worth every penny I spent. The house sits deep in the woods that offer a completely secluded experience. At night you will be able to see the night sky clearly surrounded by the sound of cicadas. It is the best option if you want to visit the beach in the daytime while not having to worry about being bothered by others at night."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! The house is gorgeous and sparkling clean. The kids loved the upstairs loft space. Kitchen is well stocked and has beautiful appliances. There is a great screened in porch that you can access from the front porch. Beds are comfy and showers have great water pressure. Only 40 minutes on a weeknight to Stone Harbor! We also enjoyed exploring the bay side and Maurice River Bluffs Preserve. We came right after a tropical storm so, as would be expected of a flood plain, the grounds were very wet and buggy. Wear bug spray in August! The path to the tributary on the property is currently overgrown so you have to be ok with some bushwhacking to get to the water's edge. There is also a really neat bamboo forest on the property. Kathy is such wonderful as a host. Very responsive to any questions and very warm and welcoming. Thank you for making us feel right at home!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Kathleen was terrific in preparation for going to the house. The location was both secluded but also close enough to town to pick up groceries and other items with a quick drive. The house had great character and plenty of space in the yard. Made a day trip to Cape May about an hour away with no issue. Highly recommend the house and will definitely rent again.
2020-07-01,4,Group trip,"I think for the price you can‚Äôt complain! The house is very secluded in the woods and yet 15 min drive away from Walmart, Dunkin, target, etc.! The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 starts was because the bathrooms definitely need a deep cleaning and the house isn‚Äôt actually that close to the lake. From the pictures I thought I could easily find / walk to the lake but I wasn‚Äôt able to find it. Maybe it‚Äôs just me.
Either way I really enjoyed my time here and the host was VERY responsive and understanding."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpa's house is exactly what my son and I needed to take a break from 2020. A large home that feels remote yet right off a main road. There is so much land, animals and everything else a young adventurer of the family would love- with the quiet and serene for the parents. Kathy (the awesome host) replies quickly and had small touches like having a s'more kit ready for us-to roast on the large bonfire pit. I look forwardto booking here again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem for all those looking for a retreat into tranquil isolation. The house is beautiful and spacious, and surrounded by beautiful land. Kathleen is extremely easy to communicate with and friendly. I would recommend this to anyone looking to just get away from the world, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Kathleen is simply amazing. Great communication and the house is spectacular!
2020-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kathleen is a helpful, communicative, and sweet host! We live in Philly and Grandpa‚Äôs house is only 45min away. Yet, we felt like we were in a whole other world!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Excellent stay! Well built and beautiful house on an expanse of land. Several friends as well as the dog really enjoyed the stay. you can‚Äôt beat the value. Plus Kathy is such a gracious host.
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A nice getaway from the city for some quiet and time outdoors! Kathleen was very friendly and available for questions.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend, pup and I had the best weekend here. The house and grounds are very well kept and exactly as pictured. Kathy is an amazing host. She allowed us to check in early to get a jump start on the weekend and answered all of my messages promptly. If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing, quiet weekend in nature this is the place to stay. We will definitely be returning!"
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"Grandpa‚Äôs House is a dream!! There is so much space inside & a large yard that was great for throwing around a football & running around. The fire-pit area was a favorite place for us to hang out. The woods around here are wonderful to walk through (though, as with any woods, check for ticks!).
Kathleen was friendly & quick with responses to any question we had. We will definitely be coming back!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Grandpa's house. We cooked a lot and played with the dog in the yard. The kitchen was very nice, and the yard was large. The space felt isolated and remote, but was actually close to town. Kathleen was very nice and responsive. I would recommend!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a dream weekend at Grandpa‚Äòs house. This place is a real gem, in the middle of an oasis of green, absolutely perfect for a get away and living life at a slower pace while you can! We loved hanging out under the porch, grill, have some family ball games on the grass, listen to the birds (and watch them), and enjoy our evening in the many couch corners of this beautiful interior made for chill-out. Kathleen is the best hope you can imagine, always friendly, available and responsive, and totally into letting her guests enjoy the privacy they need and feel home. The interior design is sober but very warm, giving the just right touch of old-schoolness while being super ‚Äûuser-friendly‚Äú, also with kids (and the kitchen has pretty much everything!). We will definetely come back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is beautifully updated. For such a large house, I was surprised how clean it was. Our adult kids loved having the refinished attic space to themselves. They watched movies from my son‚Äôs laptop on the TV up there. Not sure if that requires a cord of some sort. We would stay again!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"Spent 4 days and 3 nights at Grandpa‚Äôs house for a motorcycle event. This was my 3rd stay in this house. It‚Äôs always a pleasure and Kathy is a great host. We had 5 guys and there was room to spare, the house is the perfect size for larger groups and everyone‚Äôs comfortable. Will try to book the house every year for the same event we enjoy it that much."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa‚Äôs House is a huge, well appointed house in a beautiful and peaceful setting. I met friends there for a reunion weekend and it was just perfect. Kathy was an extremely gracious and helpful host and went out of her way to suggest places to shop and dine.
It‚Äôs a very quiet and private setting. The rooms are large and light filled. The beds are extremely comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a delicious meal in, and it‚Äôs not too far from some great restaurants.
We highly recommend Grandpa‚Äôs House as a retreat and place to relax. We plan to reunite there again."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely large house on a large wooded lot. The kitchen has enough space for a few people to prepare food at once and a huge dining area to accommodate a large crowd. Lots of sleeping space and well appointed bathrooms. We loved the fire pit and exploring the yard with our dogs. The front porch was great for just sitting around and relaxing.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great space for our families to get together, off the road and private with plenty of room inside and out."
2019-09-01,4,Group trip,"The property offers so much more than I expected honestly. Commercial VIKING appliances, the old barn ruins (this you have to see), the massive parcel of land it sits on, the whole place was just cool. The host isn‚Äôt lying when she says you‚Äôll get your peace and quiet. With there not being any WiFi, if you‚Äôre on Verizon or AT&T, good luck getting any service beyond 1X. This isn‚Äôt a bad thing. The fire pit in the barn ruins was perfect for sitting around and playing guitar and singing with my friends. They said the acoustics in there were awesome. If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre looking for, there is plenty of dry downed timber all along the outer edges of the manicured portion of the property and some gloves in the basement to break it up, just put things back where you found them. We had a great time, and I believe if you stay here you will too. If you‚Äôre the next lucky customer to stay there after us, congratulations, you may have inherited 2 bags of ice, 3 Yuengling beers, and half a bag of WaWa coffee."
2019-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I had a great stay with my husband, our two kids (ages 3 and 4), our friends and their two kids (ages 6 and 9). The third floor was *so fun* for the kids, and the grown ups spent a lot of time in the kitchen and on the porch. We all enjoyed the yard, and loved how secluded it felt. We also enjoyed short hikes at the nearby nature preserve (Peeks). Kathy was very quick to respond to small questions I had during our stay."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"My husband and I brought our dog here and we're joined by my aunts and uncles. The house was plenty big for all of us and if any of us had young children, I think the 3rd floor would have been perfect for them! Our dog loved the open space which was very safe and secluded."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at Grandpa's house! This house is located close to lots of activities yet offers a secluded feel which was perfect. The kitchen is top notch and Kathleen is such a wonderful, warm host! Great memories at a truly unique house."

Very friendly and congenial hosts. Such an enjoyable stay. We barely missed the presence of WiFi. Looking forward to another stay in the future."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is in a wonderful location. Close to town yet surrounded by beauty. Large rooms, modern kitchen, open floor plan for kitchen, sitting nook and dining area. Great place to socialize. Cold AC especially in this 98 degree weather.
Good sized bedrooms and bathrooms on the 2nd floor.
I will be returning!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking for an oasis of nature, peace, and relaxation, Grandpa's House is the place to be! 
Keep your eyes and ears open for wild turkeys, frogs, toads, turtles, birds of every kind and the most diverse, beautiful dragonflies.  Kathy is the most gracious, loving, and kind person you will ever meet. Her personality will make your stay a happy one! The home is very airy, beautiful, clean, and welcoming. You will not be disappointed in staying here!  Enjoy!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This property is amazing! The privacy and peaceful setting was so relaxing. We loved sitting on the front porch and exploring the woods. Can't wait for another visit to this unique house!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for a set of racers going to NJMP. Way better than a hotel and only 10 min from the track!! Comunication was top notch and my wife and 2 kids loved the 3rd floor room. There was a Viking range to cook up some gormet food and plenty of room to hangout. I come to NJMP 2-3 times a year and will definitely be back.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house itself is so spacious and nice, the attic especially is such a cool area to play games and hang out! The kitchen is crazy nice, like something out of a commercial lol The porch has comfortable furniture to relax on, the surrounding outdoor area is so lush and interesting to explore, especially if you have a curious pup like ours! Everything about our stay was very warm and welcoming. Meeting Kathleen and her husband was awesome, they're such good people and super friendly with our dog Freya! Kathleen even put fresh eggs from her chickens in the frigde for us. I don't think I've ever tasted such yummy eggs! The whole stay was fun and relaxing, wish we could've stayed longer!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Terrific kitchen for those who like to cook. Our third time back. We'll be back again!
2019-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A nice secluded area that was quiet and relaxing.
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Kathy was so helpful and responsive with any questions I had. She was so kind to let us check in early and stay past the check out time. The house is really great, with an amazing kitchen - which came in handy when cooking for a big group. The fire pit was especially nice to enjoy. I would come back to Grandpa's House!"
2019-04-01,5,Group trip,Another great stay at Grandpa‚Äôs House. Spacious and comfortable! Terrific cook‚Äôs kitchen.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for family gathering
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,Great location if you want privacy and an escape from the hustle and bustle.
2019-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect house, perfect location, and so clean and spectacular for our family getaway for New Years, but that‚Äôs not what made it amazing. Kathleen is the only reason we went after this house so much, and loved it so much. She made everything so simple and easy and made me more excited for the stay by being so sweet and helpful for everything we needed! You are truly and amazing person Kathleen thank you for everything!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The rental process was extremely easy. Kathleen was very accommodating. The home was very clean and was well stocked with all the things we needed.
2018-11-01,4,Group trip,Kathy is an excellent host. The house is great. We had some issues with our stay but she still took great care of us. House is in a wonderful location and has tons of room for large groups and is very cozy and accommodating. Would stay here again without a doubt.
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,Second time staying at Grandpa‚Äôs House and it was great!
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"Quiet comfortable house - lots of space - terrific kitchen (Viking range/oven, dishwasher and refrigerator), loaded with cooking supplies, utensils, etc., huge stainless steel sink and spacious granite counter tops. We had a group for a weekend track event at New Jersey Motorsport Park and the house was nearby and a far superior alternative to hotel rooms."
2018-10-01,3,Group trip,"Fun house on a large property, good for games. Nice open kitchen and dining area for socializing, and a great front porch for relaxing evenings."
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home on a great piece of property. Kathleen was especially quick with her responses and very considerate. We had an awesome time!
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at Grampa‚Äôs house for a race weekend at NJMP and it is very convenient to the track. Older house with new high end kitchen and master bath. House sleeps a group comfortably. Worked well for us.
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"For anyone that needs the perfect, secluded family or group spot to bond at, this is the place to be. Kathleen was so accommodating for me and my family that it legitimately felt like home. This was an important weekend for my family due to a tragedy and this home brought us together in a way that meant so much to me. So, do yourself a favor and avoid the hotel rooms for your group and rent this beautiful home. If I could go above five stars I would."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpa's House worked really well for our family: three couples plus two children. The attic could easily have held more children. The space has been very nicely renovated, the appliances are top-notch, there are plenty of cooking tools, and there is a lot of safe play space outdoors. When we were there, the water had an off-taste -- check to see if that has changed -- you may want to bring bottled water."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, highly recommended"
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Kathy is very sweet and extremely pleasant. She met us at check in and insisted we make ourselves at home. The house was fantastic and provided all the amenities we needed. Open layout, brand new appliances, 3 floors, 2.5 baths and a secluded location for us to rest and enjoy our time together. While at Kathy‚Äôs house we enjoyed going to a nearby sporting clays range, racing go carts at NJMP and played some golf at the nearby Running Deer golf course.
The house was located in a prime location for getting to/from these events very easily. We would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a great place to go to get away and enjoy some more unique activities. Wish we could have had a fire in the old silo ruins but the temperature and humidity were hot enough. The front porch is one of a kind and large enough to entertain all of us when the rain passed through.
Amazing weekend was had by all with nothing but compliments on the place and location from all of our accompanying guests.
Thank you again Kathy. We look forward to seeing you in the future!"

2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice house quiet atmosphere
2018-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a terrific home away from home in an area where lodging of any kind is hard to find. Beautifully restored and updated home with so many comfy touches. Loved the quilts, the gas stove, the incredible kitchen. Appreciated the area rugs which we used as designated play areas for the toddler. Loved the privacy and the daffodils coming to bloom all over the yard. Communication and attentiveness to our questions was excellent. Highly recommend this place for groups and big families."
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a very nice stay at Kathy's place. Grandpa's House was secluded and quiet, with lots of woods and a nice bonfire pit in the barn ruins!

2018-02-01,5,Group trip,Great relaxing getaway...very quiet...no distractions...great for a retreat..
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,"Grandpa‚Äôs house is a beautiful, quiet, and charming getaway. We loved everything about this home.

I can‚Äôt wait to go back."

I've celebrated 2018 new year eve with groups of friends, and I'm very thankful to Kathy for accommodating all of us and providing all the amenities which are listed.
Grandpa's house wonderful kitchen, we prepared barbecue also it has excellent dining area close towards kitchen accommodated all our friends at dining area.
it's very calm place surrounded by green trees and has great space for parking which i didn't find in some of Airbnb houses.
finally Grand Pa's house gave lot of joyful memories, thanks to Kathy."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the kitchen!! Private & secure location. Comfortable rooms & house
2017-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had an excellent experience at Grandpa's House. Kathy was extremely responsive and helpful, not to mention generous and kind. When she found out that we would be traveling with two toddlers, she left out toys for them as well as a gate, which was unexpected and appreciated. The house itself was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. I cannot express how happy I am to have stayed there, and my family and I intend to stay there again."
2017-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place for a family holiday or reunion! Far enough into the woods to feel secluded but close enough to town for resupply or a trip to a restaurant. It was the ideal place to get relatives together for our Thanksgiving. HIghlights are the terrific kitchen with its Viking appliances, the large dining room with many windows, and the rotating seasonal decor which really made it feel like our home for the week. We enjoyed hiking at the Maurice River Bluffs Preserve directly across the river which is an easy drive away, seeing large scale glassblowing at the nearby WheatonArts center, and spending evenings outside around the fire."
2017-11-01,4,Group trip,Kathy was great and the house is beautiful.
2017-11-01,5,Group trip,"Kathy's place was awesome. Very secluded, surrounded only by trees and woods. No other houses nearby which was great for our group. The house was bigger than we expected which was nice and it was very clean, check in was easy and Kathy was just a sweetheart. We will definitely be coming back!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great family place to be. Large secluded place to run around outside and explore the woods.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a wonderful experience all around. The house is big, beautiful and private. We came from the city so it was nice laughing loud together on the porch without worrying about upsetting neighbors. Kathy and Kathleen were such wonderful hosts - excellent communication before and during our time spent at the house, and they were extremely hospitable and welcoming. The fire pit was extremely fun too. Highly recommend, would love to return!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful secluded home with a completely renovated interior. Although to be honest we spent most of our time in the yard or on the porch.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend. Kathy is very accommodating.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! If you are looking for tranquility and living off the grid while still being close to the beach and many activities, Grandpa‚Äôs house will be perfect for you. The charming art district of Millville is just a few minutes away! Definitely check it out while you are in the area.
The house itself is beautiful and spacious. It fit our seven member family with plenty of extra space. We are excited to bring our two puppy dogs the next time around!
Kathy, our host, was exceptional. She was very responsive and welcoming. She shared with us the rich history of the house and the land and the grandpa himself. This will be our preferred vacation destination for years to come!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is large and secluded. There were nine of us staying here for a friends and family get together and we couldn't have been more comfortable. The woods surrounding the house were beautiful and we were lucky enough to spot 5 large turkeys foraging around the house. The New Jersey beaches are an hour away through quiet local roads that wind past quite a few farm stands. My only advice would be to pick up one of those big containers of water on your way here as the house has well water in keeping with the rural atmosphere and it tastes very different.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and Kathy was so helpful! My nieces loved being able to have their own little ""suite"" on the top floor!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible weekend at grandpas house. The property is so beautiful. This is a great place for spending the weekend away with friends or family. From kayaking down the Maurice river to exploring the bamboo forest, this was my favorite Airbnb trip. Kathy is really informative and will answer any questions you have."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was really big and exactly what we needed It was able to accommodate 10-11 of us! When we got in everyone was amazed and very pleased with the place. It really felt like a weekend getaway with friends! We had a beach trip to the Wildwood Boardwalk. It was truly a wonderful place to gather people in. There is also plenty of parking. Overall it was an awesome experience. The housing Air Conditioning was also fantastic!!

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place! Quiet & in the woods, yet not very far from a grocery store, a weekend flea market, and much more. The property was beautiful, necessary incidentals were plentiful (e.g. laundry & dishwasher pods provided), the kitchen was outstanding and well-furnished, and the hostess was very friendly and very helpful. Plus, the price was great! Highly recommend."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa's house is a great place to stay for a quiet break in the nature. The house is clean, big and very charming; it has been renovated and the kitchen is amazing. Super family friendly (kids love the 3rd floor), and Kathleen is an exceptional host. I would definitely recommend!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a magical place to escape from the city. Kathy is so kind and helpful. Beautiful place to hang out and enjoy nature with your friends. Will definitely be back and can't recommend enough!

2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa's place is a treat! Stay here if you're in the area. The kitchen was a pleasure to cook in, the rooms were private and comfortable, and the property is beautiful. A pleasure start to finish. Thx Grandpa!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Grandpa's House was truly the restorative nature-filled trip we needed! My three girlfriends and I spent a quiet weekend enjoying the large lawn, copious trees, HUGE kitchen and plush bedrooms. Everyone had plenty of space and the home was nicely stocked with all the amenities we could possibly need (including a basement full of rain boots for a walk in the woods!). I would highly recommend this place for anyone who needs a refreshing weekend away from it all!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was fantastic. It's a great place to stay for the weekend! We had a wonderful time during our stay. The property is beautiful and the house has everything you could need.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed at Darren's place twice for business. I appreciated the firm, comfy mattress + flat pillow option. (He also had fluffy pillows - but I always prefer flat) the bathroom was cute + the place quiet. really appreciated having the Keurig French Roast in the morning."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable space. Everything you need for a few days away.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As return guests, we love to stay at Parlor in the Pines when visiting family in the area. Awesome hosts provide a beautiful space along with clear communication. They continue their restoration of the property to its pine barren roots, and it‚Äôs great to see the new pine trees grow!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great for long term stays. Very comfortable and worth the price.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,was a great stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed in Darren‚Äôs place after a wedding. It was just what we needed. His directions were very clear. The place was private and quiet.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,THIS PLACE WAS ABOVE AND BEYOND BEAUTIFUL . So peaceful and private like a get away in the woods I felt right at home with the decor in the home was outta this world . If you‚Äôre looking for a peace of mind and serenity book here asap .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Darren was very helpful with the check in process and room was just what I needed. Will definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Darren is a wonderful host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place!! I almost had to cancel because of unexpected travel changes and the host was gracious enough to offer 1/2 a refund if I needed it. I was glad not to, because this place was really cute! The neighborhood is quiet and there were turkeys everywhere :) thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed the night before a track day at NJMP, was a perfect with it being so close.
Place was exactly as described and Darren made the whole stay incredibly easy with his very clear instructions, not to mention if you have any questions he‚Äôs extremely quick to respond. Loved the flexible (any time) self check in as well!
I greatly enjoyed my stay there, would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Parlor in the Pines was perfect. I was in the area for business and visiting family so this was perfect for me. The neighborhood was quiet but close to stores and restaurants. The bed was comfortable, sheets lovely. The bathroom was super nice. Parlor in the pines was clean and comfortable. The coffee was a great addition also. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for our needs: affordable for a one-night drive to our destination. the price is very fair, with extras and few. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was hot, the place was quite clean (but a lot of dust on the lamps / fan and full half cans), self check-in easy. As is often the case for budget housing, there are small compromises to be made... 1- the accommodation consists of a closed section of the house itself (as indicated in the listing) and the soundproofing is minimal (we can understand the words of conversations in the kitchen and the host was conversing with friends until about 1am), but closing the corridor door leading to the bathroom helps a lot. Also, the mini fridge is quite noisy. 2- The central air interchange allows us to feel the food cooked by the host. But, it was perfect for our needs and budget."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the bathroom and as well the room. Nice and comfortable will definitely visit again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I only wish I needed more than one night ..it will definitely be my go to spot when I'm in the area ..beautiful clean peaceful and comfortable
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a lovely stay! I was looking for a peaceful getaway and that's what I found. The area was beautiful and had lots to offer.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sweet surprise. When I pulled up to the house, I wasn't sure what to expect. Once I opened the door to the space, I was so pleased. The space was recently updated and nicely decorated. Well laid out. Very clean. Comfortable mattress. Table and chair where I could do some work. Nice large bathroom. I thankfully did have control of the room temp. Slept like a baby. Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"A place most convenient for one night stays for business or young adults looking to stay 1-3 nights. ‚ÄúParlor in the Pines‚Äù is a place a little around the backroads and what may feel homely on the inside, the place can give an almost isolated feel that can make one nervous.
For the inside, not having access to a thermostat made things a little uncomfortably warm when sleeping. That and the one ply toilet paper are the only gripes I have with the Airbnb as everything else was provided for with standard kitchen items and tv. Plus the small hallway with the history is a nice touch.
Just a warning for families with small children, we had music played by the host guess which was loud at times. So little tykes or toddlers who need naps in the mid afternoon/early evening could be little disappointed.
Overall and okay place that was suitable for two young adults who were out of the house for most of their stay. Okay"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy to communicate with and understanding if arrangements change.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for my boyfriend and I for a weekend getaway! Clean, quiet and convenient to many attractions around the area. Would definitely return for another stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a quiet neighborhood a few minutes from Route 55, it was a perfect stay for me. The space was spotless and comfortable. I always received timely replies to my messages. (Also I love the smell of the peppermint soap ^u^ )"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our racing weekend at NJMP. It was exactly like the pictures. William was a great host and making sure our stay was going well. I loved the personalized note that was left. My only regret was mentioning to people at the track. I wish I kept this place a secret.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great visit and stay at this property. We traveled with 5 adults, 2 toddlers and had plenty of space and private rooms for all of us. The owner also provided a baby gate to keep our kids safe from the stair area and door access. The only very minor issue for us was the fact that there was no bath tubs to easily wash the kids, but thankfully we had other family that lived in town so we were able to work around that. The property isn't a typical house but still felt like a home to us and everyone thoroughly enjoyed watching planes take off and land. The owners were very attentive without making us feel bothered and they stocked the house well with essentials and extras. My only suggestion would be to maybe add a pod type coffee maker and toaster for easy quick breakfast but definitely not necessary, as the property is close to wonderful restaurants and convenience stores. We hope to be able to stay again in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is a nice place that is very close to NJMP
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"William‚Äôs home was perfect for our NJMP race. You can see the track from the front door. His home presents exactly as the photos show. It was spotless, homey, and has a huge television. The beds are very comfortable and each bathroom has a toiletry kit with everything you‚Äôd need.
William was also a fantastic host. He was very communicative, proactively reached out to us, and made sure we had everything we needed.
We will certainly stay here again in the future if we find ourselves at NJMP."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the kind of place you don‚Äôt want to leave a glowing review, because you want to keep it for yourself. But truth is, William‚Äôs place was the perfect spot for an event at NJ Motorsports Park (NJMP). His place is 6 min away, and from the kart track, you could look across the airfield and see it if you knew where to look.
It‚Äôs a converted FBO/airport office, with a plane hanger out back. It was quiet and had good views of the airport. The place was like new; everything was perfectly clean, with bedding, bath and kitchen amenities that were as nice or nicer than at home! Beds were great, slept well. Giant TV, lots of comfy seating in the Pilots Lounge, and a pool table!
Williams place is not what I‚Äôd call fancy, but very nice, perfectly home-y, perfectly clean, perfectly comfortable, and perfectly situated. William was helpful and responded quickly when we chatted - couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
Will come back for our next NJMP event, if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt beat us to it :)"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I stay at a lot of Airbnbs. This one was different. It looks like it was an office space that was converted into an Airbnb. The home is at the end of a long road at the local airport. There are no other homes in the area and a fence that runs along the property at the end of the tarmac. If you are an aviation fan....you will be thrilled. The decor is all airplane/helicopter motif, which is cool. The place definitely gives you an office feel with the overhead florescent lighting and drop tile ceilings. It was clean. The beds were decent. The blinds light filtering so you can still see the blinking lights of the airport. No planes fly at night, so don't be worried about noise. This as a great place to stay if you are planning to go to the speedway or motorcross tracks in the area. Plenty of room for your motor toys if you need them with you as much of the property is paved/part of the airport so I could see that as a plus. Awesome breakfast place at the airport was a plus. Host was great"

2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay to prepare for and attend a wedding nearby, as we didn't want to drive back home to the city after a lengthy and fun-filled evening. We booked Tiffany's and it was ideal in location, with a yummy pizzeria take-out near by for pre-wedding snacks!
Very quiet and clean, with a lovely smart TV for later on after the event! Large and roomy, with a comfy bed and nice kitchen.
