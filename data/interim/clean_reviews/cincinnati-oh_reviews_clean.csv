2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came for the swing and it was fabulous, very unique. House was clean and easy to park .Check in was easy . We were only there for a night , but it was great fun to use the swing , the house is a piece of art . The only criticism I had was the area around the house was ok, not great .

There was lovely music playing on the stereo system when we got there. The large space was uniquely decorated with Mark's touches of art throughout, including a small gallery in the lower level. He had provided coffee and some breakfast items in the pantry.
The centerpiece swing was fun! Who doesn't like to swing?!"

Swinging is my happy place, ever since I was a child and I was so excited to be in the space with my kitten and mom.

From booking with Mark months ago for intentional rest and throughout my arrival and stay it has been a beautiful surprise! This was a birthday treat for myself and I will live more and swing more because I chose to stay here.
The photos are excellent. I was welcomed quietly and allowed to be present with the art of enough. This place is a gift that photos only introduce.
Again, thank you Mark!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures don’t do this place justice. This is not just a place, it is an art exhibit and experience that you are a part of. The more time spent here the more details emerge. Staying here is an activity in and of itself. If you were even slightly considering it do stay at this place. Mark is onsite and has thought of many little things to make the place more comfortable and welcoming. Since it isn’t really located next to anything he was very helpful in recommending places to check out and explore. My wife and I can’t wait to return on our next trip to Cincinnati and are excited for his next project."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend this experience. I was not the one who chose to stay here and am usually skeptical of a gimmick… No gimmick found, real deal for sure! The design elements and craftsmanship were absolutely amazing as was the swing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very special place. We felt honored to be guests there. Thank you for sharing it!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark was an attentive host. Pictures were accurate. Clean inside. The swing was fun and entertaining. It is necessary to have a car. There are areas nearby that you would not want to walk to at night. I’d recommended this place for anyone wanting an art experience and ponder the interior design.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Swing House was a wonderful experience! We had such a special stay and will cherish the memories forever. We are so happy this masterpiece could be shared with us.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,So glad to finally get a chance to stay here. The house is so much more than pictures can convey. The space is peaceful and calming and of course really fun with the swing. We loved the nice lighting options for a quiet time before bed. Mark thought of all the nice little amenities you could want from small breakfast items to extra blankets. He was super responsive to all communications and we felt safer knowing he was close by down the street. We usually sleep with a box fan so we missed having the noise and close breeze but the eye masks left for us were a great touch. Overall a fantastic and very satisfying stay for our one night in town.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The most unique place to stay in Cincinnati, it’s an experience on its own. The attention to detail in every corner was great to discover, the art gallery down stairs is a brilliant touch to a normally unwelcoming space (the basement). If you want to escape the mundane this is the place to go. I planned a whole trip to Cincinnati just to stay at the SWING HOUSE. It was well worth it! Can’t wait to go again"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cool space! Everything is as advertised and Mark welcomed me to take a glance at his next project, which I might stay at next, but the swing house will hard to top and I’m convinced that Mark can and will do so. 10/10!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a place… We picked this house for a mini honeymoon. Amazing doesn’t begin to cover it!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! The swing house swing is a blast to use, little touches of charm and art all over the place and the cabinet had cereal, granola bars and the fridge had almond milk so very very considerate! Mark even let us see his current project the stair house which is amazing! The bed was so comfortable and due to upper windows not having blinds, he left eye masks on our pillows and ear plugs for the noise, but that wasn’t bad at all, other than getting woken up by birds each morning. Great place, well worth the cost and the experience is unlike any other Airbnb we have ever tried! Infinity stars!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Mark is a great host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark is a kind and courteous host. Very easy to communicate with and more than reasonably accommodating.
Evidence of his creativity and talent is abundant throughout the Swing House. You’re absolutely staying in a piece of art.
All listed accommodations were accounted for and then some. There was nothing we needed that wasn’t well stocked and available in the space.
The bed is incredibly comfortable. The shower has great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The A/C works VERY well. Streaming services/TV/WIFI all worked flawlessly.
The back yard space is larger than the listed photo makes it look.
Eye masks and ear plugs are provided for light/sensitive sleepers, but any noise or natural light we experienced was not enough to disturb our sleep.
Check in&out were both very simple and painless.
& of course, the swing was such a fun thing for our inner children to experience. Very secure and has grip so you aren’t sliding.
I can’t recommend this stay enough. 🙏🏻"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"There is nothing more to say other than this place is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, full of relaxation and nostalgia. You simply must experience it for yourselves, even just for a night. Bring a book, some wine, and let yourself be present. Thank you so much, Mark."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my third stay at The Swing House and it won’t be my last. It’s such a calming and meditative space. If you’ve been trying to heal your inner child or inner artist or inner self, you’ll likely find some peace in this space.
Mark also let us look around the Stair House next door and I cannot wait to see the finished product.
While in the area, check out the cold brew at Mom ‘n ‘Em. Delicious."

We enjoyed the basement art galley and videos. Much time was spent looking at everything in main floor of the house. From the ceiling, walls, furniture, and more, there always was something new and wonderful to discover. The house is as advertised and very clean and pleasant. All listed amenities were provided. The bathroom is quite nice, the bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen well equipped. Mark is a great host. He always responded quickly to any message we sent. We hope to return again!"

So well thought out and every possible thing we needed was already there for us!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark was kind enough to let my new husband and I use his space for our small wedding. Hands down, THE BEST Airbnb I have ever witnessed. My guests were very pleased and had a great experience. The Swing House has its character and charm. Something about it felt so nostalgic. You can tell a lot of planning, time and effort was put into this beautiful space. It truly took my breath away when Mark showed me the first time. I was in awe… and still am. The art was stunning but so simplistic. The bed was fantastic and the sheets were very comfortable. The kitchen was stocked and had everything we needed. The basement was perfect for our ceremony and we will never forget you swing house!! Don’t walk, RUN to this place then swing your hearts out !!!
Thank you Mark for hosting our stay. A memory that will be cherished for a life time!!"

We cannot wait to see the next two projects he is working on! Peace Out, Greg and Heidi"

He was very responsive,helpful, and friendly! The space is exactly as described. If you’re ever in the Cincinnati area, this Airbnb is a must stay at location! We were in absolute awe of its beauty!"

Mark's vision was something to be hold and upon walking in the first time and expecting the amazing scene, both of us stood awestruck for a time and then when touring the place again felt awestruck at Marks work. This will go down as one of the most amazing stays we have ever been to through Abnb and weve stay at alot.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Whether you're passing through Cincinnati or looking for a memorable staycation, The Swing House is an exceptional and memorable spot. What an eye-popping monument to human creativity and imagination."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,STAY HERE!! this airbnb is absolutely magical & something I’ve never experienced before. We were in awe every time we walked back inside. Such a beautiful house.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous house and experience! What a unique way to experience art and a wonderful overnight stay! Exceeded our expectations!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot! A bit of a hiccup with check-in but Mark went above and beyond to make up for it after the fact.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! What a great piece of art this little house is! We loved our stay there!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a beautiful experience at The Swing House during a road trip from St. Louis. Check in was simple and Mark was so accommodating and great with communicating expectations, suggestions, and information about the house and surrounding property. The home is near touristy things as well as neat local spots. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to visit again someday!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is what it’s like to live inside a work of art. It’s a beautiful, fun, enthralling space to rethink the world and everything. A simple thing like swinging on a big rope swing becomes almost transcendent with music blasting and moonlight streaming in. Go, enjoy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The Swing House is one of a kind! Immaculate vibes from swinging on the swing to exploring the art in the basement. Mark goes above & beyond to greet you when you check in. Absolutely loved staying here and will definitely come back to stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A masterpiece. Every detail was perfection in simplicity and splendor. Can’t say more about how incredible the experience of of stay here was.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is just stunning! My only tip is don't plan anything else exciting to do during your stay, because you won't want to leave the house! We were in town for Blink and were so torn between staying in and going out! I expected it to be pretty cool but I did not expect it to feel so Zen like and completely peaceful. It is so much more than a place to sleep... It truly is a work of art and would highly recommend it to anyone needing a recharge. Order some food and bring some nice wine and just relax... And the swing..... So much better than I could have ever imagined! By far the best AirBnb stay we've had and we've stayed at some pretty fun places!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is a dream come true! There are so many culturally enhancing things to do, see, eat, and drink in the area. But I also caution people to accept that they’ll want to spend hours and hours in the house absorbing the art. After 48-hours I was still finding surprises of art installations I hadn’t seen at first.
I also recommend being prepared to fall into the pace and meditative space of the swing. I spent many hours on the swing and ultimately needed a pad to sit on, gloves for my hands, and a thick shirt for where my arms engaged the rope. It is very worth it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible. Very clean. Thank you Mark for the opportunity to experience your art and enjoy your space.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I had an incredible stay at the Swing House! We were here for one night celebrating a birthday and it is definitely an experience! We can’t wait to see the completed Stair House Mark is working on next door!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks, great time."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the awesome innovative and carefree atmosphere created by this artists masterpiece!! Awesome relaxing stay, wonderful host we will definitely be back !"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Magical stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Literally just stayed in the house and listened to music. Didn’t even realize there was a tv. Swing automatically turns you into a kid again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark was an excellent host that met us when we checked in and took the time to explain the property to us. Mark also let us go through his next project, which we are looking forward to staying in. The Swing House speaks for itself, it was an absolutely amazing place to stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect arrival to departure. The space is magic and can’t be truly described without visiting for yourself. So much thought has gone into the space and nothing has been left undone. Literally every inch is intentional. The photos don’t do justice. It’s an incredible experience and well stocked, as well. Thank you, Mark, for allowing us to experience it."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"this unique gem is a perfect spot for a getaway. The relaxing music that plays when you walk in down to the symbolism had me captivated the moment I stepped inside. mark was a great host, I can't wait until the stair house is ready 😀"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful night here. If we are ever back in Cincinnati we will absolutely be coming back here. It was so peaceful and such a beautiful place to be able to stay in. I truly would come back to Cincinnati just to experience it again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Swing House is a live-in exhibit that meets every sense from the acoustics and sound system to the textures on the walls- every inch of this space is well thought out and masterfully crafted. The Swing House is close to great eateries, parks, and attractions. A great spot for couples and artists needing a drink of rest and inspiration."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean. The bed was comfortable. The swing was so fun.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This had been on my bucket list for over a year and I finally got to stay here. The pictures of the place are gorgeous but they don’t do it justice. I actually gasped when I walked through the front door. It is truly one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed in. A true work of art and a masterpiece to say the least. Not to mention Mark is an exceptional host and made us feel like we were friends rather than just guests. I highly recommend!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying here. Mark has curated such a beautiful experience. Everything was spotless and the amenities were much appreciated. We hope to be back on another getaway!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was in a perfect location. Close to Great American Ball Park and OTR. We walked back from Great American Ball Park in 30 min. Nikki was very kind and friendly.
I would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location close to all the things I wanted to do in the city. Easy hosts, clean lodgings, highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got a severe bus delay issue before arriving, Vinod and Nikki kindly gave an instruction for my late check-in. The house and the surrounding area is very peaceful, I felt it’s totally safe even at night time. The room was super comfortable and considered for the guest. they sufficiently provided so many things I needed. I would say this place is much better than any other inn or hotel having a same price. Highly recommend staying here if anyone has a plan to visit Cincinnati!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was by far the best airbnb we've ever stayed at! the hosts were very accommodating and friendly. they had some free food like bagels and cereal. they also had drinks for sale. it felt like a luxurious experience for a really good price! also much cheaper than other airbnbs we've stayed at that were much worse in quality. my boyfriend forgot his sunglasses when we checked out, and the host messaged me an hour or two later before we even noticed and told us we could come pick them up. very good service. these hosts are experts and seem to really care about giving their guests the best stay!"
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,Really great hosts! But needs some work for sure. Not at all what we expected based on the listing. Smelled moldy/musty. Not really safe to walk around the neighborhood.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Will stay here again when back in Cincinnati!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Suited my needs perfectly. A bit loud upstairs with kids but peaceful at night. Wonderful hosts with a hip place in a cool neighborhood. I would return.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vinod and Nikki are such thoughtful and responsive hosts! They sorted out my parking permit in no time and were so considerate of the nature of my visit. This was one of the easiest bookings I’ve ever made and I would be happy to stay with them again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The AirBnb space was great. Place was very clean with a lot of amenities, with more than most places I’ve been to. The location is also very close to downtown and in walking distance of it. Hosts were extremely kind and responsive to any questions I had. Overall, I had a fantastic experience staying there and would love to stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place👍🏽
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thank you so much!! Hope to return soon!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very responsive host who will do whatever it takes to give you a good stay! My requests from our first stay in January resulted in Nikki upgrading some of the furniture and concessions available for purchase. Part of the interior is a little rustic in feel but it's very roomy, comfortable, functional, livable and secure. Also, there's secure parking right in front that they code in your license plate for approval with the city. It was easy to walk to Memorial Hall OTR for our concert and an easy drive to restaurants. Nikki and Vinod will make you feel very welcome and taken care of. Excellent hosts!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Very clean and perfect for a weekend stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely big space and exactly what I needed for a quick pit stop while in town for a concert.

Bed comfortable and amazing heated blanket !!
Thank you for a lovely stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here. The neighborhood was very cute and felt safe. It was nice to park our car and enjoy the city on foot and using the free street car. Incredible location! Vinod and Nikki have made a cute little getaway in a somewhat unfinished basement space, if you are looking for luxury, look elsewhere but this space has everything you could need. We loved the pool table, darts, and having our own fridge and living space. The bed was so comfy!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect last minute stay.. I liked the wine and the sodas Nikki had to offer saved me a trip to the store.. definitely was clean and comfortable
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was very lovely. In the home owner's basement. Private bedroom with TV. Shared kitchen space for the other private bedroom. Great for an overnight stay. Nikki was lovely to talked to. Will definitely look to stay again, if available!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was close to the center and also nice neighborhoods. Everything that was needed was taken care of and it would have even been possible to play billiards. Unfortunately we had bad weather and it was very cold. Since it is a basement apartment, it was also quite stop there. However, there was a heater that helped. The landlady was very nice and friendly. She was easy to reach and quick to respond. One parking space was also available. The place was as described. Thanks very much."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great find just a couple of blocks from OTR. Comfortable, clean, and spacious. 2 bedrooms, large rec room with pool table and minibar, and a kitchenette with cooking surface. We had everything we needed. Hosts were responsive and helpful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and value. Had fun playing pool and darts.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is classic Airbnb; a great use of a space to house guests in a comfortable and affordable rehabbed neighborhood residence. The rooms are in a quiet and cozy basement, that is easily accessible, clean, and cozy. The bed is wonderful and the shower hot and strong. I particularly enjoyed that this listing is walking distance to Over the Rhine and near good restaurants, nice parks, and interesting buildings. The neighborhood is quiet. I only spent one night, but wish that I had longer to stay and would like to come back. The hosts were very accommodating and communicated well. If you want an affordable, comfortable, unpretentious, and clean place to stay in Cincinnati, this is it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,it was a pleasure to stay at your place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Vinod and Nikki's place was perfect for us. It was in a wonderful location, they allowed our dog and their place had a wonderful vibe.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"You won't find any hosts friendlier than Nikki and Vinod! They reached out upon our arrival and welcomed us personally, visiting for a short while with them and their sweet children, too. Nikki had lots of helpful feedback about the neighborhood including a good Lebanese restaurant where we got carryout. The free street parking was secure and right in front of our door.
Vinod and Nikki will take care of any need or concern you have so don't hesitate to book with them. We are already booked with them for another stay in April."

There is pew in the pool room but no couch which we only noticed when we put our daughter down for a nap in the room.

Close to downtown and they were super quick to respond. Highly recommend their space to rent!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My only complaint is that my trip was too short!! We loved the converted church! It was unique and quite charming. We played a quick game of darts, which was great. If we weren’t in town for a concert we would have played a little pool, as well.
We want to explore Cincinnati a little more and we will definitely be staying here again!! 🙂"

We will stay here again in the future."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Stay was for night after a Reds game with my company. This listing is only a 25min walk away from the Ballpark. Sure you can hear their young child running around upstairs but it wasn’t a bother. I will 100% look into this listing again if I’m ever in the area! Thank you so much!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay close to downtown Cincinnati. Well equipped Appartment accessible with key code. Short walks to all spots in the City. Quiet neighborhood. Awesome hosts.
An Overall great stay. Being able to use washing machine and dryer gave a great opportunity to reset.
Lots of items available in the kitchen."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was decent. There was a noticeable dog smell when you walked in. Which okay whatever the plan was to only stay there during the night anyways. In the shower there was visible mold in the bottom of the shower and the smell of mildew. After the daily festivities and it was time to go back for bed the room was very hot, the host turned the temperature down slightly but it was still too hot to sleep. We ended up driving to Meijer and buying a fan just to blow hot air around the room and try to sleep. They did reimburse us for the fan but that was an inconvenience. Also, if you are planning to hopefully sleep in; there is a child that likes to ride a toy around on the floor above your room so you will not be able to sleep in. Overall it wasn’t a terrible stay just some noticeable things that I found. I do recommend they get a separate thermostat for that area that you can control from your room."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place!!! Great value for the price. The surrounding area felt safe, the apartment was pretty spacious and clean, and there was lots of extra food/drink available (not to mention a pool table!). Would definitely come back here!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quite affordable for being your own unit and close to downtown. Not the quietest place you'll stay, as the upstairs footsteps were somewhat pronounced. I would stay here again despite this. I liked the location very much and the unit had some nice little goodies like chocolates and bagels."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I never met the hosts, but it was a comfortable place. Easily walkable to Over-the-Rhine, placid, and they provide quite a bit for guest in terms of the amenities. I was just here for a day."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Vinod and Nikki's home meet our needs perfectly. Their place would be my first choice the next time we are in the area.

It's a typical basement apartment. My only feedback would be to run a dehumidifier and maybe put a ceiling fan in the room. It got very hot when we were there. The box fan helped, butore airflow would be nice. Would definitely book again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Vinod and Nikki were able to accommodate me at the last minute and I was grateful for it. The space was easy to get into and cozy. It is a basement apartment in an older building so it’s a little musty but that’s to be expected. The hosts were very responsive and even gave me great local recommendations. I appreciated the little details that they provided. The neighborhood felt very safe and was within walking distance of trendy Over-The-Rhine. Overall I’m glad I had the chance to stay at this listing.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Vinod and Nikki are wonderful humans first and foremost! They are extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful; and the place they host is one of the best-bang-for-your-buck Airbnb's I've ever experienced - right downtown, walking distance to everything Cincinnati has to offer (and just ask Nikki - she'll tell you everything the Queen City offers!), while yet located in a quiet, safe and historic neighborhood. Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Solid stay, easy in and out. Lots of room to spread out, extremely useful for me! Very relaxing after a long drive. Loved the record player, gave me the idea to go score some vinyl nearby.
Quiet for the most part, sounded like they were caring for a young child. It wasn’t a bother for me at all, I’m used to it with my young son so it felt like a slice of home life to me!
I will definitely stay again, when the time comes around! They have a basic setup, but really have it down for the casual travelers. Only wished I could had hung around loner."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent folks & excellent place— everything was exactly as described, with extremely easy self check-in.
The very easy-going and friendly owners, who do everything to make sure guests enjoy every minute of their stay there, always respond quickly and stand by to help.

Thanks a lot for great time there, Vinod and Nikki !)"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is THE place to stay in Cincinnati, whether you're a solo traveler or in a group! Fantastic location, in walking distance of OTR and downtown Cincinnati, and the space itself is well-equipped with whatever you might need during your stay. Can't speak highly enough to Vinod and Nikki's attention to detail! It's a bit chilly throughout the space since it's in a basement, but if you're visiting during the colder months, there are plenty of extra blankets and a space heater to keep you comfortable. The heated blanket on the bed was particularly cozy! Vinod and Nikki are attentive hosts and fast communicators. Highly recommend!"

I’d stay again if needed."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is low on frills but high on value. We were in town for a convention and it was super close to everywhere we needed to be in the city. The street felt safe and quiet, and we loved seeing the city blooming in spring. It's a basement apartment so it's a little dark and not super cozy, but it was perfect for our busy weekend. The hosts were very kind to accommodate some last-minute changes we asked for, and all instructions were clear and reasonable."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time in Cincinnati and this was the perfect spot to stay. Great neighborhood to walk around and explore the area. Vinod and Nikki responded very quickly whenever I had a question. Much appreciated of the hospitality
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great. Neighborhood was absolutely fantastic, huge fan of the sights to be seen on a morning run. The space is large and piecemeal. Comfy bed, nice shower.
It is appreciated that they have a coffee maker and offer a Continental style breakfast. I was momentarily frustrated not being able to get the hot surface to turn on to cook my meal prepped breakfast, however they left out a few Nutrigrain bars which were enough to hold me over. Loved the place."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in Cincinnati for the last leg of a very tiring trip. This home was exactly what I needed. Settled sleeping room and enough of a kitchen that I would have had no problem making a simple soup and sandwich meal. Breakfast and caffeinated beverages were provided too. The chocolate candies were a special treat. The neighborhood had restaurants of all $ levels and ethnic varieties within walking distance. I walked a few blocks for a diner of falafels and fixings.
Vinod & Nikki were in contact with me before I had reached Cincinnati, welcoming me and ensuring I had a city permit for parking my car. I felt well taken care of the entire time I spent in their lower flat."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very kind clear and easy! cute unique amenities. perfect little basement dwelling.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town for a Bengals game and couldn't have been happier with the accommodations. The property was exactly as described, and we were delighted to find that in addition to the extra amenities detailed in the listing (which were already more than what I'd consider standard, like toiletries, breakfast items, etc.), they even had an adorable minibar by the billiard table stocked with local craft beers and an honor system cash basket! Such a cute touch! We were incredibly grateful for all of the recommendations, from the general tourist recs in the standard communications to specific brunch spot recommendations that we requested. I would both recommend their listing to friends and stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to downtown and the place is spacious and the hosts are very accommodating with snacks and bottled water in the fridge. We will look for this place again when we come back into town"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Vinod and Nikki were super accommodating with check in and always quick to respond! Over the Rhine is a cozy, quiet, quaint part of town and very walkable to downtown! We came up for a Bengals game and it was only a 15min walk to the stadium! I would definitely look to see if Vinod and Nikkis place is available the next time I come to Cincinnati!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We would defiantly stay again. Very nice homey place that is close to downtown. Walking around the area was safe and quiet.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Couldn’t fault it, was perfect location and amenities for us and the price is great. Great hosts in a lovely city I would 100% recommend."
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,Super location and easy check in. No sitting area to relax in and bare bones kitchen. Couldn’t control temperature in apartment.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our third time staying! We love the spacious bottom floor and easy access/parking. Nikki &Vinod are so kind and responsive! They always put me at ease. I cannot think of a better Airbnb that have stayed at!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,would definitely stay again :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW!! Me and my partner stayed here for a show and it was absolutely amazing! Firstly, Vinod and Nikki are absolutely lovely and extremely helpful if you need suggestions! Secondly the location was absolutely AMAZING!! Everything is so close you could walk everywhere but even if you drive, the parking is extremely convenient and easy at Vinod and Nikki’s as well as the rest of the area! 100/10 the stay was lovely and everything was so warm and cozy with many blanket options! Will definitely return :)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! We were a short drive away from most anything we wanted to do. Nikki and Vinod were very accommodating hosts, even leaving breakfast options!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay that is well within walking distance of everything you can imagine downtown! Vinod and Nikki will always answer the phone if you have any difficulties or questions. They have a clean and well kept place for you stay. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and will be back next time I am in Cincinnati! Easily 5 stars guaranteed
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at this spot. Super close to everything, the hosts are easy to communicate with and the check in/out was seamless.
I think it is important to note that it is the basement of the hosts house and you will be able to hear them and their children talking/walking around. Did not bother me, but I did not see any reviews talking on that so felt it was important to note. You will hear them.
The location was perfect, price was wonderful and the hosts are very easy to communicate with.
I enjoyed the little touches they had of the breakfast/snack options and having coffee.
The pool table and record player was a fun little addition!
Would come here again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you consider the free parking and the fact that this place is within walking distance to everywhere cool, it's an amazing value! And on top of that, it's private, comfy and is stocked with everything you need to help economize on food while you are in town (small refrig, microwave, some snacks). I would gladly stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second stay and we love the location in OTR. As a repeat guest we can highly recommend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a prime OTR spot! The pool table and dart board were so fun and relaxing, and I don't often say this but the BED WAS SO COMFORTABLE (it came with a heated blanket!) This spot was lowkey and lovely, and we would recommend it for anyone looking for wonderful hosts, a laid back vibe and a great location!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Vinod and Nikki are fantastic hosts. The property is in a safe area conveniently close to many places around town. Vinod and Nikki were excellent communicators and made check-in and my stay in general a total breeze. I really appreciated the privacy that this rental offers along with the complimentary breakfast snacks and water the hosts provided. There is also an honor system mini-bar in the pool table room, which I thought was a very thoughtful touch. Would definitely recommend."

The hosts communicate quickly and have breakfast options available. Self check-in is super easy. Great value too!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a rad spot! Even better than the pics! Will def be back. Cheers!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the Carriage House in early May. The place is beautiful, comfortable, and served as the perfect home base for wondering around OTR and Cincinnati on foot. The unit is gorgeous, we really loved the aesthetic of the interior - the shower and bath are as good as they look in the pics. Waking up to all the natural light that floods the bedroom and birds chirping was amazing and stepping out into a brick cobble stone alley covered in vines is the perfect way to start off your day."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot in OTR. Everything is realistically walkable/accessible. Bar Saeso was very cool. Everyone in town loves it! Christy was very fast and efficient getting back to me about anything and everything. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Coming back to Cincy next month and will likely book again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chris' AirBnB was BEAUTIFUL! Great location, easy parking, easy to access, all the accommodations one would need. They were extremely responsive. Loved every minute of our stay. Absolutely give them the HIGHEST recommendation!!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While the pictures I viewed online were absolutely breathtaking, I was even more blown away when I saw this lovely home in person. Everything is immaculate and love the creative touches all over the house. The Taco food truck and the Bar Saeso right next to the carriage house enhances the experience, making our stay really fun. The bathtub is a cherry on top and everyone must take full advantage of it. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I highly recommend booking this gem of a place."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House is a perfect spot to call home while exploring all the great places in downtown Cincinnati. Walkable to great restaurants, shops and parks. The space is roomy, stylishly decorated and very clean. Parking is just out the door and very easy. There’s a great bar with a taco truck and patio right next door. The hosts were great to work with and everything went very smoothly. Would recommend highly!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home in a perfect area. Everything is walkable and we enjoyed a drink from Bar Saeso next door each night. Christy gave us the heads up that there would be music from their patio until 10pm, but it wasn’t loud and actually gave a nice ambiance. Given that the bedroom is upstairs, it was no disturbance at all. I can’t recommend this place enough - don’t hesitate!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Great host!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Carriage House was a great spot for couples and socializing. The pictures are an accurate expectation of the space.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing as can be!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House is just as pictured and described. It felt very luxurious, comfy, and clean. The bathtub was incredible and the water piping hot. Christy was so prompt in her responses and answering any questions. As others said, parking is tight, but awesome to have a free place downtown. The location is so convenient and close to so many great food and drink places. The included bath amenities, cooking items and utensils, and extra linens were lovely. Our stay made for an excellent last minute weekend away!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean,convenient, comfortable.
Nice spot for business travelers as well."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you stopped to look at this place, just go ahead and book it. The Carriage House is a beautiful apartment with a stylish kitchen, cozy and open-spaced bedroom, and a bathroom straight out of Emerald City. The hosts are fantastic and hospitable. With a bar 10 feet from your doorstep and a whole block worth of activities down an alley, this stay was exceptional on every level."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful!! Loved the location. The parking alley is a bit narrow nice to not have to pay for parking. I recommend a sleep mask due to the sky light. But overall the experience was wonderful! Will definitely stay here again.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay in Cincinnati. Clean, stylish, great location, and Christy is a great host! I will book this house again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing and beautiful place to stay! My girlfriend and I spent the weekend there and we’ve already said we’d stay again next time we come to Cincinnati. So many things to do around the place. Kitchen was beautiful, bathroom was beautiful. Loved every second of our stay."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Let me say this! This place is a must! The pictures show that it’s beautiful but in person OMG it’s beautiful! This place was very clean and neat and in walking distance of many places. My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday by just getting away and chilling out and this was well worth it. We will be back very soon definitely!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely. We will stay again. It is so cozy and I imagine in the summer it would be so cheerful.
Tons of windows and lovely light. The bed is amazingly comfortable and smells beautiful.
We made dinner and stored our food in the mini-fridge with no issues.
Having Bar Saeso next door is such a great perk, so if you're like me and staying there with kids, you can still get some great drinks just steps away.
We chose this spot because we know the area but there is still so much to explore. the weather kept us inside most of the time but I want to stay again when we can enjoy the area as much as we did the Carriage House."
2021-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A luxurious stay!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. This place is a total GEM, I almost don't want to tell too many people about it ;) Christy was such a responsive, friendly and helpful host. I will be back for sure."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is absolutely amazing!! Great hosts!!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful, romantic weekend at The Carriage House! The space itself is beautiful--just like the photos--and it's in a great location. Just a short walk to restaurants, shopping, etc. Check-in was very easy, and we appreciated the clear instructions left behind by the hosts. A few things potential guests should note: 1) The parking spot is in a narrow alleyway, so getting in and out is a little challenging (but not too bad!) 2) This guesthouse is right next door to a bar (which we did not visit but looked very nice) that has outdoor seating. If there are people sitting outside, you will hear them. 3) If you're staying during a colder month, the heat definitely rises to the second level, but does not reach the bottom floor as well. However, none of these small things really affected our stay very much, and we truly enjoyed our time in this beautiful place!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is EXCELLENT! Beautifully designed as indicated in the pics. Very clean and well-kept. Great accessibility to OTR food and activities. I highly recommend staying here!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time here. Still 5 out of 5 stars. Extremely clean.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing, it was the perfect place to spend thanksgiving week. Spacious, so well designed, super comfortable bed, incredible bathroom, just great."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the airbnb all other airbnbs want to be when they grow up! Top to bottom, this cozy carriage house does not disappoint. The bathroom is definitely the star of the show; if you're not using that tub, you're missing out. Also loved the new addition of Saeso right next door (also designed by the host). This was the perfect spot to stop at the end of the night!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space was perfect. Christy was an awesome host and was able to respond to any questions I had in a matter of minutes. HIGHLY recommend this gorgeous house.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the bathroom for relaxing in the tub! All around stylish, spacious and clean. Perfect for a weekend getaway. In the heart of it all, not secluded so a little noisy. The thick drapes made it cozy and allowed me to get great rest -comfortable bed too! Parking was tight in the alley, but my minivan did fit. Thanks!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely space and perfect location!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location with gorgeous decor. Wonderful communication, going above and beyond. Easy check in and check out. Perfect stay!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 5 nights and felt very comfortable at the Carriage House. It was very clean and had all the conveniences and comfort of home and more. The design and layout are open and refreshing, and the finishing touches are top notch. The Bedroom is large and the bed is amazingly comfortable. This is one of our favorite places to stay! We walked the nearby pedestrian bridge, and just steps out the front door is a cute and quaint place called Bar Saeso, which you must check out! Amazing cocktails. Our host, Christy, was attentive and easy to contact if we needed her. We will be back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well maintained, pictures are accurate."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Gorgeous space, every detail accounted for! Perfect location. Every room was immaculate and well designed. I wanted for nothing, from soaps to steamer everything I needed was on site. Can’t wait to come again, if you get the chance stay here!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Pure class. Exactly like the photos.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really loved the style of the apartment and the the space in general. All the rooms were large and it had a great feel. It was stocked with all the essentials and the kitchen was amazing. It was in a nicer part of OTR and close to downtown. Would definitely stay here again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing experience at the Carriage House! The styling is stunning and the home is located within walking distance to many restaurants. Parking was very convenient and the host provides great, easy to read instructions."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space and area is close to adult bars and restaurants. The carriage house is immaculate and romantic for a night in. The claw foot tub is spacious and the shower is huge. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christy's place is a hidden gem in OTR!!!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little spot for a staycation getaway. The atmosphere was lovely, Christy was fast to respond, and the bathtub is great. Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is the perfect place to stay in Cincinnati for couples, friends, or a small family. It is super close to amazing restaurants like LouVino and coffee shops and about a 15 min walk to Fountain square and Findley Market. This airbnb was the cleanest I have ever stayed in, seriously! The big bathtub and walk in shower was perfect to end the day with. Everything is decorated and styled with charm and modern touches. We loved just sitting in the living room/kitchen and drinking some wine and watching tv in the evening or listening to music, which they have a great speaker btw. You also get to park in the private alley right next to the house, which is such a huge perk in downtown Cincinnati. I hate trying to find parking and it was nice to just pull and leave the car with no worries. We can't wait to stay again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful space, feels nice and cozy. It’s also in a perfect location to explore the city and it’s nightlife"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great mix of comfort with beautiful design. A great space to enjoy being in whilst being in a great location to explore the city. Highly recommended.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and space. The amenities are perfect and make for a very relaxing private getaway. Christy was very responsive and helped us out whenever we had any questions. Location was near lots of food options and easily walkable. Such a great stay!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was awesome! Just great communication with Christy. The living room/ kitchen area is great for having people over and entertaining them and they also have blinds on the windows for privacy for the alley when people walk by and such.
The location is actually prime. Near enough to be close to all the cool restaurants and bars but far enough away to have some nice quiet and privacy. It was a great time. Totally perfect for a little weekend getaway ."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's carriage house is a truly beautiful and stylish retreat. The space is airy and full of natural light, the decor is elegant and very much of the moment, the bed is wonderful, and the bathroom has great water pressure--we very much appreciated the hot shower during our snowy visit. There are thoughtful touches throughout, and Christy is very responsive to requests for more information. The lodging is within Cincinnati's bustling OTR district, and also just steps from the attractive Pendleton neighborhood, with great breweries and cafes. Parking isn't an issue, with options in the alley that abuts the house, as well as a parking lot just beyond the door. Folks who don't get up early should be aware there is a significant constuction project underway within the next block, but we had no real issues with construction noise. If you have a chance to book Christy's carriage house, do so!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and a very cool place to stay. Big enough to have some friends meet us and socialize. Fantastic location within walking distance of several restaurants and bars. Easy access to all the key areas downtown. Easy parking and loved our morning walk to grab a Sunday brunch! Would highly recommend as a great place to stay to enjoy Cincinnati!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! It is one of the best places I stayed in Cincinnati
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, comfortable place! My husband and I absolutely loved our stay. Sparkling clean and beautifully decorated.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Spotless. Interesting. Upscale. Contemporary. Hidden gem.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Carriage House was so lovely. The space is swanky yet homey. Every detail is thoughtful, and we felt like we were at a grand hotel. As an AirBnB superhost myself, I have a critical eye, and I give this place an A+. We wished we could’ve stayed another night. Pro tip: if you can back in the alley for parking it’s a safer exit when you’re ready to leave."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,5 stars all the way! what a special place- will be back!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked The Carriage House for photoshoots and it was even more gorgeous in person! The location is great as it is in walking distance to some of my favorite OTR spots! There is plenty of parking available surrounding the house, check in was nice and easy and the house was sparkling clean. All of my clients were in awe when they walked in. The space is so well thought out and it makes you feel like you walked into a catalog! I am looking forward to the next weekend I have booked!"

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is unbelievable. The pictures looked amazing, but the actual space is even better than it looks. The whole house is so thoughtfully designed... don’t even get me started on the bathroom. Pendleton is a great neighborhood - close to OTR and pretty much anything you’d want to do in Cincy. You’re a quick walk down the alley from coffee, beer and biscuits. Can’t wait to stay here again. 100% recommend."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely terrific space. Gorgeous design, all the extras including coffee, tea, granola, fresh fruit, great bath products, fluffy high-grade towels, pillows, etc. I really loved the beauty and great condition of everything, including great parking!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To call this place stylish is actually a gigantic understatement—it’s really stunning. The proximity to OTR is unbeatable—so many great restaurants and bars within a few minutes’ walk! (The neighborhood can be a little bit noisy here and there, so keep that in mind if it’s a problem for you.)"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the Carriage House for our wedding weekend. We wanted a place that would look great for photos and be centralized to our city (Cincinnati) and venue (Northside). The photos online are great, but the place in person is even better. The entire house is tucked away in the alleys of the city making it feel rustic and almost like walking the streets of New Orleans. The interior is beautiful and cozy. The bathroom upstairs is absolutely gorgeous. I know that is a weird thing to review but, seriously, amazing. And the bedroom is quiet, spacious, and the bed is insanely comfortable. Would love to stay here again when we can. Hosts were very responsive and welcoming. Would recommend to anyone looking for a fun place to stay in Cincinnati."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Carriage House was a great place to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary! The decor was romantic and luxurious. The bathroom was everything you could possibly hope for and more. We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity presented itself! A beautiful find near the heart of OTR.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed over the weekend, and loud music was being played the majority of the day and night but that doesn’t take away how stylish and clean the property was. Location was great and bed was super comfy. Christy was a very responsive and thoughtful host. Overall a 5 star stay."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christy’s place is just as stunning in real life as the photos show, and a delightful space to wake up.
Decor was phenomenal- every last touch, from the plush sofa to the luxurious bedding.
It was truly the ultimate space to host a few friends for dinner. And the location was perfectly central with easy alley parking, and great cafes, restaurants and nightlife in walking distance. On top of that, Christy was an incredibly nice and gracious host that I had the pleasure of meeting at the end of my stay.
I have visited dozens of Airbnb’s over the past 6-7 years and this is easily one of the nicest. Highly recommended. Thank you Christy!"

Wish I could put a 10 star ! Especially for communication. I’m in the city often and I will definitely be back again if I’m staying around this area. Thanks again!"
2019-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"A very stylish place perfectly placed to walk to all sorts of neat spots. The bathroom is awesome and the king bed is super comfy. Not so much the cozy weekend get away we were expecting, but this would be a great meeting place for friends that didn’t live in the same city. The host provided lots of sweet touches- the face wipes, granola bars, etc. Thank you!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Christy's place was AMAZING. So beautifully decorated, clean and in an awesome location. We will be staying again."

If you have any questions or concerns she makes it her priority to accommodate your needs."

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely GORGEOUS and in a perfect location to walk to everything in OTR! Check in was so easy and the apartment is full of extra touches to make your stay special and easy - super soft blankets, a Bluetooth speaker, nice toiletries, and fully stocked spices. Christy was so responsive and such a pleasant host. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so amazing! It was spacious, beautiful, and in the best area. Parking was easy and I was able to check in myself. Christy had the best local recommendations. I will definitely be back to stay here again when I come to town for work!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience and nice house!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is so cute! This was my second visit to Cincinnati and I wanted to stay in OTR where all the adorable bars and restaurants are. The location could not have been better for exploring the area- you can walk to absolutely everything! Inside the house is beautiful and sparkling clean. It feels like a luxurious hotel suite on the inside disguised as a quaint historic carriage house on the outside. A hidden gem in the middle of the city. Good coffee, parking, and Christy was super helpful and quick to respond to my questions. I will definitely be back!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is the best place to stay in Cincinnati hands down. Awesome location, super cool design, comfortable bed, easy parking, all the amenities. Why anyone would stay in a hotel when you can have a whole luxury house to yourself in the coolest part of the city is beyond me. Definitely stay here."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House was an unbelievably beautiful space. The location is perfect for all areas of OTR and Pendleton, also a scooter ride away from downtown or the banks. It was amazing to have parking right outside, and we were able to cook all meals at the house. The bathtub was a wonderful addition to our lovely stay! I’d very much recommend this space for a downtown Cincinnati weekend getaway."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"First and foremost: if you're thinking about staying here, DO IT! Christy responded with lightning speed to my request, and made me feel welcome through every step. From private parking, to easy check in, the moments leading up to our arrival were a piece of cake! The first time opening the door and stepping in-- WOW! The photos are exactly what you are getting. Pristine space, gorgeous decoration and set up, and the whole apartment just feels like luxury! It was a little paradise in the heart of OTR, and was a great little weekend stay-cation for a Cincinnati native. The giant bathroom and bedroom were perfect for a romantic night, and the little personal touches made it feel like a second home. Do yourself a favor and experience this beautiful place!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space! I chose it for the location downtown near popular restaurants and museums. We were able to park for free which is a bonus because parking downtown can be a challenge. If you don’t need a car, it’s easy to use Uber/Lyft.
The bedroom and bathroom are spacious and come with great shampoos, conditioners and soaps.
The living room and kitchen area is very comfortable. I really enjoyed the stay!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an awesome property! If you are looking for luxury than this is the place. Communication with Christy was perfect. I called her twice and she answered. Not having to leave a voicemail is great guest service. Also texted her a couple of times and had a reply within minutes. We had dinner at Boca and I highly recommend it!
2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous and historic carriage house. Beautiful touches really enhance the experience. Within walking distance to so many fun places! Thanks for having us!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WOW. That's all I can say about Christy's flat. The best location in Cincy with the absolutely GORGEOUS apartment. Winning combo. Christy is an incredible host with very quick responses. The personal touches to the apartment really made the place feel like home. Easy check in and out (which is perfect for those arriving a bit later) and easy to find with private parking. All around this was an amazing experience. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Cinncinnati. Thanks Christy!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect. Peaceful. Pristine.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Drew’s space was beautiful! The view was absolutely gorgeous. The pictures don’t give the space the justice it deserves. The steam shower was exactly what was needed to relieve some stress and rejuvenate. Perfect for a couple’s getaway.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had 6 ladies stay when in town for a concert; it was very clean and cozy. We enjoyed the home and their attentiveness!The 3rd bed is a futon/couch not very comfortable.
Also the stairs to third floor very steep, was not an issue for us at all but those renting should be aware."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The home was something else! loved the archite and the breath taking view. Really great for couple get away.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent Home. Thank you

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Amazing! Great location and a fantastic space. I visited for my sister’s graduation with my parents and my nieces. It was a great hosting space for us to be able to hang out and visit with our family.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Space was absolutely beautiful. Would definitely stay again, we had a little issue as there was no parking in the driveway as advertised - but we were able to find parking on the street. Drew's team was very responsive and came addressed any issue within 10 minutes.
Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place. Will definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely enjoyed our stay. Everything was clean and the kitchen, especially, was well stocked."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Drew’s! Gorgeous, unique apartment with stunning views. Looked like the photos! Would stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Drew is seriously a 5 star host. Every property is immaculate. When booking within the city I always look for his properties first! Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great rooftop patio with comfortable seating. Decorated beautifully and comfortable
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second of Drew’s listings we have stayed in, and as always the attention to detail in his properties is truly top notch. This unit is absolutely stunning, and every amenity you could need for your stay is thought of! Will definitely stay again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Drew was a great host! Commutation was great and air bnb was exactly what we thought.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most beautiful house. The views are beyond amazing. We got ready here for my wedding weekend and it could not have been a more perfect day.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view of the river and close to downtown Cincinnati. Perfect place to stay.
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful townhome and great common areas for a group. For a group of 6, it was a little unclear from the listing how many beds there were - the 3rd bed was a futon that would have only slept 1 person, so the 6th person had to sleep on a couch. Not ideal, but we still enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great host. Responsive, honest and spot on."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful home to enjoy a short getaway in Cincinnati. Drew was amazing and quick to respond. Everything was a breeze to finding the location to getting in and enjoying the great A/C. Wish we could have stayed longer. Everything was clean. Beds were comfy and I didn’t even have to use my own pillow. Definitely recommend and will be back! It was too hot to enjoy the roof top, but it is certainly a great view."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home near downtown Cincy. Several restaurants and bars within walking distance. Gorgeous views. Beautiful interior design. Incredible kitchen with amazing gas range. Parking in driveway which is awesome for this area. Very short drive to ball park or Paycor stadium. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice property with outstanding views. It is nicely furnished and tastefully decorated. Everything was exceptionally clean, and the bedding and linens were top notch.
But several fixtures leaked, including the tub in the master bedroom and the sink in the second bedroom. The master bedroom also was very light at night, which made it difficult to sleep, primarily because the curtains and shades are practically see-through, and there are no curtains or shades covering the door going to the balcony.
While the house is pet friendly, be prepared to walk your dogs several blocks to the nearest patch of green space."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a 5 star ai r bnb!! They offer nothing but the best and don't have to do much at check out.. but the views is awesome.. it really is a get away that's very peaceful with the best decor you will see. And they have some good reads i found my self reading Saint Laurent at 3 in the morning lol 1 of my fav designers.. but yes this place is everything.. then the ROOFTOP just ends the night perfectly
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a beautiful location! We truly enjoyed our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a fabulous stay at this place! Beautiful condo, true to the pictures, well stocked, super comfy beds, extremely clean, great neighborhood, fantastic views from the roof as well as the other wonderful outdoor spaces! Would absolutely stay again next time we are in Cincinnati!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, great location. The layout is so cool!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful place
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was fun to stay in for one night, lots of stairs, so you will get a workout going up and down. The bathtub was leaking. The stairs to go up to the rooftop were very sketchy and me and my mother were both scared to go up there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous spot with amazing views! The home is located in a very nice residential area adjacent to a large park system and my favorite art museum. The house itself was very spacious with lots of indoor and outdoor space to lounge. We loved the deck off the kitchen with views of the river. Shower/steam room was a nice touch and the bed was pretty comfortable.
There are lots of steps with the set to the third floor (master bedroom) being very steep. Not an issue for us but something to be aware of is you have any mobility issues."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome stay at this home!
It is absolutely beautiful and very unique.
There are many places to just sit and relax, including 4 outdoor spaces and 2 inside living room spaces. The rooftop deck has amazing views of the Ohio River.
The kitchen is clean and has a giant range to prepare meals on.
Having 2 full bathrooms is ideal. The furniture is very comfortable as well as the mattresses.
This home is fully stocked with supplies, linens and towels.
The location is very quaint and quiet.
Drew is a great host and very responsive. Communication is prompt and thorough.
We were able to catch a Yankees, Reds game at the ballpark which was a short drive away.
We travel a lot for business and this home made our stay very pleasurable. We can’t wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a joy for me to spend several days here working on writing I’m doing with beautiful view! I’ll be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful area , great views ! Condo was decorated beautifully and exceptionally clean."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely hands down the most amazing Airbnb I have ever stayed in and I hesitate to say that as I don't want to lose any opportunity to book in the future. Fair is fair.
The amenities were exactly what we would look for in a five star hotel.
The architecture was clever and functional with constant discovery and the views were breathtaking. I am hoping to learn the name of the architect. The home was THAT beautiful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing. Every level of the house was breath taking. Can't wait to stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing AirBnB!! We were only there for one night & regret not having more time in this beautiful place! Quick 7 minute Uber to the Ballpark & hands down the rooftop is the best place in Cincinnati to have your morning coffee.
Drew is a great host & the place is better than the picts and description. One of the best we have stayed at."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning! Loved it!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with great views. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"pics dont do the house any justice , it was a real nice cozy spot , if you ever did cabi trips with friends , it kinda of put you inthe mind of a setting like that !
i will be renting from drew again when i come back !"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Drew’s place was amazing! Killer views and cool neighborhood.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible view. Beautiful home.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Yeah this is one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in, and we travel all over. This place was just so cool, the rain head shower, excellent kitchen with outdoor deck and grill, the living room area and beautiful master. Absolute top notch. Hoping we can stay again in the future next time we’re passing through Cincinnati."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, well appointed home. Home has great entertaining spaces, layout lends itself to having space for 2 groups (i.e. kids and adults) to enjoy separate leisure spaces, nice views, great outdoor spaces, and a responsive host.
Note: This home has a lot of stairs. The stairs from the foyer to the 1st living have an average rise. However, the stairs to the third floor, where the master, master bath, and main living area are located,are particularly steep. Those with mobility issues (walker, wheelchair, etc) may find this listing difficult."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing home! Gorgeous views, beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. Drew was a wonderful host- immediately responsive and accommodating. By far this was the nicest Air BNB we’ve ever stayed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, great view. Stayed one night but the amenities were adequate."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The apartment was beautiful and fully stocked for cooking. We had a great time with our dog and hope to be back again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous one bedroom loft. It's on the 4th floor but worth every step. Immaculate, nicely furnished, great shower and super comfy bed. The decor is top notch and there is natural light a plenty. Great blackout blinds too, I slept so well. Perfect for a couple."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to see a soccer match, and this place was within easy walking distance of the stadium. We were only one block away from catching a free street car system which allowed us to see all of the Over-the-Rhine area including all the way down to the Banks. The location of this place is perfect.
As for the apartment itself, it is absolutely amazing. It is worth every step of the four flights up to it. Easy directions to get in, and Harman was always quick to respond. The beautiful brick walls and sky lights and bathrooms and comfortable bed made it so homey and welcoming. There are extra blankets and towels. There is a large walk-in closet to put your suitcases and clothes. The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, utensils, etc. Not that we really used anything as we ate out for every meal because we wanted to explore and experience as much as we could, and it didn't disappoint. This place is, well, perfect. I wouldn't change a thing about it."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous space, clean and in an amazing location. The stairs are definitely a hike but worth it for the great space!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space is perfect for a long weekend in Cincinnati. It is minutes to basically everything in over the Rhine and the views are nice. The stairs to get to the 4th floor are a lot, but it was not an issue for us even after running the marathon"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in the OTR region of the city. Close to everything and the parking spot was great bonus
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space and within walking distance to many restaurants. bars, and the market. Be warned of the stairs, though! They are alot when carrying luggage up. Parking spot a real plus."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find/ access, felt homey within the neighbourhood"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay in Cincinnati! Harman’s loft was absolutely gorgeous and very conveniently located. Having a reserved parking spot was very helpful, although we barely used our car because everything was extremely walkable. The loft is also about a half block from the free streetcar access, which we used many times.
The loft itself was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. The building is gorgeous and full of character! Harman was a great host and was very responsive and helpful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely simple. No issues with the check in or check out. The apartment has a cool, industrial loft vibe with the brick walls. It’s on the 4th floor so there is a nice view. No issues with my stay whatsoever. Thanks."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet area and lovely interior. Great view at the stadium light. It looks like a lantern from the bedroom. Clean and actually useable cookware in the kitchen. The host is very communicative.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great location. We could walk to several restaurants and bars. Harman was very responsive. We were able to check in early to avoid some bad weather. The only hang up is that the loft is on the fourth floor with no elevator. It was hard to get our luggage in and out. But, we made it work. Overall, we had a great experience,"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harman’s loft is stunning! It was exactly how she described it and looked like the photos. It’s spacious, pretty well appointed, and clutter free. It has 1.5 baths, which is great! Harman is a very kind and considerate host who was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Amazing views of Music Hall and TQL Stadium. Walkable to great restaurants, shops, coffee, parks, etc. I’m originally from Cincinnati but moved away in 1992. When I visit family here, we love staying in OTR. Harman enabled me to see parts of Cincinnati that were not safe to visit when I lived here. She is very clear in the Decatur the stairs. Very doable and worth every step. Parking is a little tight with a bigger vehicle. I just backed in from the street and it was easy peasy. I walked everywhere and didn’t take the tram once. I felt very safe (this trip I was traveling solo) and I loved the street car sounds. Felt like I was in Europe. You won’t regret staying in Harman’s loft. We will def return! ❤️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views and location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This apartment is beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. It is a great find. Easy walk to the Findley market and other Over the Rhine neighborhood gems. The host communicated well. Would definitely recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space and absolutely perfect Cincinnati location. The views of the city are iconic. Would absolutely stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed in and the neighborhood is fantastic!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Close to a connector spot which was convenient. We walked everywhere when it wasn’t snowing. The loft had everything we needed and kitchen was well stocked. Felt at home. Didn’t mind being on the 4th floor. Harman was quick to respond and always helpful. Extremely happy we stayed here overall.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem on Elm St with unique historic features and stunning views. Super walkable neighborhood with many restaurants, bars, and attractions nearby. We only moved our car once & enjoyed walking through Washington Park to break up our walks. We had a peaceful stay and can’t wait to visit OTR again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cute place to stay in OTR! The parking spot is great and everything is an easy walk away. The apartment is beautiful with a great view.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location! Super walkable to the best spots in over the rhine! The pictures don’t do it justice. It was far better than we expected!
Host was very responsive to a few minor issues.
We had a great stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location! Was so nice to be able to bring our pups for a weekend getaway. The park nearby was perfect for walks. Was nice to have a parking spot. Great local bars (did an awesome food tour) and easy access to the highway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space and location!
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"5 night stay! Pros- Easy walk to the game, restaurants, & music hall. Nice architecture. Nice to have a washer/dryer.
Cons-Unit looked fairly clean, but it was dusty/dirty. We questioned if/when any deep cleanings had been done. Bathroom drawers had used toothpaste and qtips that were loose in the drawers, half empty bottles under the sinks, closet full of cleaning supplies.The bdrm closet cluttered with sheets and comforters, not your typical blankets but bags of bedding. There were 2 ironing boards one broken which is why they had two, not sure why you keep the broken one. There is 1 closet for clothes, no dresser. They provide hangers - plastic,wire and some of those free ones you get when you buy clothes. The cabinets in the kitchen had leftover food, it was a bit of a mess so we used one shelf. Knives were very dull. Sofa had stains, and not comfortable. Dining table is small high-top, seats 2 at best. Owner should get another cleaning service, and buy a dresser. Parking is tight."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night to watch the FCC game. So close to TQL stadium! I appreciated the location, easy parking, easy to find lock box, and character of the place. I could hear and see noisy people socializing, on the balcony directly across the street by the bed, but it's a city on a Saturday night, so it might just be part of the territory. Overall, a comfortable stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay as we could walk everywhere and it was super close to the park! The entire place was the perfect loft for a city stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"very cool decoration and gorgeous views of the city. Location is perfect as well, especially if you have your dog with you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great place to stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very convenient location. We had a short but very pleasant stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We went for a show at the Cincinnati music hall. The airbnb was the perfect location making a night out very walkable and easy to get around. Will definitely consider staying here again in the future!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,fantastic spot in OTR. the place was cozy and had great views. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a cool spot in Cincy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harman's airbnb was the perfect stay-- this description, the location, the cleanliness were all as described. The space very bright and airy. And, easy to get around to all the restaurants and popular spots along Vine Street. HIghly recommend, and would stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was absolutely stunning! Clear instructions for entry, amazing view, super clean and overall very house warming. We would love to come back!! Host was amazing!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, well decorated and updated inside."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here while in town for a recruiting event at UC. Amazing location and great loft space. Highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Very walkable to OTR restaurants and bars. Easy off-street parking.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Harman's place was exactly as described. It is very walkable to all the activity in the OTR. We stayed for a Bengal's Monday night game and it was right under 1 mile to the stadium. It took us about 20 min to walk. When we arrived, we had issues with getting in but Harman called us in less than a minute and was able to get us in promptly with no delay! There are many stairs, but we knew that - so no surprise there! We like the exercise anyway and her loft apartment was worth the climb. It was our own little oasis for the night in beautiful Cincinnati. Because it wad a Monday night, not much was open after the game. But we found a late night Mexican place called Taco Lab that delivered late night on doordash after the game. The food was excellent."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will definitely consider staying here again, was perfect to walk over to the stadium for the UWNT game! Great location, clean and spacious place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in fun neighborhood with view of stadium. Parking spot was tight fit for my pickup, and walk up might not be for everyone, but really funky apartment close to lots of restaurants and culture."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Harman’s condo and our 4th visit to the loft. We love OTR. Harman’s condo stands out for its cleanliness, her positive and quick responses and you can’t discount the quick 25 minute walk to Paycor and Great America Ball Park. We will be back next season. Who-Dey!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful + classic space in an old urban neighborhood!!! Beautiful city views. Close to many fun places. Felt very much like home!!
Would definitely stay there again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay! The condo is in a perfect location. It’s a huge bonus to have a parking place. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an incredibly clean and gorgeous apartment. I loved the fact that it was a top floor apartment and had a beautiful decor. Conveniently located close to everything you would want to do. Harman was very helpful and friendly. highly recommend this location for future trips to Cincinnati.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Just beautiful with perfect location
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harman’s place was great! She went above and beyond and was flexible on check in coming in on an early morning flight.
Literally right next to the park and super close to the new soccer stadium and tons of restaurants. Will def stay again. A+++ host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! We absolutely enjoyed every minute at Harman’s incredible place! It was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! Amazing! The industrial rustic feel, sparkling clean, so quiet and had everything you could possibly need or want. The location was amazing with parks close by and parking is included. We LOVED every minute and Harmon was wonderful with us. Thank you so much! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This loft was perfect for our stay in Cincinnati. Very clean and comfortable. Walkable to many great restaurants. Thanks
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with plenty to see and do.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, pretty view, and easy parking for 1 vehicle."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great spot. You can not ask for a better location. You are within easy walking distance of TQL Stadium and Memorial Hall and just a block North of a Street Car station which provides access to The Banks area of downtown. With this being located in the heart of OTR, there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from.
The biggest thing for me is the parking spot that is included as part of your stay. I stayed on a big FC Cincinnati game night, and finding parking on those nights ca be very difficult.
If I needed to stay downtown again, I would not hesitate to stay here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was adorable and clean. It was even cuter in person. It is 4 floors up. And the parking is tight. BUT there is parking. And the views are stunning.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in this loft. We stayed for 2 weeks and felt right at home. With the added benefits of 1.5 bathrooms, laundry, full kitchen, and a beautiful view the loft felt like a home away from home. The only down side was the lack of water pressure in the shower which wasn’t a huge deal breaker for us and we would love to stay here again. Host was very responsive and dropped off some supplies mid stay when needed. Thank you for going the extra mile to make our stay comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It is a great place! Close to the park, very lovely walking around. The place itself is awesome, fully equipped. Be ready for some stairs though."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed here for one night while passing through town, and we wanted to check out this neighborhood. It's a great place in a great location."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The place inside was great. The apartment is above a bar, so there can be some noise below. Overall the neighborhood during the day was fine, but late night it was a little dicey outside."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for my husband and I's three-night stay in Cincinnati. Perfect location to walk to OTR, the Findlay Market and from Paycor Stadium. It did rain during our trip so we had to Uber some places, but it didn't cost much since it's so close to everything. The apartment itself was nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The parking space was convenient. The only downside was the shower - I'd consider it a trickle of water which made for uncomfortable showers. Overall though, it was a great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful space, super eclectic! It's on the VERY top floor so make sure to prepare for lots of stairs. The apt is beautiful, clean, and communication was spot on! It was a great option especially since you have parking, are close to Washington Park and in OTR! Pricey, but if you can swing it, I'd recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was beautiful and the location was perfect! OTR is a very walkable area plus the loft was right on the street car line, making it so easy to get to and from the ballpark and Findlay Market. Lots of fun restaurants and nightlife close by!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is lovely, the view is gorgeous and the location is great for enjoying OTR. There seemed to be a bit of a hiccup with the cleaner running behind and things were not quite clean - but I could tell that likely was not a regular occurrence. I would stay here again, if it weren't for the many many stairs. But for a night away, it was lovely."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location. Close to street car station, Music Hall and Washington Park. Great restaurants in walking distance.
Host was replied to all messages. The place looked exactly how it was advertised. If you don’t mind climbing steps, this is the place to be."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. We felt right at home and enjoyed the space so much.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic! Lovely, clean, comfortable loft. Definitely would stay here again. Only downside was the street it's located on was a bit noisy at times, but we knew that could be the case going in so wasn't a problem for us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Good location and cute apartment
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view of Music Hall was even better than I expected. Personal parking space is amazing for a downtown stay. The place is a couple hundred feet from a street car stop, which can get you within walking distance to basically anything you could want to do downtown. The 4 flights of 1860s style stairs is kinda rough but we actually got used to it faster than I expected and it's totally worth the view. We booked pet friendly but didn't end up bringing our dogs. There was some fur floating around when we checked in, not a problem for us but if you are super anti-dog then take that into consideration. The place is adorable with amazing natural light. My only con is that the shower water pressure is pretty terrible. Personally, I like my shower one notch below pressure washer and this shower is mostly a fast trickle. Regardless, it wouldn't stop me from staying here again because everything else is amazing."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow what more could you want. We stayed 4 nights and wish we could stay longer. Beautiful location on the 4th floor with city views from every window. Everything was very clean, looked so cool, and was stocked with everything we needed. Perfect location, we walked to everything our entire trip. Only about 3 minutes from Washington park, we took advantage and spent time there multiple times a day. We had so much fun and so many amazing meals. The food and atmosphere are top notch. The B & A street Kitchen is maybe 5 minute walk and the best breakfast we had. The Eagle and Krugers Tavern, also maybe 10 minute walk, were our favorite dinners. If your looking for a sweet treat it’s quite a walk but Pendleton Parlor is a must try and please go with the side by side. You won’t regret it. Harman is a great host and reached out to us to see if we needed anything and suggested a few places. If you are staying in Cincinnati look no further. This is the one."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We have stayed at many different locations over the last five years. This was our favorite rental property we’ve stayed in. We went to a baseball game on this visit. We were able to easily walk to and from the stadium. We spent part of the evening walking to the local bars and breweries. The location is great for walking to any destination. The nearby park is a great place to visit. The pictures don’t do the penthouse justice. This place is stunning. The views are amazing. The nostalgia of the place is a big reason we booked this place. The place was very clean and very relaxing. I had a special request from the renter. The renter went out of her way to make sure this request was met. Thanks again for a great stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot and close to Washington Park!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very chic place right in the middle of everything - plenty of restaurants, shops, and the TQL Stadium within walking distance (less than 10 minute walk!). Pros - squeaky clean, upscale, walking distance to plenty of things to do, and convenient parking. Cons - low water pressure and night-time noise from the city trolley system."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful loft in the heart of downtown Cincinnati. exquisitely comfortable bed, clean open space and loved waking up to the song of morning birds. would definitely come back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at Harman’s condo multiple time. It’s professionally maintained and never an issue. Highly recommend the place if you’re staying in the Cincinnati area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went to Cincinnati mainly to see the Reds but also to see the city. I highly recommend this location. It was super walkable to everything—just a few blocks to Findlay Market (great CHEAP breakfast and coffee spot) and about 1.3 mile walk to the stadium. Felt very safe and the location was quiet. Great place!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here with our toddler - very close to Washington Park and lots of good restaurants. We would love to stay here again next time we're in Cincinnati
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my first Airbnb and won't be my last. Good experience all around. Perfect location for a away supporter at a FC Cincinnati game!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Harman's space was comfortable, relaxing, and had wonderful views of the city.
Having off-street parking was really helpful, and it's perfectly located for walking around the neighborhood and having Washington Park close by was really helpful for our dog. We also appreciated the booklet with information about the neighborhood and the map. Would definitely recommend to others."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in downtown Cincinnati! Looked the location, loved the eclectic apartment and comfortable furnishings!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and very nice place, would absolutely recommend. Had everything we needed"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Harman's airbnb felt like home! Great location close to TQL Stadium, Findlay Market and Rhinegeist Brewery. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place highly recommend it. Great neighborhood close to everything you need. Only issue was needed to run out and buy body wash etc since nothing was provided but not a huge deal. Would definitely stay again. Super cool space and tastefully decorated.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host! Located by so many great places! Would absolutely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about this place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Excellent location. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying at Harman’s place. We went to a concert at memorial hall (literally 0.2 miles away), so the location was perfect for us. You’re also right by Washington Park, which is cute. We went to Five on Vine for dinner- great date night place. Fun stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible place. Perfect location and it was so nice inside. Loved the industrial feel. I’ll be trying to stay again next time I’m in town. Thanks Harman!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely convenient location. Located near the best parts of OTR.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, stress-free stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place to stay!
Highly recommend quiet place despite being in the big city 😉
Walking distance to everything you would ever want or need!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our one night stay, beautiful and spacious 4th floor apartment! Appreciated the parking spot very much. Harman did suggest good restaurants, but many are closed off-season on Mondays and Tuesdays. We liked both Maize and B&A Street Kitchen, both around the corner. We hope to spend more time in Cincinnati soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute very fun little place. The 4 flights of stairs were fun to go up but far worth it when you got to it. Homie and clean plus free parking. Great stay would go again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Harman’s condo is in the perfect location. Even though we live just ten minutes away, we wanted a night in the city for a couple cocktails, dinner, and brunch and had searched out this Airbnb after seeing it on CityBeat’s “List of best Airbnb’s in Cincinnati” and saw from the pictures it was the best one on the list. It’s actually even more beautiful than the pictures and has a great view of historic Music Hall. The bathroom is stunning, it’s in a safe area, and you have a designated parking spot. Check-in and check-out was easy and Harman reached out an hour before check-in to let me know the condo was ready if I wanted early check in. Even though it’s in the city, it was very quiet in the condo. You can walk everywhere, whether it be for restaurants, coffee/brunch, wine bars/cocktail lounges (there’s an underground bar Ghost Baby just two blocks away), breweries, Findlay Market, historic tours, OTR shopping district, and you can see the FC Stadium from the condo."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time and loved the apartment.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay near the heart of downtown Cincy! The building was quiet and clean. Be prepared to walk a lot of stairs.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This Air BnB was beautiful! Loved being on the top floor and it was really nice to have our own parking space. Good location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and very cool apartment. Loved the decor and comfortable bed!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful home, close to everything Cincy has to offer. Loft space filled with patina and charm."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful condo! Parking included in safe neighborhood! We walked to dinner, breweries and Memorial Hall for a concert! Washington Park is within eyesight of the Condo! We hope to stay again soon! Such a lovely place!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great location right in OTR! we walked everywhere and had a great time. the place was perfect. just keep in mind there is no elevator and it's up 4 flights of stairs
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. We would stay here again anytime.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We only stayed a night but we wished we had a chance to stay longer . The space was beautiful and in the perfect location . Can see the soccer stadium from bedroom and the lights are nice at night
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and quiet building. There is a lovely view from the unit. Host was responsive. Well worth the price paid compared to what you would get at a hotel for the same price.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this location!! We were very close to everything we were in town to do. New Riff was our furthest appointment during our stay and the drive was shocking short! Tons of food options within walking distance. We also travel with our dog and we’re so happy how close we were to a park. We did wonder about the shelves of empty wine and liquor bottles on display in kitchen?
My only (small) complaints:
We asked about the possibility of checking in a little early so we could make a meeting on time. I asked during the booking and after with no response. Even a no would have been appreciated!
Lastly, we got locked in the bedroom. There are not blinds covering every window in the living room area. We are used to sleeping in almost complete darkness. So we shut the sliding doors going into the bedroom. We woke up and couldn’t get the doors to open. Not the biggest deal but I don’t know if I could have gotten out without my significant other. We were only able to get one door open."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing and easy to access
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place. It is in a perfect spot near the Findlay market and several breweries. Very clean and easy to find. It was nice to have our own parking spot. Host was very helpful!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,her place is amazing cuteeeee
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to town for a show at Memorial Hall. The location couldn't have been more perfect. It is literally a Joe Burrow heave from Memorial Hall. Having a dedicated parking space was clutch. Unrelated, I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the neighborhood was; we didn't see or hear another human inside the building.
The spot itself is nice. It is as described and is as nice in person as the pictures look. Cathedral ceilings, nice views of the neighborhood and downtown at sunrise."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a great place. Very clean and it was just two blocks from the wedding we attended at the Transcept. There was a park nearby to walk the dog and we felt very comfortable walking around both in daylight and at night. The apartment is beautiful and very comfortable. We would not hesitate to book this place again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"On the way to Cincinnati, I realized that I had actually stayed at Harmen’s a few years ago. I was delighted because I recalled really enjoying my stay then and I enjoyed it just as much this time around. We went to a concert at the Memorial hall which was about a four minute walk. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance also. (Another) all-around great stay! Would definitely recommend."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, very clean. The furniture wasn’t very conducive for just watching tv and hanging out."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our short stay at Harman’s place! Wish we could have stayed longer. The loft was beautiful and centrally located in walking distance to tons of bars, restaurants, and stores in OTR.
Harman is a stellar host. We messaged and requested to book the apartment very last minute, in a snowstorm, and Harman immediately responded and was able to be sure the space was clean for us. Truly went above and beyond for our stay. We are so grateful! I would absolutely recommend, and hope to stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the neighborhood and the accommodations!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful loft that’s well worth it
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Responsive host, clean and very comfortable accommodations! A pleasure!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harman's loft was perfect for a quick trip to Cincinnati, the place was bigger than I expected and the bed was very comfortable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful apartment, close to everything, clean and welcoming! Would recommend- just know it’s on the fourth floor with no elevator (just in case you have anyone with you who has difficulty walking)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic loft, a super walkable neighborhood, and fabulous restaurants nearby! I definitely will keep this rental in mind for the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A stunning space in a beautiful location! Was everything we hoped and more--walkable to all the restaurants we wanted to hit and lots of charm.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying in Harman’s condo. It’s a great spot in OTR overlooking Music Hall.
During this visit, I was arriving during the blizzard. Harman provided an alternate means of getting into the building and condo in case the first method was unavailable due to the cold and snow. Turns out, I would not have been able to get in without the alternative. I was extremely grateful she had thought of that!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here! The space was well laid out and very clean. The only improvements we would recommend include making sure the coffee maker is cleaned out, the laundry is out of the dryer, and that there is shower gel/soap that anyone can use. We found ourselves cleaning out the coffee grounds from the last stay and folding the owner’s washed towels and sheets (not something you want to be doing on a vacation). Also, the shower gel was almost out and for men (very strong/harsh to use).
Otherwise, the stay was perfect and we would recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was easily one of my favorite b&bs. Beautiful space and wonderful location. I would absolutely stay here again. 10/10 💜
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great walkable location, super modern feel, comfortable bed!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful cozy place to stay. The decor was lovely. Walking distance to everything we needed.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great loft style condo with easy access to OTR, highly recommended!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean! Harman was great and we thoroughly enjoyed staying here.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! The apartment is as nice (even better) as the photos show. Incredible location and very clean. The owner was very communicative and the directions to get in were easy. Parking is free and right out the side door. Bed was comfy. It is in the heart of OTR near restaurants and bars. Very near the new soccer stadium. It is on the 4th floor, so you have to be able to walk up/down 8 flights of stairs. This is my only caveat. Loved the whole exerience."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Cincinnati and she let me check in early
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Wish we had more time to stay! We had a snafu when checking in but Harmen immediately resolved the issue and was available for communication. Her place has a great view of the Cincinnati Bengals stadium and very kind neighbors. If you stay here, pack light for the stairs and look for ""Quiet Wyatt"". We had an awesome time at the Cincinnati Zoo with the famous hippo bloat."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great location & a parking space right outside the door. Being on the top floor provided great views & enough space from the street to not be so disturbing. The 2 bathrooms were nice to have & the high ceilings, along with the old brick & giant bay window made this unit very unique & “just wow”."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to enjoy all OTR has to offer!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, cozy and quiet. Would definitely recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harman’s loft was perfect. Pictures do not do justice! The top floor has spectacular views from every angle, including the FC Cincinnati stadium and Music Hall. It was clean, well-equipped, and comfortable. Extra linen, pillows, and towels were available. The loft is on the top floor, and the walk up the four flights of stairs can be challenging if you have excess luggage. Not an issue otherwise. The Cincinnati Connector free trolly stops right in front of the building. We indulged in fantastic food and chose to walk everywhere, including Findlay Market, Rhine Geist Brewery, and the Bengals Paul Brown stadium- (about 25 min from the loft), and felt safe the entire time. Easy check-in and check-out. I would happily stay there again in the future."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location and great views of the city! Super cozy and had everything we needed and then some!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. the place was clean and very nice. convenient to all of the OTR area. Many great places to eat and things to do.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Harman’s place was perfect for my last minute overnight in Cincinnati!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at Harman’s! The loft was perfect and even better than the photos. Very clean. Loved having 1.5 bathrooms. The view and location is amazing. We can’t wait to stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cool spot!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay! Our trip was only for one night, but it would have been great to stay there longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location was absolutely ideal and the apartment was spotless, a beautiful place in the city that was convenient to get anywhere i needed to go. Highly recommend walking to Findlay's Market, Rhinegiest Brewery, Salazar (restaurant was amazing), and grabbing a drink at Ghost Baby."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location to check out OTR. Would stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A great space in Over the Rhine. Easy walk to the light rail and great restaurants and brewery.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful, clean, & in a good area in proximity to stores as well as restaurants! I’d come back to this spot 👍"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was Fantastic! Thank you for allowing us to share your beautiful property. We will definitely like to stay again during future trips t Cincinnati.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location, we had a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A great taste of historic Cincinnati. Very comfortable place and a great host.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location ! Using the connector was great to get to restaurants and stuff near by . Findlay market is a must see ! Place is super clean and kept up with well loved the location ! And the walk up wasn’t bad at all ! Would recommend staying here .
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! Amazing apartment!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice size pad and beautiful building. When I arrived there were no sheets on the bed and the trash hadn't been removed but it was generally clean for the most part. Despite, being a little put off by this, I was pleased overall with my stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and beautiful apartment with high ceilings! Definitely recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though there are some stairs involved, this was a very comfortable place to stay. Loved the bed! We were attending a concert at Memorial Hall, so the location is hard to beat. And the price is very competitive! A bargain."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very beautiful and cozy place and it was so close to so many yummy restaurants and cute shops!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful apartment, great location and host is very responsive"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The exposed brick caught our attention initially - but the pictures don't do this place justice! There is so much natural light and the view is absolutely beautiful from every angle. We enjoyed being on the top floor. The bed is very comfortable. Having 1-1/2 bathrooms was a luxury. We were in the area for the Ark/Creation Museum but wanted to explore Cincinnati as well. We are very happy with our choice! A very unique experience.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great room in a great location. Everything was perfect.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is right in the heart of everything you want to be around. A perfect location. I only found it by chance while browsing a travel blog that recommended it.
We spent a few days in Cincinnati and wanted to hit the zoo, a Reds game, the Newport Aquarium, and a Riverboat tour. The zoo and the aquarium were easy driving distance, no issues at all. The ballpark was a short walk to the corner for a free trip on the train.
Be aware, however, there are stairs to get up to this spot — and they can be an absolute bear if you’re not able to handle a lot of them. All in all, this was a great place and I would recommend it to anyone visiting.
The host was easy to communicate with and there were no unforeseen problems."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’d highly recommend staying here! It was so clean, well kept, location was ideal for walking, quiet and spacious."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, clean, easy check-in!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a special treat in Cincinnati, stay in Harman's penthouse. The location is perfect. We walked all over OTR and rode the Connector, which comes right by the building. The space is awesome with everything we needed plus an incredible view. We would definitely stay there again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazon stay! Great location, parking, beautiful loft!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean, unique! Would definitely stay again! Only downside is the 4 flights of stairs but we didn’t mind!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Harman’s place was beautiful, clean and a super convenient location for the concert we attended! We will definitely return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is gorgeous! We had a great time in Cincy!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay in the most perfect area. Everything was walking distance which was super cool and the space was very light and airy. Great for weekend stays! 10/10 would recommend
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying at this condo. It was perfect. The owner delivers a great experience.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Harman’s place was great & quite possibly the cleanest Air BnB we’ve stayed in. It was extremely well located in the OTR part of town where everything was extremely walkable. Parking & check-in were a breeze. I’d definitely recommend Harman’s condo if in Cincinnati!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful home, convenient & perfect location with parking. Would recommend to anyone coming to Cincinnati!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stylish loft with everything you need and super clean. In a great OTR location. Easy access and very nice to have a dedicated parking place.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and free parking! Open space and high ceilings. Tastefully decorated and plenty of extra linens/blankets. Beautiful view of Music Hall. Great shops in walking distance.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a fantastic place! Really exquisite, historic condo. The location is in the heart of OTR. We walked to awesome bars/restaurants and the (free) street car is a block away. The only thing bad about this place is we couldn’t stay longer!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful space in walking distance of everything OTR has to offer. Will absolutely be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location - close to restaurants and the loft is comfortable and charming.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place and a great location to food, cocktails, Findlay Market and the Cinci Connector! Be aware that it's on the 4th floor but, we really didn't mind since it's a great location! We walked mostly everywhere except when we went downtown, where we used the Connector. Very comfortable and was nice having a bath and a half. We will definitely come back!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was very clean and located within walking distance of restaurants, live music, breweries, a park, and open market. The free streetcar with pickup and drop-off less a block from the front door was priceless!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay in the OTR! Walking distance from the park, dog park, and a number of restaurants/bars. We appreciated the daily workout from the three flights of stairs! Would stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice loft. Be ready to walk up stairs. If you forget you phone in the car it’s game over. Really nice that is has two bathrooms, make it so much easier. Only real negatives are the TV is in the living room in an odd place and not one in the Bedroom. Wasn’t the biggest fan of the mattress, but I’m not big on memory foam in general. And lastly the smaller bathroom didn’t have an poop spray out and my girlfriend was forced to admit that she poops and that they smell. She wasn’t thrilled but I found it funny.
This would be the perfect place if you were coming into town for a soccer match, free parking and close stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect! It is on the 4th floor but not that bad a climb. There’s lots of floor space for air mattress. Would be perfect for a couple though. Bathrooms very clean. It’s on the Cincinnati Bell connector tram line that operates for free so perfect for getting around downtown to the Great American Ball Park. On Saturday morning the park down the block was having an art fair. Great area, easy parking and Harman responded quickly to a question prior to our arrival."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is impeccable and stylish, ideally located, and host is very attentive and prompt when we asked a question. Would def stay again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! The condo is even more beautiful than the photos! Location was great! We happen to love history and this renovation (property originally built in 1880s) was amazing!! We appreciated reading the reviews from others about the many stairs. We were in Ohio for a few days so we packed just a small overnight bag for this night and left of our big suitcases down in the car. Book this property! You won’t regret it!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Harman’s listing was my favorite Airbnb stay to date. Cleanliness, amenities, location, etc. this Airbnb has it all! 10/10 would recommend and WILL stay again next time I’m in Cincinnati!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Always a great stay in this OTR loft! Great location and plenty of room to spread out for a little get away not far from home.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much! Samantha was so helpful and kind to us. The condo was spotless with clean/comfy linens. Loved that it was just a short walk to many attractions as we walked to GABP (15 minutes), Findlay Market (25 minutes), and Montgomery Inn (17 minutes). The parking garage was only $25 for the whole weekend (fri-sun) so that was nice! Can’t wait to stay again :)"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sammantha was very friendly & welcoming to us checking in 3 hours early since we were already in the area, but because we were early there weren’t any drinks or snacks but that’s not a big deal. The place was very clean & as described.
We come to Cincinnati at least once a month for games & will definitely be staying here again. 10/10 recommend!"

Central downtown, 2min from any highway, and a walks distance from many food choices. Stayed here for our wedding weekend and adored every bit of it. Check-in. A breeze. Check out. Even easier. The water pressure?. A 5 star hotel could never. Truly was an ideal place for us."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You couldn't ask for a better location. The condo is extremely clean and spacious and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. On street parking at the meter or a public lot with plenty of space.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved Samantha’s place. Well-appointed for either a short or long stay. Dynamite location as well. The only bummer was this multi-floor building has wooden subfloors which telegraph noise similar to most apartment buildings and low-rise hotels.

Very good location and quiet compared to the rest of downtown. A bit of traffic noise but otherwise peaceful. Also, very comfortable bed!
On street parking is available, which was convenient for dropping our bags but we just parked in a garage around the corner for our 2 night stay. Convenient and a reasonable $12 a night."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was a great location for us as it was close to the Casino, Great American Ball Park and lots of other places. The condo was as pictured, clean, and well taken care of.
Sam was a great host and even got us into Jeff Ruby's Steakhouse last minute because of her connections! I will definitely rent again if I am back in the Cincy area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great loft, great location, great host. Samantha is the perfect host....very accommodating and communicative. Would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time booking with Patti. We love it and will back later this year!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was lovely. Excellent location, well appointed, perfect for short stays. We would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay with parking included. Great location, would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy walk to Memorial Hall, Cincinnati Symphony and FC Cincinnati's stadium. Plenty of restaurant options in just a few blocks' radius. Zero problems finding the building - Patti's directions were clear and the pictures were very helpful. Clean, comfortable room in a quiet building. Would gladly stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an excellent stay at Patti’s place. Everything was exactly as described. Cute place, fun decor, great location, very walkable. She provided thorough, helpful directions to get inside. Appreciated that we could stay for just one night, as that can be hard to find in airbnbs! Would definitely stay again if we come back to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Spectacular stay! Very clean and the perfect space for two people. Description of the place was spot on. Loved the heated mattress cover.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don't think you could get a better location for enjoying OTR. I briefly spoke to Patti upon arrival and she made a few recommendations that turned out to be perfect for us. My wife also commented that the room wasn't lacking a thing. We would definitely stay here again!
One note: our neighbors in the house came in at 3:30 AM and were quite obnoxious, only to then have a 90's R&B party for about an hour and a half. We would have thoroughly enjoyed the music had it not been in the middle of the night. It was quite shocking given how thick the walls are in the house that we heard the music so clearly. I'm guessing it was coming through the duct work. It didn't ruin our stay, just a bit annoying. Obviously, this is in no way a reflection of Patti and I'm sure if I would have reached out to her she would have assisted. But it didn't seem to warrant waking her up in the middle of the night too. If guaranteed privacy is what you're after, you might want to explore Patti's other offerings."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in Downtown Cinci conveniently located to great restaurants and bars. I’d stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very quiet, comfortable bed, nice place. I enjoyed it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed in a few places in OTR, but this is by far my favorite. The location is perfect and you can’t hear much from the street. Patti contacted me to let me know when the room was ready early. She also told me about road closures happening because we arrived on Opening Day. The parking spot alone is worth the price of this spot. We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay here, and loved it as much as the first! Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely great experience! The unit is perfect, the location is epic - from check in to check out we had a great time. Would definitely return to explore the OTR neighborhood."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The best Airbnb experience
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fully enjoyed my stay! Had an event at the music hall, which is practically next-door and super convenient. Really enjoyed exploring Over the Rhine as well. I was by myself and felt safe in the unit. And the parking behind the unit was wonderful to have. I will absolutely stay here again when in Cincinnati. The suite was cozy, clean, and quiet for great sleeping!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti’s place was perfect for a quick stay in Cincy. I am from the area, and the location of the unit is walkable to all of the best bars and restaurants in OTR. The unit was a great size for two people and had everything you needed. Plus parking was free which is a huge bonus! Patti was extremely responsive and kind, and the laid out very detailed instruction on how to enter the home. I will definitely be looking out for this unit again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best time! It was perfect for a one night stay! Walk out the front door and you are at Washington Park. They had the cutest market going on Sunday night which we didn’t even know about! Everything was clean, and check-in was super easy! I would stay again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Patti’s place was in a great location for a weekend trip to Cinci. It was in a great neighborhood with lots nearby. We felt safe in the area at night. The place was exactly as the pictures showed. Patti was a great host and responsive to messages. Note that the bathroom door is a sliding door and doesn’t close completely - we didn’t mind but just so you know! Would definitely stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place is everything g you need for a trip to cincinnati. it is in a great cool neighbourhood (that is walkable). the unit is in a groovy old building oozing with charm.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our one night stay at Patti’s place in Cincinnati was amazing. Patti was an incredible host, very communicative. The apartment was stocked with anything you could possibly need - from ear plugs to a steamer. Also, it was the BEST location (walkable to many restaurants!) and a real plus to have parking included. Would highly recommend staying at Patti’s place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The best review I can give would be the fact that I would stay here again! Everything was great!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti's place was just as described and the perfect location for our stay in Cincinnati. The instructions were specific, clear and helpful. The unit had everything we needed, and it is in such a great location with beautiful Washington Park right across the street and many restaurants within walking distance. We didn't use the street car, but you can access it just a few short steps from the unit. If we ever need to stay in Cincinnati again, we will definitely choose Patti's place. If you live in the country like we do and are used to sleeping in true darkness, I do recommend bringing an eye mask because the city lights are bright and it took us awhile to adjust, but regardless, it was a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little studio apartment in the heart of OTR. Very walkable to awesome restaurants and the park is beautiful. The included parking behind the building made the whole process easy. Didn’t have to worry about finding a garage or street parking. Would stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a prime location for the concert venue we went to, but even so prime for so many other places to eat, drink, walk etc. Neighborhood was safe and quaint. Loved the European vibe!
Instructions were on point and very clear to understand. When in doubt, Patti answered so quickly! Everything was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great hidden gem in the heart of Cincinnati! Located in a historic building with lots of charm, my one night stay in this micro studio turned out to be the highlight of all of my travels that week. Very comfy with lots of thoughtful amenities and touches. Easy to find, across from a gorgeous city park, parking included and walkable to a great little coffee shop a couple of blocks away, Redtree Coffee & Art. Couldn't ask for more! Thanks again, Patti, for a wonderful stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had such a great time staying here! It was super clean, cozy and had everything we need. Was in a safe area and has a beautiful park right across the road. We walked to restaurants and the park and it was so much fun!!!! Close to everything."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti's place is in a lovely neighborhood, across from a park. Streetcar access is right outside the door to get most places in the city. It was very quiet midweek. Her instructions were clear, she and Ken are communicative hosts, the space was very clean with quality linens. I will certainly be staying again. A+"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space in a walkable area of Cincinnati. Loved it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in Cincinnati only one night for a wedding. Patti's place suited our needs perfectly. The included parking was a huge help, not having to hunt around for parking after a long drive. The place itself was exactly as described, and very comfortable. The bed as very comfy and we got a good night sleep. Although it is in a busy, active neighborhood, and we were there on a Friday night, we had no problem with noise. The location was fantastic - right across the street from a beautiful park in the middle of a wonderful neighborhood, with lots of restaurants close by. We had the added bonus of meeting Patti and Ken on the morning of checkout (they were there doing some improvements to the property - they are very hands on and obviously care about the property) and they are wonderful people. I'd love to come back for a longer stay to further explore the neighborhood."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The location was absolutely perfect! Right downtown, very walkable to most places or a short drive. Close to public transit and a beautiful park across the street. We couldn't believe how quiet this place was for its location. Even during the day, it was quiet. Like a little hideaway in the middle of the city.
The apartment was clean and felt modern and well kept for. The only thing we weren't fond of was the lack of privacy for the bathroom. The barn door is nice for esthetics, but a full door would be much better. We would still stay here again 100 times over. We love Cincinnati and plan to stay with this host our next time in town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location for a reasonable price!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Micro - as advertised - but clean, convenient, and comfortable. And Patti was a kind and helpful host. A great stay."

Patti was very responsive and helpful with my questions and needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Patti is one of the best hosts I’ve ever stayed with. The apartment is wonderful and exactly what we needed for a quick stop in town. Communication was extremely prompt and Patti went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. I will stay here again any time I pass through town.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place!! It was so clean and comfortable. We felt right at home and the location is amazing. So walkable and lots to do and see.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying at Patti’s place for a Monday night football. OTR is one of our favorite parts of Cincinnati. We didn’t have access to the free parking since they needed it to remain open for a crane to come in for construction work and Patti very kindly paid for the parking garage. Will absolutely stay here again!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The location and convenience of Patti's unit made the trip to Cincinatti perfect. The included parking was a huge bonus. The unit was clean and I could tell great care had been taken to include everything needed for an over night stay.

If we return to the city, hopefully it'll be available again for us. Thanks Patti!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay and very convenient! Perfect when needing to only stay one night.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, very walkable to restaurants, stadiums and the City Market area, yet was very quiet because the room was not on the street but in the back of the house. The room was very clean and stylish with a nice amount of amenities. Patti was also very responsive and check in was extremely easy. The off-street parking was also fantastic. Would absolutely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti’s accommodation is beautifully appointed with carefully curated accents throughout. Fantastic bars, restaurants, arts entertainment, & beautiful Washington Park all within walking distance!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location is Amazing !!! We were in town for a concert at Hard Rock (15 min walk) but you could honestly walk to any event to any location within 15-20 mins ... SOOOO many bars and restaurants within walking distance !!!
Suite is perfect for a single or couple ... Was quiet, free parking included, and host had free coffee pods and morning snacks ...
Would 100% stay here again my next trip to Cincy !!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Patti's place was perfect for my last-minute stay in Cincy. Great location next to a park with a street full of hip bars and restaurants just around the corner. Definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place and great location!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I loved our stay here. We 100% would stay again. Great space, clean and well-designed. Very easy parking. Quick access to the Connector streetcar that took us around downtown for free. We enjoyed walking around Washington Park right outside the front door. Findlay Market is a few blocks away and a good place to spend time. Patti really went above and beyond with her hospitality and support."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patty’s place was a fantastic way to visit Cincinnati for the first time. Beautiful place in beautiful part of the city. My room was great. Cozy, clean, comfy, well appointed with kitchen and food items. The bathroom was spotless and equally well appointed and provisioned with extras for travelers. I can’t say enough good stuff. I was on the ground floor and it was quiet quiet quiet. I stayed on a Thursday night in august. Rode my bike around OTR and fell in love with the cafes, shops, bakeries, buildings, and market. Beautiful park right across the street, symphony building’s basically next stood. Thanks Patti!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, historic place overlooking Washington Park…Patti was there to meet us and show us around. She recommended we take the tram (which stopped right in front)to our planned activities downtown. This stop was a favorite for us…thank you, Patti!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pattis place is in an awesome area by a park. The apartment is quiet, comfortable and nicely designed. Easy to get parked, inside and the communication was excellent.. I would stay again .. beautifully painted"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patti's place is the best! Such a fun & comfortable place to stay in a great location. Patti went above and beyond as a host and I hope that one of her units is available for my next trip to Cincinati. Don't hesitate in booking with Patti.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was by far the best host I have had using Airbnb! I can’t wait to check out her other places!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent histoirical location with all of the amenities and hospitality one would need for a visit to Cincinmati. Located alongside Washington park and many restaurants, this hosts presents their beautiful apartment very well with a convenient location to Cincinnati's resources. You will love your stay here, whether you are visiting for business, going to a game or working. Your sojourn starts here in this centrally located OTR/near Downtown apartment"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti’s place was charming, comfortable, the house was beautiful and our room was lovely. It was within walking distance to many restaurants and festivals. And we just loved it. And to my surprise, it was a 20 minute walk to Paycor stadium, which was wonderful because we did not have to pay for parking to go see the Cincinnati Music Festival. We will definitely be calling on Patti again to stay in one of her units."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost don’t want to leave the amazing review because I want it to be available the next time I go to Cincinnati hahaha! But I cannot say enough about this airbnb. I stay in a lot of airbnbs and this one was special. The location. Yall. If you are staying for an event at the music hall this is the place. You are a one min walk to the hall. It was a perfect location for black tech week- perfect actually isn’t the word. It was better than perfect. The only better location was if I slept in the music hall.
The place was decorated so well. It was comfortable and I felt right at home. It had everything you needed, from the snacks to the pods that even had tea.
If this place is open you need to stay there. Period. It will go fast.
Patti was great to chat with and knows so much about the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Quick walk to Great American Ballpark, Findlay Market, and restaurants & bars. Lots to do in the area and felt safe the entire time."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a centrally located place to explore downtown Cincinnati and the OTR area, this place is for you. Patti's place was just the right spot for us...very clean, cute, safe & a great location. We were concerned about noise complaints at some of the other places we considered booking; we never heard a sound here! It was peaceful and sooo quiet! It is right by Washington Park and you have access to the FREE streetcar with a stop just across the street. We parked our car upon check-in at the free parking space that was included with the stay and never had to drive it again until we checked out. We loved getting around via the streetcar. Patti was very quick to respond to any of our messages and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely rebook this exact spot the next time we visit Cincy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in town for a quick weekend event and Patti’s place was the perfect location for us to be close to everything we needed in downtown Cincinnati. Patti was also incredibly responsive to my messages and accommodating to our travel by adjusting the check in time, meeting us for the check in process, recommending a place to eat, and notifying us of the event’s change in start time. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a quaint, convenient place to stay for an overnight trip or even longer! Thanks Patti & Ken!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cute! The k-cups, snacks and ear plugs were thoughtful (though we didn't use them). Place was clean and large enough for us to sleep and put our stuff down (we came to explore so that's all we needed!). Having The Connector a block away was awesome! We were able to take tours and explore the food/drink scene with no problem.
Had a small hiccup with parking instructions (I took it too literally) but Patti was able to clear it up right away for me! I would totally stay here or at another property from Patti again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in Patti’s Airbnb for one night and it was absolutely perfect for what we needed. Cozy and clean on the inside. The amenities were useful (coffee, face wash..etc).

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small apartment that’s in a great location to explore Cincinnati’s “Over the Rhine” neighborhood. Easy walking distance to the park and lots of restaurants.
Great local architecture, with many older buildings being rehabbed.
The free Cincinnati Connector trolley has stops at the park next door, which gives you easy access to downtown Cincinnati as well as Findlay Market, etc.
Place is small, but clean and cozy.
Patti was very nice and responsive. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our last minute short stay in Cincinnati. It was exactly as it was described and a good location.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patti was an amazing host - kind, helpful, and generous. I’ll definitely be booking again in the future and recommending friends to look into her stays when they come into town. This place was cute, clean and cozy with a modern touch. The name of the stay says “micro unit” but it didn’t feel that way with the how it’s set up. Loved the building and thankful for the parking lot. Location is perfect- Within walking distance to parks, restaurants, bars, the grocery. Also appreciated the microwaveable popcorn, as I arrived in the evening and was in serious need of a snack. Patti, thank you kindly for everything."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. A lot of thing to do within a close distance
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a short stay in Cincinnati. I needed to shower upon arrival and sleep after a concert. I left around 7am the next morning.
With this said, the two times I needed something, Patti was responsive and accommodating. The first was for an earlier arrival than the check-in time listed. The second was an on the fly call when I arrived to understand the parking situation. All was taken care of with Patti.
I will admit a slight concern when I arrived back to park for the night at 1am. There was broken car window glass in the parking area and I had a slight ""Will see"" as I was heading in to sleep.
Everything was fine in the morning.
I'd stay in this spot again if needed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! My husband and I loved how cozy the place was. There was great parking the location was right across from the cutest and lively park. We were visiting for a Cincinnati FC game and the park was the perfect place to pregame! Highly recommend this place. It is smaller being a micro studio but we were not planning on being in the rental very often. My only complaint is that there were ants in the bathroom. Very easy fix!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic stay. Patti was extremely responsive and gave wonderful local recommendations. The unit is just as described. Very clean, decorated well, everything was very welcoming. Think a hotel room but private location with extra amenities in an amazing location in the OTR area. We were able to get everywhere on foot- parks, restaurants, the Reds game, breweries, Findlay market. The free train is steps from the property but we didn’t use it as the weather was perfect for walking. we will definitely stay again when we return to Cincinnati."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place. Finding the way into the parking was a bit tricky.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my 4-night stay at Patti's place. Renovated, nicely furnished and comfortable micro-unit in an historic townhome. Glad to have this quiet space a short walk to the central downtown area. I walked a lot but Patti's place is right on the free Cincy Connector line, which I would have used if the weather had turned. When I spoke with Patti the morning after my arrival, she shared some of the history of her place and the larger community - helped me further appreciate and enjoy my stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patti's and Ken's place is like a little paradise. There is a ton of cute details and amenities. The place is perfectly clean, above-average equipped and very comfortable to stay. Also, easy to reach and having beautiful safe surroundings with many things to do. Patti and Ken are very friendly, helpful and kind people. Overall, it could not be better. Thank you Patti and Ken for making my visit in Cincinnati even more pleasant!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is great. Patti described the listing to a tee! I would recommend staying here to anyone who is wanting a weekend getaway to Cincinnati.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great weekend at Janet’s place. It was easy to find, very clean and felt homey. There was special attention to details including a welcome basket, cotton balls/ Q tips in the bathroom, soaps and plenty of clean towels. Check in/ out instructions were clear and host was very responsive to messages. Located in a very walkable area. The only downside is if you are bringing your pup there’s not a ton of grassy areas to let them do their business close by. The closest we found was Washington park- about a 5 min walk away. This was no biggie for us, but for female solo travelers with pups this may pose a safety issue at night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place and great location! Was walkable to just about anywhere you wanted to go, would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Only had one problem and it was quickly resolved as reasonably as possible. Things are easy when everything goes right. The real test is when there is a problem and how it gets resolved. Great job.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location with several restaurants nearby! Perfect for quick business trips
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice apartment in great OTR location. comfortable bed will equipped great hosts.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This Air BnB was fabulous! We walked everywhere during our stay. It was clean and well maintained. The only thing that I would change is the location. The apartment is right above a tattoo shop that plays very loud music starting early in the morning.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in the heart of Cincinnati! Thanks for a great stay. Would recommend to others!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with lots of surrounding things to do! Very easily walkable to many restaurants and bars. Also, the free streetcar is right around the corner. Easy check in process. Janet was also a wonderful and extremely fast communicator. Highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Janet was a great host! She was super responsive and always available. The location was great and walkable to everything!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a perfect location for exploring OTR and Cincinnati in general! Walkable to many great restaurants. Streetcar stop outside. We were there for the Reds opening day and the parade went down Race street so all we had to do was walk outside! Janet was helpful with recommendations and was very responsive. There were no hangers in the closet so someone dropped them off next day. Very nice! Parking was difficult with an FC game going on when we arrived but there is a parking garage close by that we used for the rest of the week. I’d stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was absolutely spotless and beautiful. It was within walking distance of almost anything you'd want to do and Cincinnati.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic location and a great spotvto stay right in the middle of OTR.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Made our Valentine’s Day perfect
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for a month on an extended road trip around the US. We felt like the monthlong stay was a great value, in line with our budget and in a neighborhood we had heard great things about. We were not disappointed! This was the perfect jumping off point to explore Over the Rhine, and we would happily stay again on return trips. You’re steps from great restaurants and bars, easy parking in the Washington Street garage, and an easy walk to a nearby Kroger. We even took advantage of a temporary membership at Union Hall, a nearby coworking space, to have a spot outside the apartment to work remotely.
Janet and the Liberty Hill management team were very responsive when there were a few minor maintenance issues we needed help with, and everything was resolved proactively and in a timely fashion. When we came down with COVID during our stay, a member of their team even surprised us by leaving a care package of essential groceries outside our door! We were floored by their hospitality."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Cincinnati. I did plenty of research and everyone said to stay in OTR. This place did not disappoint. From a restaurant on every corner, to little quiet corner bars, everything was within walking distance. The apartment was so adorable and comfortable. This stay will not be our last. We will definitely return"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Janet provided easy instructions and many recommendations near the Airbnb. Very clean space! We enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The location was perfect and close to many restaurants, shops, and bars that you could easily walk to. The apartment was clean and had many amenities. Very responsive host. We had an issue with the Keurig upon arriving and we notified Janet and she had it replaced within a few hours. Only thing I would suggest would be to add mirrors in the apartment. There are mirrors in the bathroom above the sinks but if you are getting ready for a special event such as a wedding, a full length mirror in the bedroom/living room would be super helpful. Overall, great place and we would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was just wonderful! The location couldn’t be more perfect, so walkable and the host’s clear instructions and recommendations for neighborhood highlights were great. The home looks exactly like the photos and was clean and bright. During our stay, the host was super responsive and able to help us very quickly with an issue. We loved the Cincinnati-themed decor and the way the home was so well stocked with amenities to make things easy. We will be crossing our fingers that Janet’s place is available the next time we are in Cincinnati."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless and comfortable 2nd floor flat in the heart of OTR, walkable to some of the best restaurants in the city. I feel lucky to have come across this spot!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and perfect apartment. The place is full with useful items like makeup removal wipes, water bottles, and even popcorn. Works great for a couple or a single person. Can walk to bars, restaurants, the park and more."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place close to everything.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and Great stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this location. If you are looking for an honest opinion…stay here! Literally the only thing you want to be aware of is you are in an apartment, so don’t be surprised if you can hear your neighbors upstairs a little. Otherwise this place gets an excellent review from me. This is one I will be suggesting to my friend headed to the Cinci area.👍🏾👍🏾"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice place, we loved it and enjoyed our stay, it fit our needs perfectly.
The neighborhood was great for walking with a lot of restaurants and bars. Although there were some undesirables throughout, which I'm sure is the case for most neighborhoods/cities, we felt very safe and loved the weekend night life."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great! Very easy
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! New place and not cramped. Comfortable bed and living along with a nice kitchen if you want to cook. Location is hard to beat right in the thick of OTR. Would definitely stay again!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, amazing location, would absolutely recommend this place."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely love to stay at Janet place.. The bed and shower are the absolute best. Salazar is one of my favorite places to eat at just 3 minutes to walk. Parking is just one block over which makes it so much more lovely. Have had the opportunity to stay at her place before, and will continue to do so.."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This area is a great area of Cincinnati and very accessible to many things to do downtown cincinnati .. it is walkable to most things you'd enjoy... one thing for me that wasn't clear was its a walk up second floor unit that is a walk up .. the unit i took was perfect and sufficiently appointed to meet anyones needs. with some nice extras like coffee and shower soaps and conditioners etc...
I would recommend this to family and friends any time"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at 7-8 Airbnbs in the Over the Rhine area of Cincinnati and thoroughly enjoyed staying here. I had always walked by the street and I thought how cute it was that it was blocked off and painted colorfully. Murals are always my favorite…on walls or the ground. The apartment is located in the back of the building and it’s on a blocked off street, so you didn’t hear much street noise. Actually, the only noise I heard was from the apartment upstairs and that was mainly in the mornings when they were probably getting ready for work and on Saturday when they were running their vacuum. :) However, most people wouldn’t hear it, unless you are a light sleeper like myself. The host was very quick to respond and extremely accommodating. She even helped me with all my parking inquiries. The apartment is completely stocked with everything that you need for your stay and I felt completely at home. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay, in the heart of OTR, this is your place!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Place is as described and Janet was proactive with all the communication and instructions.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy check in and out. Very responsive hosts. Would definitely stay here again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Returning guest to Janet’s well appointed apartment. Everything you need for a comfortable stay, bed is very comfortable, close to everything in OTR!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated and very clean condo! Located in a nice area and close to everything. However, you can expect that there will be some noise as soon as there are people in the apartment upstairs.
Cincinnati, what a beautiful city! To visit."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and great location - we walked to the majority of all the activities we had planned and found a ton of restaurants to choose from.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding location and perfect for a long weekend. The apartment is plenty spacious and comfortable. Location was perfect for downtown destinations and the YMCA is nearby. They actually let us “out of towners” come in for a free workout! It’s only a few blocks away on the other side of Washington Park. This place surpassed all expectations.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, lots of places to go to within walking distance. Responsive and helpful host!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was great and very well located. Janet made the process very easy from checkin to checkout.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, perfect accommodation. I was able to work with privacy in the bedroom and my daughter used the living room. Full kitchen although we didn’t use it - so many close restaurants to choose from including a fabulous breakfast place just downstairs! We walked (barely more than a mile) to the Bengals game. Can’t wait to come back and check out more shops and restaurants!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location for anyone who wants to go out and see things in the area, visit bars & restaurants, etc. The apartment itself is very nice and had a lovely set up. Only issue was the rooming above us had people stomping around nonstop the entire weekend we were there. We assume it was being renovated and it was workers walking around but don’t have confirmation of that, but either way that is out of the owner’s hands and no fault of theirs. Definitely good value for the price all in all."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Janets place was stellar! We loved everything from the decor, cleanliness, attention to detail, proximity to restaurants shops, parking, Memorial Hall and Washington Park, all within walking distance. One of the best Airbnb’s I have experienced…will tell friends & family if they are going to Cincinnati, stay here. What a delight!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice/updated place, close to everything, and safe!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Janet is wonderful to work with. She reached out at initial booking, the day before arrival, during check-in, and midway through our stay. Her instructions were detailed and the place was easy to access. The condo is amazing - on par with a very ritzy hotel. Everything was sparkling clean, the kitchen was beautifully setup, the living room was comfortable and inviting, and the bedroom (especially the bed) was super comfortable. I was in the area for work and was so excited to come home every night. I would highly recommend the place if you're trying to be right in the heart of downtown. I'll be looking for her listing first when I'm back in town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! So close to all the action and the bus line. Loved that we could easily cross town! It was clean and welcoming.

Over The Rhine area is simply Fabulous........will look to do it again."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect accommodation for those interested in accessibility to the Music Hall, OTR, Findley Market…bed is extremely comfortable, restaurants and breweries mere feet from the front door and the Cincinnati Connector around the corner. Checked off all our boxes."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Lovely place in a great location. In the heart of OTR. Parking is a challenge. Be careful of lots that expire at 4am. The owner is very responsive. Building was very loud. People above unit were moving around well beyond 3am and construction in building started by 8 am.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We live just across the river and wanted a one night stay. This place was great for that our a longer stay. Everything is updated inside and looks great. Super convenient to OTR bars and restaurants and FC Cincinnati Stadium.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Cozy apartment and close to everything!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The location was great and we liked how secure the building was. Janet was flexible in allowing us to switch days when we requested. I however would recommend a different system for cleaning the apartment as opposed to having guests launder the linens and load the dishwasher upon leaving. The guest before us apparently did not follow these instructions and we were welcomed with a pile of dirty towels in the hallway, sheets that weren’t changed and dirty dishes in the sink. Janet did send someone over to change the bed sheets and wash the dishes. I do appreciate her quick response but after traveling several hours I was disappointed to say the least to have to change bed linens and pick up someone else’s dirty towels and put them in the washer."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well appointed, clean and great location."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! All area restaurants are wonderful! Went to Rhinegeist Brewery and on a Riverboat Cruise! Great weekend!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a comfortable, clean, affordable place to stay in OTR - look no further. This is the perfect place for two people. The condo is in a secure building close to lots of restaurants, bars and historic sites."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely decoarted second floor apartment steps away from Taft's Ale House and walking distance to many other restaurants and Washington Sqare Park. Lots to do in the area. Easy check in and great communication from the host.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredible find in the heart of Over the Rhine, just steps away from many of the very best restaurants in Cincinnati. I find it hard to imagine staying anywhere else during our future trips to the city."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Janet’s place was great. Clean and place was as shown in the pictures. I would recommend family and friends to stay at her place.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Janet for a wonderful place to stay in Downtown Cincinatti! The place was exactly as described and decorated beautifully. Check in and check out was super easy and stress free. It was so nice to have a place so close to everything so that if it got too chilly we could run back to the apartment and grab and coat in no time. There’s a parking lot right around the corner just steps away from the apartment that is safe and super easy to access. Loved it here. Will have to come back again soon.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Janet was super friendly and very commutative! Answered all my questions in a timely manner, when I was looking to book her place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Janet and Chris were so accommodating and readily accepted my very last minute booking. I had an issue with the hot water when I checked in and within 20 minutes Chris came to rectify the issue (which literally just required clicking a switch). There were also really nice amenities provided like individual makeup wipes, and a sleep spray. The space was really clean and new. Wifi was high speed. A Keurig and coffee K-cups were provided which is always a winner! Definitely would book again for my next stay in Cincinnati"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at many Airbnb's, and Josh's place was hands down the best place we have ever had the privilege of staying in. Josh was proactive and responsive for any questions we had. The instructions for checking in were easy to follow. Loved the personal elevator! The place was open, airy, bright and clean. There was so much storage space to put our personal items. The soaking tub was a great bonus after lots of walking. We parked the car in a parking garage directly behind the building and didn't use the car until we checked out. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. When we come back, Josh's place will be our first choice. If you want to feel like royalty, this is the place for you. A great place for rest and relaxation. An added bonus, there weren't a lot of chores to do at check out."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at The Historic Lyric! Beautiful space, cool old elevator and walking distance to many bars/restaurants! Very pretty interior, and comfy beds."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, communicative host. Speedy response to questions. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Cincinnati and renting Josh's Air BNB. The Air BNB was exactly how it was listed. The location was great and walkable to anything you would want to see, visit or eat in downtown or Over the Rhine area of Cincinnati. I highly recommend this particular Air BNB if your ever are in the Cincinnati area and need a place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay with no issues. We stay in Cincinnati at least once a year and Josh's place has moved to the top of the list for our next trip.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, large, and well appointed. Great location, close to lots of activity, and close to the streetcar route, bringing even more to do. One of the best places we've ever stayed!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every AirBnb that I have rented always looks better in the pictures than in actuality. Not Josh's place -- the place was even better than the pictures that were shown (and the pictures were VERY nice). This place was incredible!!! It was so spacious, so clean, and had everything we needed. I cannot recommend this place enough. It was walkable to downtown, so perfect for the Flying Pig weekend, great for a Reds or Bengals game, or any concert that would be downtown. I would come back here in a heartbeat. It was the Presidential Palace, and it exceeded its name."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was one of the best I’ve ever stayed at! The place was not only sparkling clean but also luxurious. The personal elevator was a really cool feature that added a unique touch to our stay. Everything about this place was top-notch, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of luxury in their travels. Can't wait to come back!"""

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay if needing to stay downtown…quick walking access to Duke Energy Center and Paycor Stadium. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here! Would definitely rebook whenever we’re in Cincinnati again. This was perfect for my husband and 10 month old. Josh was a great host and this location was never more than 15 mins from where we wanted to go. We had some issues with the valet from the hotel next door when we initially arrived and tried unloading. Outside of this there are no complaints. Great air bnb!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible spot, place was spacious and well maintained. Entry information was easy to access and would definitely recommended staying here for future trips to Cincinnati!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful and walkable to so many restaurants and attractions, including Duke energy convention center. Josh was incredibly accommodating, cordial, and an overall great host. We could not have asked for a more beautiful living space at an unbelievably great price."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we absolutely loved staying here! it's in a great location, we walked to everywhere. the apartment was very. the master bed was the most comfortable bed and had the softest sheets."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was even better than the pictures! I would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to others.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous and spacious apartment. The location was super convenient for walking to restaurants and down near the river. Plus there was a dollar store just a block away.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have rented many different Airbnbs in Cincinnati, and this was one of my favorite experiences. The pictures do not do it justice! It is spacious, bright from natural light, beautifully decorated, has a vast amount of usable storage, a washer and dryer in a dedicated laundry room, and a well-stocked kitchen. It is very easy to make this place feel like your home. The beds and bedding are comfortable. Everything in the unit worked well. The location is fantastic! You are close to everything downtown has to offer. You are close to many restaurants, but a hotel serves excellent food and drinks immediately next door (30 steps from the entrance). You get the convenience of a hotel with the uniqueness of an Airbnb. While I did not have any issues with the unit, Josh was friendly and responsive when I wanted to reach out to him to let him know I was leaving. Undoubtedly, if there ever were a problem, he would resolve it. I will rent from Josh again when I'm in Cincinnati."
