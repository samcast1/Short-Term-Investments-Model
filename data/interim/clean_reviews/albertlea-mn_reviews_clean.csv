2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay Ann's Nordic farmhouse. It's in a nice quiet setting with great historical explanations throughout the house. She also thoughtfully put out snacks and drinks for our arrival. We recommend staying here!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"we booked a week at the farm due to some maintenance work needed on our motorhome at the Winnebago factory. loved the privacy and solitude of the farm. the kids loved the animals, especially the kittens. Ann was a great host, very responsive and came by once a day to feed the animals. between the towns of Albert Lee and Austin you have everything you could need. we would stay again if we were in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My coworkers and I absolutely loved this place! The animals were super cute and friendly, and the farm hands were quick to help me with a jump when my battery was dead on my car. I loved all the old references to the original settlers in the house. The beds were comfortable and the house was cozy and spacious. Will absolutely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann's place was just what we needed for a quiet and peaceful evening on our long drive across the country. The house is quite historic and loaded with really cool antiques and items from over the years. For animal lovers, there were around a dozen barn cats, a llama, goats, and horses. There were only two of us, so we didn't need the upstairs, but a large family could stay here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at the farm. We were working in town for the week, and she was very accommodating. With apples ,showing us the horses, goats ,and llama. There are friendly cats around to greet you when you come. There was bottled water in the fridge and snacks. Coffee selection was very good from flavored to dark.
She made a special trip to bring apples for our stay. I would recommend Ann to anyone looking in the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second year here. As soon as we got here, the kids were saying how much they had missed this place, and by morning they were talking about what a great vacation it was. They love to hang out on the grounds, walk around with the animals, and hold the cats. I spend time in the kitchen or the deck, relax with coffee, cook, read, and just enjoy the peace and quiet. There are fantastic things around for short day trips -- Mystery Cave, SPAM museum, the Bison Drive -- or just hang here and play a family game, do art, and enjoy time together.
And the host Ann is just lovely. She is very responsive and helpful, and the house is set up with everything you need. Just bring your groceries and personal stuff and you are ready to relax :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an adorable farmhouse full of history and charm. Ann is a great host and it was lovely to be greeted by a cadre of kittens upon arrival!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ann’s farm is a fun and unique place to stay. It’s near the highway but feels like another world, with horses, a llama, goats and barn cats.
The house is historic and has many touches of Norway that are the real deal. There’s so much to look at and many interesting books besides. Ann is a great host and super responsive. Highly recommend for a relaxing experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Ann’s it was just the break we needed on our move across the country. My kids really enjoyed the animals and the toys!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! Ann took the time to introduce my daughter to the animals and was very friendly and responsive. The house was well stocked with essentials, and extras such as bottled water and snacks."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the farmhouse and would definitely stay again. My granddaughter loved her own space and all the toys. It was a fun house to visit.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,KITTENS. KITTENS EVERYWHERE! And llamas! And a beautiful European home! What a hidden oasis.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Private, peaceful and a kind responsive hostess."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the farm, especially the barn cats. The house was really cool and cozy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved being on this private mini farm with friendly ponies, horses, goats, cats and kittens, and a llama. We also loved the Norwegian decor, and generous supplies."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Nordic farm and especially all the animals that my grandchildren loved. Ann was so easy to communicate with and treated us with snacks and bottled water. It was truly an experience of staying at a farm out in the country.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time we have stayed here. we love the animals and private space. lol forward to returning.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Very clean and had everything you might need to make your stay enjoyable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed the Nordic Farm. The animals were fun and the house was as described
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was cozy yet spacious. Ann provided snacks and bottled water which was after our long trip.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our only regrets were not being able to spend more time at the Nordic. We got there after 10 pm and had to leave early the next morning. Would have loved to spend more time with the animals and to take in the house and culture that Ann has carefully placed throughout. The history of the house/farm itself was very interesting. Ann was very helpful and went the second mile in making sure we had everything we needed to make our stay a good experience. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Ann.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Neat place to stay, full of history and unique decor. Loved meeting the horses, llama, goats, and barn cats."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Honestly, after a five-night getaway, we are missing this place! It was so cool. Lovely to have the farm animals around, interesting 19th century home, and all the amenities we could have hoped for. It felt very peaceful and private, while still being only a 10- to 15-minute drive away from groceries and other things to do. We had a great time in downtown Albert Lea (112 on Broadway) and the Brookside Dog Park. I hope we can stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann is a great host! It had everything I needed for a clean and comfortable country stay. I enjoyed being around the animals. Hope to come again. Thanks Ann!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is right off the highway on a dirt road. The barn has many beautiful cats and the farm has horses, llama, goats and a lot of fun for young and old. The kitchen had all the supplies for us to make our meals and we also loved the Keurig coffee machine. The fridge and freezer had lots of snacks and water bottles for our use which we deeply appreciated. We enjoyed the pride festival in Albert Lea and the spam museum in Austin both of which were only 15 minutes from the farm. A really wonderful stay for our family."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ann’s Farm House was a wonderful experience and I would definitely do it again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann was extremely friendly and very responsive to my messages. The location is beautiful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ann was thoughtful, generous, and accommodating! Her communication was excellent; she was only ever a text away! The farm is private, primitive, and the home is quaint. We all agreed that it was like going to our Grandma's Patty's house, which is also lovingly filled with cultural items and has a rather historical vibe. If we ever find ourselves in this area again, we would definitely stay at the Nordic Horse!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ann’s place was the perfect restorative pause for our family during a cross country move. My daughter loved the horses and other farm animals, our pup enjoyed the fenced yard, and my husband and I loved being able to catch our breath in a lovely space after a week on the road."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a treat to stay on a farm with miniature horses and a llama! We loved Ann’s place. It is a wonderful retreat and a glimpse into early Minnesota farm life. Plus there are miniature horses and a llama to say hello to! Our dog loved the yard and the bed was super comfy. All around great stay, thank you, Ann!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our Family had a unique and fun experience here. The home was very spacious and charming. Fun decor to see and alot of fun history to it. The animals were fun to be around and even just watch. Ann left bottled water and snacks that was so nice of her. Beds were comfortable and lots of extra stuff around for kids, books and toys. We would recommend this place for a wonderful experience ."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fun and unique stay! Ann's Lama was absolutely funny to watch, she had so much attitude, the rest of the animals were fun to be around too. Bedding was clean, kitchen was clean, and the bathroom was great. Lots of kitchen and bathroom supplies, including coffee and creamer provided! This was a great place to visit the southern Minnesota State Parks, loved hiking and kayaking at Myre-Big Island State Park."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann was responsive to my messages before and during our stay. She was very accommodating with the check-in and check-out times we requested. There was so much to see and enjoy inside the house - and the farm animals were fun, as well. The narrow stairs to the upper level could be a little challenging for some, otherwise everything else was pretty convenient. Fairly close to both Albert Lea and Austin, which suited us well."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay. The host was a great communicator and proactively reached out prior to and during our stay. This is a very old farmhouse with a Nordic theme. The decor and trinkets to look at in the house were endless. We appreciated the bottled water. The house was comfortable and was extremely well furnished with necessities. The heating worked very well. Guests should be aware that the stairs to the upper level are very steep, but that is to be expected in a farmhouse that is over 100 years old. Access to the house requires driving on about 2 miles of gravel road."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 2nd stay at Ann's place, both times were delightful to me. My oldest daughter was with me this time and well pleased with it all, also. If you want peace, quiet and a true farm feeling this is the place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ann's place was perfect! I really enjoyed the house. The animals were fun and sweet. I really enjoyed the Llama and horses. Town is only 10 minutes away which includes several restaurant options and grocery.
I feel terrible because a glass item got freakishly broken, but Ann was very understanding and sweet about it. I offered to replace it, but she declined."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nordic Farm was peaceful, and beautiful. As soon as you step in the door, you are transported to Norway. PERFECT decoration. The animals were friendly and fabulous. Thank you, Anne!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This farm was great for a weekend getaway with the family. Very homey and relaxing, with fun things to do nearby. The kids loved the animals, and I loved chatting with Ann and learning about the history of the home.
We were here during a small snowstorm, and home was warm and the walls kept things quiet! Would love to return soon!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our Thanksgiving at the farm house with our family. It really felt like home. The animals were a plus. Would definitely go back again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb get away was a perfect dream for what I wanted and needed. An entire quiet farmhouse all to myself in the country with farm animals like horses etc right outside the patio door. I really enjoyed this stay and truly I didn’t want to leave this amazing cozy home on my last day there. I will be promoting this place to my friends and family and I hope to be able to spend time here again in the future. Thank you so much for such a great experience!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family of 5 had a good stay here! The animals were friendly and there was enough space for all of us.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, charming house. My kids loved the animals (llama, dwarf horses, goats, cats). Ann really cares about her guests and it shows. She had snacks out waiting on us. The place was also nice and warm when we got there on a cool Iowa night. Ann was also great about communicating. Easy check-in and check-out. The house has character and we had a great stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to experience a farm stay similar to that in the 40's/50's--go here. The house is older but well kept up with all modern equipment inside; lots of fun things to do and see inside the house. Outside you have the whole farm to yourself with lots of animals to play with and places to explore. I am 81 years old and totally loved this place. Ann is an excellent host, quick to answer any needs you might have and checking in regularly to see if all is ok but not intrusive. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Large, lived-in, farmhouse right off
I-90. Lots of kitties, goats, horses and a llama. Big kitchen, perfect for our group. The three bedrooms upstairs are not private. You walk through the first to get to the second and through the first and second to get to the third. The downstairs bedroom is wonderful. Snacks and bottled water were plentiful and a welcoming touch. The house is chock-full of stuff. My only ""complaint"" would be the mothball smell. For the price and the description, I thought it would be more upscale, but I don't regret choosing the farm for our stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,2nd time here. Everything you need. Will return.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here. Midway through a 3500 mile drive (with four Golden Retrievers), it was the perfect respite. It's an old farmhouse- well-maintained, immaculately clean, and completely unpretentious. There's a real television with real local stations, no smart tv needed. Inside is comfortable, outside is spectacular. The kitchen was well-stocked, perfectly designed, with a deck overlooking the ponies. Amenities were plentiful, more than I needed. Hand-made quilts, vintage wine glasses, friendly goats- my pups and I were in heaven. Best night's sleep I've had in months. Thank you, Ann."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at this house. It was cozy and inviting, centrally located between Austin and Albert Lea. We would stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gem. perfect location for a night’s stay on a cross-country road trip. the property is beautiful, the goats are friendly and the gnomes are plentiful! so peaceful and perfect for our dog to freely explore the fenced area of the yard. hope to be back again in the future."
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Directions to place clear, easily found. I gave it a 2 overall because it was just so stuffed with stuff, and immediately upon entering smelled this old house, musty/dusty smell which triggered my sinuses to swell andmy throat and voice scratchy the next day. 2 small horses needed brushed and burs removed from solidly matted manes and tails. In general whole place needs attention inside and out, and massive de-cluttering"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,awesome stay and Ann was a great host
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was spotless and had everything anyone would need. The host’s communication/response time was great. Of note for future renters - three bedrooms are upstairs and the staircase is a bit steep if you have slight mobility issues. Also, the yard was a bit overgrown."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love this space!!!!! It is by far my favorite airbnb. Our 2nd visit was wonderful like the 1st time.
The beds are comfortable so you can get some good rest. The master bedroom has an alcove for a youngster to sleep which I liked.
The kitchen is well equipped for making meals and plently of utensils and dishes. That is good for my family of 7.
The bathroom shower is good where most places I have stayed dont have good water pressure.
The horses, llama and cats/kittens and goats were such a treat to interact with. The kids enjoyed feeding the animals and playing on the swing outside.
Wifi worked well around the space.
The host, Ann, was great with communication and made sure we had everything we needed. She even had some snacks on the kitchen island for the kids. Such a nice touch.
Another great experience, Hopefully we can make another trip here in the future."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a nice stay at Ann's place. The house was as described. There are plenty of board games, books, and games to entertain all ages. This would be a relaxing, unique stay for a family."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place had a magical storybook feel, with hardly a room that didn't have some sort of gnome, horse, or cool Nordic item. Our kids loved playing in the house and with the animals on the farm."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The host is a marvelous communicator and has a very cozy property!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This rental offers a unique farm-stay experience. The home is filled with owner's personal collection of Scandinavian and farmhouse memorabilia. The farm animals are entertaining, especially the baby goat, and scenery is down home Minnesota."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly what we were looking for. Nice break in the country from our busy trip. Animals were a lot of fun to watch and entertain the kids.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed waking up in the morning and watching the horses and the llama
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Just far enough away from everything but not too far. interstate is close but not disruptive.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great REAL farm stay. Our kids loved the animals, games, and swing outside-endless hours of fun. Tons of space to spread out."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ann’s farm would be good for a family. The animals, horses, kittens, goats and Llama were fun to watch."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem. Great place, with 4 comfy beds, and a big kitchen. Lots of outdoor space, and the animals are so fun to interact with. Wonderful spot!!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a unique stay! Lots of animals which my daughter adored. She also loved the toy barn in the house.
The house was really clean. We were only here one night as a rest night on a long haul road trip. I appreciated that there were plenty of towels, pillows, dishes, coffee, etc."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Peaceful country/farm setting. A lovely place to stay! Ann was a great host.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the best airbnbs ever: spotlessly clean, quiet, convenient to I90, beautiful landscape and animals. So pastoral and thoughtfully arranged inside. Norwegian decor was beautiful and interesting, with so much character. Just like visiting grandma's house, so homey, spacious and peaceful. A perfect stay and a great night's sleep. Thank you Ann!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at the farm, it was everything we expected and more. We loved all the animals and communication we received from Ann. Definitely a place we look forward to returning to."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy 'lil Scandinavian retreat with many furry critters to greet. 😀
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Lots of room and everything was clean! Ann is a pleasure to deal with and communication is great. We loved the animals and being secluded but still close to town
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall we had a nice experience. It was a comfortable place and fun to have the animals around.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Ann’s farmhouse. It is charming and comfortable.
Ann is a fabulous host, quick with communications and very knowledgeable about the property’s history."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nordic Horse is exactly what we expected, a relaxing and private getaway from the city. There are no neighbors in the immediate area, and the highway while nearby is still far enough off to not be too loud or noticeable. The house itself is a beautiful older design and Ann has done a fantastic job making it comfortable and welcoming. All of the animals on the property were very friendly, and Ann herself was a delight to chat with about the history and future of the place. Definitely recommended to stay at least two nights here to properly enjoy it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful house… very easy to locate.. there is a gravel approach road parallel to highway 90 to reach house… house has soo many items which shows the Norwegian heritage.. very relaxed and enjoyed a lot.. easily 3 family can stay here.. if you are grilling, bring your tongs and spatula .. there are around 9 cats in the barn which are very friendly.. my son loved them..this house is fully fenced so your dog can be unleashed all time… many horses are there and there is a lama and pony which are friendly.. you will wake up seeing them outside.. sip a cup of coffee and that view will make the day.. thr are state parks near by for tracking..u should visit albertlea downtown if u stay here.. there is a lake view drive and small beach and picnic areas in downtown .. (15min from the house ) u can keep the trash outside the barn .. TV is small.. but we don’t care as we went there to relax not to watch tv.. lots of books and card games there.."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a unique place to gather! We visited over Easter weekend and it was the perfect place to spend the holiday. Our daughters loved spending time with barn cats, horses and Llama! The farmhouse is full of character and is oh so “homey”. We had a lovely stay! Thank you Ann!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect quick trip for our family - our 4 year old loves anything horses and Ann was so kind and sweet to indulge her fascination. We were very happy with our stay and hope to return!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my family and I loved our weekend at the Nordic farmhouse! Ann is the perfect host. She kept us updated on the weather as a strom started the day on our arrival day. She is so accommodating and such a genuine, caring person. The farm animals are a true bonus! Location is so relaxing!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second review of Ann's place. My first review was for our overnight stay en route to Northern Minnesota, and this stay was for our overnight stay as we made our way home. Both stays were great, Ann's place provided just what we needed. We are so glad she has a pet friendly place!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Ann's place was great! The location was just what we needed and we appreciated the ability to bring a pet. Ann's description of her place is spot on and I found most of the other reviews to be accurate as well. Everything you need for an overnight stay is there. All you will need to bring in is clothes and maybe personal items, although Ann does supply most of the items you will need to freshen up(towels, washcloths, soap, lotion, etc). Snacks, bottled water, coffee/tea are provided. We didn't have a chance to meet Ann d/t both of our overnight stays being brief(late check-in and early check-out), but she was easy to reach and very pleasant to communicate with. Check-in was simple. The beds were comfortable, and the comforters and blankets were numerous and warm. The location was just as described. Easy access to major roads but still quiet. The only thing I would echo from another review is that if someone is traveling with a ""busy"" toddler this might be a more difficult home to be in d/t the number of memorabilia and breakable items within easy reach. If we are traveling this way again, I would definitely consider this an easy choice for another stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent place to stay our generous and gracious host provided nearly everything to make our stay comfortable. I would highly recommend this house to anyone staying in the area.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann’s place is a lot fun with the ponies & llamas and cats. She was so great to allow all of our family’s goldens and they were safe in a fenced yard.
Ann was easy to communicate with."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Norwegian homestead from the 1800’s ~ a warm gathering place which felt imbued with fellow traveler soul and care. Thank you again, Ann! - we had a happy reunion with family & friends, horses, & a llama, too * : )"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann’s home was the perfect cozy stay after a long, cold drive. The second you walk into her home you feel warmth and comfort. Even though the home had plenty of space, it felt like a cozy home. I loved exploring the yard and watching the horses and llama play. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was fun looking through all of her books and games. Stay at this haven whenever you’re in Minnesota!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann’s place is amazing and fun!! She made sure that we had everything we needed for a relaxing stay.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient farm stay and off the interstate. Snacks in the kitchen were a nice touch.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann was beyond helpful with check in and questions. The farm is so relaxing and the animals are friendly! Loved looking at all of the Norwegian decorations, books and photographs."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very unique experience that we found so enjoyable. Sitting at the kitchen table looking out at the llama and miniature horses made for a perfect breakfast setting. The house is spacious and welcoming - the downstair's bedroom is extremely inviting and comfortable. There are touches of pride in Norwegian heritage everywhere. The fenced in yard was perfect for our dog. This home is exactly what we love about Airbnb. An opportunity to experience a way of life in a genuine real world setting!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly charming place to stay!! We loved all the decorations and really enjoyed the animals.
Would stay here again, 100%!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay in a little farm house. We loved it!
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice home on a farm. Very secluded which was great. Met a friendly barn cat which was a nice surprise. Very comfortable beds with A/C. Just what we needed.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"cute and cozy, feels a lot like staying at home but without the stress.
with two young boys, I did not want to be cramped up in a little hotel room. this had plenty of space and the farm animals sealed the deal, the kids were enamored.
Ann was very responsive to my messages and questions. there's plenty of amenities in case you forget anything. there were plenty of books and little toys to keep them busy inside in the evening. there's a little kid/toddler bed in the master room which is nice for those that might be a little scared sleeping in a new place.
you can tell there's a lot of history in the house which I find fascinating and the Scandinavian decor is nice. i loved the hand painted houses in the dining area."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place for a farm stay feel - beautiful horses and lovely green setting where trees and flowers abound! The host had so many thoughtful extras throughout the house and an abundance of treats for adults and kids alike. Even emergency frozen foods in the freezer! Lots and beds, blankets and treasures of Norway and other travels - this home can accommodate many guests - with easy freeway access."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place to get away and relax. Great host with great communication.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second trip to the Nordic Horse Farm, and we will be planning a third soon. Ann is a thoughtful, generous host. My family loves everything about the farm. The house is unique and cozy (and fully stocked!). It is full of books, games, and beautiful treasures to look at. The animals are the best! Ann got Scout, one of the ponies, out for our nine-year-old twins to play with and ride. For a couple of kids who have been cut off from so much because of the pandemic, that was a huge gift, and we are really grateful. And we got organic vegetables from the garden as well! Thanks so much, Ann. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great Communication!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We look forward to any chance to visit Ann and the Nordic Horse. She is such a brilliant, creative, well-traveled woman and really makes her farm house feel like home away from home. We absolutely love all of the animals on the farm.. especially back porch visits from the cats! Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Relaxing atmosphere and handy to the freeway. Ann is quick to respond if we had questions. Enjoyed coffee on the deck and watching horses 🐎.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann’s place is truly one of a kind - a big farm house complete with all needed amenities plus cute animals! This isn’t a 4 star hotel… but it’s not supposed to be! Unplug and relax by feeding the mini horses and llama. :-)
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice. relaxing place to stay; would be especially good for a big family - the kids would love it. The only drawback is the location - just 1 block off a fairly busy highway. But if we come to this area again we'll probably stay here.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Nordic horse farm. The place was beautifully decorated and it was such fun to look at all the little knick knacks and items around the house. All the rooms had their own flair. My husband and I stayed downstairs and our bed was super comfy to sleep in.
The kids enjoy the farm immensely. There was a swing out back, a play area and ride on toys available. We bought some apples and carrots to feed the llama and horses with approval by the owner. We were also allowed to pick some little tomatoes she had growing. The only thing is I wish we could have stayed longer! I truly would like to stay here again if we ever came out this way."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect stopover with our two kids while visiting family in nearby Albert Lea. The house is like a museum! So many books and trinkets to explore, lots of toys and games for the kiddos. The beds were comfortable and clean. Air conditioning kept things cool. The highlight was the fenced in yard for the dog and feeding apples to the horses. We’ll definitely stay here again!
PS If you have kids that have a tendency to be rough / break things or need a kid-proof space - this is not it."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann is a great host! Her communication is super quick and letting our daughter play with the horses was amazing.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It feels just like going to grandma or grandpa’s house, with all the little things you’d enjoy about going there. Comfortable beds, temperature, and all around great!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice place with plenty of beds, the home is clean. we enjoyed the remote location. Ann is a very laid back host."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very spacious. Lots of breakable items, so it was a little hard to have the littles running around without constantly telling them not to touch things. But this is a great location, there are plenty of places to go near here if it rains (which it did the weekend we stayed) such as the Medford Outlet, Spam Museum, or the Reptile Zoo in Medford. But besides that, the house was wonderful. It was very quiet, tucked away, and there is a super awesome bungee swing in the backyard. Ann was very sweet, and very great with communicating. I will definitely be making this an annual trip, and if you stay at the Nordic Horse Farm, you will want to also!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Felt so homey, but with lots of conveniences for travel! The place is exactly as advertised and was very convenient to the Interstate, as we were road-tripping across country. Loved the touch of to-go coffee cups in the morning! My girls (3 and 8) loved exploring the home and property, choosing a bed (all of which were very comfortable) and playing with the collections of toys and books. There's many beautiful antiques and collectibles for the adults to explore as well. Great stay!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann’s place is like stepping into a lovely Norwegian home. Beds were very comfortable and house is very roomy. Kitchen was well stocked and lots of thoughtful touches. Very relaxing stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! The home was well maintained and clean. It is a charming old farmhouse. The horses were beautiful and we were able to pet them and feed the llama. The host was friendly and communication was great. She had snacks, coffee, and kitchen essentials. Relatively close to grocery and a state park."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann’s place is wonderful in every detail. Our family of 6 was quickly passing through and needed a comfy and quiet place to stay the night on I-90, have breakfast, and go. Unfortunately, when it came time to leave the kids were so sad!! There were enough games and toys and adorable animals about to entertain the kiddos for days. I highly recommend the place."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful time and Ann is a fantastic host. After our first day we decided to book another weekend for the fall! The house is clean and fully stocked, as well as very pretty, and totally welcoming. The animals are a rare and extraordinary bonus. There are lots of interesting books and games, as well as cozy spots to read. We can't wait to visit again in September!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay exactly how it looks in the add. Very peaceful and relaxing. Enjoyed looking at all the cute knickknacks around the house and seeing all the animals outside. Very clean and welcoming. I look forward to staying there again with my kiddos. Ann was very easy to communicate with and answered any messages or questions I had right away.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Ann's place is conveniently located off the highway and has a fun and unique feeling. Our daughter enjoyed playing with the toys that were provided and counting all the Norwegian gnomes! We said hi to the beautiful animals and enjoyed some extras like Keurig coffee. Having a kitchen gave us some respite from take-out and hotel living in a cross-country trip. Thanks!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home is exactly as the listing outlines, in the middle of working farm and an older home that is authentically decorated and reflects the owner’s taste.
Would recommend checking in early while there is sunlight out but the process is very easy and the owner is accommodating."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay a lot. The house is full of Scandinavian memorabilia. Kids enjoyed watching horses, and llama. Great, quiet location."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would recommend this place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were traveling from Kansas City to Minneapolis, moving our son. He wanted a safe, spacious place for the moving truck with his belongings. My husband was an exchange student to Norway. Ann’s place was easy to find, a quick drive off I-35. It’s well appointed with everything we needed, and there were many fun collections to see. Beds were comfortable and we enjoyed strolling around in the morning, chatting with the horses and enjoying the peace."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at Ann's farm. It was a lot of fun to see all her animals too!
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Five of us met at Ann’s cozy farm home for a girls weekend. It was the perfect place with plenty of sleeping space for everyone. Ann has lots of personal touches - snacks on the counter and bottled water in the fridge. Loved watching the animas. Great location. We will definitely visit again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When you stay at Anne's, you can expect a throwback to times-gone-by when form mattered more over function and things were made to last. Yes, the house is old but it is just so warm, so large and feels so friendly. If you are passing through this way, stay at Anne's..."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,I was not pleased with our stay. As we arrived people were exiting the house. Someone came in the evening to do chores for the animals - I expected more privacy. Abandoned vehicles in the yard. Overall unkempt. No access to wifi. Small 13 inch (guesstimate) only tv in the whole house. Fridge was full of items.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Great communication. Loved visiting the animals. We would stay again.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Ann's place is a quaint country house. There are many things to look at...definitely like a glimpse at Norway. The house is well stocked and there is a generous supply of towels and bedding. The horses are wonderful to see.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My toddler son and I had a fantastic time at the Nordic Horse farm. It was really like an Airbnb Stay and Experience combined, since Ann and her son gave us tours of their other two farms nearby, and my son got to sit on one of the ponies and pet all kinds of animals. This stay really felt like what Airbnb was originally, a stay at someone else's home - it felt like we were staying at grandma's house for the weekend. There were lots of toys for my son to play with, an ample kitchen and bedrooms. The home is older (as described in the listing) and charming with lots of knick knacks so if you're searching for a modern stay this may not be the right place for you."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"A very nice location, easy to find, close to the highway but far enough away not to be bothered by highway noises. Plenty of room to maneuver our trucks with trailers. A nice yard for the dog."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,amazing set up and view of animals! quickly responded when needed as well
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Completely recommended.
My family and I were looking for something a little different for Spring Break this year - and we found it here. We were able to experience the farm, the animals, dirt roads and a house built by Norwegian immigrants 150 years ago.
Ann was an outstanding host - easy to reach, prompt to respond, and very knowledgeable . The house has a very functional layout for five guests (3 kids and 2 adults). It was clean and had all the needed amenities. The Scandinavian books and art was a welcome bonus.
I would definitively consider staying again if the opportunity arose. Tusen takk!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Ann was very accommodating with our schedule. We enjoyed our time in this old farm house. Kids would enjoy this as well with all the horses and other animals around.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy and spacious cottage with abundant amenities. Host was friendly and communicative. Overall a great find and stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann is a wonderful host, and the animals are very welcoming--especially the barn cats! It was such an incredibly relaxing time, and full of history! You get to feel like a rancher, walk around with your hands on your hips and say ""yep."" as much as your heart desires. Highly recommended, especially to animal lovers out there!"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be reserving the home again. It was exactly what we wanted for our time with familiy.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I travel alot and stay at airbnbs all the time but this one was my favorite! I'm an animal lover so this was perfect! Loved the Norway feel to it! Cats, Horses and llama was awesome! Will be back!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a charming place and I got the bet night's sleep in the quiet location! Ann was great to communicate with! I think it would be great for couples or small groups. I had no problem being there on my own, but single travelers should be aware that it can feel a bit removed. I loved that aspect - but come prepared with all food needs and a spirit of farm house adventure! The barn cats are loving and amazing!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you're looking for a spot near Albert Lea. Fun to be on the farm and see the animals!
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"was a good place to stay was perfect for what we needed it for....place to stay for a job we had to work in Austin, MN, one thing for a heads up to people that might find this a very important necessity in life but the water was very hard and well water this doesn't bother me especially for the 2 days we were there.
Ann was a good host and quick responses"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really enjoyed our stay here! the llama was great and the horses and kitties were very social and fun to hang out with. Beautiful property and very cozy house, with plenty of places to sleep and kitchen appliances. Really felt like Norwegian countryside, and an excellent host!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the home was amazing,, the cats were so friendly and the experience was unmatched...truly enjoyed getting away from everything ...ann is so kind she truly set the bar for hosts"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we’ve stayed at Ann’s b&b and we loved it more than the first time. It’s always clean and has everything you might need. I love staying there and seeing the animals. Just a great place to stay at!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay and it was fun to be on a working farm. Great value, kid-friendly, cute barn cats, fluffy ponies. Thanks, Ann!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked well for us. Appreciated the Covid protocols and the extra touches of produce and flowers.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very sweet house with so many amazing touches! It's fun to have the horses, cats and llama there too! I had a lovely stay"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy. A real farmhouse, as if your grandma just left and is gone for a couple of days. Good hot shower. Large. Be ready to see lots of grandma’s knickknacks."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"nice quiet place to relax, loved all the decorations."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house is lovely, and was perfect for my family of four to stay while road tripping across the country. Everything was very comfortable, and a lot of care was put into making the place homey and providing guests everything they could need. Also some very cute cats and other animals to greet you!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My delightful greeting party was three barn cats, seemingly waiting for my arrival. I had a great time at Ann's farmhouse. The house is a unique experience to see the world through a lifetime of stories Ann has collected and placed for her guests to enjoy. Don't miss the opportunity."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann is very kind and thoughtful and responds quickly to any issues.
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place. Patio faces south and gets direct sun most of the day (no shade). Water pressure is good. Quiet even though it's near the highway. Gravel road from highway to the house. Snacks and disinfectant wipes were a nice touch.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super quaint and cute place! It was so really neat to wake up and see horses and llamas out the windows too. Ann is very nice, accommodating, and responds to you quickly. Highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway!"
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Nordic Horse is rustic and a true 19th century farm-house. The location is right off the highway, so I suggest using the fans provided to act as white noise.
The house is decorated with lots of Scandinavian art, which can feel a bit cluttered.
Ann provides water and snacks, which is very nice. We found the water in the house to smell like sulfur, so we stuck to bottled water.
If you love animals and want a unique experience for a great value, the Nordic Horse is the place for you."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value, right off the highway, and still peaceful."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An awesome place to stay! It's incredible comfy and homey. My kid's loved it. They literally played for hours with the three barn cats and feed the llama apples. The place is very large and plenty of room for our family of five. My 11 yr old said it was the best airbnb we had ever stayed in! Ann is excellent host and provided food and drinks for breakfast! Would definitely stay again if in the area!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann’s place is off the beaten path, but still close enough that you can be in Albert Lea in a matter of minutes.
It was exactly as advertised, and our son enjoyed seeing the animals and playing with the cats.
Anna does an excellent job at staying in touch."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,So convenient - right off I-90!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved our stay on Ann's farm! It reminded us of going to grandma's house. The kids ran up and down the driveway, visiting the animals and petting the barn kitties. Ann had snacks, coffee and breakfast for us! There was plenty of space for our six person family to sleep...the built in toddler bed fit our seven year old perfectly! How quaint!! We hope to visit again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann's home was lovely. Clean, comfortable, and perfect location. The house is amazing, filled with all sorts of unique treasures. Make sure you read the photo book about the storm of 2019. Fascinating! We loved staying at the farm and getting to meet the animals. The extra touches - hand sanitizer left out, bottled water, snacks - were so appreciated and made us feel safe and comfortable after a long day on the road."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Such a wonderful place to really unwind and enjoy quiet country living!! Ann is such a wonderful host and is always quick to respond. The farm animals are an added bonus!!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was very beautiful and quiet. There were two friendly barn cats that would come out when I went on the patio. Very calm and peaceful, I couldn’t hear any cars or traffic. I had no problems and thoroughly enjoyed my time there, Ann was very helpful and kind. This is the perfect getaway spot!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet and comfortable. Great communication too!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely space! So nice to be around the animals and a beautiful landscape. Perfect place for our one night in Minnesota.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved everything about this place. The house is so charming with all of its Scandinavian decor, and it was wonderful to say hello to all of the farm animals including two very friendly cats who liked to follow us around. Ann is also incredibly nice, and she answered my phone calls right away when I had questions. If I ever need to visit this area of Minnesota again, I'll definitely be staying here again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed twice - once on the way up to the North Shore, and again on our way home. It is hard to find a place, at this time, where we felt comfortable. Ann’s place fit the bill."

2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to hang out with your family, you will enjoy Norse Horse. We met up with our adult children there for a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed cooking meals together, playing games and just enjoying each other's company. Our host, Ann, was always easy to reach and very accommodating."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nordic House made for a perfect relaxing weekend away. Its clean, comfortable and well-located with a lot of charm. We loved having breakfast while watching the llama and horses each morning. Ann was responsive and helpful throughout our stay."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann's farm is a wonderful stay; it's full of unique Nordic decorations and is very large. The bedrooms and kitchen were very nice, and there was plenty of water and snacks available for us. There are some ponies, a llama, and multiple horses on site for you to see. I enjoyed coffee on the deck in the morning, watching the ponies run around! Definitely worth the value."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Nordic Horse was a great place to stay. It is a charming and cozy place. We enjoyed the peacefulness of being alone on the farm with the horses and llama. Would definitely recommend!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just a treat coming up here. We got to meet Ann this trip and she is the sweetest. If you are in need of a place near Albert Lea, this is my recommendation. It's minutes from Albert Lea and we'll secluded.
Ann takes care of everyone who stays there and has such a kind heart."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann is a wonderful host the the farm is so charming. I only wish we had more time to enjoy it, and the animals that live on the property. We needed a night's sleep on our way back home to Chicago from South Dakota and this place was perfect and Ann was very accommodating and responsive. Got us closer to home, it is right off the highway but very quiet, sparkling clean, beautifully decorated. We enjoyed looking at all the Norwegian decorations and furniture. It felt like living in a different time. I highly recommend it. Not to forget, we fed some apples to the llama and the little ponies that live on the property on our way out. My 4 year old daughter was so excited about this little adventure."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Great communication very quiet location. Will stay here again

Highly recommended"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nordic horse farm was easy to get to. Ann was the perfect host, the house was well stocked with snacks, as there is not much in the immediate area, and the beds were very comfortable. Dimity the llama was a bonus! We would stay here again."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, rustic getaway in the country. Turn thermostat all the way down, then reset to desired temperature."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a quaint farmhouse with a very convenient location. We were happy that the weather was only cold and not snowy as it may have made the lane hard to maneuver. Loved that there were 4 separate sleeping areas and all of the beds were comfortable. This is an older farmhouse and due to additions, there are slight differences in the height of the floors as you move from room to room. This is something that you may want to consider if someone in your party has mobility issues. There are also 4 steps leading to the front door. Overall, we enjoyed out stay!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great family stay! Ann was soooo accommodating with the winter weather and the games and toys for the kids made the stay easy! Would stay again.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved staying at Ann’s place. The house is cozy and very charming with lots of Norwegian decorations. The horses came to greet me at the gate. It was a hoot seeing a lama outside the living room window. Everything was very clean. Soft, pillow like bed. Very quiet. Easy access just off I-90. Highly recommended."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ann was a great host. I truly enjoyed our conversations and the welcoming atmosphere of the farm. Of course, a free roaming Llama doesnt hurt!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet, quiet farm house. Great find. Great Host."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann is a great host. She is such an interesting person to talk to... many interesting life experiences.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very secluded and quiet place. Relaxing.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful!!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay! The house felt like we belonged there. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The farm animals were friendly especially the lama which really does beg for apples and knows when you are bringing them out and runs across the pasture. We will definitely be staying at the Nordic house again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Ann’s B&B was my first ever B&B experience. It was very cute and cozy. The house was very warm and inviting but overall my favorite part was the animals. Horses, llama, barn cats and kittens. It was a very comfortable stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,One of the most cozy and homey AirBnB I've ever stayed!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann’s place is amazing with enough room for a good sized family. The farm animals are fun and the house is decorated with antiques and plenty of reading material. But the best part is Ann herself. She is one of the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. Her stories and philosophies on various topics make for some very engaging conversation. Whether you’re seeking a nice place to rest or seeking the meaning of life, this is the place to go."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My second time staying here and it was great....again! I hope to be back a third time. Ann is very easy to work with.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was cozy and quiet. I was traveling with my young daughter and see loved the cats outside and the kid-sized bed in the downstairs bedroom.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ann is an amazing hostess. So many wonderful sweet personal touches. A great respite from the city life. I will be back again. Thanks for your hospitality!!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming farm house. All the amenities that you could ask for. Ann is a fabulous host. We give this Air B&B a 6 out of 5 stars. Plenty of space for everyone!!!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely place. It’s like a historic site but with all modern amenities. It is full of interesting details inside. Plus the cats, horses, llama, and fresh vegetables offer so much fun. We wish we could have stayed more nights."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Ann's wonderful little farm has been one of our favorite Airbnb experiences. We had the pleasure of having a personal tour of the property from Ann when we arrived. The tour even included feeding the friendly llama and horses. We wished we would have had the time to talk with Ann a little longer. The home itself was very clean, cozy, and stocked with anything you may need. There is a large vegetable garden in front of the house that you're able to pick fresh veggies out of. Our second day we had planned to drive out to a state park to go hiking, but we were just as content to stay on the farm with the kids for part of the afternoon. The kids loved feeding the horses hay, feeding the llama apples, and playing with the barn cats. They were pleasantly surprised to find a new born litter of kittens in the barn. Overall, I would absolutely recommend staying here. My guests and I would stay again in a heartbeat. The farmhouse is cozy and comfortable, the farm animals are an entertaining addition, and Ann is a wonderful and gracious host."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The highway exit 163 was closed due to major highway construction and we decided to keep driving. Ann was very understanding about this last minute change. Hope to stay on the next trip!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Anne's charming historic farmhouse. Everything was clean, functioned well, and the place lives up to its name with Nordic themed decorations throughout. Ann made our stay easy and was good about checking in with us as we were getting into town and getting back to us as we were checking out. For an authentic local experience in southern Minnesota, I would very much recommend staying here."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ann maintains a spacious old farm house with wonderful opportunities to interact with ponies, horses, a lama and very friendly kitties."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,had a great stay nice and clean thank you

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house in a beautiful part of Albert Lea. Worked very well for our family.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I LOVED staying here, the Pattys room is so comfy, the bed is memory foam type mattress. The home seemed and smelled like staying at a grandparents.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place for Albert Lea. It only has beds for 7 because one room has a single bed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,A lovely place for my friends to stay while visiting from out of state.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our time. This house was perfect for our family of 4. Super clean and easy to access everything. Beds were comfy and temperature stayed nice and cool for the heat outside.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is beautiful and right next to the hospital. We are a family of 5, and it was the perfect spot to crash for a night on our way to the Black Hills. I was pleasantly surprised to find a pack n play for my 1 year old as I did not see it listed as an amenity. Patricia was a very responsive host and the house is in a great location (very near downtown area). Would definitely stay again on the way to our annual family vacation next year!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family stayed one night in the entire house as we were on our way home. It was what we needed and was exactly as described. Would stay there again if in the area.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall a great stay. We traveled with young kiddos though and I would not recommend unless they are old enough to do stairs independently, it is not baby or toddler proofed at all which was challenging with our crew. For older children or just adults this would be a great place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It worked out great-
The instructions were clear and straightforward"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's an old home that has been fairly well maintained. One bathroom is a bummer, and it's upstairs, and it's small. Having to be shared and only a pedestal sink - where do you put your items, towels, clothes? We were all family, so not an issue for us, but if I didn't rent the whole unit, not sure I'd be a fan. Bedrooms were spacious and cozy, treats were a nice touch! Entry and living room were generous and comfortable. (Odd that there is only 1 entry/exit in the unit - the side door is walled off for owner access to the basement.) Front screen door latch to keep open doesn't work, making hauling in stuff challenging. Kitchen was well stocked - appreciated the volume of dishes, utensils, and staples for cooking/baking. The dinning table and chairs could definitely use an upgrade, the table wings slope and the chairs are uncomfortable. It's pretty much the only usable space for games, cards, or eating. Big room, but the furniture's age (maybe by design), matches the age of the house."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters, niece and I enjoyed our stay at this property. The house is large enough to accommodate family dinners and game nights but we each had our own bedroom to retreat to at the end of some busy days. The home is located just down the street from Fountain Lake, a perfect place to enjoy a relaxing walk and beautiful sunsets."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was very comfortable for a weekend away! We enjoyed walking through the shops and by the lake.

Walking and biking distance to every place we wanted to go"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was magical. There were helpful stickers over all the cabinets describing what was in side. Little nots all over to help you along you way. Super clean and an extremely beautiful place. Will happily return when in the area.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great and easy stay, had a small issue with one of the beds that was easily and quickly rectified. I was visiting friends with the family and it was better and more cost effective to stay here rather than renting a couple of hotel rooms. My kids loved the turn of the century home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Grace House was just what we needed for our weekend in Albert Lea. It provided us a quiet place to stay after a hard day working.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Grace Place was restful with very comfortable beds.
There was a small issue with arrival instructions and the front walk had 15 inches of snow on it, (which my husband had to clear) but once communication was established, Patricia was kind and made sure we had a pleasant stay."

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Grace was a lovely place to stay. We were here for my Father's 80th birthday party in town. This home brought me back to memories of my Great Grandmother's home. It was comfortable, allowed for everyone to have their own space and yet we could chat and eat together in the living and dining rooms. We would stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice location in town.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I stayed here for a few nights while visiting family. The dining room and living room made it easy to host a large gathering. Rooms were cozy. Plenty of blankets and bedding provided. The bathroom is small but functional.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia’s home was everything we could hope for to make our Thanksgiving with family in town perfect. It allowed us to escape for some well needed rest in between festivities. Kitchen was well stocked. Only appliance not available wash dish washer. Soap was supplied for washing dishes or bring paper plates. Always appreciate having a washer and dryer to lessen packing needs. Beds are firm , but comfortable. I would highly recommend Patricia’s home for out of town guest."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space. Not often you stay in an Airbnb that really feels like a bed and breakfast (like what I remember from family vacations). So clean and beautiful, had a quick snafu (my error), my phone call was picked up and I was helped."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We where not there for long. We just stopped for night on our way through. It met our needs perfectly.

Everything was very clean and well supplied. I'm very pleased with the location and the accommodations."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall it is a great place to stay. There was a minor issue with check in but the host promptly took care of it.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place! Thanks for letting me stay.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented the house for a ""girl's weekend"" and had a very nice time. The house was very clean and the kitchen had everything we needed. There was no dishwasher, so we washed dishes before we left on our final morning.
We found the beds to be extremely comfortable. The weather was very nice and we found ourselves wishing there had been a deck, porch or patio to enjoy.
There was only one door in and out of the house - the front door. It sparked a conversation about whether or not that met the fire codes for Albert Lea.
We would stay again and recommend this location."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a wonderful gem! My friends and I went here for a girls weekend and it was perfect! Albert Lea is a nice little town with cute boutiques, beautiful lakes and wonderful architecture to look at in the houses.
Grace place was incredibly comfortable to be in! We were looking for a place to hang out together and chat and play games and just relax and this was perfect. All the beds are extremely comfortable, the kitchen is set up very well with lots of extra amenities that are normally not Airbnb‘s. Even the bathroom was stocked with extra things in case you forgot some thing. The house has the charm of a grandma‘s house, and we loved the history there. All the rooms have their own TV as well as a TV down in the living room. I just can’t state enough how wonderful to stay we had. We had a couple of questions for our host and received responses very quickly. The area is charming and very quiet. Would highly highly recommend this place!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, great price and good location."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an absolute sanctuary! We came off a 7 day camping trip with our friends from across the country. It was like waking into a family home that we all knew and loved. Everything was so clean and well thought out. You could feel the love and intention in the walls of the home. Thank you so much for being such an amazing host.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patricia’s place was clean and comfortable. Beds were excellent. Keurig is stocked and theres oatmeal and granola for breakfast - a nice touch. All bedrooms are upstairs, but temperature was comfortable despite summer heat."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved every bit about staying at this lovely Airbnb. It was very clean and spacious. We also love the location especially being so close to the lake. We would totally stay here again when we come back to Albert Lea.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay at Grace Place. Perfect location too with the hospital and lake nearby. The photos do a great job of showing the property and we appreciated the extra touches such as granola bars and oatmeal. Very clean.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a perfect place to stay in Albert Lea, near Broadway. We walked to shops, the farmer’s market and the lake!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quiet home and comfortable with lots of old home charm. Perfect for what my family was looking for as we were in town for a family reunion. We were a short walk from the larger lake home where a lot of aunts and cousins were staying so really enjoyed our separate, but close spot.
Home only has one bathroom though, so it got a bit difficult sharing the sink/shower/toilet with a full house. The stairs are also a little steep, my husband slipped the first night while wearing socks."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’m a big fan of Air BnB, and so I use them a lot. I have yet to have a host better than Patricia and Bill. Kudos to them for another great stay for us at Grace Place. We will be back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely home.. Had everything we need for all of our family gatherings! Would definitely stay again when we are in the area!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Patricia's place was a great space for our family of 6. We all had ample room with the four bedrooms. The kitchen was well equipped. As an added bonus I was surprised with how close the place was to the main Albert Lea thoroughfare, Fountain Lake and Farmer's Market (all within walking distance). If you're visiting Albert Lea this is a great location, and much better than any hotel offering."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Patricia and her family are such amazing hosts. We will visit Grace Place every summer for many years to come.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we had a wonderful time at this cute and clean house!

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our weekend, 2 of us. However, for a large family or group, it would have been more difficult. Because it’s an older house, there is only one bathroom and that is upstairs."

Very clean and pleasant!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. Rooms can get a little warm but nothing a fan won't help. Off street parking and visitors parking a plus. Keep in mind there is only 1 bathroom and it's located upstairs. I will be staying here again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Exactly as shown. Very close to a hospital, which was nice for us considering one of our travelers was 8 months pregnant. The location is very close to a lake as well. If the weather would have been better, it would have been a perfect location to catch a walking trail around the lake! We would stay here again."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great towels, beds comfortable enough, nice bathroom, well equipped kitchen, washer dryer, great location - easy to walk to town and around the lake. Lighting a little dicey in the living room. Great price!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place for us to host our coworkers and a nice dinner after our event. The dining and living room area along with the kitchen was able to spaciously accommodate our guests. We appreciated the coffee and snacks made available. The instructions given were a little too detailed and at first seemed really involved but parking and the doors were easily accessible and not a big deal. The beds were pretty comfy and plenty of extra blankets and pillows provided to keep warm. Overall we had a great stay and would book again if hosting in Albert Lea in the future.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I loved how spacious and welcoming the house was. We will definitely be back again. The host was nice and responded to my messages in a timely manner.

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Wish the bedroom situation was explained better beforehand, but that’s okay! Each bedroom has a code and the cost is per room. I didn’t realize that, but Patricia communicated timely with me about it and explained it right away😊"

We'll definitely be back next summer."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were in town to celebrate my Grandfather's memorial for the weekend, so we were looking for a spacious place where we could unwind at the end of each day after the festivities and gatherings. Bill and Patricia were incredibly generous hosts. The house was just perfect. It was very clean and cozy -- the perfect place for my family. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and the neighbors are very nice! We enjoyed taking long walks by the lake at the end of the day. I highly suggest eating at The Elbow Room! It's the oldest restaurant in town, very tiny, but the service and food are excellent! I highly recommend staying here!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen has really fixed this classic old house up sweetly! It is easy to get to and the location next to the park adds to the charm. I slept great in the nice linens and memory foam bed but my hard bed loving husband would probably not give his sleeping experience 5 stars. But, he loved the place otherwise. It was a great place to stay on our way further north. Thanks Kathleen for providing a great stay and experience!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay. We felt right at home. I liked that it was across the street from the lake and had a nice view! We will definitely stay again next time we come to the area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Let's just start with this, is the perfect stay away from home! Every detail has been thought about and carefully planned. You are comfortable from the moment you walk in until the time you check out. Not only do you get to wake up and have a cup of coffee, staring at a beautiful lake first thing in the morning, the neighborhood is safe, quiet, and nice.
You have all the amenities that make you feel at home. I have several more trips to the Midwest, and I will certainly book with Kathleen before anywhere else, and I suggest you do the same!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen’s place was so cute, clean, and accommodating! Cozy house set up with everything you need to relax and enjoy Albert Lea!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"I’ve been staying at Airbnb’s for a long time. This is the first place I stayed where I absolutely felt at home from the minute I walked in. I had to have a late Christmas with my children and grandson, and this was the perfect location. The kitchen had everything I need to make a perfect dinner for everyone. The binder left with instructions provide tons of useful information. The house was spotless I have not ever seen a place this clean. It felt like home and we treated it as such. The kids have already asked me to book for the Summer. This was extremely kid friendly with crib, high chairs, baby gates, kids utensils. Everything you need is here. It was a perfect stay. Due to the time of year we were not able to spend anytime on the patio or deck, but hopefully we will be back to enjoy those when the weather is more suitable. Thank you for providing this wonderful place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Happy Days. We celebrated my husband’s 60th with our family. There was plenty of room for our kids and grandkids. The grandkids really loved the game room. House was clean; had everything you needed in the kitchen; and lots of games and toys. Kevin & Emily were very responsive and even accommodated our request to check in early. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful log home! It is completely stocked with everything you could need. The main living area is open and spacious and there was seating for all 14 of us to eat at once (even a high chair for the baby!) We really appreciated the crib and baby gates that came with the cabin. The older kids loved the game room and the Kayaks. We enjoyed the yard and fire pit and being on the water. The only drawback was that the cabin is on a narrow channel of the lake and it was very shallow and weedy. It was not good for fishing or swimming (at least not when we were there in mid July). The cabin itself was perfect, however, spotlessly clean and plenty of space and beds for everyone!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great places, best staying in Albert Lea, the owner makes the house very homey!!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carly was extremely responsive and a great host! The place was as advertised and a great spot for my parents and I (and our pup) for the weekend. If you are looking for a stair free place, this will not be it (we didn’t read the fine print and this stay is part of a duplex so there is a flight of stairs)."

Very responsive and accommodating. The place was immaculately clean! Very comfortable beds and linens! Loved the covered porch leading into the stairs so that we weren't tracking snow into the living space. Cute neighborhood. I felt safe walking my dogs there and even sent my son out by himself with the dogs."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at about 6 airbnbs and this has been the best so far. The of details that went into making people feel at home is unbeatable. From a bottle of wine to a kitchen with ""the extras"" and you will never run out of towels. My roommate and I were in town for training. She was allergic to fragrances and Carly laundered the bedding and towels in fragrance free detergent andcreated a cute note to assure us. We talked many times with Carly in passing and she was always very kind. Everything in Albert Lea is 5-8 min from location, so it very convenient.
Things that might bother you (but did not me): one block the train tracks (the train does toot its horn throughout the night), this in a 2nd level, so there is a set of semi-narrow stairs to climb, I detected a slight smell of dog and there is a request to not adjust the thermostat.
I would completely stay at this location should I return Albert Lea. it was wonderful!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great.
The stairs are steep, but there is a hand rail and the stairwell is narrow enough you could touch each side anyway, so that was good. There is also a light, so you aren't going up nor down in the dark.
The place is comfortable.
Full kitchen, washer and dryer. Dryer wasnt working well though. It would make noise and quit on you. However, we managed to get through.
Over all, we liked it quite a bit. We'd stay there again if we were in the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Carly's place. We would stay again.

Carly had lots of extra touches that made our stay very comfortable. Nicely decorated and homey feel. We will definitely be back to stay again.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!
Carly and Lori’s place was incredible and so homey. One thing I was blown away by was the amount of specific things they had that were available to us. Every time I I went to look for something we needed not only did they have it, but it was in an intuitive place and easy to find. Beds were comfy, plenty of extra blankets and linens.
We used this space as our crash pad as bridesmaids for a friends wedding weekend and it worked perfectly! We likely won’t have the pleasure to return anytime soon, but I recommend it to anyone looking for a homey and thoughtful space for their stay in the area."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at this clean, well-maintained air bnb. Carly was very friendly during the process. One thing to note- the stairs up to the apartment are quite steep, which could be challenging for some people."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I’ve stayed here a few times and I’d been very happy every time. The place feels like home and everything is available that you could need.

Honestly, the host and the amenities are just amazing. Felt like home, SO MANY nice small extras. They have thought of everything!

The kitchen was very well stocked with a coffee maker, pots and pans, plates, mugs, etc. I enjoyed making a small cup of coffee for breakfast and sitting at the dining table. The living had a sofa, TV, and I did some light computer work on the desk next to the TV. The bathroom had toiletries as well. I was only spending 1 night, so I didn't get to use everything. I could see that it could be a great place for a short weekend trip! Thank you!"

Due to some unfortunate personal issues, I had to cut my stay short and Carly was so understanding and kind! Her words will be held close to my heart for some time. I would absolutely stay again. The house was beautiful with a great view of the lake. This was my first time ever in Albert Lea and Carly's place made my stay enjoyable! The pig theme was SO cute! Absolutely adorable. Loved having the rules on the fridge as a reminder and the little map was so helpful too! The shower was heavenly and I really enjoyed the driveway being so large for multiple vehicles. Having a washer and dryer on site was so helpful and the two tvs made the comfort factor go up tenfold! Everything was homey. The kitchen was perfect and we utilized it to make delicious meals and snacks. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone traveling and searching for a home away from home from an incredible host."

2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Everything was excellent!! We used this place for our daughter’s wedding weekend. It was a great place to relax before the wedding. The only hiccup was the kitchen faucet sensor wasn’t working right. Beautiful home!!! Nate was very responsive and friendly.

Huge trees in the backyard provided wonderful shade the whole weekend! The house had even more amenities than the listing indicates — a hot tub, tons of Adirondack chairs, kayaks, stand up paddleboards, yard games, the property was loaded!
It was perfect for our 14-month old daughter, had a high-chair, pack n play (with mattress), kiddie pool, and even bath toys for her.
Within walking distance of farmers market, shops, food.
Overall — so awesome and we would totally go back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,wonderful place. we will book again in thefuture
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, very nice house. Lots of wildlife."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"This worked out really good for a girls weekend. There were plenty of comfortable places to sleep.
Major pros: Very clean, very well decorated and stylish, the kitchen was the most stocked airb&b I have ever been to - excellent cooking supplies and cookware.
Major cons: We really wanted to enjoy the breeze and sounds from the lake but there are not any lake-facing windows that open or have screens on them from either the downstairs living room or upstairs living room. Part of the reason we were willing to pay the price was because we wanted to be able to have that atmosphere of a lake breeze/smell and we assumed windows would open from the pictures. Also, there were only three chairs on the patio (no table or other furniture), so we couldn't really sick on the deck as a group. Note that the deck is out of the downstairs - the top deck probably shouldn't be gone on - the rails are really low and it isn't a space to gather at all."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We LOVED the home! The pictures do not do it justice at all. It’s luxurious, beautifully decorated, pristinely clean, so much room and the back deck view? Breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful. I cannot recommend Nate’s home enough! I would live there full time if I could!"

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"I would say this place is average. I was a little confused at the amount of amenities offered for 3 guests. There was not enough bath amenities. We also unfortunately got inundated with ants. Other than those things, it was okay."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This little house felt just like a home when we checked in. It was neat and clean and very comfortable. Luke has been renovating this house and it is set up with so much thought for guests in mind. We stayed just one night as we are on our way home to Colorado from Canada and prefer to avoid hotels if possible. So nice to have a full kitchen and place to fully relax after a few days of long drives. We would definitely stay here again should we find ourselves traveling through Albert Lea!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Luke is a great host. My dog Rogue and I had a great stay and felt welcomed. 10-15 minute walk to the lake and park to shoot some hoops. I loved the front porch!

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for what we needed. Clean, comfortable, well supplied. There is a beautiful view of the lake through a wall of windows that provided a lovely place to enjoy my coffee & book in the mornings. We appreciated the filtered water in the fridge and everything was easy to find! The only downfalls are the stairs from the upstairs unit were right by our heads while sleeping, so we awoke to the other guests (very loudly) leaving at 7am. And the front door lock does not seem secure. We'd stay there again when visiting family nearby in a heartbeat!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Priscilla's place was just what I was looking for and more. She is a super host and very accommodating.

I definitely recommend Priscilla as a host along with the accommodations !"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The panoramic view of the lake makes this cozy little spot feel extravagant. I appreciated little touches that made me feel like our host thought of everything—toiletries in the bathroom, kitchen essentials, extra pillows, and even children’s books— those sure made our toddler happy. The space was inviting and clean. It made for a relaxing visit.
Also, It snowed while we were there, and I noticed the drive/walk was shoveled before we left that morning. The heater worked great, too. We would absolutely return to this hidden gem in Albert Lea."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our dealings with Pricilla were fast and very beneficial. The house was clean, and had the most awesome view of the lake. The only thing that bothered me was having to park on the street by a no parking sign for certain hours. We had no issues as a result of this just as Priscilla told us. I will stay there again if possible."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, excellent view with the lake to walk around.
No dishwasher, but not a problem for me!

Thanks!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Lake House at 607 is a dreamy location! You will not be disappointed. It’s charming, inviting, and was an amazing place to call home for a few days.

Pricilla was quick to respond when we had a little issue and helped resolve it.
There was a paved sidewalk around the lake, and it was an easy walk to the downtown area.
We enjoyed our stay very much."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully described, equipped, and centrally located. Enjoying a cup or five of coffee each morning watching the world go with the lake view was worth the price of admission itself. To top it off, Priscilla was more than responsive and accommodating.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful scenery! I thought the beds would be too hard for us, but they were very comfortable. Had good night's sleep. The washer and dryer were very convenient. The location is close to downtown and plenty of eateries. There were people staying in the apartment above but they were very quiet. Overall, a great experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! The only downside is if theres a guest upstairs you will have to share the drive way with them.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here. Its a sweet little place, perfect getaway space! Nice view. Priscilla is great to communicate with and so helpful. Everything was as described. We had a perfect girls weekend!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place to stay in Albert Lea. The view from the front room is just beautiful, sunrise or sunset. Additionally you’re about a five minute walk from historic downtown, and a ten minute drive to anywhere in town.
The interior is well decorated and feels like a warm home. Priscilla was friendly and more than accommodating."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! Very clean and accommodating. We’ll be back again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Minnesota for a relaxing break. Views out of the large windows in the front room are spectacular. Furniture is comfortable, kitchen well stocked and house was clean. Only note of caution is that as the host points out it is an old house, if you are a light sleeper, you can hear every step people upstairs make, luckily we only heard people our last night."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"enjoyed our stay, home was well equipped with everything needed- appreciated that."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very cute and modern in the morning when the sunlight comes through the giant windows it’s gorgeous. Priscilla replies fast and was a great host! The house is much larger than it seems in pictures another great plus.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a view to enjoy the morning coffee or evening wine! Great stay, helpful host, no complaints. I will be staying here any time I am in town and have recommended to others I know that travel to the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay so much! This darling home sits just feet across from Fountain Lake and the view of the lake from the living room is gorgeous. Priscilla has gone out of her way to make this home a memorable experience for her guests. The decor is very pretty and well-coordinated and all of the comforts of home plus more are provided. The house (duplex) is very well equipped and includes sweet niceties like breakfast snacks, Keurig coffee, adequate closets, big towels, comfy sheets and covers, real pillows, a comfortable living room, beautiful rugs, a guidebook of the area, and . . . that view! The neighbors are friendly and the walk around the lake is so relaxing and pretty. There was little to no noise from the upstairs guest and the separate entrance for them made this feel like a single dwelling. This was exactly what we needed -- comfortable, private, well-appointed and clean. I hope to plan my next trip to Mayo Clinic in Rochester with a return through Albert Lea just for this experience."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with four friends at Priscilla’s home. The house is immaculate, modern, and clean. The view is amazing - none of the photos of the home do it justice at how beautiful it is! The amenities are plentiful, beds comfortable, and the home is spacious. It’s worth noting that there is not a ladder or steps off the dock so swimming right outside the house can be challenging but there is a beach just two miles away, easily accessible by car, bike, or foot. We loved exploring the underestimated gem that is Albert Lea, and Priscilla’s home was the perfect landing spot for our trip. We’ll be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, wonderful view of the lake and everything needed for a pleasant stay. The area around the lake has nice walking paths and a pretty Lakeshore Drive."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our long weekend stay at Priscilla’s lakefront house! The place has old house charm with modern furnishings and decor. We loved sitting in the cozy living room with coffee or a cocktail and just watching the lake. Check in was a breeze and Priscilla was easy to communicate with. This has got to be one of the best areas of Albert Lea and I enjoyed walking downtown right from the house, passing neat houses and parks along the way. Highly recommend :)"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here just to get away for two nights. Surprised by the beauty of Albert Lea and the location of this house was right on the lake. There was a sidewalk right outside the house that went around the lake. Great for a run/walk in nice weather. Sat outside to read and the neighbors who walked by on this path were friendly. The house was furnished so well with bottled water and even a few snacks! I was there with a friend and we so enjoyed the accommodations. Especially their tv streaming options were amazing in case you’re looking for a little entertainment. Great place!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home is lovely, clean and furnishings are extremely comfortable. Kitchen perfect making breakfast and for enjoying the lake view. Great location for walking around the 5 mile lake path as well as walking to the downtown area to enjoy some of the stores and restaurants. City has Tuesday night food truck night and a Farmers Market on Wednesday. Both are within easy walking distance. Priscilla was very responsive and gracious when replying to my questions. Will definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house on Grace has a gorgeous view. The beds are comfortable. Kitchen has all you need. Central location for walking by the lake or going downtown.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, YES, this place looks as good in person as it is in the photos. Cuter, even!
You can tell from every inch of the space that Priscilla 1) has great taste and 2) really cares. Comfy, quality couches and mattresses, excellent amenities, and a super handy welcome book. And spotlessly clean!
She was quick to respond and always provided clear instructions/responses.
We also appreciated the walkability of the location and the excellent view of the lake.
If I could leave extra stars, I would! Truly the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. Thanks, Priscilla!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful, neat, clean and very welcoming. Snacks and beverages were provided upon arrival...that was very sweet. She did notify us beforehand that the water may not be suitable for swimming due to the increase of algae, which she was right. Although, we did take her suggestion to visit Boat House rental and it was absolutely fun and affordable!! ($5/rental kayak, canoe). Rode around the lake with public scooters. Not much good fishing but we did catch a few by the Fountain area by the mermaid statue.
The home itself was very relaxing. Alot of light through the big windows and open floor plan. Decor was simple a cute! Btw, bed and blankets are so comfortable but gets a bit hot at night because it starts to get too warm under those comfy blankets. AC is steadily set at a comfortable degree throughout the whole stay.
Kitchen and bathroom was stocked. (Bring your own toothpaste and your own food to cook) Alot of great places to eat around here as well.
Priscilla was on point with her services. Communication and instructions were A+ and she was very accommodating. Excellent host. I would highly recommend."

Would stay here again if in the area, the house book showing progress from purchase to airbnb ready state was very cool."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The dollar house is charming, very clean, cozy and comfortable. the perfect place to stay when on the road with our dogs.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was easily the most equipped Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! I stayed for nearly two months and it immediately felt like home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and organized
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was clean, easy to find and was accurate to the images and description. Backyard is not fenced in, so privacy is lacking from the neighbors. A picnic bench and a fire pit was located in the backyard, these were nice to have for outdoor relaxation. The laundry is coin operated, unfortunately we do not carry change, because of this, laundry can be an inconvenience. There are cameras surveying the exterior of the property, one of which is a ring floodlight that tends to turn on quite frequently, the light faces the bedroom window and can hinder sleep at night. Recycling was requested to be taken to the curb and a landscaping crew was scheduled on one of the morning of our stay, this took away from the experience we paid for. Overall, a clean and quiet experience with room for improvement."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. This is a little old house that has been updated and modernized where it needs to be but with some of the charm of a 1940's era home maintained. Too many thoughtful amenities and extras to list. We will try to reserve again whenever we are back in this area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very well equipped kitchen and comfortable bed. I found it to be a relaxing stay.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place. Just like the photos everything was perfect. We did get turned around with the place in the sense that the Airbnb was the actual house and not another location or a guest house if that makes sense. Luke messaged right away letting us know.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This stop met our needs for the night and was very clean and convenient. We were traveling cross country with our dog, and I so appreciated the ability to have my vehicle in a driveway right outside and accessible for items needed. The backyard was appreciated as well. Luke was attentive prior to our arrival. This is a great value. Thanks!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Luke’s place was a perfect stop on the cross country road trip. He’s a great host, the place was immaculate and super comfortable. I’d definitely stay again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed a safe place where we could park close an not have to unload the car. So glad Luke’s place was available. Very comfortable accommodations with nicely added touches. Quiet neighborhood! Luke was quick to respond when I needed to book the day before the stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was first Airbnb experience. And it won't be our last. Luke was an amazing host and the house was perfect. So many amenities that we weren't expecting. We stayed a week, and it really felt like a home. The kitchen was fully equipped as well as spices (very unexpected). The bed was the most comfortable ever. This review is definitely a 5 star. We'd give it more if we could. Can't wait to go back..."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute little place with such charm!!! Luke’s place is fully equipped with everything you will need to make your stay the best! It was very clean and decorated nice!!
I would highly recommend!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect stay if you are in the Albert Lee area. fully stocked kitchen with pantry staples and pots and pans and utensils anything you could need. very clean space and comfortable. Love the remodel job. it was the perfect mix of cute and functional. would definitely stay again and have already told friends to stay there as well. only thing was the code was wrong when I got there so I would suggest messaging the host just to make sure you have the right one but they responded very timely So not a big deal at all. easy to find great location. overall. probably one of the best airbnbs I've stayed at

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home in a close proximity to downtown!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot as we had a trailer and wanted a safe place to park. Everything was just perfect and what we needed after a full day of driving. Luke was very quick to respond.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a stop in Albert Lea! Spacious kitchen and perfectly updated.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was just passing through and after a long day driving I was happy to pull into that long driveway and get inside this nice place. It was super close to the lake but if you were staying in there was a nice large TV as well. The kitchen looked fully loaded and ready for you to make a nice meal. Whenever I might pass through again this is the spot I’ll be looking to stay at again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very clean and exactly what was described! If we go up again I would book again with Luke!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay made better by the location convenient to I90 and my route west. The house was clean and well organized. I didn’t use many of the amenities, since I was there mainly to sleep, but it was nice to know they were there!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Place was very nice. Perfect for a night away… close to trail for running or biking…would definitely stay again…
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed the month of June at the Dollar house. Luke did a great job of remodeling. It’s cute, just like the pics. It’s super insulated - I didn’t even hear rain on the roof. Everything worked well, he even has a small dishwasher! The washer and dryer need quarters, but no biggie. It was only $1.50 for a wash and $1 to dry. And he provided quarters for the first load. Oh, and the washer and dryer and extra large capacity.
There were plenty of supplies (laundry soap, tp, paper towels, soap, etc) for a full month and more.
Neighborhood is quiet, I hardly saw neighbors. And as a solo female traveler, I felt safe. I even walked around the neighborhood several times. Recommend walking up Frank st to the park by the lake. There’s a boat ride Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons in summer. $10 for 1 1/2 hour tour of the lake. Also highly recommend Blazing Star trail for walking or biking. It’s a 20 minute walk from the house or there’s plenty of parking at the trail. Also really good coffee at Mocha & Minis, a 5 min walk.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice unit near plenty of things. It was small but good value. Also well kept. We would rent it again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, good location. Beautiful state park 10 minutes away."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The dollar house was super, clean and comfortable. It’s a well appointed spot to stay. Our host was very helpful and responsive. We’d stay here again if the need ever arises."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and cozy. Great for our family of 3.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time I stayed at the Dollar House. It's become my favorite place to stay when I'm in Albert Lea. I will definitely come back!
The sofa is comfy, and there are plenty of linens/amenities. I especially love that Luke pre-loads quarters into the washer/dryer for your first load. There's nothing worse than flying in from a long trip, just to have to run out and try to find quarters! The kitchen has a wonderful layout and easy to maneuver around. The heating and cooling is just right. I've been here in both cold and hot weather.
of the modern features with plenty of old-school charm makes for an enjoyable stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay! Exactly as described, would stay again (as I have many times now)."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to locate and check in. Perfect home away from home in a quiet neighborhood.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful lovely home. Accurate description! Newly renovated, new sheets and towels, pillows and mattress are very comfortable, abig flat screen TV, gorgeous kitchen with new pots and pans. The photos doesn’t do the place a justice. We’ve stayed at several Airbnb in the area and this by far is the best. The basement is very clean and organized where you will find the washer and dryer with quarters already provided for the first load. The house is fully stocked, great for short or extended stay. Definitely recommend this place! Luke is a great host!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was clean and comfortable-communication was great! Would definitely return!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Luke was very responsive and the house was very nicely stocked.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice little house that matches the pictures/description, host is nice and quick to respond. Would stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a super charming place - very tidy and communicative host. We had a bit of trouble with the lock, but other than that, no complaints!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cute little house and looks just like the pictures! Feels like a safe neighborhood as well, very friendly neighbors. Luke has been great at communicating and in a timely manner. The only complaint I have is the fact that the washer and drier are coin operated. I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb with coin operated W/D and I wish it was mentioned in the listing. I travel for work, I don’t have a bank nearby and getting coins is a hassle. And I barely do laundry so I’d rather be charged $5 more a month rather than trying to get coins. Just inconvenient. Otherwise great place and would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, clean home. I enjoyed the privacy and convenience. Luke is responsive and available.
I would stay there again if returning to Albert Lea."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house! Comfy bed, giant TV, updated bathroom and nice kitchen. Happy with the house!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great layout and convenient/ quite location. Stayed before, and will stay again!"

2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location if you’re staying in Albert Lea
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home itself is comfortable and we were satisfied overall. Unfortunately there are white supremacist symbols at several homes in the neighborhood, so we are unsure if we would stay there again."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"You’ll love this little gem in the center of town! Whoever decorated it has great taste. They still managed to keep the rustic feel after the Renovation and I like that they didn’t completely demolish everything but seemed to have kept some of the original features like the bedroom closet. I am from New England and don’t see houses like this anywhere!
I very much enjoyed the coffee table book showing the unfolding of the remodel. That was one of my favorite aspects. You’ll see antique pieces everywhere that really took me back to my childhood visiting my grandparents in Albert Lea. It brought tears to my eyes!
You’ll be very happy with their modern dishwasher and new appliances. The oven worked great. There are pots and pans and cookware to accommodate anything that you need to cook. As someone who is sensitive to fragrances I was not overwhelmed with chemical cleaners and I can tell they use all natural cleaners including the dish soap which is very important to me. Oh, and to have the coins already loaded into the laundry machine was a lifesaver! The last thing I need is to try to find quarters after a long flight.
I also slept like a baby in that bedroom, even better than my own home! 😁
I will definitely be back to stay in Luke’s wonderful home."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house. The host was very responsive and even opened the garage to accommodate us with the grill. The place is the perfect space for 2 people. It is close to a state park and only a few minutes to a canoe/kayak access point.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my weekend stay! Neighborhood was nice and not far from stores and parks. I enjoyed the unique decor in the house that added a nice touch. Just some minor touch ups need to be done in the house. Otherwise the description of the house and amenities were accurate!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dollar House is worth many dollars in value! Great layout, appliances, quiet location. Should have booked it longer!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was even better than it looked in the pictures! Location was in a quiet neighborhood just a few blocks from a park and near enough to the stores and restaurants. The floor plan makes this space feel very roomy and was plenty big enough for us and our 2 kids (1.5yo & 3mo.) The kitchen has nice equipment and a lovely deep sink. The drawers are soft-close and there are plenty of dishes to cook and eat with, had our stay been an extended one. The house had lots of vintage touches throughout that blended well with the modern things. 10/10, would stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall real solid house. I would have preferred a bit closer to the lake but apart from that the place really worked out well!!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good value; as described.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was accurate and check in was very easy. The house had a brand new grill and new appliances, and very cold a/c! It was a relatively quiet neighborhood and quick to get on the highway."

2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good value
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Dollar House is a nice place to stay for a quiet getaway weekend for a couple. The house is cozy and stylish. We weren't able to get out much due to the cold weather but it was still enjoyable. The typewriter is a fun added perk. Luke is a great host and very responsive!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"How is this place both cozy AND spacious? Probably a little luck, but also great renovation decisions. Comfortable enough to settle into for a weekend or a month, depending on your needs. Full-sized kitchen a MAJOR plus for those who prefer not to eat out. Luke was an incredibly gracious and accommodating host."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean and was affordable. Would highly recommend.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a perfect stay at Luke’s Dollar House AirBnb! It is 5+ star property. The house was pristine clean, fully renovated, stylish, and complete with thoughtful, welcoming touches. The bed was super comfortable with a high quality mattress/bedding and the kitchen was well stocked. In short, it was easy to feel immediately at home and have a comfortable stay. I also really valued the privacy, comfort, and safety (given Covid-19) to stay in a private house.
The description is completely accurate. Luke was highly responsive, a great communicator, and a wonderful host. I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with a stay here, and I highly recommend this AirBnb to everyone."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, newly renovated house with very nice appliances and bathrooms. This is an older house so there are some creaks but it is very stylish with the recent renovation. DeAnna was very communicative and helpful with all of our questions."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Older house remodel. Would return.
,,,Luke was very rude to me due to having a service animal. According to air bnb you are NOT required to disclose that you have a service animal. Luke does not know the air bnb policy and yelled out me to “ GET OUT” of his air bnb 1 minute before check out even through I was walking out the door. He cursed at me via the air bnb messages that having a disability was “bullshit” and I lied and was ambiguous about my disabilities. This is unacceptable in accordance to the American Disabilities Act. He proceeded to tell me I will “NEVER” be welcomed back. Trust me I will never ever book again.
