2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my gosh! This place was amazing! Gorgeous views, cozy surroundings and the bed was so comfortable. Favorite part of my morning was laying in bed looking out the window at the beautiful view of the inlet. The driveway is steep but easy to maneuver. This space did not disappoint. Can’t wait for the opportunity to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about this property. If you need somewhere to stay in Juneau, stay here. The house was clean, warm, had a beautiful backyard area, is very close to town yet very private, and the house was stocked with nice little snacks and things you need when you are on vacation. Amanda was extremely responsive and helpful and the WiFi was very fast - we had 3 people on video conference at the same time and everything was working better than the Marriott we stayed at in Juneau. 10/10 would recommend - best Airbnb I have ever stayed in tbh. Best hosts. Thank you Amanda and family!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so beautiful, and it was my first time traveling to Juneau, AK, and this airbnb makes it feel like I'm at home. I love that.  Highly recommend!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! That’s what we all said when we walked into The Buoy. The place was extremely clean, exceptionally stocked with kitchen, bathroom, and comfort amenities and the decor and furniture made us feel right at home. Amanda was a super star host and does an amazing job of making her guests feel welcome. Juneau is a beautiful place and if we make our way back to Alaska again we will definitely stay at The Buoy!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway for a staycation!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My trip to Juneau will stay with me forever thanks to our wonderful stay.
From the offset, the space was clean, tidy and so well equipped.
It has everything you need to stay in for as long as a week or two, unfortunately we didn't book to stay longer.
The finishing touches is what makes The Buoy so special, the finer details and thought out kitchen utensils, the infinite amount of board and card games- and of course the spotlessly clean and comfortable furnishings.
Thank you so much once again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,She is a great host and we really enjoyed the stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home suited my husband and I bringing our 13 yo to learn how to snowboard at Eagle crest. We got to drive out to the glacier and check out downtown Juneau. It was very like a luxurious forest cabin. It had everything we needed and more. The host was incredibly responsive and made sure we knew what we were getting into with the stairs. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda was amazing! We had a emergency and had to leave early, however the couple we were staying with were able to stay and enjoy the airbnb. Amanda was super understanding and communicative! We will return!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just as cute as it looks in the photos, if not more! We had a great stay here and the host was responsive and had plenty of thoughtful touches in the house. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at and definitely the cleanest! We felt right at home. From practical amenities, local resources and clear instructions, to little design details in the home, everything was so thoughtfully considered. Very centrally located as well. Amanda was the loveliest host. Highly, highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay with exceptionally comfortable beds. Hosts are very responsive and go above and beyond to make guests comfortable.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay. Being winter in Juneau, the roads can be a mess. The driveway was plowed, and rock was put down well before we arrived. The host was very responsive and the place was incredibly clean and well organized."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I loved our stay in this adorable A-Frame. It was spotlessly clean, the beds were super comfy, and the host was great! Perfect location for our trip too. I plan to come back again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was truly a dream-come-true for my partner and me. Amanda (and her partner) were wonderful. We had such a lovely time visiting Juneau, but it's hard to separate our trip from the warmth and coziness of this home. It's even better than the pictures. We felt so at-home, that it was hard to pull ourselves out and explore the rest of the city. We would not have been bothered to see Amanda, but she respected our privacy and worked behind the scenes to make us comfortable. We came in an oddly intense snow storm, and they kept the driveway and stairs clear of snow, all while coordinating around our schedule (which was above and beyond what we expected). 11/10 -- this is a must-stay if you're in Juneau."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we walked through the Buoy cabin doors I felt at peace. The cabin is beautiful! The thoughtful touches that they had waiting for us (coloring for our daughter, local events to partake in, wine!) made us feel so special from the start.
Amanda was so responsive about our questions - she went above and beyond. The attention to detail was the best - Kleenex, extra linens, shampoo/conditioner, first aid kit, “oh crap I forgot something” bathroom supplies…. The list is endless. Amanda really thought about how to make the cabin feel like a home.
Our family loved how cozy the cabin was. The firepit out back was a great way to ring in the new year. We played endless board/card games. The couch was perfect view of the bay - enjoyed my morning tea there everyday. AND the beds - so cozy!!! I slept like a baby each night!
Thank you for a wonderful Alaskan Adventure!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, and Amanda was very responsive. Made very easy to find while driving in the dark."

The heater always running provided a very comfortable and cozy cabin."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Buoy Cabin is a great place to stay in Juneau. The cabin is as nice as the photos and you will not be disappointed. Everything works as it's supposed to and there are lots of extra amenities and comforts. Great kitchen set up with very clean and nice dishes, espresso maker etc."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do the cabin justice! So adorable, cozy and great location. Probably the cleanest airbnb I’ve ever stayed in as well. Amanda was very easy to communicate with. She stocks the house so much for you as well with coffee, snacks , detailed guestbook and personalized notes. By far one of my best experiences. Would 100% stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a lovely home, spent a lot of time very cozy in there."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda’s house was the perfect stay in Juneau! Amazing location with even better views. The house was even better than described and shown in photos. Amanda thought of everything to stock the house with from coffee, to extra q-tips in the bathroom. The house was incredibly clean and the beds were the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. Amanda has a book right at your fingertips she made that answers any question imaginable. I highly recommend staying here! Wish we never had to leave!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda goes above and beyond to make this a comfortable stay. Extremely thoughtful with many much appreciated amenities we had no idea we would need (e.g. charging cable which gave us juice until we could pick up one locally, bear spray we noticed after purchasing some, fully functional kitchen with Brita pitcher and ice ready, etc. etc). The furniture was all super comfortable, and the views were incredible. Book this place for your next Juneau trip!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Amanda was very responsive and helpful. I’m so glad we got to experience her place. The cabin itself is beautiful and very well cared for. Amanda has it fully stocked with all the essentials, and even included some thoughtful treats for us to enjoy.
The view from the front never got old - just breathtaking! The location was perfect for us. We rented a car and this ended up being the perfect home base for us while we explored Juneau.
I hope to one day return, and if I do, I hope I’m able to stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing property to stay at- everything you could THINK you need is available. Cabin is beautifully updated and details are perfect. There is absolutely no way you will regret staying here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed in and certainly the one with the most comfortable sofa! So much thought has been put into making it a home from home and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay 😊 The internet connection was good so Netflix worked well for those rainy Juneau days! Great location to explore the Juneau area but away from the Cruise Ship crowds. Amanda was very responsive to messages and let us know as soon as the cabin was available for us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re reading this -book it now! It was everything we hoped for and more! The cabin was the perfect location and setting for our family of three on our first Alaska adventure. The views, the charm, the special little touches- truly spectacular!!"

Our family of 4 had a wonderful weekend here; we didn’t want to leave!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for our Alaskan family getaway! Amanda's home had everything we needed. I would definitely come again and recommend the home to friends.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! Amanda was incredibly helpful and shared so many recommendations for things to check out in the area. As for the house, you couldn’t ask for anything more .. adorable home in a great location with so many thoughtful touches. We enjoyed local coffee on the front porch in the mornings and campfires in the rainforest backyard at night… this place is just absolutely perfect. A must stay if you’re in Juneau!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are planning to vacation in Juneau, this is THE place to stay! Great location, view and the absolute cleanest place you’ll find! Best of all is the outdoor area in the back! After a day of hiking, biking or just plain ol’ sight seeing, this is the place to unwind by a wonderful smoke free fire, eat and have drinks. You can’t go wrong staying here. It just adds to the overall Alaska experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the BEST stay at the Buoy and were sad to leave. Cannot recommend this place enough! On top of the great spot, Amanda was the most helpful host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great hosts. They made it feel like home with snacks, a bottle of wine on arrival, very very clean. Not quite as secluded as the pictures may seem but definitely a nice area. Would stay again!"

Loved our stay in this place and would come back again!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic experience! The place was pristine without even a spec of dust. Amanda was extremely responsive and provided excellent recommendations. The fire pit in the back was great for making s’mores! Beds were super comfortable. 500 stars!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Amanda’s was wonderful!!! Her home is beautifully decorated and updated. Everything was plush and new. It was obvious to us that she is very meticulous and pays attention to the smallest of details. Amanda even left a message with information about activities that were happening downtown. We went and had a marvelous time. The fire pit was a plus. We enjoyed relaxing around the fire after a long day of hiking, shopping, sightseeing, etc. I would highly recommend Amanda’s home for your next vacation. NOTE: The stairs inside and out can be intimidating but once you get the hang of them, they’re a breeze however; I wouldn’t recommend them for the really young, the elderly, nor people who have difficulty getting around."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. This cabin was heaven away from home and Amanda went above and beyond for us. Without going into full detail, she went out of her way to help us book and saved us from a hotel room in town with no heat and no hot water. What could have been a trip ruined turned into a romantic getaway at a cozy but spacious cabin, in a serene, tucked away location. The cleanliness, modern interior, and attention to little details all made this my absolute favorite rental I’ve ever stayed at. I will absolutely be booking again next time I’m in Juneau. It was more than worth every penny and I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay and location. Lots of thoughtful touches and the extras were perfect so we didn’t have to run to the store!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such a great stay. The cabin is super cozy and clean, has every amenity you could need, and has an amazing outdoor space and view of the channel.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to stay in Juneau! We loved the space and appreciated the treats and recommendations for activities going on during our stay. A very nice touch!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simply stunning! The fire pit out back is well stocked with wood and we used the Solo twice during our stay. Highly recommend staying at Amanda’s place.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely A frame cabin with a forest view out back or the channel out front. Very clean and lovely linens. The guide book was great and we were able to most cooking at the cabin. Lovely place would definitely stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Amanda's place recently for our trip to Juneau to go snowboarding at Eaglecrest. We were a party of 3 and we absolutely loved the cabin. It was super warm and cozy, peaceful, clean, well thought out, close to everything.... I could go on but basically it was everything we wanted and more! Being that close to Eaglecrest was an absolute dream, and it's even closer to downtown Juneau.
We especially loved the quiet and peaceful setting, the overall charm and aesthetic of the cabin, the awesome laundry room which serves as the perfect place to dry out ski/snowboard gear, the location, and how communicative and helpful Amanda and Kasen were. It snowed quite a bit while we were there and Kasen made sure our driveway was plowed, stopping by several times.
I couldn't recommend Amanda's place any more, if you're a smaller group visiting Juneau, definitely stay at this cabin!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Juneau Gem! The Buoy Cabin was immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, cozy & comfortable. So much attention to detail at every turn—from beautiful local artwork, quality linens, to a well equipped kitchen—all spoke of hospitality at the highest level. Amanda & Kasen were fabulous hosts!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This family goes above and beyond to make sure their guests have an experience of a lifetime!!! My wife and I came to Juneau to celebrate her 30th birthday and Amanda made sure we had everything we needed and more to have an amazing vacation!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was an amazing place to stay while visiting Juneau! A friend and I went there to snowboard at Eaglecrest so this cabin was very conveniently located between the mountain and downtown.
The cabin was very well equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Amanda even left some eaglecrest trail maps and some local food and drink for our stay which was very thoughtful.
Hands down the best Airbnb I’ve been in. Thank you Amanda and Kasen!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was great!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to stay in Juneau! We've stayed in a lot of AirBNBs over the years and this was one of the top, for sure!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful, cozy cabin! It is so charming and we found it to be very clean and tidy.

Amanda and Kasen are a pleasure to deal with and very responsive. You should definitely stay here! Pretty soon so many people are going to want it, it won’t be available!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amanda's A-frame house is a great place to get away. The ambiance is peaceful. The little touches create a feeling of hospitality. There were treats, a bottle of wine, coffee, and breakfast items (microwavable oatmeal and breakfast bars). The home is tastefully decorated and everything in it appears new. The beds and sofa were comfortable. I got decorating ideas for my home!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Buoy Cabin was cute, cozy, quiet, and comfortable. All the small details making the cabin a home turned my business trip into a vacation. Thank you so much!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an incredible cabin. Amanda was so nice and generous! She had coffee, wine, and dessert waiting for me when I got there. It snowed while I was there and Amanda and her family were so accommodating and plowed the driveway. She was very helpful in providing a list of things to do! The cabin was so clean and just felt like home… if I could live there, I would!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this stay!!
Quaint, convenient, secluded, connected, comfortable, and beautiful. Wake up with a view of the mountains and Gastineau Channel on the slope of Douglas Island. Minutes from downtown, private parking, fully stocked accommodations and secluded and cozy backyard!
Again, book this stay!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Buoy is a dream. The cabin is so light and bright and nicely arranged that you can't help smiling the moment you walk in--and the longer you stay there, the more you smile. Amanda has an unerring eye. Everything from the furniture down to the bowls and kitchen tools is beautiful and well chosen. The appliances are of very high quality, the kitchen is fun to cook in, and Amanda seems to have anticipated every need and put everything in exactly the right place.
Even though it poured almost every day during our week-long stay, our spirits were buoyed by The Buoy. (And we loved Juneau even in the rain.) When the weather cleared, we appreciated the great view of Gastineau Channel; when it didn't, we counted ourselves lucky to be staying in such a cheerful and well-designed space."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was one of my airbnb favorites. Amanda's place is absolutely captivating. The view of the mountain and water was spectacular. This A-frame cabin is beautifully decorated interior and exterior. The fire pit was a plus for us so we could have a little campfire outside and enjoyed our first night without the rain. Amanda gave us little extras on our stay for our wedding anniversary like bottle of wine and snacks. I definitely would recommend her place if you want to stay in Juneau and you wont regret at all.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my family had a lovely stay! The entire place was well thought out, decorated with local art, beds were so comfortable and fire pit in the back was the icing on the cake. Would stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in! Comfortable, clean, wonderful location. Amanda was an incredible host.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. The house is very cozy and stocked with everything you need. Amanda even added a few snacks and had filtered water ready for us when we arrived. The fire pit area out back as well as the front and back decks are wonderful for relaxing before or after a day of exploring. The house is conviently located to the downtown area but just far enough away to feel private. I would highly recommend staying here!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is so beautiful and has a perfect view. Its secluded enough for you to feel like you're really getting away but also so close to everything you need.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute wonderful, welcoming and cozy place to stay while in Juneau. The accommodations were top notch, everything was very well thought out, and everything you think you might need was there. Host was very thoughtful and welcomed us with kind gifts.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering a getaway in Juneau, the best decision you can make is to book Amanda’s stunning A-frame! A local friend recommended this listing, as we were in town for her wedding. Amanda was so accommodating and the A-frame was so clean, well-stocked and charming. You can tell how much effort went into every single part of this “passion project”! We felt like we got to experience the serenity of Juneau but had all the amenities we could possibly need. Our only regret is not staying longer! Thank you Amanda!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Buoy is a stunning A-Frame cabin with beautiful views of the Gastineau Channel and the Juneau mountains. Amanda has all the details covered creating a warm, sparkling clean cozy respite. Definitely a 5 star stay!!!"

This was the best stocked Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in - anything you could need was there. It made for a really comfortable stay! Amanda was so responsive and helpful to communicate with. We arrived to some sweet treats and drinks she left for us and a welcome note! The house was even better in person than in the pictures! The house is tucked in the woods but has a view of the water and is just a short drive from downtown juneau. The welcome booklet has a ton on information on exploring juneau. Would highly recommend this as a cozy spot for staying in Juneau!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful, very well organized, and has a great view. Our entire family enjoyed the house very much, and wished we could stay there longer.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was possibly the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. It seemed newly updated, was perfectly clean, had a nice bathroom and kitchen, and comfy beds. The unit was spacious, the kitchen was stocked with everything we could have needed included snacks and eggs, and the bathroom had unexpected amenities as well for anyone who forgets toiletries. Cannot recommend more!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay with Greg and Betty was last minute, but we couldn't have picked a better place! We got there early and Greg greeted us through Ring and let us check in a little early. The place was perfect in every way! Beautiful surroundings, beautiful and clean home and the hot tub was just what we needed. If we are ever back in Juneau, we will definitely stay again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Greg and Betty had an amazing spot. After spending the day running around with a 7 year old we were eager to relax and just chill. Not only was the space super homey - but - everything we forgot (a toothbrush, a q tip, even spices!!) ended up being located in the home! It was nice that they provided these items at no additional cost. You can tell the owner takes great care, and we really appreciated that. Great place, quiet, and cozy. Perfect for a small family or a few friends. 👍👍"

We were there during a big snowstorm. We really enjoyed warming up in the hot tub. We took lots of leisurely strolls to the beach area on the other side of the neighborhood. It’s a little outside of town, but it only took a few minutes to get to groceries and restaurants.
The apartment is clean and comfortable. The hosts are kind and considerate. Highly recommend this property."

Thanks Greg and Betty! We will hope to come and stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Greg and Betty's apartment! I was traveling with young children and it was such a fun surprise when we arrived to find kids books, puzzles and coloring supplies laid out for us. The living room and bedrooms were very cozy and the kitchen was really well stocked - we loved the farm fresh eggs they shared for our Sunday breakfast. The hot tub felt private and it made for a great home base activity in between trails and playground expeditions. Greg and Betty were very communicative and made our stay a breeze. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We has such a wonderful time staying here!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so blown away with this air b&b. Living in Georgia we pride ourselves on southern hospitality, this is also true in the south of Alaska.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Their place is exactly as described, it was absolutely beautiful and just far enough out of Juneau to feel the wilderness and the quietness of the woods. We had everything we needed and more, the kitchen had enough equipment for a Thanksgiving dinner but luckily I didn’t have to cook any of that. The hot tub was a perfect ending after trekking around all day and on the last night, we were finally able to sit and enjoy a little fire and Greg even shared some king crab legs with us. Thank you for putting so much into your lovely apartment."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the very best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Sparkling clean, wonderful kitchen with all you need to cook with, cozy, comfortable, great beds and linens. The hot tub was wonderful. Great location near Auke Bay. So impressed! Well done Greg and Betty!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg and Betty were the best hosts I’ve had in a long time! Not only was their place amazing (my dad’s friends had never stayed in an Airbnb before and are now eager to do it again), but they were super responsive with lots of recommendations on food, local trails, and even helped me find a place a few days later after I had checked out and they didn’t have availability. They’ve also got a book of Juneau suggestions.
The place was spotless, elegant, large, and had every amenity we could think of. Sad we didn’t have time for the hot tub but it looked so nice! The beds were so comfortable, the three 75 year old men with me said they hadn’t gotten better rest on the trip. The blackout blinds were such a nice touch with Alaska having so much sunlight this time of year. While it is attached to the house, it feels super private and we didn’t hear anyone else the whole time.
I couldn’t have found a better stay for our time in Juneau. Stay with Greg and Betty if you have the chance!"

Cute town. FYI If you arrive late you may have to car pool a taxi with others

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is ""tiny"" as advertised up-front. Don't expect a recliner couch, t'ain't one. A very comfortable clean efficiency almost directly downtown making it very convenient for walking around and then simply crashing out.

Close enough to most everything that we walked back and forth to the house 3-4 times in the day. Even off street parking!
Thanks so much!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space to check out Juneau and be able to walk home after exploring downtown. We loved it here!!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable.
A night lite would have been useful as when the lights were turned out from a switch on the wall at the foot of the bed it was hard to navigate and get situated in the bed. As a result I had to leave porch light on for sufficient light to navigate. While a coffee maker was provided it was hard to reach. Luckily I was tall enough. Also, coffee had to be made from grounds, not a problem, but I had to open a full pack and reseal afterwards. I would recommend a single cup Kuerig in its place with a selection of K-cups including tee. There was insufficient powdered creamer and packets of sugar.
The location was superb for what I wanted to accomplish - tour the Alaska State Capitol Building."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly where you want to be when visiting Juneau! Less than 10 minutes walking to anywhere in downtown! Super convenient. The space was perfect for our 2 day layover off the AMHS Ferry. Great communication. Having a tiny home while here was perfect for a quick pack up for when it came time to leave! This is where I would stay if I came back to Juneau.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our place was absolutely perfect for walking downtown or going for hikes. Cozy spot, quiet, and well cared for!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but lovey things to say about Khrystl as a host, and her lovely tiny home.

Khrystl was very helpful and communicative, and I would not hesitate to recommend the Juneau tiny house—I’d come back to Juneau just for the tiny house!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five minute walk to the water, but in very quiet neighborhood. Comfortable and clean. Khrystl wins the all time Airbnb award for great snacks and drinks. Best for one person wanting a comfortable, small, downtown space."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is small but very centrally located and quiet. Khrystl is quick to respond and offers a nice assortment of treats that were appreciated.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Juneau Tiny House was perfect for my recent visit to Juneau. Didn’t rent a car as this place is very close to downtown with many shops, restaurants, museums, and the Alaskan state capitol building. Do however need a ride from the airport. The Tiny House has everything I needed for a comfortable stay including a Murphy bed, shower with fast running hot water, microwave, and refrigerator for leftovers from the many places to eat. Quiet place away from the main streets. Great tiny house for the single traveler or couple. Thank you Khrystl for the quick communication and a very nice stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Khrystl’s tiny house is the perfect base of operations for experiencing downtown Juneau and the trails above. Off street parking meant we could leave car behind till ready to explore Douglas or Mendenhall and beyond. Have a question? Khrystl was on it and we had our answers in minutes!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect Tiny home located downtown within walking distance of everything. Was stocked with all the amenities needed, and Khrystl was very accommodating and quick to reply. 10/10 recommend for an affordable stay."

Side note: I loved beverage selection in the mini fridge! Thank you so much for such a kind touch!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Khrystl was an amazing host. Location of her house was just a couple blocks away from the main downtown and all the activities that we needed to get to. She responded right away when we had small issues with the temperature and was able to trouble shoot it quickly. Overall amazing stay and would definitely recommend this place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny house was exactly as pictured. Small and tidy space and perfectly located close to downtown. Loved the wifi, available snacks, and storage space. Thanks for a great stay!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is in a perfect location for everything on Juneau! The Murphy bed was extremely comfortable , towels were soft as could be and I walked all over the city ! Everything you need is in this tiny house !"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean cozy lodgings in a great location! Small space as described but perfectly fine for a couple nights. I didn't need to use the garage for additional storage but if I'd brought a larger suitcase I probably would have.
Would be nice to have a few non-slip strips on the deck in front of the space for wet or icy conditions, as the wood there is really smooth and can get slippery.
Had a great stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house had everything I needed. It was warm and dry, and easily walkable to downtown, a trailhead, and the wster. It was easy to get what i needed and be entertained without a car. The city bus system was grest. Airport to near the house for 2 dollars and in about an hour."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time! Thanks so much. The space is beautiful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful in a wonderful area. It has everything you need in the kitchen. Carin is a great host. This is the best place to stay in Juneau I think.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Carin’s place while in Juneau for work. It’s about a 20 minute drive to downtown. The incredible setting, brand new clean apartment, and great hosting were well worth it. Highly recommend and will stay again if it’s available next time I’m in Juneau.
Walkable to the water and nice beach, near amazing hiking and walking trails, easy access to good restaurants in Auke Bay, and all the amenities you need."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful inside and out. Carin was always available and quick to respond if we had questions.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute treasure of a place! So happy we stayed here during our stay in Juneau. It’s close enough to enjoy downtown, but far enough away to not feel mixed in with all the other tourists. The location is gorgeous and so peaceful! The place itself is as clean and welcoming as they come. Carin is fantastic as well, she makes the process easy and enjoyable! Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Juneau."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carin’s place is truly a gem! She is communicative and the place is all that is listed to be and more! Carin goes above and beyond to ensure her guests are at home! I look forward to future stays at Carin’s place!!! It is truly one of the best AirBnb experiences I ever had!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a beautiful rental with high end appliances and finishes. We have recently stayed at lovely rentals in Palm Springs and Turks and Caicos, and we were surprised to find our favorite spa bathroom right in the middle of Alaska’s woods at Carrin and Crissie’s place! The shower tile is stunning!
The kitchen appliances are sleek and modern, and we loved having a VitaMix to use!
The bed is comfortable, and there is plenty of storage space in the bedroom with a full size dresser and an oversized closet.
Communication with our hosts was friendly and efficient, and we loved the peace and tranquility of the area. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Carin was an absolutely FABULOUS host!! Before our trip she went to extraordinary lengths to give us advice on everything Juneau: from dowtown restaurants to whale tours to cruising to a stunning fyord and a calving glacier, the Tinglet Nation culture and the Capital City history. Oh yeah - when she found out we desparately needed an early checkin because of a tough journey to Juneau - she made it happen!
Carin's apartment is STUNNING! The location, the peacefull environment, the nearby hiking and the ambience are just what a traveler dreams of. Impeccably clean kitchen. The living space is beautifully decorated, appointed with exquiste furniture and a wonderful bedroom / bathroom. After a long day of exploring & hiking, we loved sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. WiFi was awesome.
Carin is the BEST Airbnb host we've had in many years of traveling. Unparelled.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carin and Chrissy’s home was just perfect for our trip. It’s in the perfect spot for easy access to Auke Bay, the valley, Lemon Creek, and just far enough from downtown to avoid all the crowds and tourist buses. Every amenity we could possibly need was available and they were so quick to offer additional support. Their little extras also made our entire stay so much easier; we utilized the bear bells, bear spray, umbrellas, and tide and hiking guides. Thank you so much!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carin’s place was great! It had everything we needed and we really enjoyed the Lena Beach area, it was a beautiful spot to walk around. We would totally stay again when we’re back in town!"

The place is immaculate and has everything you need to feel right at home. Everything was clean and in great condition. We felt right at home. The best part is the location. It is a little drive from downtown but you can’t beat the views and surroundings. Just a few minutes away is Lena beach and a ton of trails.
We will be back.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Timothy’s place matched exactly what I needed for my first trip to Juneau. I stayed for 2 weeks while I was visiting for work. It was only a short drive from the airport and to everything I needed to access. Very clean and fully stocked. I hope to stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We're so pleased that we decided to stay here instead of a hotel. It felt like we got a true Alaskan experience. Cozy, quiet, private, and excellent location (near the Glacier and other outdoorsy spots). It was really nice having a second storey balcony to enjoy views and relax."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Only a mile from the airport and the neighborhood was super quiet and safe. When our cab didn't show up to take us to catch our early morning flight home, we had to make a fast walk to the airport. So glad we were close by!!"

Fantastic views, quiet neighborhood, so easy to walk to the grocery store and nearby gym, and hosts were great! Highly recommend! We hope to return to this listing! Oh, and fast wifi! Usually we have issues with listings having weak wifi in Juneau listings. We were using the internet a lot with zero issues."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed everything about our stay at Alder Flat! The pictures are accurate and the place was immaculately clean. However, there was so much more to this quaint apartment that made us feel at home and left us wishing we could to stay longer. For Instance, Timothy's apartment felt pleasantly stocked. During our stay if we unexpectedly needed something- I would open a drawer and just like magic there it was. Inside: the linens, pillows, and bed itself were all super comfortable and of good quality. The shower is roomy with the hardware hung high and a wonderful amount of water pressure. The washer and dryer are new and worked great. Oh and the open kitchen with the large amount of counter space gave us plenty of room to enjoy meals inside. Outside: beautiful mountain and garden views, a nice area to sit and enjoy morning coffee, a large drive way and easy access to take out the garbage. But more so, super friendly neighbors and a clean quit neighborhood. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once inside, Tim's place is like home. Washer, dryer, dishwasher, full size refrigerator, very clean, kuerig everything you could want or need . We ate breakfast staring at the mountains as well as neighbor's garden from the seating area at the top of the stairs.
I would give 5 stars, but the stairs were cause for caution when carrying heavy luggage or anyone with gait difficulties. He was correct there are 16 steps that go straight up with only a wooden outside handrail used for support.
It is located close tothe airport, but 15 minutes from the downtown and most activities. During our summer 2023 trip that cost $30 each way whether by Lyft or local cab"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect spot for a last-minute booking when weather prevented us from getting to our destination. We were able to book, confirm, and get into the place all within about thirty minutes, and we had a very comfortable night. Thank you!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is our second time staying here- love it.. selected it as it’s within walking distance to/from the airport.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy check in and check out process. Apartment was clean and the beds were really comfortable! Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect quick overnight - we arrived on the evening ferry and flew out early the next morning. Everything felt brand new- nicely decorated and we enjoyed having our own space in a quiet neighborhood for a good night’s sleep. We actually walked to the airport as it was barely a mile away and we really appreciated the half&half for coffee in the fridge and made some toast before we left in the early morning.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice clean and comfortable place to stay in a great location. Can park right in front of stairs for easy access to the vehicle.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had some travel plan interruptions that didn't allow us to make full use of our reservation. Kiara treated us more than fairly in the way she handled the whole situation, even though it had nothing to do with her or problems with the rental. First class service and great customer service. We'll be staying with her again next time we're in Juneau!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great stay! Accurate description, responsive hosts, clean, and comfortable place! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this cozy and modern apartment. It has everything that one would need for a several-day stay, every modern appliance imaginable. We liked that the house was away from downtown, and it was quiet at night. The proximity to the Mendenhall glacier was also a plus. We highly recommend this place to a family of 2 or 3 visiting Juneau.  We had a very pleasant stay, enjoyed Juneau a lot and staying in this nice apartment contributed to our wonderful (although too brief) visit to Juneau."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so lucky to find this great place for our week in Juneau. The apartment has everything we needed and much more to make our stay easy. We’ve stayed at Air BnB’s in many locations over many years and this was by far one of the best. It is super clean, welcoming, comfortable and cozy. The bed and linens were awesome too! If we are ever back in Juneau, we will be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot that felt super homey, clean and comforting. This was a quick one night stay as we were on our way back from Glacier Bay to the lower 48 but needed a spot between flight days. Awesome bonus is that it was only a 1.5-2 mile walk to Mendenhall Glacier along a very safe and beautiful path. If you're into exploring the area, this is a great spot near the glacier to do so. Towering mountains all around make this a great area as well, too bad we didn't have longer to enjoy!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kiara was a great host and promptly answered any of our questions. The location was walkable to Mendenhall Glacier tourist centre and other lovely walks. The bus was close by and reasonably frequent - make sure you have dollar notes as no credit cards or change given. But still 12 mile from Juneau itself. Hiring a car would be good. No restaurants nearby and groceries several miles away
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at Kiara's place. Thanks so much for having us again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a week in Juneau, this home is right next to Thunder Mountains and super close to Mendenhall Glaciers, such a beautiful location. The home has every amenity you could possibly need, our airlines misplaced our luggage and we didn’t need to buy a thing until we got our stuff back. It’s a quiet family-friendly neighborhood. The place was clean and well-maintained. The hosts were super friendly. We had an amazing vacation!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Juneau is spectacular! We were so grateful to have the flexibility to come and go everyday - hiking in so many different areas and trails. We appreciated Kiara's friendly and clean and simple space. She has really thought through what a traveler to her area might need - including black out curtains for the long summer days in Alaska, outdoor chairs to take on a picnic, washer and dryer, easy coffee, puzzles, cards, etc. She went above and beyond to meet our needs quickly. The bed was super comfortable. Loved our stay here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was looking for a nice place within walking distance of my daughter's home. Kiara's place was perfect in every respect! Clean, up to date, enough space to have the grandkids over a few times, quiet neighborhood, and a 15 minute walk to my daughter's house."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is spotless, nicely furnished and perfect for my weeklong stay in Juneau! I will definitely stay there again for my return business trips to Juneau."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kiara’s place was great. It was nice to be on the side of town near the airport. There are parks nearby and it was great to be so close to Mendenhall that we could easily cruise up at the end of the day when it was relatively empty.
The space is clean and free of clutter, but stocked with things we needed. The appliances were all easy to use and nice quality. Everything was easy and straightforward.
Host were quick with suggestions and responses. Very helpful. We would certainly come back!"

It was extremely clean and cozy.
The bed was extremely comfortable with extra pillows.
Kiara was very quick to respond to any of my questions.
The property is minutes to the Glacier and wildlife viewing opportunities; in the other direction, minutes to restaurants, grocery, etc.
The location at the base of Thunder Mountain provides great scenery.
I visit Juneau about three times a year for business purposes. As soon as I know my next scheduled date, I plan to book this property again.
I highly recommend this property to business or leisure travelers."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. Clean and comfortable. House was also stocked with some nice extra items, like basic kitchen spices, toiletries, and a nice welcome basket.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect ending to our vacation in Alaska! Kiara and Albert's place is perfect and has all the amenities you'll want and need. The washer/dryer was a godsend after two weeks of hiking and exploring, the kitchen was fully stocked and the place was spotless.
Kiara was so responsive and on top of any questions we had.
The apt. is in a great location - close to the Mendenhall Glacier and the airport and away from the cruise life that is downtown.
Highly recommend getting a car - there is a bus stop walkable to their place but it's slow movin!
If/when we come back to Juneau, we'll definitely be booking with Kiara and Albert again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kiara's place was lovely!!! SO clean, comfortable, and somehow even nicer the pictures. communication, check in and hospitality were super smooth. the location, on a quiet residential street, was perfect for us. You could actually walk to Mendenhall Glacier state park. The drive to downtown Juneau was about 17 minutes but we barely went as we were avoiding the cruise ship crowds.
We hope to return to Juneau in the fall/winter and plan to stay there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in the unit! It was in a quiet neighborhood and the unit itself was very quiet. We decided not to stay downtown Juneau and opted for a place outside of downtown. It was about a 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown which wasn’t bad. The place was immaculately clean and was great because it offered parking, a coffee maker, hairdryer, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/washer and dryer. Everything was new and the place was spacious. It is perfect for 3 people (adults) or a family of 4. There was a full kitchen with everything. I loved there was a little walk in closet with hangers and storage. There is a pullout couch in the living room. For 1-2 additional guests. The one suggestion I gave to the owners was to install blackout curtains in the living room because in the summer the sun doesn’t really go down. So I recommend bringing a night eye cover just in case. I highly recommend it!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. Everything you could need. Highly recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kiara’s place was immaculate and had the perfect touches.
Like fully stocked Kona coffee and cream for the Keurig. King size bed was extra comfortable and even the fold out was comfortable for my 6’7” son to sleep in.
Great location in a quiet neighborhood. Couldn’t have been better for Us.
Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful apartment on the side of a home nestled below Thunder Mountain. Beautiful location with an easy walking distance of mendenhall glacier trails and park.

The entire apartment is essentially brand new. The apartment is very convenient to the airport, Mendenhall Glacier, Auk Bay, and not far from downtown Juneau. We plan to return for our next visit to Juneau!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was just perfect for what we needed. Located in a sweet little neighborhood, it was easy to get to and a beautiful drive. Kiara had thought of everything - from the bathroom amenities to extra blankets to kitchen essentials. It was clean and cozy and plenty of space for my husband and I. She brought us the newspaper in the morning, left us a windshield scraper for early morning frost, and gave us extra recommendations for coffee shops nearby. The space was clean, super quiet, and very comfortable. We will definitely reach out to Kiara next time we are in Juneau!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean. Super comfortable. Close to the airport and less than half the cost of any hotel in Juneau - prices more than double once the cruise ships start coming.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rob's an excellent host and he was quick to answer any questions we might have. This is an amazing little place to stay.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob was responsive, friendly, and offered an early check-in. The place is right by the airport. I would recommend getting a rental car if you’re going to stay here, like I did, so you can explore downtown Juneau and the surrounding area. Both downtown and the Mendenhall Glacier were easily accessible via car, and the airport, of course, is right nearby."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s executive suite is a neat place to stay, supper easy access to the airport and food options. I’m definitely staying on my next trip to Juneau."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tom is a top notch hostess with great communication and attention to details. He cares immensely about each and every guest and was very accommodating in many ways. He knows Juneau and is a wealth of information. I highly recommend Tom's Airbnb.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would stay here any time, it was perfect for what we needed. Ideal location, steps away from the airport/necessities, and a bus stop that took us everywhere we needed. Also felt super safe and comfortable, for an amazing price. 100000x recommend this place"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was a convenient five minute walk from the airport, across the parking lot and over a small wooden stream with salmon. Checking in was easy and secure, and the space was very tidy.
This area is in “the valley”, a 15 minute drive to Mendenhall Glacier and “downtown”. Only a five minute walk to the public bus stop, but a rental car is recommended to make traveling easier, and to allow space on public transit for locals!
As of this review the kitchenette has a microwave and refrigerator. The washer and dryer is very convenient, and the shower is high quality. Will recommend to anyone visiting Juneau! -R"

It's $20-23 for a taxi or LIFT to the hospital or COSTCO, and $12 to Fred Meyer each way. An umbrella is provided if it's rainy. The studio is very quiet. The washer/dryer and large refer with freezer and microwave is a real plus! The wifi is fast! The big screen TV with Dish/and all the streams is beyond a channel surfers' dream. If you can't do 12 stairs to the bathroom, don't book this!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable space. Nicely situated close to the airport with easy access to both downtown and the valley. Dedicated parking spot was a bonus!

I asked a lot of questions about the area and he was full of info and resources. It’s the perfect place for a couple, or you could even fit a couple kids on the futon.
Super close to the airport See you are just a few minutes from downtown on one side and just a few minutes from whale watching and the Mendenhall Glacier on the other side.
We would totally stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place, well worth it, and much better than a hotel."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rob’s place was perfect for my stay in Juneau - he was very responsive and extremely flexible as my stay was unexpectedly cut shorter than initially planned. I appreciated his hospitality and would highly recommend!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob's place was super clean (new construction) and convenient. The large bed was very comfortable (medium firm) with nice linens. Located in a commercial area near the airport, we had no problems arranging Lyft rides to downtown Juneau, to the ferry to Glacier Bay National Park, and to Mendenhall Glacier. Monday through Friday we also used the express buses which stop at the nearby (5-minute walk) Nugget Mall to get downtown and to the glacier for just $2. The buses ran right on schedule. There is some airport noise during the day, but it was mostly quiet in early mornings and evenings. Breeze Inn, the local convenience store, is very close by and open 24 hours. It had large, tasty pre-made sandwiches and salads (refreshed daily) for under $10 - best value in town! There was a glitch with the wi-fi one morning, but Rob took care of it immediately upon our notifying him."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place ! So comfortable and the a walk way from the mall and restaurants that are near by !! I would stay again ..
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spotlessly clean ! We stayed for four days and it was a comfortable stay. Rob was very kind to provide us with local recommendations (which turned out to be good). This place is just a walkable distance from the airport, hence very convenient if you land late at night! We had a late flight to catch . Rob was generous to allow us for late checkout. Overall, great experience ! We would love to stay here if we are in Juneau again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay close to the airport. It’s a good little spot for a couple of people. The creek outside the window was relaxing to listen to at night.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Would highly recommend. We booked Rob's place because it was priced better than anything else we found but ended up loving the place so couldn't have been happier. Great location - less than 10 mins to downtown and less than 5 to the Mendenhall Glacier.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent place to stay. When in Juneau this is the place. Thanks for being so great!

2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bring your own toilet paper, there wasn't any in the apartment and the stores were all closed by the time we got there"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob's place is perfectly located between the airport and my favorite little restaurant, Donna's. It's very clean and surprisingly quiet given it's proximity to the airport. The bed was especially comfortable! It was great to save money on a rental for the entire stay. We could just walk over to the airport to pick one up as needed. Rob was communicative and super friendly! I would absolutely recommend this apartment to anyone needed a clean and peaceful place to rest."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. We enjoyed the stay and communication with the host is smooth too.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aside from this location being PERFECT for our red-eye flights, this Airbnb was a great spot to rest after hikes and get ready for a wedding!
If you’re planning on visiting during Juneau’s summer months, definitely make sure you stay at a place with a washer/dryer. The one we had at this Airbnb definitely helped us do more with less(:
All in all, this place adds to a long list of reasons as to why I only stay at Airbnb’s. Rob’s place is super safe, clean, and gave us everything we needed to have a perfect trip!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodations. It was clean, comfortable bed, functional washer/dryer (yeah) and conveniently close to airport. Better than described. Communication with Rob was great. We were welcomed with Water bottles and a couple cute pins."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob's place was exactly what we needed. It's in a great central location with restaurants and stores nearby and yet not in downtown Juneau with the crowds of cruise ship passengers. It was clean, well-equipped, and communication and check in were easy. We'd like to stay here again the next time we're in Juneau."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and a wonderful stay!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a GREAT studio. It is in a convenient location next to the mall, the airport and the bus routes. There are plenty of places to eat within a quick walk, and some markets slightly further out. It is also well built and very quiet. The owner lives above the unit, and we never heard footsteps. The only drawback is that the bathroom is downstairs from the studio, so if mobility is a challenge for you, this might not be the best option. Otherwise, absolutely 5+ stars!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal location, phenomenal host. Rob has made the space super welcoming for travelers, and I appreciated how our communications went with some of my non-typical work hours. Would absolutely stay again next time in Juneau"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Staying at Rob's AirBnB was a welcome improvement over any of the nearby airport hotels, and in most cases, less expensive. The room is large, bathroom great, and tv options appreciated. Large fridge and microwave allowed me to stay ten nights with no inconvenience. Easy walking distance from the airport, and several restaurants. I'll be back for sure."

About a 15 minute drive to downtown Juneau."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robs place was a hotel room with a personal touch! It was the perfect location if you’re not wanting to get a rental car, but still explore Juneau. I had no issues walking to the airport each morning and grabbing a taxi to where ever I needed to go. My final day I walked to Auke Bay which was a nice stroll to learn the area. Everything about Robs place was perfect for a weekend getaway. Very clean, all the amenities needed, and Rob was a great host!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and very close to the airport. Simple and nice place to stay in Juneau. Close to a lot of things in The Valley.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay at a clean and tidy unit. Great location, especially if you rely on public transportation to get around. Rob is responsive to questions in a timely manner. A good host all in all.The washer and dryer came in handy. Will not hesitate to stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rob's place was very cute and comfortable. Everything was clean and is a convenient location in the Mendenhall valley. Overall, would recommend this place!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob was a great host. Upon our arrival, he answered our phone queries promptly and told us about restaurants within walking distance. Donna's diner-style restaurant (a four-minute walk) was the best we found--hearty breakfast and tasty dinner specials.
We didn't have a rental car (they were hard to come by in July, and we really didn't want one.) Without a car, it is a less convenient location for visitors who want to discover Juneau. There were hourly public buses from the nearby shopping center, not ideal b/c most made lots of local stops. But the airport was less than a five-minute walk via a short nature trail, and we could always find a taxi there to share with arriving travelers heading into town.
The apartment was spacious; the queen-size bed was very comfortable; and the kitchen area had a full refrigerator, coffee-maker, and microwave, but not much in the way of supplies and dishware. As hearty seniors, we didn't mind that the bathroom, shower, and laundry facilities (well-supplied) were on the ground floor, while living quarters were upstairs. Stairs were wide and well-lit at night. But some may find the arrangement not-so-convenient.
Overall, we can recommend Rob's place for a short stay for work or a few days of sightseeing around Juneau. It is clean, quiet, very convenient to the airport, and less expensive than most places in town. We preferred our three nights in the center of town, but this is a reliable alternative with a very helpful host."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s place was seriously perfect for a quick stay in Juneau. It’s extremely close to the airport, perfect size for 2 people, and about 10-15 minutes into downtown. The place is easy to find and the bed was extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place for someone who wants to stay close to the airport or doesn’t have a rental car."

I would stay there again during my next Juneau trip.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great stay for professionals. Clean, convenient and comfortable. The bed is especially comfortable and you have all the amenities you need for a smooth trip! It’s also nice that there are trees outside the window, creating a peaceful environment so close to airport!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Rob’s airbnb! We stayed for 5 weeks from mid June, 2020 through July 22, 2020, as we were in Juneau helping an ill family member. The location was great. We didn’t want to be downtown with no parking or in Douglas either. Close to airport, car rental place, grocery, restaurants, OfficeMax, etc. Super. Quick ride to Auke Bay and the glacier. The building seems to be a pretty new build which we liked! The bed was comfortable. As we are 2 ladies, we felt quite safe in the airbnb, in our location, which was very important to us. The parking spot was right out front. The Keurig coffee maker was used everyday for coffee and then for hot water for oatmeal. We appreciated and used the fridge and microwave too. Perhaps we loved the washer/dryer best! We used it almost everyday and it worked great. Rob’s place was exceptionally clean and tidy! Nice! Only concern (minor) was that sometimes our T Mobile cell coverage from California didn’t always connect perfectly with the wifi or anywhere else in Juneau. But overall we got done what we needed to do just fine online. Rob was quickly responsive to our emails when we had a question come up. This was much appreciated. FYI-the bathroom- toilet, sink, shower and washer/dryer are on the lower level, while the bed, tv, kitchen area and couch are on upper level. In summary, we were very happy staying at Rob’s place! It was wonderful and we would certainly stay there again! Rob was a great host!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can walk to and from the airport in minutes. The space was very nice and clean. We had great communication with the host - his response was so fast and he was so flexible with our check out time. Would stay here again!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is more than convenient it is perfect. The location is ideal for anyone arriving from a flight and super easy access to return to the airport.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob’s place is wonderfully comfortable and very clean. It is so close to the airport and about 12 minutes from downtown and about 5-10 from Mendenhall Lake and glacier. It is stylishly appointed and a wonderful place to fall into the soft bed after a long day of hiking! The washing machine was great as we needed it to clean up after our hikes! I highly recommend Robs place for comfort, convenience and a restful experience! I would definitely stay there again!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location close to the airport and very comfortable place to stay. We saved quite a bit on our rental car by not getting one the night we arrived- instead picking it up in the morning when we were ready to begin exploring Juneau.

Thoughtful items like automatic lights for the stairs were a great touch. I was able to do laundry without any issues (he included tide pods and softener sheets). The space was extremely comfortable; cozy but not cramped. There were extra little items in the cabinet, like plates, utensils, etc. I really cannot think of anything I needed that wasn't addressed. Nice place; highly recommend."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the kind of place that makes you wonder how long hotels will be able to stay open. We were in luxury.
Our flights were such that it had to be a quick stay, but the host had everything so Set out so conveniently. The small touches were the best part: a water bottle on both side tables of the bed. Snacks for on the go. Coffee and creamer at the ready. Not to mention it was super comfortable.
The host was able to turn what could have been a stressful situation into one that set us up for an early flight out with no fuss. Truly a star host if there ever was one."

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Rob’s studio for five days and we absolutely loved it! His place is conveniently located close to the airport and is within walking distance to several restaurants and businesses. Even though it was in a business district, it’s on a very quiet block with a green belt area behind it. Once inside it felt quiet and secluded and allowed us to just relax and enjoy lounging on that comfy bed! It also has new/updated fixtures and is very clean. We loved having wifi, tv w/cable, and a washer and dryer in our suite. The check in process was a breeze. Most importantly, Rob was a wonderful host. I could tell that he really cares about the comfort of his guests and wants them to get the most out of their trip to Juneau. We will definitely try to stay at Rob’s the next time we go to Juneau."

Everything was very clean, and I was impressed that Rob provided Tide pods which came in really handy after long hikes and bike rides. Even though it's next to an airport, I didn't really hear any planes at night. I was out during the day so I can't really speak to the air traffic at that time. This place is right next to the bus stops too, both express to downtown as well as the long route."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I give Rob’s AirPORTBnb Executive Studio two thumbs up, ten if I had ten thumbs. This was a wonderful place to stay; I would Recommend it to anyone traveling to Juneau.

Rob was very accommodating and helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was oh-so comfortable. The room had a Keurig Coffee maker, a refrigerator and huge TV. We plan to stay there again on our next adventure to Juneau Alaska

Very nice little place for a stay in Juneau!"

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rob was very responsive from the start and communicated throughout our short stay to make sure we were situated and comfortable. Rob's place is as advertised, very close to the airport, but also close to all major roads so you could get downtown easily. Rob's place might have been the nicest apartment I've stayed in using Airbnb; we were impressed with the stylish touches throughout, it was great having a washer/dryer, and the bed was THE most comfortable bed ever! The little kitchen area was so nice - Rob provided some snacks, a Keurig complete with many coffee/tea options, and a fridge! We are so happy we went with Rob's place as his is 10x nicer than any hotel or lodging option! Would 10/10 recommend Rob's place to anyone visiting Juneau!!"

2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! This is a well-appointed nest in a fabulous location. I followed Rob’s directions and walked across the airport parking lot, then through the little path, and easily found the door beneath the stairs. The lights had been left on for me, which I much appreciated on the dark and rainy night I arrived, and it was cozy and warm inside. This is the first time I encountered a first aid kid at an Airbnb, which made me wonder why they don’t all have first aid kits! Great idea (I’m happy to say I didn’t need it). The place has been recently renovated and decorated, and the attention to detail is evident in the choice of furniture, appliances, and flooring—I wish I could take the flooring home with me. Rob was very responsive to my messages and questions during my stay, too.
Very comfortable place in a convenient location, and I hope to stay here again."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob and his place are perfect. The close proximity to the airport is ultra convenient without any downsides-- we almost never noticed any sounds of planes.

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Juneau for about 5 days. The apartment was clean, comfortable, very modern, and convenient in so many ways. We decided not to rent a car, but as stated in the description , airport is walking distance. Public transportation is 1/2 block away and the express gets you into town in 15 minutes. Taxi's are available and will respond within minutes of calling. They can be a bit pricey, but public trans into town stops running at 6:00pm. We would probably rent a car next time (parking spot is provided) just to see more of Juneau and Douglas Island. Our visit was memorable and we cant state it enough how helpful Rob was in working with our nutty Flight and Ferry schedules. We hope to return to Juneau and would not hesitate to stay with Rob again."

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful, comfortable place to stay and is very convenient for the airport - just a few walkable minutes away!

Appreciate the thoughtfulness. Though we didn’t need the space heater, the place stayed plenty warm and did I mention how comfortable the bed is!?!

Big log walls with a modern touch and so tastefully decorated. I especially loved the large photo panels. There is a very well equipped kitchen and luxurious bedding and comfy bed.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My stay at Robyn’s place was everything I needed and more! I was there for work during record-breaking snow across three weeks. My initial fear of staying slightly “out the road” with wintery conditions was immediately put to rest. Robyn communicated with me frequently while still respecting my privacy. She and her family made sure the property was safe and accessible at all times. The view of the water was stunning and the unit had everything I needed. I can’t say enough great things about this property and host. I hope to be back soon!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Robyn was thoughtful and accommodating. She went above and beyond when we had a power outage on the street and had a snow day at home and were unable to get a few items from the store. I recommend this place to anyone.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn's Place is a MUST STAY. It's a 5 Star place on any lodging scale. The view is amazing; it is spotless clean; the bed and bedding is so comfortable; great furnishings; it is the Best In Class, Any Class. Robyn's communications are outstanding and to me that is one of the most important aspects to a successful Airbnb. It is as good or better than the pictures and descriptions say. Another nice touch was the Outstanding user manual that helps explain everything you need to know about the unit's operation during your stay. I would and will stay here again. The location is quite and prefect for all the outdoor activities you would want to do in Juneau and 6 mins to the AK Ferry Landing and 15 mins from the Airport. One of, if not the best Airbnb we have stayed in, and we spend about 90 nights a year in them. Cheers"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, private and peaceful. Had all the amenities we needed for our short stay and was very comfortable and clean. Robyn also communicated when the place happened to be ready for us early, which was thoughtful. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I would more than 5 stars if I could. This is easily the best airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The location of the apartment was perfect for our stay. It was so peaceful and I can’t rave enough about the views from the house. It was just stunning. The house was squeaky clean, well stocked kitchen, clean bathroom with wonderful shower and a comfortable bed. There are so many trails near by and activities around. Good restaurants around and Safeway near by made it convenient for us. Zeraldas Bistro was our favorite for food.
Robyn did a great job with the house and maintenance. She was super responsive and helpful with everything.
This apartment was definitely the highlight of our trip to AK. We are lucky to have found it! We will be visiting again for sure 😀"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay, and the beautiful views!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a must stay! The view from the apartment is gorgeous. Robyn was incredibly friendly and helpful when our ferry to Juneau was delayed. She was super accommodating helping us revise our stay and even refunded us the money for the days we couldn’t stay at the apartment due to the ferry. The apartment is incredibly cute and spacious, with a wonderful deck to enjoy the view of the water. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed to be able to do laundry and make dinners. Couldn’t be happier with our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can’t say enough good things about Robyn’s place! We stayed there for a week (our entire Juneau trip). It is tucked away in a quiet cove, away from the crazinesses that comes from the cruise ships. It is about 15 mins from downtown Juneau, which is just the right distance and time to let you enjoy Juneau but not get caught up in the tourist frenzy.
The apartment is exactly as pictured but the beauty of the surroundings can’t be captured in pictures. The place was clean, modern and with all the needed amenities. We had no problem exploring different parts of Juneau and going on tours while calling the apartment our home base. Robyn was very friendly, responsive and overall a great host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite Airbnb when I'm in Auke Bay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved our stay at their home, it is beautiful and the pictures don't give you the Ravens call or the eagle call. It's a great location with great parking, perfect space for our family of three that travelled to Juneau and had a car rental. The shower/tub was amazing, the beautiful detailing in everything from linens to decor was beautifully done. I slept so great in the fantastic bed, I even had a dream that I remembered (so comfortable and relaxed here). The view from the chairs in front were perfect to sit and sip on my coffee and watch the boats before we started our excursions for the day. I just can't rave enough about their beautiful place. Thank you for your kindness also!."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great alternative to being in cruise ship tourist filled downtown Juneau--beautiful views and great space. Waking up to a bear in the back garden the first morning and deer on the beach the second made our stay! Host was unobtrusive but very responsive--lots of good info. and a really nice, well-equipped space and neighborhood. Generous Keurig and cooking and laundry supplies too!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite Airbnb!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb, so i didn't know what to expect. This was wonderful. I was visiting family members near by, so, for me it was perfect. It is very close to Mendenhall Glacier, but a drive into downtown Juneau. Lots of local areas to walk and hike. The view out the window is spectacular! Whales, eagles and more to see. Looking forward to returning."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This my second time staying here. The view is gorgeous, the space is immaculate and bed is very comfy! Couldn’t ask for anything more!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Juneau has to be one of the best of the U.S. capital cities to visit, and Robyn's place has to be one of the best places to stay there. Everything is close; very little traffic. The airport is only a few minutes away, the enormous cruise ships downtown about a half hour. Almost as many people arriving/leaving daily from there as there are living in the city. Bears were roaming only five minutes north, and there was a whale in the harbor before our whale watching boat could even get out into the open water!
There are stairs, so this place is not for the mobility challenged, but the view is well worth the climb. Blackout shades were great for people who have trouble with the 18 hours of sunshine during the summer. All in all, an almost perfect visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet space with an amazing view of Auke Bay. We saw a pod of orcas over morning coffee! Robyn gave comprehensive directions and it was a seamless stay. About 20 minutes from Downtown Juneau by car, and very close to other outdoor recreation areas."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was quick, but perfect and as we were talking, Robyn’s husband offered a ride into town, but we already called for a cab, he left and came back to pick us up to show us a bear up the street, then brought us back again, full of information and helped plan a day of sightseeing, amazing experience, wonderful people"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn’s place was wonderful, beautifully clean and comfortable with an awesome view. It was about a 25 minute drive from the down town and cruise ship area in a quiet peaceful Auke Bay residential area which was just perfect for us. She lives on the premises and we were able to meet and chat with her and get suggestions about the area. We couldn’t have been more pleased with our stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Robyn’s place was a beautiful home base while visiting Juneau!

Don’t hesitate booking this one!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robyn's apartment with a view was the perfect place for our family of four while visiting family in Juneau. It was comfortable, clean and quiet. Robyn was a great host. We will stay there again next time we visit."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect stay for us! We are from a neighboring community and came by the Alaska Marine Highway system. Generally, the ferries come and go at the most ridiculous times and therefore it was just lovely to be only minutes away. Plus we always appreciate nature versus a town stay. This neighborhood is safe, beautiful and quiet nature, away from city sounds. A KILLER VIEW from the open and spacious accommodation. I really appreciated to be able to darken the bedroom but enjoyed the amazing views onto the water at night (we were there during a lunar eclipse and a blood moon) and the sunrise. For us, Robyn's place was the perfect setting with easy parking, a very comfortable bed and a very clean and well thought out apartment. We will be back, undoubtedly!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome listing. Enjoyed my stay. Will stay again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was perfect! Amazing views, pristine in condition, plenty of space with everything you could need and check-in was a breeze.

My favorite place to stay in Juneau and I’ll definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is amazing with a beautiful view. Everything about this place was great. The place is very clean. Has everything you may need.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed spending a week at Robyn’s place! The view is a highlight and even better than the pictures. The apartment is very comfortable and has everything you need plus more including a Keurig coffee maker with coffee pods as well as a well a stocked kitchen to cook meals there. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and did some things around there including visiting the great Forbidden Peak brewery but you definitely need a car to get around and to drive to / from downtown Juneau. Thanks for a comfortable place to stay in Juneau, Robyn!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I cannot recommend Robyn's very clean, charming, and comfortable apartment enough! The place was immaculate and the view....absolutely stunning! Robyn is the best. She was very welcoming and informative. She was accessible for questions and her communication to us was thorough. She even had flowers and a sweet note waiting for us when we arrived wishing us a happy 35th wedding anniversary. The apartment is on the second level of her home, so there are few stairs to navigate. There is a porch at the top where we enjoyed the view and eagle watching. There is a campground with a beach one mile away. It was a nice walk to this area and we enjoyed walking on the beautiful, stony beach. The best thing we did was hire a fishing guide to take us out Salmon fishing and whale watching. We were so lucky with two large salmon caught, and witnessing a pod of whales bubble feeding. An experience we won't soon forget. We hope to be back very soon, and we will definitely stay at this apartment if available!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All the 5 star reviews are spot on. It was great!! Beautiful space, art and of course the view is fantastic.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn’s place over looking Auke Bay is stunning. The accommodations are well laid out and all the essentials for cooking are provided. The handiness of laundry facilities were an added perk. The surroundings are peaceful and an easy commute into Juneau, the airport or over to Mendenhall glacier. It truly is a great place for a get away."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely perfect! It was clean and the bed was super comfortable. The place is in a great location with a couple really good restaurants nearby.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cozy and comfortable spot overlooking beautiful Auke Bay. We saw a pod of orcas and a humpback whale go by right along the shore below! Plus many more whales spouting in the bay beyond. Eagles and otters, too. All through the big picture windows or from the deck. We also walked to the Auke Bay recreation area and found a delightful trail to Louisa point and a stone beach. At one point a juvenile bald Eagle fluttered out of the brush near our feet and flew up to sit on a low branch to hang out with us awhile. Truly amazing wild life. Oh, and everything about Robyn’s place is perfect… Beautiful, peaceful, comfortable — all you could wish for. First-class all around!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely, the view is incredible and the apartment is private and has a wonderful layout. Sitting out on the deck we watched 2 bald eagles calling to each other and then land in a tree not far away. It was amazing."

Apartment was perfect, loved the location. Would absolutely recommend if you come to Juneau!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! I went up to Juneau on a whim and I came across this place knowing zero about the area. The location was absolutely perfect - close enough to amenities and downtown, but far enough out to give you that true Alaska feeling. The apartment itself has a spectacular view, it really can't be captured in words or pictures. You will find yourself just staring out the window. Place is well-stocked and super clean. Host (Robyn) is super responsive. This place is what Airbnb is really all about."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I look a huge leap of faith booking this home especially coming from FL but I am glad that I did.
Since day 1 of booking Robyn was always super helpful on giving information on all the closest grocery stores, COVID regulations and restrictions, weather updates, checking in / out.
I cannot say enough about this place. It is absolutely beautiful, the views are insanely gorgeous and Robyn has pretty much everything that you will need for your stay.
If you are looking to book a trip to Juneau, book this place ASAP!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robyn was very thoughtful and presented us with flowers for our staycation anniversary. It really made us feel special. The place was immacualte and clean. The view is stunning. Definately would recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying at this apartment! The king bed was so comfy! We loved the kitchen and the TV and the Keurig! Oh! And the shower. We are big and tall, so we appreciate accommodations that fit us generously.
The one thing to be aware of is that the seating in the living area is not comfortable for hanging out. So it’s something to consider if you plan to spend a lot of time in the apartment. But we would definitely stay there again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will love the apartment! The view is well worth the price you pay. We watched a sea lion play with a salmon while having coffee on the deck. You will need a rental car as it is quite a distance to restaurants and downtown but is in a beautiful area. You will not be disappointed!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodations! Clean, nice views, comfortable, all you need. Away from town with some solitude which is exactly what we were looking for. Great communication by host. Definitely hope to stay again. Thanks Robyn!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn has a fantastic location with an amazing view. The apartment is impeccably clean. The kitchen is well stocked, so you can do your own cooking if you like. It was very easy to get to the other areas of Juneau from the apartment. We really enjoyed our stay, and I highly recommend Robyn as a host."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Traveling with teenage daughter to visit family.
The apartment was very relaxing and what a beautiful view. The bed was so comfortable - slept very well there. Daughter loved having Netflix to wind down after days exploring. Kitchen was well equipped and easy to use.
Favorites - hanging out in the living room playing with my 4 year-old granddaughter and taking in the incredible view"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment with a stunning view. Comfy bed and towels, great water pressure. New and clean."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a magical spot - Robyn has incredible attention to detail and has created such a beautiful space! We were so happy we found this place. The view is spectacular. We rented a car which was necessary to get to Juneau (about 20 min drive), but we also really enjoyed exploring the local spots at the lake, Auxe Bay Cafe, and the Forbidden Peak Brewery. We had a fabulous time! Thanks so much Robyn!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic accommodation, fantastic location with a view to watch the eagles flying around in the evening

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robyn's home exceeded our expectations! the location is stellar, about 15 minutes from the airport. It sits in a quiet neighborhood one row back from the water. Her home is large and lovely with the airbnb apartment attached on top of their garage. The view from the apartment is breathtaking, the living spaces are clean and modern, the laundry comes in handy and the kitchen is fairly well equipped (no blender, but most everything else). Of all the airbnbs and vbros we've stayed at across the US and in other countries, this was hands down the best. Plus a good value for the money. it was only a touch more expensive than the old Travelodge in town. My family is already talking about coming back! Thanks!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place with an excellent view. Only a short drive to downtown and minutes from Mendenhall. Many amenities. Clean. Great place to see more of Juneau.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect Airbnb. Great communication and one of my favorite all-time places, the view is just amazing, you can even enjoy it right from bed, speaking of which is incredibly comfortable.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Book it as fast as you can! This place is a stunner! Beautiful location! Very inviting and the process was so easy!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was like winning the Airbnb lottery. It is exactly as described, and as beautiful as the pictures suggest. The home was clean and modern, with lovely touches of decor that gave the space such personality, while still allowing the wonderful view be the star.
Top notch appliances and fixtures, a VERY comfortable bed, and a really nice TV were things we really noticed and appreciated. The WiFi worked great during our stay.
We saw Robyn and family in passing a couple times during our stay, all being pleasant exchanges.
A couple things to mention. This is place is about 15 minutes north of the airport, and about 25 minutes north of downtown Juneau. So you’ll need a car. We didn’t mind the drive into downtown at all, and had planned to rent a car anyway, so it wasn’t an issue for us.
Robyn was quick to respond to questions, and she was very understanding, flexible and accommodating when some of our travel dates were altered due to Covid. She also helped us out with the disposal of some larger items we couldn’t take with us on the plane, which she absolutely did not have to do.
So, bottom line. Come to Alaska>>visit Juneau>>eat at Tracy’s King Crab Shack>>don’t waste your money on the tram if you can’t see the top docking station from the ground>>stay at Robyn’s place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic location and lovely apartment with beautiful views

(We were lucky enough to see a pod of Orcas from the living room window!) You can even see the view while lying in bed in the morning if you leave the bedroom door open. The owners are friendly and attentive to your needs without being intrusive. You will not be sorry you chose this place to stay when you come to Juneau!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn was really kind and sweet, friendly to talk with. I would definitely stay here if I visit Juneau again."

It’s a great place to stay any time of the year! It is spacious, modern, and spotlessly clean. The kitchen is efficient and well appointed. nice place to work while enjoying the view. Located in a lovely serene neighborhood just 15 minutes away from shopping and restaurants. Robyn is a gracious and hospitable host. Highly recommended!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Robyn’s place is a MUST stay! It’s a little off the beaten path which makes it that much more special. The deck over looks the bay which makes for the best coffee spot in the morning. There were so many special touches like coffee, teas, books of things to do, and all the necessary toiletries. We were so grateful for her quick responses and eagerness to give us day trip ideas. Look no further for the perfect Juneau experience! Minutes away from the airport, numerous hiking trails, and a brewery."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My partner and I could not have been happier with our stay! The location was great (away from downtown but obviously not too far) and the view was amazing throughout the day. The place was incredibly clean and Robyn was extremely communicative throughout. Great host, great space, great experience. Would absolutely stay again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those reviews you hate to make, because the place will become more popular, and harder to book! Nevertheless, if you get the chance, stay here. The pictures of this space don’t do it justice, it is bigger and roomier than you’ll think from the pictures. It is a separate apartment on a new private home, on the outside with private stair access. You have your own bathroom, kitchen, and all the amenities you’ll need, and that view! There aren’t many AirBnb offerings in Juneau where you can stare out the window at a gorgeous view, and as an added bonus you have your own private deck if you want to watch it from outside. The driveway and parking area is large, so no issues with parking.
If you’re thinking Point Lena is too far away from town, remember that nothing in Juneau is more than 15 minutes away. The hosts are very nice, and communication/questions are answered promptly. Great place that we’ll stay at again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Nice neighborhood, beautiful view, spacious/clean/modern apartment and great hosts! My family and I were beyond impressed with the location and quality of this airbnb. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Spectacular water view with a deck and great amenities. Location is perfect to go whale watching out of Auke Bay or the ferry and Allen Marine dock - only 5 minutes. Brewery also only 5 minutes away. Cute neighborhood our friend said is filled with million-dollar homes, and I believe it. Nice area for walks and AMAZING eagle viewing. VERY hospitable host family. Tons of kitchen storage and an enormous TV to watch Netflix and Hulu on. We even contemplated buying the house next door (under $1M) since we'd be in a great neighborhood with great neighbors;)"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay in Juneau if you want away from downtown! We loved the cozy, clean, artful, brand new space...and wish we could have stayed longer. Great apartment!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the PERFECT getaway retreat. The view is amazing and it’s really not a far drive from downtown even though it’s considered “Out the road”. It’s under 30 minutes to get to the Capital building and everything you need is in between. The apartment is adorable and well worth the visit! Robyn is a very accommodating host and a pleasure to do business with 😀
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous apartment with an ocean view. Modern and very clean. Robyn was very responsive throughout the booking process and during my stay. The unit came with a welcome PDF with so much information, very thoughtful! Would definitely stay again!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and enjoyable stay.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn’s place is super nice, cozy, and comfortable. I was a bit reluctant to book a place out the road in Auke Bay since I always stay downtown when I visit Juneau, but everything about this place was wonderful. The neighborhood is very nice for walking/hiking with gorgeous water and mountain views. There’s a variety of places to eat within 5-15 minute drive including Zerelda’s which has a fantastic lunch/brunch menu and is hands down my favorite eatery in the valley. The apt is fresh, modern, sparkling clean and has a memory foam king mattress that is the best I’ve ever slept on in an apt or hotel. It felt like home! The heated bathroom floor was a treat after our snowy hikes.
In addition, Robyn is easily accessible, responsive, and flexible which I really appreciated since we were concerned about weather cancellations. We had a very snowy weekend here and enjoyed every minute!
I would not hesitate to stay here again upon returning to Juneau and only hope it is available!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From the moment I walked in it was magical. I stayed during the winter, and the bathroom floor is heated! The driveway was continually accessible, plowed and graveled. The view both morning and night was unbelievably beautiful. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything I needed. The place was immaculate! There was a personal touch from the linens to the Decour. Robyn was quick to respond to any questions. A book of instructions and maps of the area are provided. GonZo for breakfast is a must. The apartment exceeded my expectations. You will be 100% pleased with this rental. Kim"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place with fantastic views and a wonderful host. Thank you, Robyn!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When you stay in Juneau, a view of the water and mountains is a must. The vista from Robyn's place is the best of Alaska! The apartment was super clean and comfortably appointed. The in-floor bath heat is quite the treat. Conveniently located a short ride past Auke Bay and the ferry terminal, we really enjoyed the Lena Loop location (and the forest frolf course nearby). The side-by-side arrangement with the main house and our perch above the garage, provided a perfect private get-away. We are seniors and managed the 21 stairs, but if you have mobility issues, this might not be the place for you. That said, the stairs were worth it for the view! We stayed 6 nights and loved it! Communication with Robyn was aways quick, polite, and efficient. We will stay again when traveling to the Capital and recommend family and friends to do the same. Excellent!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say other than - VIEWS! This place is very clean, cute, and overall perfect. Definitely one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. Their daughter even designed a lot of the art work (and made the delicious smelling soap in the bathroom), which was a very sweet personal touch. I would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you Robyn & family!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robyn's place is sparkling clean and it smells brand new! The communication was excellent and we couldn't have been more comfortable. We loved the view, even on the cloudy days we were there in November. We'd love to stay there again."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even better in person than it looks- what an amazing location! We had a terrific stay- quiet neighborhood, spectacular view, beautiful nature hikes and surfing in November!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location and ocean side view. Everything was super clean and available for use. Will definately visit again next time in Juneau

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was absolutely stunning and had an amazing view. The place was very clean and has a great modern feel to it. Waking up in the morning and looking out the window at the beautiful sunrise is a memory sure to be remembered! I would absolutely stay with Robyn again, and I cherish the time we spent in her place!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was above and beyond what we could have ever thought. The pictures do not do it justice. The most breathtaking views, it was functional, clean and comfortable. SO much bang for your buck. My boyfriend and I both agreed we wanted to move in.. lol. I never wanted to leave! We will most definitely be back and are hoping to stay here every trip we take to Juneau. It was a beautiful 20 minute drive to downtown, easy to find, nice quiet neighborhood and just the cutest place. So happy to have found this place!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This gem was the PERFECT place for our visit to Juneau. With gorgeous views, a super clean space and extremely comfortable bedding & mattress it was just right to recharge after a day full of exploring. Temps were a bi to cold for the outside deck, but absolutely appreciated having it there! We would definitely return and stay at Robyn's place!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to stay a little off the beaten path, with breathtaking views, look no further! Truly, you can sit on the deck of this beautiful apartment and watch the stunning views of Auke Bay, away from the crowds of downtown Juneau. The apartment itself it gorgeous and well-appointed, and Robyn was a gracious and thoughtful host. You could not ask for more."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful Airbnbs ever! Loved staying here!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, cozy home. It was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve been in, which was so appreciated! They also provided great touches, like coffee and extra towels, nice soaps, and great artwork on the walls! The view is amazing and we made good use of the deck overlooking the water. As it turns out, we lucked out and saw the northern lights from the deck, but even without it, the view of the stars would have been amazing regardless. Great hosts with an easy check-in process!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is clean, comfortable, and quiet. The view is amazing! It was very nice to spend time on the deck watching and listening to the waves. We loved our stay here."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Robyn is super sweet and very informative. It’s easy to access. Amazing spot with breath taking views. What a treat to wake up to that view! The place was spotless. Newly updated throughout. The kitchen is week stocked. Appreciated the k-cups! We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay very much. Highly recommend!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wish we could give more than a 5 star rating for location and view, value, and speedy communication. We certainly plan on staying here again when we come back to Juneau."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an awesome space with an amazing view of ocean where we saw seal and fish jumping out of water. The place was spotless and brand new. The host was tentative to all our questions and responded quickly. Stocked kitchen, laundry and bathroom. We will be back!!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! We loved our stay here. Everything in the apartment was clean and stylish while also feeling very welcoming and cozy. We appreciated the blackout shades so that we were able to sleep soundly, even with the light-filled Alaska summer nights."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I rarely give 5 stars across the board but this place is worth it! From the time we arrived it was obvious these accomplishments were very well planned out. It is very comfortable for the 3 of us. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and had a lot of lovely details including homemade soap! The kitchen was well appointed with all the basics. It was so nice shopping and having the large refrigerator/freezer to store everything. My teenager was in awe of the large 4k television... it did have an awesome picture. Lastly, the views were amazing! I loved being able to watch the boats come and go from either inside or outside on the balcony. I would definitely recommend these accomplishments hands down!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful place to stay! Downtown Juneau is cramped and filled with everyone from the cruise ships. This was out of town and in my opinion offered a better experience. Beautiful views, close to parks, walking, hiking, and boating. The place itself was well equipped and Robyn was fantastic and easy to reach. Highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An exquisite place, beautiful surroundings and stunning view. And the bed is super comfy! Robyn and her family are adorable and we had a wonderful time there. I wish we can come back some day :)"

We highly recommend this Airbnb and exceptional host!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at many places while working in Juneau, all very nice with nice hosts - Robyn and her space are hands down the VERY BEST!! From informative pre-trip communication, to easy entry, to the space with just-right furnishings, super-luxurious linens in the bedroom and bath, great artwork, lovely handmade soap, well-equipped kitchen, just a beautiful calm space perched on the hill above the bay with, a STUNNING VIEW! I will return!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place at a great value!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Robyn’s place. I found myself not wanting to leave because it was such a pleasant place. I plan to book again for my quarterly visits. The space was immaculate, modern, yet very comfortable. The view is absolutely incredible. Every aspect of the home is stunning and much more than I ever expected. It had everything I needed and thoughtful details like lovely handmade soap her daughter made. It felt like a spa experience in a private getaway."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate, comfy, and beautifully appointed. Fell into the warm nest of a bed the first night and woke to enjoy a great shower and a hot cup of coffee in the sun-soaked window enjoying the gorgeous view. Wow."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great
I would stay again"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rose petal cabin was just what I needed for a 2 night stay in Juneau. Conveniently located less than 10 min from airport and central Mendenhall Valley, it was an ideal location for my visit. The Kitchen was clean and equipped with everything you could need for cooking. Laura’s cabin was stocked with great reading! Would recommend and would stay again the next time I am in Juneau!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fabulous cabin with every amenity you could need. A full bathroom, kitchen and living room downstairs, the bedroom upstairs. Lots of local brochures were available, and Laura supplied us with lots of places to visit. Wonderful stay ad we would absolutely return without a question."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice spot! Definitely a great stop in Juneau
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura's place was perfect for a couple from Skagway needing to do errands! Close for the early morning ferry ride which is a huge plus! Cabin was cozy and had everything you need! I'm sure we will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s cottage is a quiet, peaceful home base for your adventures around Juneau. Close to Auke Bay and Mendenhall Valley, it’s in a great location for outdoor play, and is a short drive to the airport or downtown Juneau.
The cabin is a little too “cozy” for taller travelers (my 6’4” brother and I felt squeezed in the loft bedroom), but if you’re average height or fun-sized you’ll feel right at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura is a great host! She is very responsive and quick to answer any questions or needs that may come up!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for a very short weekend but could have stayed longer in this very cute, peaceful and clean airbnb! I really enjoyed the various travel books, historic Alaska books and games! Laura’s place was incredibly clean and easy to get to. If you rent a car this is a great alternative to downtown hustle n bustle. Next time I visit Juneau, I hope I can snag a reservation! 10/10 I would recommend staying here! If anyone has mobility issues I would not recommend only because the stairs to loft is alternating tread and can be tricky. I, however, found them just fine and a unique access to the upstairs."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, accurate description."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to get away, thanks Laura"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay there again. Very nice location quiet and great parking.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were beyond pleased with our homey stay. Truthfully we found the provide pictures didn’t do it justice. Location was great, felt somewhat secluded yet close to town’s needs along a beautiful cove drive. Cottage was pristine, cozy and small details like extra bathroom supplies and coffee/snacks rounded out the already memorable stay. Not to mention the owner leaving town recommendations/brochures and reaching out day one of stay to ensure we had we needed. Beds and pullout couch were comfy. Loft stairs were funky but took extra caution to get up and down with luggage. Thank you for such a lovely stay-no shortage of amenities. We will absolutely be recommending this to anyone visiting the area and will most certainly look forward to our next stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot right next to the bay!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent two nights at one of Laura‘s places. We really enjoyed the calm surrounding of Auke Bay. The option with the car was perfect! Nice, tiny, cozy and very responsive host. Loved it! Thanks Laura"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy and convenient little spot was the perfect home base from which to explore Juneau! We appreciated the washer and dryer after a week on the road, and the kitchen was roomy and well-stocked for our cooking needs. Do the recommended walk to the neighborhood beach: there’s lots to see out there!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed our stay at the Sitka Rose cabin. It had everything we needed and we liked that it was located in a quiet neighborhood. My only complaint was that there was only enough hot water for about a 5 min shower.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at this cozy cabin! Laura was very friendly and helpful. The cabin is spotless with plenty of extra linens, a full kitchen, books, and games.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I always like it when I get it right the first time. Laura’s guest cabin was just right for a home base for a week in Juneau.

I whole heartedly recommend Lars and Laura as both hosts as well as the cabin.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura’s place was the perfect spot for me while working nights in Juneau for the week. Super quiet and the upstairs was so dark when the curtain was shut. I will try and come back for recreation since I was so comfy there. Thanks for a great stay! ☺️

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura was great to work with. She always got back to me quickly when i had questions. Nice little cabin. Close to airport and university. The car that you could rent too was great. Got around well on the snow and ice in Juneau. I would highly recommend staying here. Only issue was it was hard to find in dark but that was due to lack of city street lights only.
Had a great time! Comfy little place!"

Since we did much hiking,
it was great to be able to wash/dry our clothing there.
If you have bothersome knees/ankles/hips/balance, consider sleeping on the first level rather than climbing the stairs.
An extra bonus was being so close to a lovely beachy area to watch sunsets, bird watch, & just peacefully enjoy nature. The Auke Bay are is such a wilderness treasure!
All the citizens of Juneau we encountered during our 8 day stay we very kind and helpful - what a lovely town."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visited Alaska for the first time and stayed at Laura's cabin. It was clean and nice. Definitely worth the price. The kitchen was a bit small with no dish washer, or dryer inside but there isn't much space.
Everything feels very cozy and quality."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was warm, inviting, and had everything we needed to be comfortable. The bedroom is up some stairs that can be a bit daunting, so if you're less mobile, I'd consider sleeping on the sleeper sofa downstairs :)."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the space! Perfect distance from everything. If I wanted to go out it wasn’t to far, and if I wanted to stay in it wasn’t to close. Very homely. Would stay again in a heartbeat"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazingly, cozy, stylish cabin in a great location that allows you to see more of Juneau than just downtown. The short walk to outer point is beautiful and hosts shoveled the driveway area every day when it snowed. Couldn't imagine having a better time staying anywhere else and for the value, I wouldn't recommend anywhere else besides this cozy Auk Bay cabin!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great host and tends to needs quickly. Great location, a short drive away from stores, hiking trails, the Mendenhall Glacier, and a 20 minute drive from downtown Juneau."

Laura is an excellent host. She responds promptly although everything we needed we already there. She even sent us fresh towels and bathmats midway through the stay and we didn't even ask."

2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy to find with Laura’s instructions. Difficult bedroom climb for those not able to easily ascend very steep stairs or have luggage. Bathroom downstairs. Very comfortable sofa bed however that folds out easily. Enjoyed our visit overall.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If this place happens to be available when you need it, you would be a fool for not booking it. Great little place."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice cottage, very clean . Laura and Lars were great hosts and very helpful with information about the area.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,No complaints. Great location and accessibility. Perfect for long stays with the kitchen stocked with dishes ready to cook and bake with. I definitelywould stay there again. Just big enough for you to feel at home and just small enough to not worry about too much to keep clean.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best places to stay in Juneau and I highly recommend. The place was clean and comfortable. Laura and Lars were super helpful and accommodating for several special requests. Laura went well out of her way to help us get everything situated for our trip - local pickups/receiving a package/ local tips. Even when we lost a bag on the ferry she was so helpful recovering and getting it to us in Haines. Nicest hosts in Alaska!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding! Definately will stay again 5 out of 5!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It a small place that’s good for 2 guests. Basic kitchen amenities. Decent shower/bathroom. The stairs are basically an encased ladder that leads up to 2 twin beds. Not easy to bring luggage up but there’s space enough downstairs. Located in a pretty area near Auke Bay. Would repeat.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful house. Good base camp for exploring Juneau. We walked to the bus stop, 31 minutes according to Google Maps, which when using their Transit app let us plan our departure times very accurately and well in advance. Hiked numerous trails during our 5-day stay. Wonderful choice for an adventurous couple. Shuttling help from Laura was a special courtesy, and much appreciated."

2012-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. Great location for all activities, nice to be able to visit downtown but not stay in downtown. Highly recommended, exactly as advertised. Laura was easily accessible if needed. We did split our showers, 1 morning and 1 evening so that we each had plenty of hot water. Overall this is an A+!"
2012-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time in Juneau. The cottage was perfect for our week visit. Laura was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. The privacy of having your own place is so nice.

Jeff and Jill Rennicke"
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, exactly as described. Laura was super helpful in answering questions and returning emails. We will be back!!"
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hi - I had a wonderful time in Juneau and Laura's Cabin was wonderful accomodations! Great location, clean, and updated with everything you would need! Before I checked in I had hiked Mt. Roberts and had gotten a little muddy and thought I would have to run to the laundrymat before meeting friends for dinner, I was so surprised (ok giddy) to find a small washing machine ""with"" laundry soap right inside the cabin! As a showered I was able to put my socks, shorts and shirt into the washing machine and head out without having to make several trips. There was coffee, cream and sugar to complete my welcome from a day of hiking before I had to head out (so sweet). I also went to Hearthside Books and bought the book I started while in the cabin - ""A Walk Home"". I wish I could have stayed longer - it had been 9yrs since I had been back and falling to sleep to the falling rain coming down the mtn side was music to my ears.
Thank you Laura for having such a wonderful place to stay at, posting it on airbnb and for being a great hostess!
Always, Lori Weller"
2012-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The cottage was amazing and perfect for our needs. It was clean and kept in great shape and the view down the road is fantastic.
2012-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed only one night but the cottage was exactly as expected: clean, modern, functional and comfortable. Laura was a great host, unobtrusive but providing us with everything we needed."
2012-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool location, super clean, and great hosts."
2011-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cottage/guest house was immaculate and had all the necessary living furnishings needed. It was nice to have my own place with a kitchen while in Juneau for a week and the price was affordable. I wish there was wifi but the university was nearby so it wasn't a big deal. I liked the location as it was across from Auke Lake, in a quiet pretty area.

I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely consider staying here again!"
2011-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was beautiful new and clean on the exquisite Fritz Cove Rd overlooking Auke Bay. The kitchen is gorgeous and perfect size for two, and fully equipped to prepare your own gourmet dinners which is so nice, not having to go out for a good meal! The cottage is the perfect Juneau getaway. We can't wait to stay there again or recommend it to friends and family."
2011-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Auke Bay Cottage was the perfect place for my parents to stay when they finally visited me in Juneau Alaska. It was very clean and well stocked with the necessary items my parents needed on their vacation. Thank you so much for providing a great little home away from home!!!
2011-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very nice and just as expected (with minor exception below). It was immaculately clean with plenty of dishes and cookware. the cottage was easy to find. Considering the price and scarcity of accommodations in Juneau, I have to say you would be hard-pressed to find any other accommodations to equal what you get by renting this cottage!
Two things to note - 1) there is no wireless internet (not that its listed as an amenity but just something to point out) and 2) while the listing is accurate in stating that there is a TV in the room, you will not be able to watch anything on it unless you bring DVD's with you - there is no TV reception/cable. Really you should be out exploring all that Juneau has to offer rather than watching TV anyway!"
2011-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Wonderful cabin!! It had everything we needed. The host were so nice. We will stay there again!!!!
2011-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you are looking for a very nice place to stay while in Juneau I would highly recommend booking your reservation here. It is a very nice area, clean cabin and hosts were very friendly during my stay here."
2011-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cottage is perfect! We stayed there for 7 nights and it was everything that we wanted and needed. It is so cute, clean and stylish with all of the essential daily needs. Travelling to Juneau is a little on the expensive side (for eating out) so having the fully equipped kitchen was awesome. Laura was attentive to all of our needs and the couple of things that we asked for, she delivered in a timely manner. The location was great for us - kindof in the middle of everything. Located just down the road from the university, wi-fi was easily aquired there. I would highly recommend staying at the cottage :)"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sandy and Luke were amazing hosts, they are super kind and very accommodating. I’d recommend them to anyone with a family. They were completely understand and supportive. Their place is super clean and stocked."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a fantastic stay at Sandy's place. The owners were friendly and eager to help us explore Juneau and help with our stay.

The bed and couches were quite comfortable, which is what I needed after a long work week. View from the front is beautiful, but not much private seating if you want to sit outside. The neighbor was blasting loud music when I arrived but only lasted for about an hour. However, I would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place for our quick trip. We were in town watching softball and it happened to be right around the corner from the field. Robin let me check in early and it worked out great having somewhere to login and get some work done. Thank you for the cozy stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin and Scott were perfect hosts. Helpful with anything and everything, yet gave space at other times. Their apartment was easy access for my old dog who needed a vet check, and the neighborhood was friendly though buried in deep snow during my visit. Scott was meticulous with snow removal and made it easy to get in and out. The apartment was so well equipped, I wished I had a little more time to enjoy it. I will definitely come back when I return from Haines to do ‘big city’ business."

Will stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place to stay. I will continue to book with Robin & Scott when I come to town. Scott was so nice and cleaned the snow off my car & the driveway. & Robin is super sweet for offering me dinner. Such a great & cozy place. Highly recommend!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin is amazing--not only did she pick us up late in the evening at the airport, she also took us to the ferry the next morning at the crack of dawn. She is so personable and kind; and the lodging was close to everything and very cozy. Since our stay was a quick one and we had no time to go shopping, we deeply appreciated the little touches on hand like coffee, milk, cereal, and muffins for the morning; she also has everything else for a longer stay, such as pots, pans, and pantry staples, etc. We'd definitely stay again and highly recommend Robin Nest."

I would recommend this place very conveniently, located to the airport. Robin was very kind, helpful, and friendly."

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Very neat little apartment that had everything we needed. Decorated very well. Good location and adequate parking. The apartment is attached to the home. There is a laundry room joining the house and apartment. The cat litter box was in the laundry and had a very unpleasant odor. The smell lingered into the bathroom and kitchen in the apartment.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robin and Scott were very nice and provided a great place for us to stay during a quick weekend in Juneau. The unit is small but clean and worked well for 3 adults and a toddler. The first smell we noticed when walking in was cigarette smoke, but it was very faint and after a few minutes in the unit we didn't notice it at all. We also greatly appreciated the breakfast items Robin and Scott provided for those checking in late (like us). We would recommend this to others needing a small and quiet place to call ""home base"" while visiting Juneau."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin and Scott were gracious and generous hosts, picking us up from the airport, dropping us off at the Mendenhall glacier and later the AK ferry. Robin Nest is in a lovely quiet neighborhood, convenient to hiking and exploring, far from the hustle and bustle of downtown Juneau. Sleeping arrangements were super comfortable and the rooms had everything we needed and more. We will definitely be staying with Robin and Scott next trip to Juneau!"

Look forward to returning someday.
Thanks Scott and Robin 😊"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t imagine having a better experience than the one I had at Robins Nest. It was my first time in Alaska & Robin welcomed me by picking me up from the airport. That night she was having a get together where I performed a few of my songs in preparation for my performance at the Alaska Folk Festival. It was a wonderful night! I can go on & on about how hospitable both Robin & her husband Scott were. I was treated like an old friend & had the opportunity to see the town through their perspective & through a bunch of their friends as well. The Nest itself is a beautiful, cozy, spotless & spacious place filled with everything I needed. Thank you Robin & the gang for creating such an amazing experience for me! Looking forward to seeing you again soon!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Robin's Nest provided us an excellent home away from home for a week in Juneau. This spot was nestled in a quiet residential neighbourhood near Mendenhall Glacier and not far from the Auke Bay ferry terminal. Robin and Scott are lovely and helpful hosts. Their suite is extremely well equipped, especially the kitchenette with a full sized fridge and propane stove that made cooking for ourselves easy. Best of all, this location is dog friendly!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robin and Scott were very easy to communicate with; the place was spotless and a great location.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very friendly and communicative hosts. They were able to flex an earlier check-in time for me after a last-minute cancelation from another host. WiFi service left a little to be desired, but that could’ve been my phone, and it didn’t really affect my trip to greatly. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fiancé and I felt right at home at Robin's Nest. It was a fantastic stay with so many friendly accommodations if we felt like snacking while sitting on the couch and watching tv. We will definitely stay again. Thank you both.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve never had anyone accommodate me above and beyond as Robin did, as far as Airbnb hosts go. She picked me up from the airport, showed me down town, took me shopping, and Mendenhall Glacier. Oh, and gave me a ride to the ferry terminal at 6am!
I would stay here again and again. The place itself is so comfortable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Robin's house is clean and warm. You can find anything you need in the room and it's a perfect place for a transit stay! Robin and Scott are great hosts!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such wonderful caring hosts always make us feel welcomed
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have to first say that I booked this Airbnb for my sister and elderly father and my aunt. It was last minute because the airlines they were on canceled their flight to Fairbanks and rerouted them to Juneau with a fourteen hour layover.
I messaged Robin at 9pm and asked would my displaced family who traveled from NY be able to check in to rest for the fourteen hours.( my father is disabled). Since this was so last minute. The airline could not provide a hotel as the cancellation was due to weather and there were none available.
Robin not only responded IMMEDIATELY! She offered to have her husband pick them up🥲
Scott and Robin were the saving Grace to a very trying day! Their kindness and warmth is what every traveler wants, they are the porch light on in the storm!
I’m forever grateful for the compassion and kindness of these strangers who I now consider friends!!! There place was fantastic. Thoughtful and warm. If you want the feeling of family ,comfort and care this is it!! ❤️"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just stayed the night to get on the ferry but was a nice place to stay with our little pup. Headed back later in the month.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We couldn’t have asked for a more accommodating host and hostess. Robin and Scott made us feel like family. They were understanding about our situation with our sick puppy and went out of their way to make us comfortable and feel like home.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had another amazing stay at Robin's. It feels like home away from home when j need to travel for cancer treatments. Its relaxing and comforting.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This host went above and beyond for us. Not just a great place to stay, but we were greeted by great breakfast items in the fridge in case we were hungry.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy place to stay. The extra food amenities made our visit easier as we were in Juneau for medical reasons.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really appreciate you offering me another night this day and offering me a ride into town if I needed it
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s basically a full apartment of your own with EVERYTHING you’ll ever need at top qualities: private bathroom, private living room, your own kitchen full of food, nice and cozy bedroom. Above all, Robin and Scott’s hospitality makes it even better, offered me rides wherever I needed, with all the enjoyable conversations and stories. Truly a highlight of my stay in Juneau"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Robin’s home was a great place to stay in Juneau. Their separate unit was quite spacious and in a quiet neighborhood near great hiking and Mendenhall Glacier.
While their location is best if you have a car, Scott was very gracious and more than willing to pick me up from the ferry nearby as well as drop me off. It was a pleasure to stay at their place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 will return! Robin and Scott are by far one of the most accommodating couples i have had the pleasure to stay with. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The house itself is very understated and comfortable. Basic commodities are provided for and a few extras too. Location is close to the Mendenhall Glacier area, as well as a strip mall less than 10 minute drive away, providing access to a few nearby restaurants and sites. Perfect place for an outgoing couple in the area looking to explore the valley."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin and Scott are truly wonderful hosts! Great communications and very helpful information. The apartment was newly renovated and it's very clean and in a quiet yet convenient neighborhood. It's only ~2 miles from the Mendenhall Glacier visitor center and it is a nice and safe ~40 minutes walk. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a warm and comforting meal. The bathroom also has all the amenities that help you relax after a long day of exploration. Most importantly Robin and Scott's hospitality made me feel almost like at home! I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Juneau, hopefully soon!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my second stay in the Otter Den and it was even better than the first! The natural beauty of the location, comfort of the apartment, and incredible wildlife viewing is impossible to understate - and the hosts embody the unique and welcoming culture of Juneau. I’ve never stayed at an AirBnB that is so thoughtfully equipped and livable. From the kitchen equipment to the laundry to the extras (raincoats! a viewing scope! puzzles!) this place is the MOVE! I will be back and recommend the Treehouse to anyone visiting Juneau!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at the Tongass Treehouse in Juneau, Alaska, and it was absolutely amazing! The property was beautiful and matched the description perfectly. Nestled in a serene location, it offered stunning views of the ocean right from the deck, which made for breathtaking sunrises and sunsets.
The house was close to numerous hiking trails, allowing us to explore the natural beauty of Juneau with ease. Despite its peaceful seclusion, it was only about a 20-minute drive to downtown, making it convenient for dining and shopping.
Clayton, the host, was outstanding—extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating. He provided great recommendations for local activities and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
This is one of the best Airbnbs I've experienced for a peaceful getaway. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy the serenity and beauty of Juneau. Thank you, Clayton, for a memorable experience!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We so needed a change of scenery and the Treehouse exceeded our expectations. Even with the daily rain, the views from the balcony never got old. Daily spotting of eagles and even got to see whales in the distance. Binoculars are a must! Prepared many meals in the kitchen; the induction stove is amazing! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Otter Den was perfect. It was peaceful, beautiful, serene and the perfect getaway for a week in Juneau. We couldn't have asked for anything more."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic quiet retreat!
Clayton was the perfect host and incredibly helpful. Go to the house before going to the store as I was surprised as to how much I bought that already was in the pantry and fridge.
Definitely will be back.
Thank you again for the perfect vacation setting."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is simply no way to overstate this. If you are looking for a peaceful, serene, cozy studio in the woods, surrounded by nature, and overlooking the water, this place is perfect. We were whale watching and bald eagle observing from the deck as the sun set behind the mountains in front of us. And Clay was a superb, responsive host with wonderful local recommendations. We can’t wait to come back to explore more!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Otter's Den Treehouse is a magical place. High up in the canopy with the eagles overlooking the water, surrounded by the sounds of nature. Living amongst the wildlife was amazing. All from the deck we saw whales galore (Orcas and Humpbacks), Sea Otters, Dolphins, Eagles, Marmot and Black Bears! The views of the water, mountains and sunsets were spectacular. The studio itself is very modern, spacious and comfortable. Water pressure was great. Wifi strong and steady. Plenty of outlets. Bed very comfortable. Kitchen has new appliances and everything you need and more. We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most beautiful vacation rental we've ever stayed in. The views from the deck were stunning. The newly remodeled unit was nicely furnished, very clean and well stocked. Clayton was exceptionally responsive before and throughout our trip. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend the Tongass Treehouse to family and friends."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a phenomenal stay! We absolutely loved our time in this space- it was absolutely beautiful inside and out, with unbeatable views. From the balcony we saw sea lions, whales, eagles, and chum and there were bear and marmots all around. The kitchen is fully equipped and the bed is so comfortable. I can’t wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and great deck to enjoy. Lots of new items to the space with the recent renovations and it's looking great. Well stocked kitchen.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a clean and quiet home-away-from-home outside of town, look no further. Clayton and his wife have turned this studio into an Alaskan paradise. They obviously take great pride in both their home and sharing the Juneau wilderness with others. Their anticipation of our needs ensured we were comfortable the entire stay. From the comfortable mattress and linens, to the covered patio, and the well-stocked and easy to navigate kitchen; everything was perfect. We hope to make this our summer vacation spot and will highly recommend it to family and friends."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has an amazing view! The kitchen is well-equipped and everything matches the description. Will be back again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"suberbe view, very good location, quiet, clean, loved our 3 days past che Amah"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is hard to describe how beautiful Alaska is when you visit for the first time, but on top of that we had the most beautiful windows to see the beauty constantly whenever we were in Amah's place. A very well designed ""studio"" type place that is updated, clean and so very comfortable. I really don't know that you can top it and won't try should I decide to return. It was 150% better than being in a hotel."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend Amah’s place. It was perfect for the two of us - exactly as listed, easy to access, offered great amenities, and had amazing views of Auke Bay. It was our favorite place we stayed in SE Alaska. We hope to visit again soon."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from the windows is awesome and so peaceful! Everything was very peaceful, comfortable, clean. Hostess was very proactively seeing to our needs. They even let us rent their Jeep which made things so much easier. I just can’t say enough about how pleased we were! Definitely recommend them to everyone! If you want to know something just ask and very knowledgeable. Chatted with hostess once and was very enjoyable. Daughter pointed out where to look for whales and toddler pointed out a butterfly. Though I must add they were respectful of our privacy. Only chatted when I approached them, and then were very warm. If I go again I’ll go there!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view could not be beat, and the layout was very comfortable. The house was walkable to the University of Alaska SE campus and the harbor. I felt lucky to be there."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend and loved it. The space is the perfect size, the location is incredibly convenient, and the view is amazing. It was easy to make our way to various hikes in the area, Mendenhall Glacier, and downtown Juneau is also a short drive away.
Our hosts were so wonderfully nice and helped give some great recommendations for the area. The experience is far beyond what you can expect from a standard hotel stay (especially for the stunning view!).
We loved our time here and would happily return on our next trip up here. We hope we can make it back soon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely LOVED IT!!
We had crew stay here during a training.
The rest of the crew was jealous of the description of where he got to stay & had to stop by to see it.
Amah was amazing and very accommodating.
The place is a bit out the road (not near town), but not far if you have a car. Very peaceful!! Our worker enjoyed watching the tour boats in the evening."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,You will not find a better Host or location in Auke Bay!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard's place was fantastic. The location is top notch. It's easy to walk everywhere, close to the airport, quiet, safe, etc. The real stars of the show are Pua and Leonard. I travel constantly, and I'd say that Pua is one of the nicest people and airbnb hostesses I've encountered.
Pua picked me up at the airport at midnight upon arrival. She lent me her car for the week. She drove me to the airport at 4am today.
She had fresh jam from berries she picked, granola she made, etc.
If I find myself back in Juneau, this is the only place that I'll stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Puanani & her husband were very welcoming to us. Place is comfortable with lots of space. Walking distance to various hiking trails and downtown.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a wonderful home away from home. Comfortable and Puanani and Leonard are so kind and friendly.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard were extremely friendly and responsive to our needs. Every time we wondered if something was available in the rental, there it was! Pua went out of her way and even PICKED US UP AT THE AIRPORT when our plane was too late for the car rental agency. Then, she TOOK US BACK THE NEXT DAY TO GET OUR CAR! Now that's service. Food was stocked, there were so many personal touches and notes for us (it was our anniversary and she had made a cute note for us on the fridge) and she walked us through the rental pointing out all the little extras. She was proactive and texted us in case we had other needs and told us several times to contact her if needed. When we did, responses were almost immediate! The place was cozy, colorful and really felt nice to come home to. All of the artwork and books were wonderful. Then, there was Elvis. Leonard was awesome! We know where we want to stay next time! I hope you caught a 60 pounder, Leonard! Thanks for everything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt like home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard are so warm and welcoming!
This isn't the most modern option you'll find but it will definitely be the cleanest. It has everything you will need for your stay, no matter how long. It's in easy walking distance to downtown as well as a grocery store.
Highly recommend Pua and Leonard's apartment and will stay there again if I return to Juneau!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Leonard and Pua were so attentive to us as we were recovering from a non-covid illness. They were very hospitable and went above and beyond what was expected. It was a delight to stay with them. Loved Pua's art that was everywhere. And the bed was so comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard were very warm and welcoming -- we immediately felt right at home. The rooms were clean, with a lovely, spacious feel, surrounded by beautiful artwork, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable! The neighborhood, as well as the hosts, help you feel the friendliness of Juneau people. We would definitely, and hope to, stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a
Puanani and Leonard are a sweet couple and will go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable. Puanani helped us with transportation, suggestions for hikes and restaurants and just easy going friendliness. Don't be surprised if Leonard cooks you a breakfast. The place is Puanani's art studio so it is wall to wall paintings. A really fun place to stay. Next time we come to Juneau we will stay here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and as advertised. Would stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been fortunate to stay at a number of B&Bs over the years and have enjoyed every one of them due in part to the hosts. They have all been invariably warm, thoughtful, interesting, knowledgeable people.
Then we were hosted by Pua and Leonard in Juneau. All of the above attributes are certainly true of them but to a greater level. Especially talented, affable, communicative, magnanimous, kind, helpful and caring. Did I mention unique?
We departed having become friends. We know of no higher recommendation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful and thoughtful hostess who always went the extra step to make our stay memorable. We would love to visit again. Pua provided many special extras making for an excellent stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Terrific hosts. great location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pua and Leonard that kind of hosts that Airbnb was originally designed around. they were welcoming and kind and eager to meet us and to show us their community. it felt like we were visiting family while we were there. If you are looking for the hands-off, get a code to let yourself in when you arrive, and never see the host experience this is probably not for you"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani and Leonard welcomed us like family to their Juneau home. They stayed up late until we arrived to personally show us in and also drove us to the airport the day we left. Pua had homemade strawberry rhubarb pie waiting for us when we got there! We enjoyed talking with them and learning about their lives in Alaska, including Leonard’s Tlingit Elvis impression.
Their home was very comfortable. It had everything we need for our stay and would work well for a long stay because of the full kitchen and washer and dryer. Both beds were comfortable. Pua’s art and souvenirs from their lives give the place a funky vibe. The location is perfect. It’s a ten minute walk to the heart of downtown, and there’s even a flat route you can take.
We really appreciated their hospitality and enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pua and Leonard were very communicative and the location is excellent. Thanks so much for opening your home to us!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time! Puanani and Leonard are extremely friendly and welcoming. They showed us around, and made us feel the most at home we ever had been in any AirBNB. Would highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani was an amazing host. her and her husband treat you like family. made my trip to Juneau all the more special and memorable. if you are visiting from out of state and need a place to stay, i recommend. their house is located in a beautiful neighborhood and is great walking distance to local markets and coffee shops.
If i ever visit juneau again I would stay here"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was beyond comfortable and made even more special by the hosts friendliness, helpfulness, responsiveness, and kindness. They stayed up to welcome us to the home when we arrived later than expected, provided tons of area recommendations and personal stories about the area and culture, and even brought us home-baked goodies! This stay felt like visiting friends or family and we felt right at home!! Thank you Pua and Leonard for an amazing stay!!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,the hostes were very friendly and helpful. we had booked at another bnb who at the last minute canceled on us. this cancelation caused me to panic because it was done the night before at 11 pm. puanani not only got back to me in seconds she even allowed us to check in early. her husband met us at the door and showed us where we were staying and gave us cookies. the refrigerator was stocked with snacks and had breakfast granola. the hostes live upstairs close enough for questions but also gave us privacy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay, very welcoming and warm hosts. Everything was at our disposal.
For lunch. Even had a nice surprise for lunch, a morning was excellent. Really Great!!!. Thank you"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Puanani's place was just wonderful. She and Lenard are great hosts. We'll be back again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great hosts! Will be back.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard’s place has everything you need for a comfortable stay in Juneau. But more than that, they are kind and generous people who shared their home and their culture with us. This is Airbnb at its best."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! Best stay I’ve ever had, I didn’t want to leave. Pua and Len were incredibly generous and thoughtful. They felt like family.
They went over and alive with their care and communication. They cooked for us, drove us to and from the airport and even showed us the sights. That was one of the main highlights of our trip and I’d love to stay there again in the future.
The accommodations were very nice as well. Comfortable beds, very thoughtfully stocked fridge. The art studio with Pua’s artwork was such a calming and happy atmosphere! What a great experience!
Sincerely,
Jeff and Kacie Cooke"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable, cozy, and beautiful space filled with color and art, and friendly and hospitable hosts. Will stay here again if I can return in the future."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Very welcoming and friendly. The space did show it's age but was cozy and comfortable. The sound did travel quite a bit from upstairs however.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very homey apartment, decorated with Pua's art and other knick knacks. Staying Pua's apartment is like staying at a friends home. And yes you have all of the ameniities."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Len are top-notch Airbnb hosts. Their basement grotto is cool, well-stocked with delicious homemade snacks, and the beds are comfortable. Pua was very communicative throughout our stay, baked us banana bread, and even offered to pick us up from the airport, which was extremely kind. She is an artist, and one of the big appeals of the space is that she is prolific, and the walls are covered in her work. Leonard ""The Tlingit King"" is friendly and ready to share photos from his Elvis days. The space is pretty basic but has all the essentials. It's easy to cover the small windows, which is useful in a place with so much daylight. We could occasionally hear footsteps and activity from upstairs, which was the only downside of basement dwelling. But this is the absolute perfect place to stay if you're looking for location, value, and so many delightful and homey touches."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard could not have been nicer hosts! Pua went above and beyond in telling us about Juneau and even picking us up at the airport and dropping us wherever we needed to go. She had provisions in the fridge for us, could not have been more accommodating. We even learned a little about the Tlingit from Leonard!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard are amazing hosts and set the gold standard for AirBnb hosts.
The accommodations are spacious with 2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, bathroom and a living room. You can hear some movement from above (as it is a basement apartment).
There is a clothes washer and dryer in the kitchen.
The kitchen was stocked with everything you would need such as cooking oil, salt, black pepper, eggs, butter, milk, homemade granola etc.
There was plastic wrap, aluminum foil, sandwich bags, etc…….all the items you just need small amounts off during a short stay and very few AirBnb hosts provide.
I wish that other AirBnb hosts would follow the high and generous stands that Pua and Leonard have set.
The information folder provided for guests is very informative and helpful.
Pua picked us up from the cruise dock on arrival and Leonard dropped us to the airport."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Len are wonderful hosts!! They were very accommodating when our plans changed and let us move up our reservations and check-in early in the morning.
The place is conveniently located to walk downtown but far enough way to avoid the crowds. We had a great stay in Juneau!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay, with great people! Great size basement. Paintings are a nice touch."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani and Leonard’s Airbnb is super cute, clean, and pictured, great location, with artwork everywhere! We were greeted immediately, given a tour, and our second morning treated to scores! Pua even gave my daughter, graduating from UAS a very thoughtful and personal gift. Highly recommend!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great friendly hosts. Very welcoming and accommodating. Great location to the downtown scene and douglas bridge.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!
Attentive and very gracious hosts."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very friendly and generous hosts!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua’s place is great for seeing Juneau. It is an easy walk around town from there and the park is really close. Great privacy and amenities, we could have stayed long so easily. Make sure you get to know both her and Leonard. Thanks for a great start to our travels."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I really enjoyed our stay with Puanani and Leonard. Puanani was so very thoughtful and accommodating that it truly made our visit exceptional.
The place is eclectic and has everything you could need. Easy walk to downtown. Was awesome to have a washer and dryer and breakfast items.
While you’re in Juneau go to Deckhand Dave’s and eat a fish taco for me!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to hiking trails and to downtown, this is your place. Leonard and Pua when beyond to make sure this solo traveler had a great stay in Juneau. Their 2 bedroom basement apartment located in a nice and quiet neighborhood is well equipped with everything you would ever need, and then some. Leonard and Pua are some of the nicest and sweetest people you will ever meet and I look forward to seeing them again someday."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Warm, eclectic, artsy home-base for your trip to Juneau. Puanani and Leonard are bright, enthusiastic and friendly. They are the ideal Airbnb hosts. The house was stocked with breakfast staples and we were thrilled to enjoy homemade treats during our stay. Accommodations were very comfortable for three adults."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely spot right in the best location downtown! Such a treat to spend time with an Alaskan Native, generous with his stories and Herring Eggs too❗️. We feel lucky we discovered this gem on Air B&B.
Thank-you 🙏"
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Pua and Leonard are wonderful people with a unique, artistic home that is centrally located in close proximity to downtown Juneau. There is really only room for four comfortably, maybe five. They have all the amenities needed for short or long stay except for a TV. The heating was a constant problem. At times Privacy was an issue."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,:D
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect home away from home! Great location downtown and within walking distance to great views, hikes, food! Would absolutely stay here again. Pua and Leonard where so kind to us and went above and beyond!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful cozy spot near downtown and the high school! Gracious host and artist! I will be back!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great. The hosts were very friendly, making us feel comfortable. The apt. was sparkling clean and everything worked well. our stay was topped off with homemade scones. Yum!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and location. Pua and Leonard are amazing hosts and made me feel very much at home. The space was clean and all of the art on the walls made it bright and cheery. I would not hesitate to stay with them again :)
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pua and Leonard are some of the most sincere and caring people you will have the pleasure to meet. They genuinely want you to have a good visit and to make a new friend. I cannot say enough good about them - they made a difficult time for myself and my daughter a bright spot since we found there are good people in the world like them. Also, she makes a delicious chocolate cake!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pua and Leonard are very kind and thoughtful. They are wonderful hosts and helping my family during a difficult time. The art is a great feature and makes it so much more special - they treat you like part of their extended family.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts are very hospitable and welcoming. Great location, easy walking to all things downtown Juneau. This is my 4th Air BnB stay and all 4 have been different experiences. I would describe this one as a two bedroom basement apartment with a private kitchen and bathroom. The living room/sitting area is a shared space with the hosts art studio. It is an older place with older appliances and fixtures but it is clean and has white and bright colors so it doesn’t seem dark even though it’s a basement. It has a cottage type feel."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host and hostess! Guests have private entrance to a basement with a full kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, sitting area and art studio. Pua makes the best breakfast! Kitchen is equipped with everything you need, including a washer and dryer.
Highly recommended and within walking distance from town."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pua and Leonard were wonderful hosts. The location was perfect for us. The space was great for us.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Pua and Leonard went above and beyond for us and out daughter while we where in Juneau getting out daughter settled at UAS . Their house was a perfect location to get to all the stuff down town and a short drive to UAS. We would definitely go back to visit them again.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani and Leonard are amazing hosts! Their house is warm, cozy and much more than we had asked for. Puanani is one of the sweetest people I’ve met. She is an artist and the entire house is filled with her amazing paintings! I wish I could stay longer and get some painting lessons from her!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard are very gracious hosts. Their home is in a central location within walking distance to downtown Juneau, Foodland, the trails and outdoor adventure pick ups. Pua is a wonderful cook and always had delicious treats for breakfast. Our privacy was respected, and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Everything you could want for a restful stay is available, and the place is spotlessly clean. Thank you, Pua and Leonard, for making us feel at home. We miss you both!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Puanani and Leonard's was unforgettable and above every possibility. Puanani offered to pick us up at the airport and immediately drove us around downtown showing us all the sights and roads we had to drive home or to go to Mount Roberts. She got up early the next morning and drove us to pick up our car. The last day we went to Glacier Bay and had trouble (due to schedules) with our bags. Puanani offered to keep them at home and take them to the airport on our way back from the trip so we could fly to Anchorage right away. As for the apartment when we arrived, we already found a basic expense made and everything was super clean and ready for us. The house is in a great location, within walking distance of a fully stocked supermarket, downtown and the beginning of some trails including the one for Mount Roberts. Both Puanani and Leonard have always made us feel welcome and part of their daily life with a lot of discretion and giving us our most complete privacy. I highly recommend it to everyone and hope to return one day to be able to go fishing with Leonard!
Puanani and Leonard, I made the comment in italian so that maybe you will met a lot of new italian speaker! Wish you all the best and really thank you for everything :-) !"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a special home, in a wonderful place. Plu and Leonard go above and beyond what you'd expect from hosts - and that is saying a lot, given that most AirBnB hosts are pretty darn good. However, this one is extra special. We certainly hope we can return some day, to say hello again to our new friends."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard are hospitable, kind people. They were available for questions, Pua made breakfast for us daily, and we were even given a ride to pick up our rental car. The art in the space and Princess the dog are also great additions"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani’s place was exactly as described satisfying all our needs. The bed was comfy and linens all fine quality. There was space in the closets for hanging some clothes and drawer space in two chests to unpack the rest of our clothes. The bathroom was near the bedroom, just past the kitchen. All rooms were extremely clean and inviting with vibrant colors and wonderful artwork. Best of all were the daily breakfast delights. Each morning we would wake up to delicious home made scones or cobbler or omelette. All to be eaten in the privacy of our little kitchen. And both Puanani and Leonard were always willing to share their knowledge of the best places to explore, including what only the locals know. We can’t wait to come back and visit not only Juneau but these two wonderful hosts!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The hosts are the best. Kind, generous and thoughtful. Private, 2 bedroom accommodations with kitchen, full bath, laundry, and common area. Sparkling clean, comfortable accommodations, special touches such as breakfast fixings every morning and maps with suggestions to local attractions. We felt like we were at home. We were extremely satisfied and look forward to returning."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've done Airbnb's all over the world, but we've never experienced hospitality like what we had at Pua and Leonard's home. A warm welcome when we arrived, fresh berry scones and crisps in the morning, and many wonderful conversations with them and their friends throughout our stay. We feel like we have new close friends in Juneau."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really such personal kindness and assist...Pua is a gem and her artwork hanging in this downstairs studio space is amazing. The beds we so comfy and my grandson and I each had our own rooms. such generous goodies left for the ""breakfast"" part of this airbnb."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The hosts, Pua and Leonard, are friendly, helpful, joyful, and trustworthy people. The location of their place is absolutely ideal--in the Federal Flats neighborhood--a quiet neighborhood just a ten or fifteen minute walk to almost anywhere in Juneau. The basement apartment is filled with artwork and color. Bedrooms are comfortable; the kitchen is outfitted for minimal cooking-- a refrigerator, 2-burner stove and a microwave, plus toasters and coffee pots--also a washer/dryer. It served our purposes quite well. The living room is comfortable, and is adjacent to the host's painting studio. The apartment is a minimally shared space, meaning that once in a while the hosts may wish to come downstairs to retrieve something from the studio or do their own laundry while the guests are out; this was rare, and they never entered the space without contacting us first. It was never a problem. A bonus: Pua makes delicious homemade breakfast treats, which she brought down in the morning, plus fresh fruit. We had a delightful stay!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beds were very comfortable, the hosts were extraordinary & the location was within a short walking distance to downtown."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pay and Leanard were fabulous hosts. Breakfasts were amazing and their generosity with their time was above and beyond. Thank you!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful week started with a warm welcome. Pua makes AMAZING breakfast and Leonard was so much fun to chat with about his native background. It's a close walk to downtown and a very comfortable living space.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your hosts really take the Bed and Breakfast part of AirBnB seriously. You'll be well taken care of and treated like old friends come to visit.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy place to stay, yummy breakfasts, hospitality from Pua and Leonard, and the perfect location. Thank you!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing host family. The rooms are super comfy and the space filled with art. My only challenge was the wi-fi didn’t work (said it was connected, but wouldn’t load), but that encouraged me to unplug and enjoy the time. They made me feel like family which was awesome! I will stay here again, as the location was also perfect. A must stay."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved being around Pua’s beautiful art! The beds are comfy and the hosts are very helpful.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying at an AirB&B. We were so happy. We had everything we needed. Our hosts welcomed us so warmly, we felt like family. The apartment was clean, the beds comfortable and the breakfasts delicious! We had an added bonus of staying in the art studio which was amazing. We will be back!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Leonard and Puanani have created a welcoming abode for travelers to enjoy. My husband and I stayed for several days in the winter and were quite comfortable despite being from TX and being sued to warmer weather. We stayed in the queen room and used the second room to organize our belongings. The queen bed was so cozy we slept in every day. The breakfasts were substantial and prepared with care; the kitchen is large enough and has enough utensils and tools for guess to use to prepare meals and there is enough seating to accommodate a guest or two— a huge bonus for us since we were visiting family in Juneau. We really appreciated all of the thoughtful details in the apartment. A treasure!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can't say enough about this gracious couple and their beautiful space.
Juneau would've still been gorgeous without them, but staying with them turned it into more than just a touristy vacation. I came away feeling the roots and power of the people and the land.
Pua and Len both shared an invaluable wealth of information on the Tlingit people, as well as suggestions for things to do and local happenings. I ended up dancing in the street with them and local Juneau-ites in 40 degree weather at an end of the season jam, as well as being invited to their table for delicious deer meat stew. And while I'm on the subject of food, Pua made breakfast and brought it down every morning. Have you ever had a scone so good you want to cry??? You might if you stay here :-)
They gauged perfectly when I wanted to engage and when I didn't, which is really an art form with people you've just met. The ease of communication made my week stay very easy. They checked in early about logistics like making sure I was warm enough and encouraging me to use the washing machine if I needed it (a huge help when a regular hike turns into a mud hike).
The sheets, towels, and pillows were all quite comfortable, and having a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker really helped me keep the overall cost of my trip down. If that wasn't enough to entice you, you get to be surrounded by many of Pua's sumptuous paintings. It really helps prepare your minds eye to see Juneau, not just to look at it.
So, in conclusion, these two are the best (and when their little dog Princess gets comfy with you she will let you rub the belly). I was sad to leave, and am already planning my return. So, book with them now, or else I will take your spot ;-)"
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Puanani's apartment is clean and filled with amazing artwork. It was like living in a gallery. Thank you.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy artist retreat and it looked and felt like I was experiencing living in Juneau full time. The home was warm and inviting. Everything we needed in our ""home away from home."""
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was born and raised in Juneau and I often return to visit family and friends annually. Puanani's thoughtfulness shined throughout our visit, She made my sweetheart feel at home and although Juneau will always be home for me, it's people like she and Leonard that epitomize what Juneau is all about. They make a Juneau kid proud to be a Juneau kid. Stay with Puanani and Leonard and you won't regret it! Also, those homemade strawberry rhubarb scones!!! WOW!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy walk to downtown Juneau. Warm welcome from Puanani and Leonard and delicious breakfasts delivered to your table each morning. Great value!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani's place is a wonderful base from which to visit Juneau and the environs. Close to the downtown, near the bus line, and major hiking trials near downtown. It is a lovely and comfortable space with all the things a visitor needs with many thoughtful personal touches, which make it feel like staying in a home where someone put thought into the comfort of visitors. It is also a real treat to spend mornings and evenings surrounded by Puanani's wonderful
paintings. Puanani was most helpful in providing an introduction to Juneau, where and how to find things and suggestions on things to do. She was great at being available for questions, but giving a visitor space and privacy. She and Leonard provided a wonderful welcome to Juneau and Alaska. I am most grateful."
2017-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pua and Leonard were excellent hosts and really made our stay in Juneau much more enjoyable. Their suggestions for places to eat and things to do/see were spot on. They were also very helpful with transportation logistics and provided a lots of food for breakfast and snacks. Thanks again!
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying with Puanani and Leonard was just like staying at home. The apartment was so cozy, home like, and well taken care of. We were greeted off the bat with a full binder of local attractions and restaurants and things to do and a fridge full of amenities. The entire week felt like staying with family over anything and I could not have asked for a better experience. Next time I’m back in town, I know exactly where I’m staying. Thanks again Pua and Leonard!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is great place that is very well located and with lots of space. We were lucky to have sunny days! But it is big enough to hang out if the weather gets too bad. We slept very well on the big bed. Some noises from upstairs as in previous comments but very few and did not bother us. We lived our stay in Juneau, definitely recommend this place. Thanks Leonard and Puanani!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my stay! Everything was perfect and I felt right at home. Will definitely be coming back!
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani and Leonard are kind and generous hosts. The private downstairs apartment is extremely comfortable and covered in beautiful artwork. The small kitchen has a small fridge and tea/coffee makings and is lightly stocked. The location is in a lovely part of town, an easy walk to downtown and to hiking trails. Our taxi driver said that the neighborhood homes are old mining houses. This is a wonderful stay and a great value."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, easy walk from downtown. The basement flat is brightened up with lots of bright paintings. Puanani and Leonard were great hosts making sure everything was easy for us and even supplying some freshly caught salmon for our first evening meal! Many thanks had a great time!"
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our hosts. They were very accommodating. This apartment has enough space that you don't feel crowded. However, if someone has a mobility problem, this space would not be for them. Our hosts have taken the basement of their home and made a two bedroom apartment. Therefore to get to the space, you have to go down a small staircase. If yo have any walking problems, you might have difficulty with thus. The apartment has its own entrance. This enables tbe guests to have more privacy."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Puanani and Leonard were absolutely wonderful hosts! They went above and beyond with communication, offers to help with anything we needed, and personal touches... including homemade breakfast deliveries! It was a very welcome surprise. The apartment is beautiful, decorated with Pua's amazing artwork, and the beds are very comfortable. We loved everything about our stay!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW!
This was our first airbnb experience and Pua and Leonard went Above & Beyond in our opinion! They treated us like family or treasured friends, not complete strangers.
Not only did she meet us at the ferry (which arrived 45 minutes late that night!), but she allowed me to ship a box of gluten-free items to her home (then she had located some FABULOUS GF pretzels which were in our Welcome Basket), as well as receieving another box I shipped with a gift I needed for our next vacation stop, then she and Leonard even offered us the use of their vehicles! (when they didn't need them) Unheard of!! Plus, gave us free tickets to go on the Tram (although we didn't have time). They also took us to our scheduled boat trip, which departed at 7:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, then gave us a ride to the airport on the day we departed! Really exceptional, in our opinion. You couldn't ask for nicer or more accommodating hosts!!
The cozy basement rooms were very comfortable and bright, due in large part to all of the amazing artwork (most of which is Pua's!), and the bed is AWESOME! At least as comfortable as ours at home!!
The only things to note before booking:
- there is no tv in the space, so anyone who has a high tv need should consider that. We were busy being tourists and/or relaxing, so my husband only noticed this and ""missed"" his news fix on our last day there.
- Also, pay attention to how the hot water in the shower works! The water is very hot, so younger children, even tweens, should be assisted so they aren't scalded.
Aside from those small considerations, you can't go wrong booking with Pua and Leonard. They will make your stay in Juneau very memorable!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Puanani is very friendly and accommodating with any plans you may have! Super convenient location. Hands down the best Air BnB I've ever stayed at.
2017-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a funky place. But for the low price it's good. The beds are comfortable, kitchen is great ,all the amenities. It is a basement dwelling so not a lot of light.
Be aware you will hear the noise from feet and voices upstairs, above you. They are very nice folks, so it's a great place to stay if you just use it for sleeping and it's location. Though you will be woken early by their upstairs noise!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard are wonderful hosts, going above and beyond to take care of us . We made new friends in Alaska! The accommodations were perfect as well. Just a short walk to town and all of the tourist attractions. It was clean, well stocked with everything we needed. We loved looking at Pua's beautiful artwork that decorates the walls.
Thank you so much Pua and Leonard for everything"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and her husband Leonard were the most wonderful and friendly hosts and we were just floored by their generosity and kindness. The rental was spacious, clean, and well stocked with any thing we might have needed during our stay. The rooms and living area is decorated with many of Pua's amazing art and they made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The location is convenient, about a 10 minute walk to downtown and the cruise ships and only a few minutes from the local grocery store. Highly recommended and we can't wait to go back to visit!"
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pua and Leonard were amazing hosts and went above and beyond to make us feel truly welcome. The residential neighborhood is very cute and a close walk to both downtown and the Mt. Roberts Trail, which has fantastic views of Juneau. Pua was nice enough to pick us up at the local ferry terminal building, which was great because it was a bit out of town. The basement apartment was huge! We had access to 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and a large kitchen. Plus it's connected to Pua's studio, so all her amazing paintings are on display. The parfaits and breakfast food in the morning were great, plus they invited us up one morning for Leonard's world famous pancakes. Totally unexpected and extremely generous! We got to experience regular Juneau life, since all the neighbors say hi and a few stopped by to visit. We also had no idea that we would be in the presence of ""Tlingit Elvis"", and it was fun to see Leonard in newspaper articles and books, as well as see the costume that Pua had hand-sewed for Leonard. Overall, Pua and Leonard are great hosts and we hope to be able to visit them again in the future!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay in Juneau! We were in town for the wedding of good friends, but built in some extra time to enjoy the area. Puanani and Leonard were excellent hosts. They were respectful of our privacy but also so warm and welcoming. They made it clear that they were there for us as much as we needed them to be. Communication was prompt and helpful, too. Puanani was even kind enough to drive us from/to the airport, which was really going above and beyond for a host! Greatly appreciated.
""An artist's home away from home"" is the perfect description of the space. It's clean, cozy, and full of lots of colorful artwork and thoughtful touches, like the breakfast parfait (delicious) and snacks delivered to our little fridge, and the variety of teas and coffee-fixin's on the countertop. The bed was plush and comfortable. The shower is hot (!) with excellent water pressure. We felt very comfortable and very much at home.
Be aware that this is an apartment in the basement level of the house - Puanani and Leonard live upstairs and you will hear them moving around. This didn't bother us at all, but just a note to travelers unaccustomed to apartment living.
The location is fantastic - in a quiet residential part of Juneau that we hadn't explored before. A comfortable walk to downtown, and a stone's throw from two of the highlights of our trip: Cope Park (gorgeous morning hike along the Gold Creek trail) and Coppa, home of life-changing handmade ice cream.
This would be a perfect spot for a small family or group, since there's plenty of room, but it was also a great place for our just-the-two-of-us getaway. We look forward to returning!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My 4 friends and I got in late from a ferry ride, and we appreciated having a place to stay within walking distance to the airport. I wish we could have stayed longer because it was very comfortable and nice! We were extremely grateful for the snacks, and the coffee bar was a nice touch. Perfect space for friends or family!"
