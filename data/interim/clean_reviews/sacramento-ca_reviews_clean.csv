2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed a place last minute while in town for a funeral service. Linda's place was perfect. Peaceful & quiet. It was just what I needed after a long flight. If you're looking for a place to get a good night's rest, this is it. The bed was clean and the bathroom. No kitchen, which was fine because I only needed a place to crash and shower. Nice neighborhood and the host was very communicative. Will definitely book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean. Respect guests’ privacy. Everything matched with pictures listed.
2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Let’s start with the positives: It’s a nice neighborhood, a nice interior if you like tiny/claustrophobic and they had nice soap and shampoo. Now the negatives: this was the loudest Airbnb I have ever stayed at, probably louder than the vast majority of hotels, motels, campgrounds, bars, parties and concerts I’ve been to. the place is basically a converted half-garage with an extremely loud laundry room (that they use late into the night), directly above the bathroom. It shares paper-thin walls and ceilings with the rest of the house. When I first arrived it sounded like someone was playing basketball upstairs for hours. Then they turned on their washing machine, which was unbalanced and clanging for hours. I could hear them partying and it sounded like a baby crying. Not sure if it was a baby or a child. Heck, it could’ve been a donkey, with how loud it was. There must have been a party at this place, because the street was absolutely loaded with cars. Even had cars blocking driveway"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s place was perfect for a quick stay! Location was safe, secure, and the space was spotless!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I flew in from out of state and didn't get to Sac til midnight and will have to drive 3 hours away. We needed a place to rest and spend the night. Linda's place was available. The place was nice and cozy. Linda and Johnny instruction to get inside is easy and convenient. The place was very clean. We highly recommend their airbnb. thank you, Linda and Johnny."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a dream stay as I attended an important family event. It was a last minute find, but truly the BEST around. It gave me the space I needed to wind down away from the noise for some peace in between all the movement. It was cute, clean, and comfy too! Just perfect! I'm grateful for all the swift responses and kindness as well!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda and Johnny’s home was very comfortable and beautiful surroundings in the Natomas area of Sacramento. Just a 5 minutes drive to a grocery shop and close to the highway along with the neighborhood being right by a lake view makes this something you could easily walk through feeling at ease at any hours of the day. Will be staying here if available again

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My go to spot whenever my girlfriend comes to visit Sacramento. Her flight came really late and we checked in around 1am but it was no problem and super easy. Really private and simple, perfect for a night."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice room that was private. I was not expecting the neighborhood to be so nice with a nice lake. The community was very peaceful and had very nice neighbors. The only thing I didn’t know is that there are other people in the house as well so there are times where I have to keep it down but overall it was great. To be fair nobody ever told me I was being too loud but I didn’t want to be rude. I very much enjoyed my stay and will most likely try this spot again. Thank you!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot. Essentially just 1 room with an attached bathroom, but the tall ceilings and clean setup helped make it feel a little more spacious. Very nice neighborhood with plenty of street parking, too. Linda and her co-host were quick to reply to my inquiry and left very clear, hassle-free instructions for checkin and checkout. We didn't cross paths during our stay, but that worked for us. Overall a great value."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little spot for an overnight stay. I was attending a week long class nearby and literally just needed a place to come stay the night where I could study, sleep, and get showered up the next morning. I was already planning on eating out all week, so the lack of a kitchen was no inconvenience for me.
The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful. I had no issues or questions so I did not even reach out to the hosts during the stay, but they made it clear that they were available. Their instructions made it easy for a no contact stay, for those who might prefer that.
I'd highly recommend for anyone looking for simple clean and safe place to stay the night. Great value too!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda's was a fantastic place to stay the night before an early flight out of SMF! It is close to several restaurants / a shopping center and just 10 minutes from the airport. While minimal, this place had everything we needed for a comfy stay (clean bathroom, nice bed, small desk/table). There was a lovely little park just down the road as well for a nice evening walk.

There is a very nice lake located behind the house where you can walk and sit and admire the scenery. It is about 12-15 minutes from midtown and the downtown area. The bed was comfortable to sleep in. The bathroom was so nice and it also had awesome water pressure. Overall, it was a very nice stay in a cozy little corner in Sacramento.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you would like a place to get away that is outside of Sac (10-15 minutes) this is a good place. It's not huge, however, it's comfortable for two people to stay for a weekend or week, or for a single person to stay for a while.
The place is connected to the main house but separated enough to where it doesn't seem like it is connected.
It was quite quiet and it's close to a lake that is great for walking. The owners/hosts were responsive to all questions."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful rental that is very convenient to the airport. The unit is bright, comfortable and sparkling clean. It’s attached to a house on a quiet street and has a private entrance. Communication was clear and friendly. We would gladly stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great experience when staying at Linda’s Airbnb. Linda and Johnny are the best hosts.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda and Johnny are great hosts. The unit is very clean, private and comfortable. Highly recommended. Will be back :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room and bathroom were immaculate, and met our needs exactly--a place to sleep, keep our stuff, and get ready for our event. The check in process was super simple, and even though we saw cars coming in and out of the driveway, we did not hear a single sound from the main house. It felt very private and quiet--ideal."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Minimalist dream. This is as described. Just a note thay the bed is very firm! Perfect if you just need a small place to stay before a flight out of town.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Room was really nice and had everything I needed, was in a nice neighborhood! And plenty of parking! You can hear voices through the walls, but other then that everything was and check in was easy! With private entrance!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, and accommodating. A bed, a shower, and TV. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for a low maintenance stay this is your place. The community was beautiful and you feel safe every step of the way. I did not hear and peep the whole stay. I needed a break from reality and got it here. I appreciate Linda and her host for opening their doors for me last minute when I was in a crunch."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Great host. Easy communication
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a lovely and quiet stay. The neighborhood has a small lake and running track, perfect to fend off any jet lag. It was very easy to check in especially when I had a 3 hour delayed flight and arrived at 2am. Perfect stay for a quick layover in Sacramento."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What you see is what you get. Super clean and perfect for just a place to rest and shower. The host were extremely hospitable and were willing to offer us anything we could need. I had asked them prior to flying in if there was a iron or a steam iron because we were going to a wedding and our clothes would be wrinkled from being folded in a bag. They let me know that the one they had in the room previously was broken. We showed up to the room and there was a new steam iron sitting there for us to use. I never expected them to go out of their way for such a simple request and they could’ve just easily said “no, sorry” but I thought it was extremely hospitable for them to make that happen for us. Would definitely recommend and visit again, should I be in the area."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing. Size of room is perfect for one person. The private unit is attached to the house, so you’ll be able to hear bits of conversation and sounds from the kitchen and when someone is walking around upstairs, but generally it’s a very quiet, private AirBnB in a very quiet and safe suburban neighborhood. If you’re taking a cab into the city, be sure to give yourself a time buffer. Ubers/Lyfts are a little hard to come by in the area (understandably so). I would love to stay here again the next time I’m in town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice neighborhood. The space was small but just enough for my partner and I. Loved the plants outside and overall it was a very nice airbnb.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good house in a safe neighborhood. Nice hosts. Had some minor issues with getting reliable streaming-quality internet so I recommend an upgrade there. Bed frame is a bit small for tall folks, had to sleep at an angle. No cell service with at&t in the area for some reason"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cheaper than all of the hotels In the Sacramento area. Located in a nice neighborhood and easily accessible. The room and bathroom were updated and there was a small fridge and tv available in the room that was equipped with Netflix etc.
Would 100% stay again for my next trip to Sacramento."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay! Exactly what I expected and more!

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy stay. Close to the airport so you may hear a few planes if you’re a light sleeper but that makes getting rides to SMF easier. Peaceful and safe neighborhood.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I really liked staying here just for a night in Sacramento. It’s a convenient location close to both the freeway and airport plus restaurants/stores/ and a park. You can hear planes a lot in this area just an FYI. The place itself is super clean and I loved the decor! I only took off a star because my partner found the bed to be a little uncomfortable and I found the refrigerator was quite loud when plugged in…it kept waking me during the night. Other than everything was great!
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It is great place for privacy and safest area in Sacramento.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very neat and thoughtfully maintained place that is not too far from the airport or downtown areas. Cleanliness, and aesthetics were very well considered. The bathroom was in great condition and so was the room. No microwave was a bit inconvenient. Also, mosquitoes can tend to get in, so close the door fast behind you! Otherwise, very convenient and easy to access."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little spot to check in for the night! Super close to the airport and Linda has great communication!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place to stay, good neighborhood, would stay again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a clean small space. I left leftovers out instead of putting it in the fridge and woke up with a small swarm of ants on the desk, communicated with the host who responded quickly. I was given industrial ant killer to clean with. Overall good experience."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful spot in a great area right off the free way not to far from downtown activities. Extremely clean and accurate to the photos, feels much more spacious than one might expect from the photos, neighborhood was very quiet, check in was easy and clear.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, quiet and clean. Definitely recommend"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb really came through for me when I needed fast internet speeds for work! I use a remote server and VOIP so the upload speeds are very important. They totally helped me figure out the speeds before I booked!
The place was small but exactly as pictured. Perfect for what I needed. Bathroom was exceptionally clean."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda and Johnny's private room was absolutely perfect for our stay in Sacramento, they have quite the beautiful home. The bed was super comfy and the place was extremely clean."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay in safe neighborhood
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really easy check in and a quiet area from morning to night. We were not disturbed at all. It had a hotel feel to it which we didn’t mind! Noticed there was another bed underneath that was tiny if needed. Really clean bathroom and I have no complaints about it! It was about 13-15 mins away from things we had planned as well.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay great communication and location
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable and peaceful place. Close to everything. I wish I could have reserved more days. I would stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in Midtown which was perfect for a wedding we attended! Walking distance to coffee/restaurants, easy parking, and comfortable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had been given a code to enter, all went well. The apartment was as described. It had everything we needed with the added bonus of washer and dryer which was really useful. The apartment is perfect if you choose not to drive as it is in walking distance of most places. We had no issues at all with the place.
It was a pleasure to use it for our 2 week stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was clean, comfortable, easy to find, and in a great location. I would stay here again and recommend it!
Foot steps of the upstairs tenant can be heard, but there were no disruptions during the night. The parking was a little tight for my 4-door sedan, but much preferred than street parking. Overall a good experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy to get in, parking was a breeze and very clean."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable place in Midtown! Host was very kind and communicative. In walking distance to a bunch of great shops, restaurants, and bars."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay for the weekend! Close to so many midtown favorites.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Host is pretty responsive if you need directions with parking or about any other problems! Cute and cozy, everything is less than a 5-7min walk away!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at this spot! It was super clean and check in was very easy. Alex is super responsive and very friendly. It’s a great location where we can could walk to everything we wanted to do. We will definitely be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place right downtown! we walked to a show at goldfield and stopped at a lot of cool places along the way. Very easy to get into with the directions given, and a very comfortable place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed in this apartment for a week and had a lovely time. The location is fantastic and the apartment had all the amenities we needed. Just a heads up that the host lives above the apartment and the house is from 1902 so you can hear them, but it’s not a big deal and overall our stay was way quieter than other Airbnbs I’ve stayed in within Sacramento. The neighborhood specifically was surprisingly quiet for being so central. I would be happy to stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great couple of days staying at Alex's. the neighbourhood is quiet, but has plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. It's also only 20 minutes walk in to the Capitol
The apartment space is excellent, well equipped, and the off-street parking is really handy.
I would definitely consider staying here again if I find my way back to Sacramento."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A lovely spot walking distance to many midtown faves.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!! Perfect location, especially to the farmers market and Temple coffee for a great start to the morning. The place was very cute, and clean, excellent decorations and thoughtfully designed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Made my stay great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's place is great! The location is ideal for full access to Midtown experience, all within walking distance. The place is spotless and felt secure and safe.
As a heads up, the covered parking area is for very small cars only!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Perfect and quiet location, very clean on the inside- looked just like the photos. Thank you for providing a peaceful stay and I can’t wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little place was just what we expected. A perfect location for my mid town event. Temple coffee was a perfect short walk away. Wish we had the ability to stay longer. Will book again for sure next time I have an event in midtown. Had an impeccable dinner at Mulvaney’s.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,easy to access and in a very walkable neighborhood!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had an outstanding stay at this superb apartment. Alex was friendly and welcoming, and quick to respond to any questions I had. The location is super central and in a safe yet fun area. Having my own parking spot a few steps from the front door was ideal. The keyless entry system was flawless and I felt safe. The apartment itself is really beautiful, with a modern and upscale vibe to it. The bed was super comfortable, the bedroom itself very spacious with a perfect chair for reading. I loved the shower. Having a big closet and living room made the place feel like home. The kitchen had everything I needed, including a Keurig for coffee. Overall, it was an excellent value and I'd definitely recommend Alex's apartment."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very comfortable stay in Sacramento.
The room is very clean and beautiful.There was also detergent in the washing machine, and there was parking.
There were many restaurants and cafes just a short walk away, and I had a very nice time.
Thank you."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Definitely a good stay if you’re visiting Sac!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would absolutely stay here again. Very cute place with everything we needed. Great hosts who were super responsive and friendly. It was clean, cozy and in a great area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect midtown Airbnb
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host with very private and peaceful space. Would recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for me - near many restaurants that I call on for work in the wine industry. Exceeded my expectations as far as the actual space - it is large with a great kitchen and living room. I was almost embarrassed to stay by myself - but the price was well below any hotels with a fantastic location and spacious space!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment delivered on everything it promised. It had incredible bang for your buck. When hotels in the area can run three times what I paid, I was grateful for the option. The neighborhood is fantastic. Restaurants, coffee, bars...all in walking distance and had a ton of personality. The water pressure in the shower was top notch.
If I'm being judgy of anything, I wish the curtains were blackout -- being a first floor, it didn't provide a lot of privacy at night. They were almost lace and see through. That really was my biggest issue. You could definitely hear people in the other units, but in a city, that's to be expected. And honestly, sometimes a comfort to me when I'm traveling alone. Otherwise, great little spot."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So convenient to check in, clean, and cozy! Alex communicated clearly and was quick to respond. Enjoyed my stay a lot! Would highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay! Alex was a great host and made sure we were settled in and if we needed anything he was available to answer any questions! I would definitely recommend and stay with Alex again! The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as pictured!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in midtown
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Alex's place and I can't wait to come back for a third! The location is perfect for walking to great restaurants and shops, parking is easy in this neighborhood, the apartment is comfortable and has everything I need to cook my own meals, and Alex is wonderfully responsive and helpful. All in all an excellent find in a great part of town!"
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding value - the unit is comfortable and well-appointed. Location is great - in Midtown, close to lots of restaurants - and within easy walking distance of the Capitol area. Excellent communication, easy access."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location with ample weekend parking! There is a gorgeous yummy coffee place 3 minutes away. Walkable to so many things! Big closet & bedroom. Basic amenities in the kitchen, though the fridge is bigger than I expected! Electric kettle and a Keurig. The off street parking spot is tight so best for a sedan."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's place was wonderful. I was in for 3 nights for a conference at the SAFECO convention center and it was in a perfect location just far enough away from there in a quiet, safe-feeling, tree-lined neighborhood. It was convenient and quick using Lyft, with many drivers always available in the area both am and pm.
The apartment was cozy, very clean, quiet and quite spacious inside; it felt much larger than the photos express. There were extra blankets if I had needed them but the heater worked perfectly on the cold nights I stayed. And I loved the large closet space for storing my luggage, shoes, etc and the handy coat rack by the front door. Alex was proactive and very helpful and responsive as well. It's nice to have the parking space behind a gate. Keep in mind you won't fit a large vehicle there; it's a tight turn getting into it and narrow as described, but my 4-door Lexus fit fine. I highly recommend a stay here and hope to return next year."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay!! Alex is a phenomenal host and was helpful and attentive to any need I had. The place is beautiful and the bed is very comfortable! Really loved it and would happily stay again!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely renovated, clean and cozy little one-bedroom. Alex had it well stocked. It is in a safe and walks part of town. The unit was fairly quiet which was nice.
Parking was a bit tricky as it can be when you are in a downtown area, I have an SUV and had assumed the parking under the deck would work but it really is meant for a very small car. Because it was the weekend, I was able to park in the dentist lot next door and street parking on the weekend is not limited. Just a consideration if you are coming during a week day or have a large vehicle.
If you are sensitive to fragrances, ask Alex to unplug the air freshener before you arrive. The smell was overpowering and I got an immediate headache."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient and clean. Great for my brief stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay at Alex’s— it’s in a wonderful location! We brought an extra blanket after reading another review about the chilly winter temps, and were glad for it. We didn’t realize it was a ground floor apartment— photos made it look like we’d be up a level or two— but it wasn’t a problem, we just kept the window shades up to maintain privacy (some rowdy fun loving foot traffic outside on a Saturday night, just fyi). Overall very peaceful, and we’d happily stay again! Thank you Alex!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex was super attentive and responsive. Helped all throughout the stay. A really nifty Victorian with two mini apartments built under it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean & organized space. Alex was a very responsive host. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little space in a fantastic neighborhood…
GREAT shower, GREAT mattress, GREAT location, SUPER-responsive host…
They won’t let me give SIX stars, so five will have to do!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was super convenient and the unit feels private and cozy. The kitchen is well-equipped. Alex was helpful and available when needed to answer questions. Great value, would definitely stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice and clean place. Alex gave very clear instructions on how to checkin/checkout. Will definitely book again when I come back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and cozy! Alex was extremely informative and accommodating. His communication was top notch and nothing was left for interpretation. Would definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's Airbnb's biggest plus is its fantastic location.
Even though I had my car in Sacramento, I barely used it! Alex's place was super close to all the cool shops and restaurants in Midtown, so we ended up walking most of the time. The neighborhood's beautiful trees and unique houses made it a great stroll.
Our stay was a breeze.
Alex got in touch with clear instructions on getting the keys and where to park. They made sure we knew they were available to help if we needed anything.
Just like in the photos, the place was awesome—clean, modern, and exactly what you see online. I was seriously impressed with how much space and all the amenities they had."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Alex was very helpful providing instructions and the place was right in the middle of it all in Midtown Sacramento. I felt very comfortable reaching out to Alex and would recommend the place highly. I regret I couldn’t stay longer!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex was great. Clear, concise communication and available if I needed anything. Prime location within walking distance of everything."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a nice time in Alex's apartment. It is extremely clean and the space is well cared for which I appreciate a lot. Good kitchen amenities too. Alex is very communicative and responsive which I am also very grateful for! I wish I'd brought my own pillow and I was a bit cold in the bedroom. I would've liked a warmer blanket for the bed because the heat didn't circulate in the bedroom well. The neighborhood is lovely and Temple coffee is an awesome cafe down the street. I was happy to have a spot to park my car too, that was fabulous!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with a comfortable bed and stocked kitchen. Alex was always responsive, helpful and friendly. There are many good restaurants, parks, etc. within a few minutes walk."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable accommodations for our weekend convention. We were able to walk less than a mile to the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center with the option of jumping on rental scooters or bikes along J Street. There are great options for cafes, coffeehouses, and restaurants nearby."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall I recommend the place and would possibly stay again for the value.
Pros - Value, cleanliness, location, easy communication with Alex, easy parking most evenings. Coffee making is covered with a nice kettle, French press, and a Keurig machine. I appreciated that Alex coordinated for me to enter the unit after checkout to retrieve a cord I left behind.
Potential cons - Kitchen supplies are the basics or less. I wasn't cooking so I was fine. There were a few building and neighbor noises, which must expected in this building type and nothing disturbed me. Unit is on the ground level and the kitchen has no window coverings and looks out to an area where people are walking by. The lack of window coverings was nice in the daytime, but I felt a lack of privacy when in the kitchen after dark, especially on a busy evening/ nightlife night (halloween). This is only an issue in the kitchen and not any of the other rooms. I still recommend the place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here on 10/28, great place to stay for 2 people. The Airbnb location has a lot of a lot of walkable locations like cafe shops, restaurants and bars. Overall the Airbnb itself was clean and lots of amenities."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Getaway weekend for reunion with friends: Hospitable host; felt at home in spacious, well lit unit. Nicely appointed. Full service kitchen and bathroom. Very clean and tidy; plenty of blankets and pillows. Good instructions; appreciated parking available overnight. Host is very responsive. Wonderful location. Look forward to future stays when in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great apartment in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Sacramento. The 1-BR apartment was more spacious than I had expected and was well-provisioned with helpful amenities to help guests feel at home. It was a quick walk to good dining options in the evening and to coffee in the morning. Internet was also super reliable, which I appreciated because I needed to teach a class over Zoom while I was there and had no issue. I would definitely recommend to other solo travelers or couples staying in Sacramento!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply perfect!!!
The apartment was lovingly furnished, super clean, with its own parking space, a comfortable bed and a super equipped kitchen.
We recommend the place to anyone!!!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little 1 bedroom was just what I needed for a weekend wedding I was attending. Only 2 blocks away from Temple coffee which I visited every morning and walkable to many other great restaurants. I loved the neighborhood and the tree lined streets.

Very happy with my choice over the deary costly hotels where we could have stayed. Thank Alex for being a great host."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot to check out Midtown. We were able to walk to many restaurants and shops. We walked by the capital to Old Sacramento on the riverfront. The apartment was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Highly recommend!

Finally, the front door is on the ground floor on the side of the house so it's very convenient. Very quiet location, you can't hear a noise. Even the air conditioning is not noisy. Very well placed to walk in Sacramento. Alex is very responsive and pleasant."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's place was great! It was very spacious, modern and clean. The best part is that there are plenty of restaurants that are literally right around the corner. It is also a short drive or walk from some of the main attractions that Sacramento has to offer (Leland Stanford Mansion, the Capitol, etc.). Alex was very friendly and responsive, and made sure we had everything we needed. The airbnb is also in Midtown, which is a nice neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's place was exactly as pictured. Clean, comfortable and quiet. The parking spot was very tight even for a small car. The site says walking distance to the Capitol, but it's a long walk and not one that was manageable before and after work. Otherwise, a great place and great host. Would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent Host! Excellent place! Thank you Alex for all your help!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean space in the Captiol Mansions neighborhood. The block is quiet, but it's a short, easy walk to excellent coffee and restaurants. Alex is a very responsive (without being intrusive) host. A great value in a great location."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Alex is an excellent host. My husband and I were in need of an iron and Alex brought us an iron and steamer, which we appreciated so much. It was easy to get in communication with Alex. The place was clean, comfortable, and in an excellent location. There was a packet with some local restaurant recommendations walking distance from the Airbnb that my Husband and I tried out and they were delicious. Location is not far from local parks as well as Capital State Park. Overall excellent stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex's place was super clean and a great space for us two for our visit to Sac. It's in Midtown and you're walking distance to everything. Self check in and out with the key code and while it came with a carport spot, we had no problem finding street parking. You're on the bottom floor of an old Victorian and share the common entrance with a neighbor across the hall (super nice people!) and you can hear others in the building but nothing too bad where it interfered with enjoyment or sleep. We used to live in Sac and would totally stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great stay here. Loved this airbnb, honestly it felt like the perfect 1 bedroom apartment to live in for the area. Super walkable and near many things."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I chose Alex's place because I needed to be near a conference and the hotel was full. As a result, I was only able to be in place for a short time. Which was a shame--it was a lovely space, spacious, comfortable, and just right for my short visit, and would have been even better for a weekend or longer. Next time!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent apartment, well decorated and clean. Located in a nice neighborhood and can visit Sacramento on foot."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions. I greatly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend the Airbnb to anyone interested.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband & I booked as I had to come to Sacramento for the weekend for school. 10 minute drive from Sacramento State which was very convenient. Place was clean & very cute. Just like the pictures & Alex was very friendly. We booked to come again in November when I return for school.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As 1 night only guests, we were very comfortable. The unit is cozy, clean, and has a warm environment. The individual, gated parking spot was a relief to have right next door."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful experience at this Airbnb. Alex was extremely proactive and helpful with instructions and checkin- everything was seamless. The place was extremely clean and spacious and in a wonderful location. We were very comfortable during our stay and would highly recommend
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"No issues, everything was as expected."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex is cheerful and nice. This is a well designed little apartment with a tub, good shower, comfy bed and kitchen area; the living room is spartan. It's in a good neighborhood near L Street with attractions within an easy walk. I walked to the Capitol to do my business too. It was a chilly few days, with the heater easy to operate I was pleasantly warm. The place is very clean and I got in a couple of good nights sleep."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent place in downtown Sacramento. a TON to do within walking distance. the place itself was spotless and really good size for the value. I will be back. HIGHLY recommend.

We loved the walkable neighborhood and tried several of Alex’s recommended restaurants during our visit. I’d definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean and brand new place in a lovely neighbourhood! We really enjoyed our stay, it was perfect for the few days we spent in Sacramento!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Alex was an incredible and friendly host! We absolutely loved our stay here and would definitely stay again. Alex was also really accommodating and quick to respond to our messages. We both loved being able to have this very clean and cozy centrally located space to come back to after exploring Sacramento. It was awesome to have a gated space to park our car as well. Thank you!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Perfect location - a very walkable area of midtown Sacramento, close to lots of delicious food and fun shopping spots. Easy parking, easy check-in and out, Alex was super fast in terms of responding, and the apartment is BEAUTIFULLY appointed. They've done a marvelous job updating the space and selecting appliances and furniture for the apartment, both in terms of function and design. Bed was super comfy, lots of extra linens and towels if I needed them, room to stretch out and work/do yoga/etc, a great kitchen space with all I needed to make my own meals, and everything in the apartment was CLEAN. I truly cannot wait to come back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here and have been raving about Alex’s place to friends and family. We will definitely be staying here again. The space was very clean and comfortable, and there are so many great places within walking distance."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Best AirBnB in Midtown! I stay in Midtown Sacramento about three times a year, and Alex's place is BY FAR the best accommodations I have had. The apartment is spotlessly clean, super adorably appointed, lots of light, very comfortable, with all the amenities you could want. Complete kitchen with Keurig machine, plenty of towels in the bathroom, comfortable bed with extra blankets if needed, and I loved the full length mirror! Bonus: washer and dryer! Alex herself was friendly, responsive, and communicative. She gave great local recommendations and was sure to check in with me that everything was good. I look forward to booking all my future visits with her! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alex was amazing, very responsive, nice place !!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a lovely and very clean little apartment! Super cute neighborhood and close by to everything. I would definitely stay here again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay and very affordable! It was really cool to be able to stay in one of the Historic Capitol Mansions and be in walking distance to EVERYTHING in downtown/midtown Sacramento. The super cute apartment was clean, well appointed, and cozy. The free laundry is an awesome added bonus. Whether you are local or out of town, or staying for a night or a week, I highly recommend Alex's place!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If the location wasn't enough of a gem, I loved this little apartment! Needed an overnight in town while my power was out and Alex came THROUGH. Felt like I had my own little airy, bright Midtown apartment. Close by to my favorite coffee shop and gorgeous neighborhood for evening or morning strolls. Felt like I was staying in a small, beautifully renovated, piece of Sacramento history:)"
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needs maintenance, the yard was dirty and a lot of spider webs. But it’s a nice little place to stay at if it’s clean. The communication with Michael was great. Good host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was excellent! Prime location; cool interiors; great outdoor space!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Tiny House provides privacy, is comfortable, and conveniently located for our needs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! I really enjoyed my stay there and will definitely book again in the future. I definitely recommend of you are into art or are an artist yourself.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so much fun to stay in. It's a little Casita with a lot of personality and a big beautiful yard. You'll have a little more space inside if you are able to fold up the bed. If you don't need a lot of walking around room, you can leave the bed where it is and still not feel closed in even though it's a tiny space. The artwork is fantastic and fun, and if the weather permits, definitely spend some time in the backyard! I loved being so close to some of the highlights of Oak Park area, including Underground Books (Black-owned/Black-centered bookstore) and Fixins restaurant (Go get you some Kool-Aid!). 100% would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I honestly didn’t want to leave. I truly enjoyed my stay and I will be returning.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So cute! Felt right at home. Host’s messages were thoughtful and very helpful. The fantastic concept gave the space a trendy, boutiquey kind of vibe. Very comfortable experience. Many thanks. Definitely plan to stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a mini vacation. Very responsive and helpful hosts. The Tiny Art House is a great little guide to Sacramento. Thanks Michael!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Everything was clean and as shown in the picture. This place is in a great neighborhood with good food options. We had a great short stay, communication was easy and great! Would def stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great option for downtown Sacramento stay. The tiny house was comfortable and convenient.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here before and hope to return. The tiny house accommodate us very well. Easy to recommend for one or two people.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot , with tons of cool art."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There were instructions about the internet but no instructions about operating the TV. At one point, we lost audio and struggled for about 30 minutes to accidentally correct it. Since we did not get a call back regarding the porch light, the probability that we would get a call back regarding the TV seemed low.
It is as advertised… Tiny! I am on dialysis and barely had room for my equipment (size of an old printer). I think this space is ideal for one person or two people traveling light.
Need to use the link in the Airbnb app for directions. We found out that if you put the address into your vehicle’s navigator, it won’t find it because it probably isn’t a valid post office address (which took use to an entirely different neighborhood 7 miles away)!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly hosts and unique, fun place to stay! Definitely a memorable experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A basic, small, private, clean and affordable place. Michael kept in touch to see if everything was good and if all my needs were met. I enjoyed my time and had no problems or complaints. Will use again if the need arises."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael and his team were very responsive any time I needed to reach out. The place was cute and cozy and has all the basic amenities that anyone would need for a comfortable stay. There are a lot of nice restaurants within a few blocks of the house. I booked his spot only a few days in advance wanting a quiet little staycation outside of my own home. It was just what I was looking for and I would definitely book with them again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed being surrounded by art. The backyard was large and peaceful. I appreciated the off street parking with a locking gate. This is a quiet retreat in the city for artists or lovers of art/creativity.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay for a few days in Sacramento. It has everything you need, and it is super easy to make breakfast or dinner. I even made coffee. The heater works extremely well, especially since it rained while we were there. Highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. It has a small kitchen, nice bed, tv to watch things on and clean bathroom. The backyard was huge with a bench swing and patio furniture to hangout at."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed Michael's tiny house. It has great character and a wonderful backyard space. The bed was comfortable. The internet was fast. The split heat/ac worked great. He has a little booklet with local places to check out. The parking space inside the gate is great.
If you are working remote, one thing to note: the flip up counter extension is not there nor the red chair in the photo...so really you have to work from bed or outside on the patio furniture if weather allows. If you aren't working and just visiting, the space is adequate.
The kitchenware could use a freshening up as items are missing (only 1 fork) or broken/chipped, etc, but I appreciated the ability to cook some with the microwave, toaster oven, electric burner, and coffee pot.
Overall, I'd book again for a non-working vacation."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed staying at the Tiny House. This was perfect for us, as it was convenient to family members living on the same street. Michael was a great host -- responsive to messaging ahead of and during the stay -- contactless check-in and check-out. The back-yard garden and gated driveway were nice features to add comfort and privacy. Small yet functional quarters for a shorter stay. Cute kitchen and coffee area, good window treatments for a dark sleep environment, and art-spirit all throughout. Thanks, would book again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed this cute little home! It was cozy, had everything I needed, was clean and tidy, and is so close to so many great restaurants and places I like to shop, but it felt so tucked away and peaceful with a beautiful backyard I would love to enjoy more in the warmer months for sure! It was absolutely wonderful and just what I needed! I loved all the art and paintings and colors everywhere it felt so alive welcoming!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for a quick stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay extremely clean just perfect for what I needed and they were extremely responsive and fast for any questions I had. Definitely worth the stay and look forward to staying here again.

Thank you so much!
Огромное спасибо за чудесное место!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here, the house and neighborhood were relaxed and peaceful. I especially enjoyed the home and the backyard with all the art.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a tiny but cozy place which was exactly what we were looking for!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was a great spot for our quick trip to sac for a music festival ◡̈ even though it is pretty tiny, it has just about everything you would need for a short stay. the outdoor space is a plus, and helps make the house feel bigger than it is. i felt pretty safe staying in the tiny art house as you needed to get through not one, but two gates with latches before even getting to the door to the tiny house. make sure you take some time to look at all the art!! you are surrounded by amazing art throughout your stay which makes this place even more special. tiny house, but everything in it is intentional and of value to the space. the hosts and co hosts were super responsive and communicative about all the logistical stuff which helped make our trip a successful one!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy access to stores and Midtown. Great yard and privacy. Way better than a hotel for a 2 night stay. Very pleased😊 Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay and close to our family’s house that we were visiting! Love that it had off street parking.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot in a great location! wouldn't stay anywhere else
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael’s place was incredible and I love the concept and design. Will definitely be coming back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great experience. I needed a last minute place to stay and Micheal was able to accommodate. The space was very cozy.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a good stay. Everything was as described, the neighborhood was walkable with a variety of food options, and Michael and his cohosts were highly responsive. The space worked well for what I needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet, quiet gem in a charming part of the city. Original art welcomes one on to a clean, cozy, restful space. The backyard was also a treat. Local business’ were welcoming and kind, too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An awesome unique place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a tiny room, but it has everything you need. The individual entrance, parking space, and backyard are essential to me. You can arrive anywhere downtown by driving within 15 minutes. My wife worked online every day, and there was no problem with the Internet. Michael responded quickly with pretty good service. We stayed four nights and had a good experience. I recommend this tiny room."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute little Airbnb. The secure guest parking is a really nice feature
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything as described. Comfy bed with plenty of pillows in a quite area. I loved how you can live your car secured and not on the street.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael's place is perfect for a secluded stay. it has all the basic amenities that are comfortable and homey. the art is fun and makes for a whimsical mood. thanks for sharing your personal touches
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael’s place was amazing and very cool. I would recommend this to anyone staying in the area.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating because I love the idea of supporting local artists, and this is a great concept doing it through Airbnb. But I have to be honest, the place is getting pretty run down. It was probably great when it was new like when the pics were taken.
The back yard was the selling point for me, but the couch with the cushions in the picture were not usable. Looked like they had been left outside in the rain, dirty, just not cool at all. I don’t know man, not doing local artists any favors here.
Again, I love the concept but that does not excuse you from keeping the place in good condition. Please clean this place up and bring it back to life. I would stay here again if I see that issues have been taken care of."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a two night stay and it was so worth it, we visited for my birthday and it was exactly the get away we needed. I am a big fan of the art that was placed everywhere and the swing in the back was so darling, I think the only downside was the lack of storage, the flooring was sticking up in a few places so that could've been a hazard, I understand it was a tiny house but the area between the tv and bed was very narrow, we still had the best time and even had the chance to make homemade spaghettis and meatballs, don't let the negative in this review out way the good. I was so thankful to be able to stay at such a lovely place and the hosts were very kind!"

You are warned of the hot water before your stay, and i was alone so it was fine but if more than one person is staying I’m not sure you could both shower right after one another.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Tiny Art House! Michael offers a unique experience with both tiny house living and decorating the house and property with art. Check in was seamless and when I opened the door the bed looked like I was at a hotel with towels nearly provided on a bed tray table along with water and chocolates. The glass sliding doors are floor to ceiling and add a beauty and a sense of more room to the space- loved the sliding doors. I didn’t have any problem with having hot water via the tiny house’s tiny water heater. AC worked great and I enjoyed using streaming services on the tv. Bed was super comfortable and the sheets were dreamy! I would definitely stay again if I find myself in the area again. Thank you for an incredible, easy, clean, safe, and unique stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cute house and literally minutes away from all the tourists spots. Well worth the stay and enjoy the swing.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place rocks!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at the art tiny house was great. The only thing was a weird smell coming from an open pipe, but Michael was very communicative and let me burn a candle, so it didn’t bother me."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel the house I rented for only 3 days but I am very comfortable and surprisingly everything inside is in shape and it is very beautiful. Not only that, the design of the house is very wonderful. If I have a chance to go to scramento I will continue to rent this house"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my first booking of a tiny home, and my 2nd with this host.
First, this host and the co-hosts that assist from jump are welcoming. From the communication, hands-on intuitive information and suggestions, to the items already available and included for your visit.
This location includes street parking, but also 'private' parking on the property.
Their attention to detail throughout puts you at ease and allows you to enjoy your visit.
I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was surprisingly surprised and impressed with how well it all worked.
I've put a few other locations hosted by Michael (and his team) for my return visits here. I'm never disappointed and know probably everything I need is already taken care of.
ps-I am only sad I forgot to put a message in the visitors ""memory book"". It was heartwarming to read the messages left by other people and their experiences."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are at the tiny house it would be nice to know in the directions that you are able to park in the back by in front of the tiny house. I just assumed it was where we are supposed to park.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was so perfect for me! I loved the energy and the communication was top notch. It was a perfect space to come relax in after a grueling day of competition.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Tiny Art House is in an upcoming community rebuild close to major shopping, restaurants, food trucks, exhibits, coffee shops, and more. The bright colors of this house wrapped within its own private gates, tidy, equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom. Let the “Tiny Art House” be your escape or getaway. Definitely recommended."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was cozy, offering unique qualities of art and eclectic attributes you wouldn’t find elsewhere. It was located on a quiet street along with access to prime areas surrounding Sacramento. The hosts communicated with me before, during and after the stay, so very easy to address any concerns. I would stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at the Tiny Art House was perfect! It was clean, comfortable and quiet. Our 14 days flew by and we didn’t want to leave!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As the description entails, the tiny home is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in amenities, great communication from the host, and great location for traveling towards downtown"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay here! I loved all the artwork and the super cute backyard.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was perfect for my girlfriend and I. It was clean, private, comfy, and quiet. Good amount of vegan choices close by. Our host Michael and Sandra were very helpful as well. Thank you! We plan to visit again."

2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Cute tiny home, but backyard was unkept so even if we wanted to we could not sit and hangout out there…tables and chairs were covered in layers of dirt.
Location was bad — not walking distance to anything and not in a very good neighborhood. Granted all of Sacramento is not very nice but this felt off."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny art home is just that. It is filled with personal touches and a great use of the space. At no point did I feel cramped or crowded. I loved the easy access and the available parking specifically for the home. The area has amazing coffee shops within walking distance. I am so happy I was able to explore an area of Sacramento that I had not spent much time in. Great new memories, fun adventures and a beautiful place to come home to at the end of the day. 10/10 would recommend."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great unique stay. Very clean. Great communication. The fees were a bit steep but other than that everything was great.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael has created a really unique and fun space. Staying places like this makes me appreciate Airbnb so much more than a generic hotel. The place was definitely the tiniest stay I've ever had, but well laid out and it worked great for one person. It was very clean inside although the outdoor area could have been cleaner."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a perfectly fine stay at the tiny house. The space was equipped with all the essentials, and the use of space was clever. I’m usually a fan of a firm bed, but slept very soundly on the soft mattress. The indoor space was clean and tidy, the outdoor space could use a little TLC. The hosts were responsive and communicative, and we did not have any issues during our stay. I’d recommend consolidating the amount of pre, mid, and post-stay instructions, as there were many messages. May be helpful to receive 1 message with all the info instead. Overall a pleasant stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb is a lovely tiny house. There is just enough room for one person to relax at the end of the day. The place was clean. The bed is comfortable, and the air conditioner worked on the only hot day. I hope to return."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little house, great communication with the owner. Perfect for two people."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great place for a short pit stop on adventures through NorCal. The location is really great as well!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this tiny home! For those that rely on reviews, this is indeed a tiny home, so do not expect sprawling amounts of space as the bed takes up a majority of the living area which should be expected and was not an issue for our purposes. With that said, the art and atmosphere and the offered amenities were above and beyond. Thanks again for letting us stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute and clean! Very fun with all of the art and in a great, safe location."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for spring break with my boyfriend just to get away from school and work for a bit and honestly all I can say that it was the best weekend ever! I've never seen anything like it in a tiny home you can tell a lot of heart and soul was put into the making of this home 🥰 absolutely amazing! I even got an art piece for a memory! All the art in the home is very different as soon a walked in I eyed one that stuck out to me the most and got it haha 😄 the hosts are incredible too! They responded so fast and were very helpful and kind ☺ I highly recommend spending a weekend there or just to get away from home life it's definitely relaxing 😌 I know I'll for sure be booking another stay soon 😊

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Tiny Art House was an amazing all-around experience. The hosts were great and in constant communication, covering everything I needed.

It was easily located and provided privacy for our little getaway. One would think a tiny home would be cramped but it was very spacious and as a larger person I had no mobility issues getting around in the home. The bed is very comfortable.
My husband and I treasured this unique experience. We cannot wait for our next trip up to Sacramento. Definitely would recommend this place to all."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is hands down the best air bnb in the area! Full of character, thoughtful touches, and conveniently located! Yes it is a tiny house but we were able to stay comfortably (with a baby in tow) and they had everything carefully laid out to maximize the space. We will be back!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny art house was adorable and well appointed with art all over the walls. We sadly didn't get to stay long enough to enjoy the inviting back area, but will be back."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Def lives up to the tiny house title. Had a very short staycation. Thanks for having me.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really lovely tiny art house. Beautifully designed. Michael and Sandra are great at quick communication.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: Host/s are extremely communicative and the place is wonderful. Every corner of the property is covered with work by Michael with artists' statements and his work is very eclectic. The heater works well, the bed is comfortable, and amenities are abundant.
Cons: Mind the five minute shower, I barely got what I needed to get done in time! Also, the driveway is a little tricky to get into and out of if you're not careful; it has some sharp angles."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, comfortable, clean. Tiny and also very visually interesting and well decorated throughout. Only tip is you really do have to shower efficiently (if you aren’t a cold water fan) as the hot water tank is small. We didn’t mind much as, hey, it’s eco friendly :)"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny Art House was a delight to stay in. The house is an enchanting puzzle of artwork, and it’s incredibly comfortable and cozy. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into making the space beautiful and private while using the space effectively.
A highlight of our night was winding down in the spacious backyard with a bottle of red wine (picked up at a nearby store) in house-provided wine glasses.
Michael and his team were incredibly communicative and helpful. We even took him up on his taco recommendation, and it was awesome!
We’re looking forward to a potential move to Sacramento for work, and the Tiny Art House helped introduce us to the city’s livability and character. We’d definitely stay again and recommend it to friends."

The place has a quirky bungalow feel, very comfortable, sturdy & safe. The vintage kitchen is fine for breakfast, reheating simple prepared meals, etc.
A new friend when in need is a friend indeed! Thanks so much, Wendy!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Wendy's place. Her place was just as described, comfortable, with great decor, and well located for what we wanted to do in Sacramento. We have stayed here before, and we were happy to be back."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wendy's place is a great find – it's centrally located, but very quiet. It's a well-laid out duplex, with a comfortable bed and a nice little kitchen. There's a great breakfast place four blocks away, too. I'll be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed here for the Aftershock event and it was great. We were close to the event, and when we came back to the house the neighborhood was quiet. It’s also just in a good spot to go out to the rest of Sacramento to explore."

I wanted to get a few hours of rest and let me tell you, I had the best sleep ever on this bed."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredibly cute and comfortable little spot to stay in Sacramento. My girlfriend and I loved it. We counted 40 seperate Marilyn Monroe themed items, the kitchen was really charming and there were a number of just little creature comforts to make the stay extra homey. Wendy is a kind, responsive and accomodating host and if we were in Sacramento again we would be quick to book a stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay. Very helpful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend staying in this apt while visiting the state fair. Location is good for downtown and CalExpo assuming you have your own vehicle. Parking out front and place easy to find. Photos completely accurate and if anything the place is larger. Everything very clean. And the décor – even if you don’t have particular nostalgia for the past it’d be hard not to be charmed by posters of glamour icons Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and of course Audrey Hepburn and such period pieces as glass Coca-Cola bottles,a Marilyn Monroe clock that doesn’t run, a blue Sac-Bee newspaper vending machine that looks like it might have been swiped off the street, and a vintage gas double oven (not working that weekend) w/ stovetop burners you start w/ butane lighter. The place cools down pretty well despite daytime outside temps >100 deg. The neighborhood is quiet and felt safe (don’t mind the small hobo camp a block away I never saw anyone). I would completely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we had a great stay at Wendy's place. There is plenty of street parking available and it's very close to a lot of great bars and restaurants. ubering around the area is cheap, only $7-$10 to get to a local restaurant with walkable entertainment everywhere. The house is really cute and clean and the bed was comfortable. Highly recommend"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very flexible and understanding host. Great place to stay with having a patient in the Kaiser hospital. Flexible check-ins, quiet neighbors, super comfy bed, was able to make it very cold in the unit! Would stay here again"

The description of the house and neighborhood were accurate. The home was cozy and had much more amenities than other places I have stayed. Wendy was very responsive and friendly.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very enjoyable and would use again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cute duplex unit on the edge of a great neighborhood. It is like a small home with everything one needs. There were a couple of issues but Wendy responded immediately and fixed them. She is an amazing host and is really concerned about her guests’ comfort. I so very much enjoyed being able to walk to midtown places such as Old Soul at Weatherstone cafe - about a 20 min walk. Also, it is two blocks from one of the best parks in Sacramento: McKinley Park. By the end of my three week stay, I was so well settled-in, I did not want to leave!"
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This vintage cottage was a memorable stay in Sacramento for me. With only two small steps, it was easy for me to get my luggage in & out. It was convenient for wedding events happening in mid-town and right down the street from McKinley Park."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice accommodations; true to the description, no frills.

Hoping this is resolved for the next guest's stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good price, location, and fun!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wendy’ place was great for 2 people. While trains pass nearby, the noise wasn’t intrusive. There is a huge city park just down the street, and lots of restaurants nearby. The place is just as shown, with a cute Hollywood/Marilyn Monroe/CocaCola decor scheme."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute spot! Pretty quiet area and everything is within a 10 or so minute drive. Host was super responsive and friendly. We will absolutely be booking this place again when we’re in the area!

The neighborhood is pleasant and an easy drive to many nice restaurants and to downtown Sacramento. It was a perfect place to stay."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy's place is so cute and the perfect stay. She very thoughtfully provides anything you may need for a shorter or longer term stay, i.e; oil, salt, pepper, seasonings, tea, coffee, laundry detergent, soap, hair dryer, toothpaste, body wash, shampoo, conditioner etc. This was so refreshing as I was at an airbnb in Scottsdale, Airizona the week prior, and there was literally nothing. The location is great for a longer term stay, because there is no 2 hr timed parking on the street in front of the place, where as it is timed just a few blocks up towards the park. East Sac is beautiful, and it was so nice to walk through the park and find a nice café for breakfast. It's also not too far from midtown and presents a better value than some of the airbnbs in midtown."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This Nifty Fifties unit is exactly as charming and delightful as the photos. The original tile work and 50s themed-decorative touches really do take you back to a different time. Otherwise, the accommodations are comfortable and the kitchen has most of the basics, although the stove was not working. And, if you are looking for a good shower, this one could use an upgrade. The neighborhood is quiet, parking is easy, and it’s convenient to McKinley Park. The host, Wendy, was responsive and helpful. All in all, it’s a very sweet place to stay for a visit to East Sacramento!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, the location is larger than it appears in the photos. There is plenty of room to stretch and relax, especially coming off a road trip like we were. The bed was nice and soft but firm in all the right places, and you'll absolutely fall in love with the decor! The kitchen provides a comfortable place to eat and prepare your morning coffee, and the living room just feels like home.
There is ample street parking in one of the friendliest neighborhoods I've ever encountered. The house is also only a couple of blocks from McKinley Park! Ducks! Geese! A rose garden! We really loved the experience, and Wendy really put great care into her home."

Yes, there is lots of parking, McKinley Park is a few blocks away and the Orphan was a great find--thanks for the tip, Joan April 2021!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I just cannot recommend this place highly enough. It was surprisingly spacious, delightfully decorated, super clean, and a great location. Wendy is a terrific hostess with great communication and very available. Check in instructions were clear and easy. When I couldn’t find the thermostat to lower the temperature, she not only responded in a way that helped me find it quickly, she had a great suggestion to open back windows (safe and quiet facing the courtyard) to get the delta breeze. The large kitchen had an electric kettle and plenty of tea. A pitcher of filtered water was in the refrigerator. Wi-fi worked well. Lighting was good. Parking was easy and free, though I rarely used my car. The neighborhood is quiet and comfortably walkable. McKinley park is nearby, and excellent restaurants are walking distance. The Orphan, a breakfast/lunch reasonably priced place with terrific food is a 7 minute walk (try the Zen breakfast!). I hope to stay here again on my next trip to Sacramento."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A true gem of a place - vintage touches, style, more than enough space, quiet, comfortable. As good of a value insofar as price point as I've ever found in Sacramento, I visit there often and have probably stayed in 10+ Airbnbs there.

I enjoyed my stay here and I would stay again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great bungalow! Perfect amount of space for us!

Easy to communicate with Wendy. I would have expected creamer and milk, and something more than sugared instant oatmeal, since breakfast is listed. We wanted to eat outside but no useable patio furniture, and I have suggested to Wendy it be made ready for future guests."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy did a wonderful job of describing her house. If you read the description, like what you’ve read & are planning on staying in midtown... you can’t go wrong! ... At least from my perspective."

We can recommend Ken's place to anyone. We had a great stay."

You also rarely ever see Ken. The one time he came upstairs he messaged me ahead of time and waited for my permission before he came in to do his business quickly. So really, it felt like I had the entire house to myself for 70$ a night. I really recommend this place to anyone."

2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ken was welcoming and friendly, and his home spacious and comfortable. The space was exactly as listed and more, and it made my trip both relaxing and enjoyable. His cat even came the first morning to lay on me while I was still in bed like I was staying with friends.
Because of Covid-19, the stay was an incredible value, but it would still be a value at double the price. It was meticulously cleaned, which was reassuring considering I'd prefer not to travel at this time, but had to. If you're in a similar situation, you can feel safe knowing the space is spotless."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,2nd stay here. Super clean. Quiet. Ken's cat has the softest fur ever. Another great stay. Plus it's only 2 blocks from my daughter's house. You definitely get more than you pay for within this price range. I do highly recommend and would stay again.

The bed is very soft and comfy, and the bathroom had little samples of shampoo and conditioner. We were able to use our Netflix acct on the big screen tv in the entertainment room so we were never bored. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet, and it's so close to downtown. We were able to get to the state capitol to site see in just a few minutes. Ken was an amazing host and very informative. Hopefully we have another chance to stay next year too."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to say. I felt so comfortable there. I hope it stays as private upstairs area. I truly enjoy my solitude. The kitty was so sweet and is older so don’t let her out and be super nice to her, it’s her house and loves attention. Ken communicated very well, but the app wouldn’t let me respond to his messages for some reason. I’d definitely stay again. I wanted to play the super nice pool table down stairs but did not want to overstep my boundaries as a guest. I give my stay 5 stars all day. Great neighborhood"

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, could go on forever about this spot, all of it positive; Ken is a great host, the space is huge, well appointed and spotless, and an amazing value. If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would 👍 will likely stay here for an extended stay while my gf and I look for a place together in Sacramento.
One thing to be mindful of, is that there is a very sweet, but elderly cat - she is a doll, and will cuddle up with you if you let her. Keep an eye out for her on the stairs, especially in the morning, when she is searching out sunspots to lay in."

Coffee tea sugar + creamer for my morning wake up.
A beautiful covered canopy patio to have breakfast with my cousin Alex. A mini fridge of sodas and water bottles
If you value a good night sleep, the cottage is tucked in the back and oh so quiet. I heard no road noises and slept extremely well
Will book this cottage again very soon

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sasha's studio and patio area were very welcoming. The complimentary water and soda were great. Although small, it didn't lack for anything and felt very private and comfortable."

No detail was left out here and it really made our stay even more enjoyable and effortless. Sasha communicated quickly and was very helpful. The outdoor seating and relaxing area is truly beautiful and calming. We loved this space and would recommend it and will be back again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A quiet place to stay in Mid Town. Highly Recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can not express enough how amazing this place it. Firstly the instructions to get in were clear and easy. The gate code and door code was easy to get in and access. Secondly the space looks exactly like the photo. It was set up so cute. They have little cute homey notes for you which I think was a nice personal touch. The outdoor space was amazing. It’s even set up with beverages in the outdoor fridge. The kitchen and bathroom had everything I needed for my stay. Lastly the location is perfect. I was able to walk around by myself and check out shops and restaurants. Would absolutely stay again!! I was impressed!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’d recommend this stay. The place was very clean
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was nice

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super nice spot! Great full kitchen. Comfy bed with nice linens. Patio is an excellent bonus space that makes the Airbnb a total gem. Really well done overall and we would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, comfortable space for a single guest or couple. Parking is challenging, no designated space, just street parking and you could potentially be forced to walk a couple blocks. But regardless, the neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and convenient."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sasha’s place was amazing! Super close to many restaurants and right around the corner from the freeway! My boyfriend and I spent a night here to celebrate and it was super peaceful and they had everything we needed! Sasha was a great host and we would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sasha's Airbnb was so cute and comfortable! It was perfect for our week stay in Sacramento.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely come back. Lots to do in the area and we felt right at home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sasha’s place was the perfect stay for my first time in Sacramento. Great restaurants close by and very responsive hosts. There's also a great court yard with water and a fire place. I wish the weather was better to enjoy the outdoor court yard. Highly recommend these host. Only weird thing was I was questioned about damaging some headboard that's made of wood. It is made of wood so sawdust should be normal and there's no reason for me to drill holes in the headboard. That actually left a bad taste in my mouth but I was very happy with my stay despite being questioned about the headboard damage.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would stay here again! Sasha and Dean were very nice and easy to communicate with. The AirBnb was comfortable, clean, and easily accessible. Overall a great experience, and I will definitely be staying here again when visiting Sacramento. Thank you, Sasha and Dean! :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful space! It was a great use of space and the patio next door was a huge plus for us. This is a perfect space for two people! It isn't the closest to some of the restaurants or the train but it's such a walkable neighborhood that it didn't really matter.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was very amazing, felt really safe and inviting"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice place to stay with my cousin for the night to eat snacks and watch Tv while we were in sac town.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Well suited my needs for a one night stay. Detailed instructions and quick responses.
Temperature inside the studio was a bit of a struggle (a bit humid and not enough heat) as well as the shower temperature was not easily controllable and fluctuated. Otherwise would recommend for a short term stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very relaxing getaway at Sasha’s. The studio was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I appreciated the little touches like the coffee and oatmeal provided that made it feel extra welcoming.
The only downside was that it was a little hard to find parking at night."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place, I would definitely stay at Sasha’s again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's great

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic, clean and lovely place. They are so communicative and helpful without being too in your face. Bed is a little on the softer side but I still slept well and there were plenty of pimples. Very cozy!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely recommend staying here it was easy to find they do provide a parking pass for the nights which was very kind. It was clean and lot of good restaurants and things to do less than 15 minutes away! Would totally come back.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sasha’s location was the perfect spot for us for one night! It had all of the comfortable amenities that we enjoy! The outdoor courtyard space would have been a great place to enjoy, if the weather had been nicer. We would definitely stay again if we are in the Sacramento area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I felt comfortable, relaxed, and cared for during our stay. Sasha thought of everything to make sure our needs were met, so we didn't have to contact her at all for anything. Everything about this place is well planned and organized, making it a truly private and enjoyable stay. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. It was cozy place. Sasha even let me know that I had left my car widows down.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described. We felt at home in the cozy guest house. Walking distance to coffee shops, etc. we loved our stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sasha's place is a great home base when spending time in Sacramento. It's right where you want to be in midtown, but still quiet, and also central if you want to visit other parts of the city. Finding street parking wasn't a problem, although you don't need to drive if you just want to pop over to the co-op for some light provisions. I wish I visited in the spring or summer instead of the winter so I could make better use of the really well done outdoor patio."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with Sasha’s space. The posting describes the space accurately, and Sasha & Darren are very hospitable and responsive!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was very pleasant and peaceful. You have privacy as well as the benefit of a quiet and clean neighborhood. You also get a parking pass so you don’t have to walk blocks to get there. You are central to many different places to eat/visit and the guide left by the hosts is extremely helpful!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sweet spot for a quick turn-around trip. If in Sac, we will book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this comfy, cozy studio. The patio is lovely and roomy for tai chi and hanging out in sun and shade. Sasha was very responsive to our questions and needs. Nice neighborhood for walking."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent spot in Sacramento, easy to access, lovely backyard space, comfortable and quiet."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying here, the unit was suuuper clean and everything was very well thought out. The instructions for self check-in were easy to follow. And the backyard was SO cute, I wish I could’ve stayed longer to enjoy it. The Natural Foods Co-Op was walking distance and had great breakfast and coffee. The light rail was also very close so if you need to commute into or out of the downtown it was very convenient, although the neighborhood was beautiful and very walkable. Did I mention it was super clean? Would highly recommend staying here, I was bummed to leave."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little spot for a quick getaway. Thank you

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyable cozy space. We only stayed overnight so we didn't get to stay too long. We enjoyed walking over in the morning to the nearby coffee place.
Street parking was simple and easy for us"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place ! Had a great time and the hosts were great and accommodating. I will definitely stay again
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an adorable restful place to stay for the night. Sasha is a wonderful communicator and was so fast in letting me know my reservation was accepted. The studio was snug and very comfortable- and I slept like a log. My daughter lives in Sacramento so I will be back!
PS The Halloween house decorations were so fun! Good job Sasha!🦇"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely return when I need a place to stay in the Sacramento area. I slept so well and really enjoyed the space while I was there. Thank you for thinking of everything a guest could possibly need! 😊
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sasha was amazing and so was her studio! Everything was in pristine condition. Don’t even get me started on the bed, holy crap it was the most comfortable bed EVER. The TV remote was missing and I couldn’t find it and Sasha went out of her way to order a new one on Amazon & brought it to me a few hours later! Thank you!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was perfect for an overnight stay to watch the Sacramento Kings game! It is located in Midtown Sacramento which made it very short drive to go to Golden 1 Center. Neighborhood was overall very quiet, the space itself was very clean and had the basic necessities, and it had a great backyard space to use. Only con would be parking - it is street parking and we needed to park around the block at night after watching the game. During the day, there was no issues with finding a parking spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Sacramento. Light the beam!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Sasha has thought of EVERYTHING. I don't think I have ever been in such a well stocked Airbnb. Outdoor area is charming, bed super comfy and place is sparkling clean with lots of treats- tea, bubbly water, basic kitchen supplies. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a short relaxing stay. Sasha was kind, was very prompt with her responses and very accommodating. Definitely recommended!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I personally really enjoyed my stay here! It was super easy to get in and the location was perfect to hang out around downtown. Everything was very clean and there was clear directions for everything. I will be absolutely booking again !

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sasha's place was super cute. It was comfortable and had everything we needed for an overnight visit to Sac. The outdoor space was lovely and we would have spent more time there if we didn't have dinner reservations and show plans. The studio was spotless and just the right size.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice apartment and beautiful outdoor space. The place was quiet clean and had everything you might need for your stay.
The neighborhood is fairly quiet but you can hear the hum of the freeway, not super loud or anything but just a note in case that impacts you. We slept great and super appreciated that we had access to the lovely patio and the drink fridge was a bonus surprise!
I also liked that the check in and out was very simple and smooth. Would definitely recommend 😊"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience staying at this cozy and wonderful place. The location is walkable and close to public transportation and within an easy reach for Uber/Lyft etc. The outdoor space is really nice for hanging out and relaxing between outings. Wi-Fi is fast if you need to work remotely. We would be happy to come back anytime!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sasha and Darren were excellent, gracious hosts! Their patio is like an oasis in the city, and the studio was the perfect size for two of us. It’s walkable to a lot of great restaurants too. They’re very thoughtful hosts with lots of extra details and amenities to ensure a comfortable stay. We ran into them in the backyard and they were very nice and chatted with us about the area, gave recommendations, and answered all of our questions. Would absolutely recommend this place and would stay here again!"

Highly recommend this place"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A charming and immaculately clean studio that was infinitely better than a hotel room. One of the best AirBnBs we've stayed at over the years. The host Sasha was very proactive and helpful in all her communication. We'll be back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow wow wow! I loooved staying here. I usually stay in hotels for work but lately they have felt so sterile and boring. Decided to try this air bnb. Loved the location so close to great restaurants and coffee shops. Parking was so easy and they provided a pass. The studio was soooo cute so many thoughtful details. I really enjoyed sitting in the back yard in the mornings to have coffee and do some work. Bed was so comfy and the studio was SPOTLESS felt like I was the first to stay 🥰. Will definitely stay here again ❤️
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an Airbnb that truly had everything you could think of as well as things you didn’t know you needed! It was a lovely space that had all amenities of home.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice & cozy, you felt at home. The area is also very beautiful, and you are quickly in the center.
The bed and pillows were too soft for us but that's a matter of taste :)
The hosts are very personable & helpful.
I can recommend this accommodation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the space, very nice and very clean! Great patio to hang out at and bed is super comfy! Sasha was great at quickly replying to messages and made everything go very smooth! Would 100% stay there again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The studio was very comfortable and homey. The host was very responsive when i asked questions. The studio was also very clean and well taken care of. I felt very secure with the front gate having a code to even get onto the property. Would definitely recommend or stay there again !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anything I could write about Sasha and Darren's studio could not do justice to the thought and care they have put into being excellent hosts! This is by far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. It was private, comfortable, and centrally located for my work function. I appreciated every detail they put into their pristine property and would recommend it without hesitation.
I needed nothing from them. Their instructions were clear. it was perfect!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great, but the amenities and unit were even greater. Hosts were communicative and helpful. Nice shared courtyard and great taste with design. Truly felt like I was at home without being there. Thank you for hosting and I will gladly rent this unit again if available!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Newton Booth Studio is a treasure! Sasha and Darren have created a spa-like retreat which provides all the soothing comforts you need to make your stay there an absolute pleasure! They are extremely responsive to any questions you may have as well, but likely you will not have many because they have provided clear instructions to make the studio easy to enjoy! I needed a little extra rest during my stay, so I spent the entire day lounging at the studio... like a vacation within my vacation. I could go on and on... but I'll end by saying that my time in Sacramento was greatly enhanced by choosing to stay here. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As a native Sacramentan, I am always delighted to find out about all the cool spots around my hometown. Discovering such a fine place to stay at Sasha & Darren's was a wonderful example!
The photos on the AirBnB site really don't do the studio (and excellent courtyard) justice. As soon as I pulled up to the house it was evident that much creative and architectural planning had gone into upgrading the location. After a very easy entry, it was a pleasure to take it all in. I instantly felt like I had my own secret hideaway!
The studio itself is good for one or two folks. It is nice to see all the special touches that have been taken...the combination of efficiency and charm are well done. The bed & pillows were super comfy, the kitchen well appointed and the bath & shower was immaculate. Outside? Well, the custom gazebo area will do the trick for anyone seeking a special spot to sit back and relax!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Sasha's studio. It's reasonably walkable to a nice evening scene and it's very quiet. The studio itself is clean and fuctional.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sasha and Darren's place was perfect for my needs. One of the cleaner, more accommodating Airbnbs I've been a guest at. Everything worked well and Sasha and Darren are friendly, outgoing hosts. I felt safe my entire stay and the outdoor space really made it feel homey and welcoming. Many great restaurants, bars and grocery stores are either walking distance or a short drive away. It's a studio, so it's on the smaller side if you plan on working out of it all day, every day. But if you need a place to cook, sleep and relax I can't recommend it enough."

Super comfy!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is great- everything you need in the studio and a wonderful outdoor space. Hosts were responsive and friendly. The one caveat for me was the bed- it was unbelievably soft. So soft that I sank into it and found myself very hot sunk down into a memory foam. If you like soft beds this is for you. If like a medium or more firm bed, this is not your spot."

The cleanliness made the stay so much more comfortable and the studio was also just a perfect space for 2 people.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private and intimate space. It has everything listed and a well-stocked kitchen and coffee bar. The space is smartly organized, but smaller than it appeared in the pictures. Sasha was a wonderful host. She gave me a call when a storm hit Sac and electricity went out in some neighborhoods. We did not lose power but really appreciate her call!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our short but sweet stay. Your back patio is absolutely gorgeous! Your directions were very thorough.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The main house was super cute as well as the AirBnb. The room was clean and cozy, provided a coffee station and A/C. Just be careful walking into the bathroom! My partner and I both stubbed our toes but only because we forgot to read the sign. The bathroom was spacious and provided plenty of space to put your stuff. I didn't get a change to enjoy the patio but when I walked out there briefly, it had a very nice ambiance. Would definitely recommend staying here for a weekend trip or even an extended stay."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Super cute place! They had everything I could possibly need. I especially loved the little place to hang clothes and that there were ice trays in the freezer. I was a little worried about parking but didn’t have any issues with the provided pass. I met the hosts while there and they were very friendly. I also used the outdoor space most days and it was nice and comfy. I would definitely stay here again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I underestimated how roomy the place would feel and how lovely the neighborhood was, as I was there for a specific purpose. It was a lovely surprise!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, for the price and need - it's everything you should expect. I neglected to ask my friends about their cat allergies and it was an issue for my guests, but that isn't the host's fault. They ad says you shouldn't book if people have cat allergies. You definitely can't get away with it if they do. Also, there were 2 keys but 3 rooms. I had 3 individual people come up for a conference so it would have been better to have a keypad, 3 keys, or some way they can act independently. Other than that, all good."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with everything you’d need and lots to do within walking distance. Very friendly hosts. Great communication. 5 stars
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Jen/Jim's house in midtown Sacramento. The Victorian home was comfortable, had many extras, and has lots of character. Jen/Jen were friendly and responsive and made the process effortless. The location was ideal - a great neighborhood, walkable, and near restaurants and downtown. I would stay here on future travel."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We completely enjoyed our stay in this beautiful period home.
All of the amenities provided were as described. Very comfortable, quiet and private. The hosts were gracious, attentive and provided many local recommendations with up to date current events. Would definitely book again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Jim made this stay incredible by hosting us. I was in town to advocate with my local representatives and this place felt like home. The cats around the home are the highlight of the entire trip. They are friendly and kind and made me feel safe and at welcomed.
The building is old so you will be hearing some creeks and squeaks, but truly a charming home. There's lots of stairs so keep that in mind when packing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Jen have a created a great Airbnb in midtown. The location is central and walkable to many fun shops and restaurants. I love the 2 story. The downstairs has a spacious and super comfortable living room, dining room, and kitchen with plenty of seating. The upstairs has the 3 good sized bedrooms and full bath. Downstairs is the half bath which is a few steps from the kitchen, which ended up being very useful for our group of 4. The 1904 home is restored with much attention to retaining the phenomenal charm of that era. Well done!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jen/Jim’s Airbnb was a wonderful experience for our 4 day stay in Sacramento. Great location. Charming house and patio. Our hosts were very helpful and accommodating. We would definitely book another stay on our next trip to Sac. Did I mention that Jen/Jim were awesome?
Thank you!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was delightful, I really appreciated how Jen and Jim had heaters available in every room. Just shows how considerate they are of guests during colder days. Lots of towels, lamps, and essentially anything you could ever need during a stay. The home had a fun, cozy, unique layout."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From check-in to check-out, staying at Jen and Jim's place was exceptional. We were warmly greeted and felt comfortable asking for suggestions from restaurants to the best way to get to various locations. We brought bikes and were able to keep them in the garage which was an added bonus as well as having parking. The apartment is spacious and well equipped. We ended up eating out and would consider doing more meals at the place on our next visit based on the well-equipped kitchen. This would be a great place for families or friends as it has three bedrooms.Definitely a stand out Airbnb and I have stayed at multiple airbnbs across the world and since airbnbs started."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Century located, great location peaceful neighborhood. Great hosts!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home with exceptional hosts. We can’t wait to return for another stay in the future!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very big home within easy walking distance to Midtown food and activities. The home is turn of the century with an updated kitchen. Main bathroom worked great for a couple but might be a bit small for a whole family. Jim and Jen were easy to coordinate with and flexible. They texted to check in and provide some daily tips on local events and places to visit. Overall excellent value and we had a great weekend.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim is a really great host! We enjoy how close was his place from our conference.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As long as there’s availability here, I’ll never stay in a hotel in Sacramento again. Loved it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place. My new #1 choice for business or personal stays in Sacramento.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jen and Jim were great hosts! Their love of Sacramento, historical and current, was abundant and made the house feel special. Thank you for sharing your home with us.
Maureen"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim & Jen are some of the best hosts I have stayed with. They are right next door so therefore available, but very respectful of their guests privacy. Also very flexible with check in/out"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great city!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying at Jen/Jim’s place. Jim was super friendly and gave us some good recommendations. We were able to walk to pretty much everything we wanted to do, and we felt right at home in this spacious property."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is spacious and Jim and Jen take care of lots of little details so it feels homey. It’s two levels, upstairs are the bedrooms and downstairs the LR, DR and kitchen. The kitchen is big. We liked that its a historic apartment with high ceilings. We went because we were going to a show at the Crest, which is a really cool venue, also historic. We thought we would walk to the Crest which is doable, but decided to drive due to the weather and we ended up just not feeling comfortable walking.
We rented the apartment with another couple. There are three bedrooms, the nicest is the one with the king bed. There is also a room with the queen bed, which was fine too. And in the middle of these two bedrooms is a room with a double bed, which seems like it would be perfect for a kid or something. If we ever need to go back to Sacremento we would reserve this place again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly exceeded expectations. Jim and Jen were great communicators and I ran into Jim on the back porch one day, very personable. We didn't need anything but I have no doubt Jim and Jen would have helped out. The house was beautiful, super interesting and comfortable. I came to Sacramento with a team of colleagues for a conference and being able to stay at this incredible Victorian was perfect - we had enough space to be able to wind down at the end of the day as well as the shared space to get some work done as well. And bonus was we were able to easily walk back and forth for conference events and activities (around the convention center and Capitol) so we didn't have to pay for parking! So glad to have the opportunity to stay here and would highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying in this little piece of history in the heart of Sacramento. It has all the charm of its 1904 roots—including the half bath that’s hidden on the porch—and has clearly been well-maintained and upgraded where necessary.
Jen/Jim were great hosts with excellent communication. From a well-equipped kitchen to heaters in every room, they really are one step ahead of their guests needs. An entire rack of towels was amazing to see as I’ve stayed in far too many places with only enough for one towel per guest!
They were also exceptionally accommodating! While I’m sure it’s not possible for every stay, they helped coordinate an early check-in and even offered a late checkout since the place wasn’t booked. I’m always sheepish to ask for these things, but we loved how proactive they were in helping us get the most out of our visit!
Location was great too. The house is on a mostly quiet street about a 10 min walk to some pretty great bars and restaurants."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and assigned parking spot were my reasons for booking this place. I also appreciated that the hosts were flexible about check in and check out. The place is very spacious with a renovated kitchen.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we've stayed here. It is a lovely old Victorian, and there is plenty of space across the two floors."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Jen and Jim’s. It was very spacious and comfortable. The beds are great, it has a well equipped kitchen, is in a safe neighborhood, is walkable to the Capital area and we felt at home. We met Jim and he was friendly. We also enjoyed listening to a couple of neighbors play the porch piano during our stay. We would happily stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very hospitable. Accommodation was very nice in every respect. Comfortable beds. Good location.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s my third time staying at this property and will continue to do so when visiting Sacramento. It’s close to everything.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great house. This house is located in mid town Sacramento and you can walk to many great restaurants. The house is cozy, with a wonderful kitchen. We could not have asked for anything more. When back in Sacramento we hope to stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jen and Jim were very responsive and flexible. They accommodated our parking needs and responded quickly to questions. I had a lot of unexpected changes to my plans and they were very flexible and worked with me. The house is so cute. Very clean and great neighborhood. Very close to excellent restaurants.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was short, but we will be back next time we are in town! Jen/Jim are great hosts and very communicative. The beautiful victorian home was so charming. Jen/Jim were very smart to keep the vibe wherever possible, while still providing modern comforts. The home is very roomy /clean. J/J provided some literature on local things to do /see.
I like to leave reviews with 3 pros and 3 cons about the property. I really don't have any 'cons' for this property ... just maybe 3 things you should know. Having said that:
Pros: 1) Great location close to everything, some walkable, a must stay if you're going to Old Sacramento 2) The linens and towels were freshly laundered and smelled amazing 3) Check out was effortless. The simple instructions were written out for us and the process was convenient.
Should know: 1) Not for light sleepers (I'm not) but the sounds from the creaking doors and such may be a problem for some 2) bring your own coffee supplies 3) the driveway was a little tight."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Our group was in Sacramento for a conference. Very convenient location. Jim went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. Extra effort made to fit our long pickup in their driveway. Home was well equipped & comfortable. Kitchen was especially nice with quality appliances. Would definitely stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"stayed at Jen/Jim's for CIM race weekend. perfect location, closet to the capital and convention center, and located in a beautiful neighborhood.

hope to stay (and run) again in future years!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Jim were great hosts. They were very accommodating, made check in super easy and while they live next door, the apartment felt totally private. The home itself is larger than it looks in the photos which was great for working from home while the other was cooking / watching tv etc. The location is also highly walkable to restaurants, grocery stores etc which was very convenient."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a perfect location for us, with an easy walk to the Convention Center. All the Victorian charm with new amenities. Jen and Jim are super nice. Beds were comfortable, and everything was super clean. We hope to stay again."

There was a small back garden that was a pleasure, and the house itself had lots of rooms. I am not able to climb stairs without a banister, and all the stairs have banisters for anybody else who might care about such things. The place is a short drive from the museums in town and walking distance or a short drive to good restaurants."

It’s like a vision board brought to life. Very walkable to everything you want in Sacramento, in a neighborhood that is somehow both peaceful and vibrant. Super clean and so elegantly updated. Hosts very responsive and friendly. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice to have the parking spot in the driveway. The house was comfortable and good for our stay and the cats outside were cute. Do note that it is a house split into two units- the air b and b on one side and the hosts live on the other side. You share the back deck and the backyard with the hosts and their adorable kitties."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, walkable location for doing anything in downtown Sacramento (State Capitol, Golden One Center), yet felt quiet and private. The backyard was a shady oasis on a hot day. The kitchen was spacious and well equipped. Architectural details were beautifully restored. Furnishing and decor was minimal but everything was comfortable. Hosts' cats were wandering around the back porch and back yard, which for us was a plus. Be clear that all the bedrooms and the full bath are up a tall staircase (in addition to front porch stairs), so if stairs are a problem this is not for you."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So grateful we found Jen and Jim’s place. Beautiful, charming and authentic historic home. Very clean and thoughtful touches added. Wonderful neighborhood, and surrounding tree lined streets with many options for food and entertainment Jen and Jim are friendly and welcoming.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sure the floorboards creak and the house is old and quirky, but this home is just stunning. The charm makes you feel like you’re back in its heyday. The location is absolute prime. We are Sacramento natives and it was lovely to stay in midtown and walk the kids to the restaurants and shops.
The pianist next door is so truly talented and made the whole experience even better.
The hosts are so nice and helpful and go the extra mile. We checked into a warmed up home. Waiting for us to just melt into on a cold day. It was truly amazing. All of it. Would definitely stay again."

The house is totally as described and pictured. It is very spacious yet retains a very cozy feel.
The little touches were my favorite - from having luggage caddies in each bedroom to nightlights strategically placed all over the house to a different scented Method foaming soap (my fave, by the way) dispenser at every sink, I would absolutely stay here again.

cons: upon checking in, one bedroom smelled awful. the host refunded me the cleaning fee and indicated it was the window ac unit and cleaned it but after turning it on, it still had an awful smell. the bed also in the second bedroom had a faulty frame and would cave in upon sleeping on it."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay over the week between Christmas and New Years. The house is well located. We were able to walk to and from Golden One Center for a Kings game then go out in midtown on New Years Eve. All without driving or having to take an uber. Jim and Jen were very welcoming, everything was easy, and the house is as advertised. King bed and queen beds were both comfortable. Would stay again."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is phenomenal. The owners were very communicative and helpful. The location of this house could not be better. Everything in downtown Sacramento is accessible on foot.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this house! Charming with lovely decor and modern conveniences.
The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful.
We had a nine month old and appreciated the high chair and pack n play."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One word: enchanting! This property is absolutely gorgeous, and transforms you to the 1800s, but with all the creature comforts of 2021! Jen/Jim are also fabulous hosts - accommodating, clean, responsive. I can't say enough about our experience, except to say that we will be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and host!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a nice play to stay near the capitol then you probably don't need to look further. My wife and I had a very nice stay. The house was very clean, and everything worked perfectly for us. We like to cook meals where we stay because it usually makes for a more relaxed day. The kitchen in the home has a topflight stove. When we got home I was still missing that range! The neighborhood was beautiful. The tree lined streets were gorgeous as the leaves were turning for the fall season. I know you won't regret staying here."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, outstanding communication—highly recommend!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great place to stay. Our family was there for the weekend and we had a blast. Great combination of old time feel with modern upgrades where needed. Highly recommend. Thanks again Jen and Jim.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jen & Jim's house is perfect from all perspectives. Its located very close to good restaurants and hang-out places in Midtown Sacramento. The house has a lot of character and is wonderfully stacked. We didnt use the kitchen much, but it has all the high end appliances and cutlery that makes you feel very good about the place. All the bedrooms are well furnished and have very comfortable beds.
Finally, Jen and Jim are super responsive and extremely helpful. We got into an issue (that we created ourselves) which they resolved very quickly so we could get back to enjoying our vacation. Kudos to both of them!!!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely house - AC in the bedrooms keeps you cool at night. Comfortable beds - we slept great - and fully stocked kitchen. Easy walk to everything you want to access, including the train station."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This beautifully restored, historic home is a gem. Jim and Jen were wonderful hosts. They suggested a few local area places to visit and we really appreciated this. They pay attention to the small details in the home that really make a big difference. This home was spotless, clean, cozy and comfortable. It is in an ideal location with many restaurants and stores in walking distance and it felt safe to walk in the evening. We took advantage of the secluded patio in the back , the lovely sitting area on the back porch. and also enjoyed sitting in the sun on the front stoop. We loved the company of the friendly cats too. This definitely felt like our home away from home."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jen and Jim were very welcoming and responsive hosts. They made our stay very enjoyable. We are a family with a toddler.
Very central location. Walkable to restaurants, stores, etc. Very walkable as is the case with the mid-town neighborhood. Jen and Jim had menus of nearby restaurants, magazines, and even a photo of the property from the early 1900s.
The property itself has a lot of character and history. Lots of windows, natural lighting, and A/C units throughout the house. There is a half bathroom downstairs and a full bathroom upstairs. The bedrooms were spacious and all came with closets. Beds were comfortable. Kitchen was also very spacious and well-stocked. Living room was spacious, a table big enough to fit 5-6 people comfortably. Washer and dryer are in the garage and very easy to use. Didn’t use the patio or backyard but it seemed great too. Cable and internet worked great. Jen and Jim even had a charging station in the living room. There was one parking spot on their driveway. Not a big driveway, but fit my mid-size SUV just fine. Street parking is hit or miss. Usually not a problem until the evening when people return home. There are parking restrictions unless you had a residential permits but those restrictions weren’t being enforced because of the pandemic.
Overall, I would highly recommend. I would certainly return to Jen and Jim’s home when we return to Sacramento."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely property, great location in town with a very private back yard. Check in and out was really easy and our hosts were very pleasant to work with.
The house was really stocked with supplies and the parking spot was a big plus in that area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jen & Jim’s house was absolutely beautiful! They managed to find the sweet spot between modern touches and historic charm. The stay is exactly as described; you won’t be disappointed :) Looking forward to returning!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The three of us really enjoyed our stay at Jen & Jim's place. The location is perfect; next to great restaurants, bars, light rail, and the capitol park. Parking in the driveway was super convenient. The house itself is a classic Victorian with lots of charming details. In a week where temperatures were over 100F, the house stayed comfortable all day and night. The wifi was solid; my wife and I were both able to take work videos calls and there were an array of streaming options on TV. It's the perfect place for your quiet vacation or work trip!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Victorian house in midtown is the perfect place to stay while in Sacramento. Three very nice bedrooms with a beautiful kitchen and living area. A very walkable neighborhood and the hosts are very accommodating. Would absolutely stay here again.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10. I loved staying here. One of the coolest air bnbs I have ever stayed in. I loved the designs of the house and the accomodations they provided where super helpful, basically didn't have to Google anything just used th information they provided to plan my entire stay in Sac. The location was about a 20 minutes walking distance to everything you need, food, bars grocery store etc. will definitely be staying there again"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very nice space for our family to hangout in between excursions. The original charm shined through and we had everything we needed to be comfortable. There were more stairs then we expected but it was nice to have the separation between the bedrooms and the rest of the house.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was fantastically charming. Jen & Jim were so nice and had great communication. I couldn’t recommend a better place and will definitely stay again. I will mention that this house may not work for someone with mobility issues because of the stairs to the entrance and up to the bedrooms and shower/tub. If that’s not an issue for you, definitely stay here!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My experience staying at Jen/Jim Airbnb was phenomenal. I admired their attention detail by leavimg brochures and business cards for local businesses, what a great touch. I also appreciate their consistent, professional, and responsive communication. The rental was spotless and the check-in was a smooth process. The place was also beautiful and the backyard is a great place to relax in. Without a doubt, I would come back and stay at this Airbnb."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home does not disappoint. Location, character, size, and great hosts. We will definitely stay here again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is a very cute. Built around 1904 and appears to have the original character.
There is a half-bathroom just outside off the back porch. Originally, it was odd to see it, but with the window facing the tree… it was oddly peaceful.
The kitchen is beautifully updated with a stove perfect for cooking…
The backyard has a table that is cool to sit and chill.
The location is perfect for Midtown Sacramento. Walking distance to the Capitol & Convention Center, restaurants, and bars. The motor scooters were fun and we rode them to Downtown Sac.
Finally, Jen & Jim were very polite and easily approachable. They always responded quickly and were very easy to work with.
Great weekend with my family and a good stay! It was a great value for the price! I would visit again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Denver's guesthouse offered a comfortable and quiet stay, perfect for a weekend getaway. I loved being within walking distance of local breweries, restaurants, and Land Park. The reasonable cost, private space, and amenities made it a great value."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Denver's place was super easy to find and access. Parking was conveniently available on the street right outside. The inside looks exactly like the photos and with all the amenities. I saw that previous visitors have conveniently left food in the cupboards, so just in case you needed SPAM or ramen, you might be in luck! 😅 I truly could not have asked for a better place to stay while traveling for a couple days for work. I'd definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a great place you stay

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It is comfortable for one; would be pretty tight for two for a long stay. A/C works, which is probably the most important thing. Parking is on the street, but there is usually space right in front of the house. The refrigerator is noisy. It's hard to get away from that in a such small space."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Denver's for 3 months and it went great. He is very responsive and has always answered our questions. There are many great books in the property, sorry I don't speak English well. The cabin is very comfortable, everything is well thought out. There is a grocery store nearby. You can walk to a big park. Highly recommended, you won't regret it"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely studio, exactly as listed! Host Denver was extremely responsive and accommodating! Comfortable cozy and exactly what I needed for my extended stay in Sac. Ca! Nice touch with the various streaming TV/Movies options! Excellent WiFi for my remote work and so many other useful amenities that I greatly appreciated! I will definitely be back!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio apt. was the perfect place for us for a six night stay in Sacramento. The studio is clean, safe & easy to access. The bed is VERY comfortable, great shower, nice kitchen w/ all the real necessities. It really was just perfect for us and will connect w/ Denver & Allie for our next visit to SAC. Thanks so much for sharing you place w/ us."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a comfortable and Relaxing stay. It is in a quiet neighborhood felt very safe. I would definitely stay here again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable! I definitely recommend! My only complaint is that the refrigerator was pretty loud
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple place with a comfortable bed. It was ok and equipped enough but there were areas to be improved which I sent Denver in a side note.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable, perfect for our needs. Denver is an attentive and organized host. Would definitely stay again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! If you're going to Sacramento, I would highly recommend this location. I went there to attend the a concert with my wife and it was perfect for us. It's a 15 min or less ride to any of the main attractions in Sacramento. The surrounding area is getting a facelift with cool new spots to eat and drink. Along with some of the staples you would be familiar with. The place was super clean, nicely furnished and it felt comfortable. Check-in/ Check-out was super easy. I would stay there again without hesitation."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cute and clean! Loved it!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here. Great communication from host, was very flexible, friendly and helpful. The space is really well decorated with plenty of books, art work and lights. There is great attention to detail for creating a comfortable space to rest your head and also to lounge around. It is a studio but remains spacious, tons of windows and also blackout curtains to sleep in if needed. Full kitchen is a nice plus, great ventilation with a house fan along with a super cold A/C that cools the space down really fast. I’ll be staying here when I’m in Sac next. Very down to earth people and the vibes in the space reflect it."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A very cute little home well worth the price.
,,,"I would first like to state that the communication for this Airbnb was quick and efficient between each host. The design of the Tiny Home is also nice. As far as cons go, we have a few. For starters, and probably what was the most concerning was the bug issue. The shower was covered in live bugs and along the trim around the baseboards in the bathroom. We weren't able to shower because of this and even found them crawling in the bed on the pillows the following morning. Had we seen this the night before, we wouldn't have stayed. We did reach out to the host after leaving and advised of the issue for future quests. We were offered a complimentary stay, but if I am being honest, that's not something we would want to risk going back into. Another con would be the location of the Airbnb. It is not on the best side of town & the police presence during our stay was active on the street. Hoping future guests have a warmer welcome and hopefully avoid the bugs at the very least."
,,,"Kicked me and my son out early on New Year's Day didn't specify why didn't communicate with me treated us poorly very stressful and left a bad feeling in me. I did nothing wrong, I abided by house rules, I am clean, respectful, polite as well as my son. Very inappropriate to treat people in this manner shouldn't be hosting your home if you don't like people."
