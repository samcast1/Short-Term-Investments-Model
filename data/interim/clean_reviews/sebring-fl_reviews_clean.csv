2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was well worth the money. The place and grounds were better than I expected with the dock to sit at and reflect watch the sunset. The house was spacious beautiful the added amenities that they had if anyone forgot something they had it there for you. I would rent this place again when I'm in town. I would give this a 5 star.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time at Traci's home was strictly for relaxation and it was perfect. No noisy neighbors. The dock and boat house were perfect for morning coffee, afternoon naps, evening cocktails and overall enjoyment of being on water. Traci has two very nice kayaks which we used each day. We brought our bikes because there is a large park nearby with a nice bike path.
We aren't much for nightlife or going out to eat so can't comment on that.
Traci's home was probably one of the cleanest Airbnb's I have ever stayed in. Comfortable furniture and great mattress. Everything you could want in the kitchen. We were about 2 hours early for check-in and it was not a problem. We brought our own chairs (the antigravity kind) for the dock. Traci has furniture on the dock but it is wrought iron furniture which makes perfect sense because it stays outside.
I really have nothing negative to say at all.
Thank you Traci"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very near the golf course we were playing . The Florida Elks Club annual tournament. Reasonably priced. Would definitely stay there again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Traci's place in Sebring. It's super clean space with room for the whole family. We'll be back again next year.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Stayed for a couple of days before a cruise. Loved the house. Loaded with anything that we needed. Very clean and spacious. Check in was extremely easy. Loved the lake and lake house. We were wishing that we had come earlier than we did. We will stay again. Thank you for sharing Traci!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home was immaculate and gorgeous. We loved the luxury linens and towels, and all of the extras Traci had. A fully stocked coffee bar was perfect! We highly recommend this beautiful home. The house, screened porch, and dock are all you need to relax and enjoy sunny Florida!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We’ve been coming to Florida for about 5 years now via AirBnB and Traci’s place was one of the best. It exceeded all our expectations. It was very clean, all the amenities were in place, it felt like home. Traci went above and beyond to take care of all our needs. We had a main city water line break on the block about 8 o’clock at night. I called Traci and she took action to make sure it was resolved. Water was back on in less than an hour. She even gave me a refund for the trouble. The house is lovely, and the view of the lake spectacular."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean! There were plenty of towels and eBay thing you would need. They thought of everything. We only stayed 3 nights but loved the lake and dock.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lakefront view is really gorgeous. Even on a cloudy day, the misty lake was great to look at. When the sun came out, it was stunning. The place is close to the city center, yet peaceful. Way better than any of the hotels I have stayed at for visiting Sebring. A 5 star place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was super organized and comfortable. Amazing location and hospitality from the hosts. We felt like we were home!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 3rd year staying at Manatee Manor! As always, our stay was great! The house is always clean and has everything you could possibly need! New addition this year was the easy entry using the lock code. Great stay and great place!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a wonderful stay on the lake. It was the perfect place for a lovely visit with my parents. The kitchen was the best equipped of any kitchen we have ever rented. And the views from every room to the blue blue lake was amazing.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,My family is extremely pleased with our stay at Manatee Manor. My grandkids loved fishing off the dock. They caught bass. The kitchen has everything to prepare meals. Traci was fast to respond to a minor issue and accommodated me for the minor inconvenience. We recommend this home for your stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely comfortable, peaceful and beautiful place to stay when visiting the Sebring area! The screened patio facing the lake provides a perfect place to begin and end each day, regardless of the weather."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house sits in a quiet area with an amazing lake view that you can also walk out to , the home is beautiful and spacious We enjoyed staying at this home very much very organized and clean pace is great also everything you need in a kitchen We definitely recommend this home"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Manatee Manor was exactly what we were looking for! There was lots of room for our family vacation. The house had everything that we needed which helped immensely since we drove from WI. The only downside was that we wish we could have spent more time at the house but the main purpose of the trip was to spend time at SIR. So easy to drop off people in the morning and go back with the kids in the afternoon. Would recommend and return in a heartbeat!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay here. It won’t be our last. Exactly as described and very comfortable. Thank you. We hope to be back in the fall.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house. Very clean and comfortable. Traci is a friendly and responsive host. Will definitely stay at this house again:)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Traci's home is lovely. We spend a lot of time fishing off the dock. Traci left a lot of information on near by places to visit. It was a pleasure to return after a day out, to relax and enjoy this very nice, comfortable home. Hope to visit again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying in Sebring Fl
The house was great very clean and host was available when we had questions.
We fished from the dock and caught bass,catfish & gar!!!
We had so much planned during our stay but honestly the next stay we are planning more time at the house just relaxing on the screen porch!!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful home! Beautiful location, everything you could need already there, super cute house, convenient to everything! Our host was exceptional with any questions. I can't recommend staying here enough."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place and very clean. Very enjoyable to sit in the back patio for morning coffee or on the dock. Very convenient to where we needed to be. Hope to be back again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time staying at Manatee Manor and we had another great stay. Traci has given a lot of thought to the comfort of her guests - the kitchen has everything you need to cook, the towels are thick and fluffy, you can grill, do your laundry, play board games, watch tv, get online... The check-in and check out are quick and easy. I highly recommend staying at Manatee Manor!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic time staying on the lake!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Manatee Manor is a lovely vacation home. I had three criteria in my search for a rental for the long Thanksgiving weekend: on the water or a water view; a screened lanai or patio for reading and quiet time; and plenty of video entertainment for my husband. This house has them all with unexpected bonuses - a very well-equipped kitchen, and super-comfortable couch and chairs for reading with plenty of lighting. At this time of year both the sunrise and sunset over the water are visible from the lanai. The house feels very private and quiet but is only a short drive to Sebring’s downtown and Route 27 with its shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. A five-star stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing house, so peaceful, so many personal touches. My family loved it here and we will return. Truly amazing."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was really nice. The view on the lake is very peaceful. Having the kayaks to go one the lake is a lot of fun.
The dock is really nice to stay on.
The house is fully equipped with a nice kitchen and bbq.
The sofa are soft and they have small blankets just in case …
I really loved the thick and soft towels
Do not hesitate to book"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traci’s place was absolutely perfect! Everything was immaculate and thought through. We had enough plates and serving dishes to make and have meals at home - and the cooking spices and oils, too! The bathrooms were super clean and I loved my hot showers with strong water pressure. There are a fun assortment of videos to watch - including on VHS! And books and games to play, too.
My favorite memory of our time there was walking down to the dock and just sitting there talking after dinner watching the sunset over the lake. Absolutely beautiful and serene."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable. Soft towels. Beautiful views from the dock, fun kayaking. Loved it there. Made a reservation to stay again next year."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This vacation house was equipped with everything I needed and more. From spices to cook with, boardgames to kayaks and firepit, one can have a great stay with family and friends which is exactly what I did. The house layout was practical with two rooms and a full bath on one side and the master bedroom and bathroom on the opposite end. Though it was raining when I stayed, the back porch overlooking the lake was very relaxing. Tracy (the host) was responsive and polite; I recommend this property for a nice stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Traci's house was perfect! It had everything we needed and more. It was perfect for spending time with the family and just enjoying the beautiful lake view.

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very lovely, well equipped and nicely decorated lake house. Our family loved spending time at the dock, and we appreciate the access to dock supplies. The house had everything we needed and more. Kitchen was well stocked with condiments/spices, towels were luxurious and more than enough for family of 5, and board games and free streaming access were provided.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice house on a lake. Great private dock to hang out in and fish from. has garage full of things to help enhance your stay like bikes and coolers and even a couple fishing poles. Not great fishing from the dock but you can take the kayaks out to better spots on the lake. But the kayaks are definitely not designed for fishing. Hard to bring tackle and poles with you, But can be done. Only a few minutes from walmart and other stores. very convenient. The house is what you'd expect. Only issue we had was that the air conditioning struggled. The house rules says you aren't allowed to set the air conditioner to below 72 degrees which was too warm for our family. And during our stay the house would heat up during the day to 75 or 76 degrees during the peak heat times. luckily we weren't at the house during those times but a couple days of our week long stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very clean and well appointed. Top notch."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! It was clean, comfortable, and relaxing, and I could easily have a hook wet within a minute of deciding to go fishing. The area was very quiet and peaceful and we would love to go back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is everything they say and more. We went on a golf weekend with friends and it was so relaxing and beautiful to come back at the end of the day and just sit out on the dock. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need which is great if you are cooking. The house is immaculate.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time here. The house was exactly as advertised, and even though we were only there two nights we took advantage of the kayak, the pier, and the screened in porch. We will certainly consider staying here again if we are in the area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is home away from home for my golf buddies and I. The house is extremely clean and equipped with everything you could possibly need...and then some. The location is excellent and the atmosphere is more than relaxing. Traci is a wonderful host who is very responsive and genuinely cares about the experience had by the guests who book this great home. We are hoping to return soon.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our visit to Sebring. Lots of thoughtful little things like phone chargers, toiletries if you forgot something.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at Traci's place! We were in town for the races at Sebring and this house had everything. Four beds, 3 bedrooms, full kitchen and garage. We have everything we needed to be comfortable during our stay. Traci's place was incredible value as well as most similar stays in the area are much more expensive the week of the IMSA race. We will 1000% be back!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect for our group of 3 adults and 2 kids. Great safe and quiet road. My favorite part of the house was the dock area where we had coffee each morning and ended the night fishing under the colorful lights! Was a 5 minute drive from Walmart, grocery stores, and restaurants. 45 minutes to Bok Tower Gardens, which we highly recommend if you enjoy beauty and have a few hours to spend there. We will be back!"

The view was spectacular and the kayaks were a great addition. I actually kayaked around the entire lake! We definitely will be staying here again in the near future. I can’t say enough about this place, it was absolutely gorgeous!
Thank you Traci for sharing your place with us!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Traci went above & beyond and thought of everything! We stayed at her lake home with our family of 5. There was nothing she didn’t think of that wasn't available at our fingertips.
The home itself was cozy, clean, convenient to get around & relaxing. We tried a lot of new things that had been on our to do list. We went to Bok Towers, Spooky Hill, Solomons Castle, Highland Hammocks state park, just to mention a few. Traci’s place was central to everything. Having our children with us, car time was important. Everything was within reasonable distance. And when we were back at the house relaxing, the kids found plenty to do with fishing, going in the lake, kayaking or playing a game of cornhole.
I would recommend this lake home time & time again!"

The process was seamless - from reservation to check-out. The home was spotless and incredibly well appointed. Traci has thought of everything! Magnificent to just sit on the dock or the screened patio enjoying a drink or a candlelit dinner, or watch the sunrise/set while reading a book. So calm and relaxing.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are lucky enough to be able to book a reservation at this house, with this host, you will have the best experience ever. This place is so clean and well equipped. The location is center to Lake Placid, and Gulf and ocean, golf courses galore, a fabulous state park with great trails, orange groves all around, tons of lakes for fishing and the best time ever was an air boat ride with Air boat Wildlife Adventures. Breathtaking. Traci was a great host and the lake is beautiful. We loved kayaking on the lake."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place feels like home :-) Everything was very clean and very comfy. If you're looking for a well stocked kitchen, you won't be disappointed. Don't miss the beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the screened in patio."

Aaron & Kimberly have done a great job with tasteful & comfortable furnishings in the cottage !! You feel right at home. They clearly considered what travelers might need & made it all available.

Minutes to downtown and from the main Highway; very centrally located. Every morning, I enjoyed my coffee on the back screened in porch.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house that Javier offers is spacious, equipped with all the amenities you need to relax and prepare meals, cleaning supplies, and plenty of towels. The place is very atmospheric and was impeccably clean. We were impressed with a cozy and well-maintained home.
The pool was a great addition for the hot days.
The walk to the lake took 2 minutes. The water in the lake was clean and very warm and the beach was fun for the kids to play.
The town is quiet, but it has necessary shops and gastronomic offer. Nearby are interesting attractions like Hammock Park with extraordinary (for us) nature.
There was information about the steep driveway in some comments. It is actually steep and if you have a low suspension sports car then the driveway can be a challenge.
Javier was very helpful and available for any questions.
I would definitely recommend this place. We are delighted with the stay."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at a different home Javier hosts in the past in Sebring and was very satisfied with my stay. I was happy to see that Javier also hosts this house where I currently stayed. It feels like home. Details are everywhere, very comfortable beds, and EXTREMELY clean. I will always be back at any home Javier hosts."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house clean and exactly as described. It is a busy street but pretty easy to get out. My only recommendation would be maybe a coffee table and recliner/chairs in the living room and maybe some loungers by the pool. Well worth the money.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a good location, close to shopping and a Publix grocery store. It was very comfortable, with nice hardwood floors and a full kitchen. It also had a full size clothes washer and dryer."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home that was very centrally located. Very busy street though so that was a bit of a challenge. Javier was very proactive and sent a message the day of arrival to make sure we got in ok and if we had any questions or needed anything. Nice pool also but unfortunately it was too chilly to use it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing stay. Thank you Javier.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Javier's place was cozy and comfortable, has everything you need, will definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay at The Good Vibe house. Javier was very easy to work with and very accommodating. The home was exactly as described. It was spacious, comfortable and had everything we needed. It was immaculately clean. The pool area in the backyard was lovely. It was located close to restaurants and stores. It is located on a busy street so there was a bit of road noise. If I were to stay again, I would bring my sound machine to use at night. But, honestly, the road noise was not enough to bother us. Javier was a perfect host."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay and Javier was a great host.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cute place! There is plenty of sleep space, the pool is very well maintained, and the space overall is very comfortable."

2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"the Tina del Bańo,very old and with a lot,rust.
the parking lot is very dangerous by,the transit of vehicles.
the box where the key is to enter is very,old one does not open, it has a trick"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Our second time staying at the Good Vibe house. Javier was a wonderful host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Javier’s home is exactly as described in his listing, from the amenities to cleanliness. The entire home is super clean. We had a great time there and enjoyed the pool for a few minutes before it started raining. Per the other comments we learned that the road out front is a Main Street and you can hear traffic go by during the night. So we were aware and adjusted. I would definitely recommend this home to others!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay at in Sebring. Close to everything, and the place is cozy and clean. Highly recommended."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was perfect for our needs and the house was just adorable. Having the pool in the back was a real plus since we had an 8 year old with us. The lake across the street was beautiful with the cutest little beach. The only drawback was the road in front of the house was a bit noisy at times for the front bedroom, but having the air on helped muffle the street noise. Everything was very clean."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Javier’s place was very nice. One of the nicer air bnb I have stayed at. Loves having access to a personal pool. Offered free shower products. The beds were very comfortable. I also enjoyed having the option of cable instead of having to log into my streaming services. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Javier's place was even better than the pictures indicate. We especially enjoyed the pool. The location was perfect for our weekend getaway and I would definitely stay here again if back in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the house. So peaceful. The lake was right across the street where we could enjoy the morning and sunset. I loved the decoration in the house. Definitely was “ The good vibe house”. Highly recommend for family and quiet vacation. Will definitely be back soon.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is my family’s second time staying at Javier’s place this is one of our absolute favorite air bnb’s has a private pool and tvs in every room with cable clean and this time we even walked down to the little beach across the street what a Gem 😍 if your going to be in the area do yourself a favor and book I couldn’t see getting anything else as good as this place is for the price five ⭐️

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and nicely decorated space
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was lovely. It had everything we needed. Pool was clean and we used it several times. We loved that we could see Lake Jackson from the front porch and from the desk inside the house. We walked across to Crescent Beach to watch the sunset. We also walked to the Circle for lunch and ice cream a few times. If you like walking this house is ideal. We met a couple neighbors and felt safe. When a breaker tripped in the kitchen, Javier was at the house in 15 minutes to fix it. He respected our space and didn't enter the house at all and went into the garage for the remedy. There is traffic noise but it didn't bother us. Overall a good experience. I would stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Good Vibe House! The house was very clean, well decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed sitting by the pool every day and soaking in the warm sun. The house was easy to find and located near many things to see and do.
Javier was friendly, courteous, and very responsive to any questions we had.
If we return to the Sebring area in the future we will definitely check availability of The Good Vibe House!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, close to everything we wanted. The road noise made it difficult to sleep. Suggest installing hurricane windows to reduce the road noise. Not sure how to get to the pool through the house as the door was locked from both sides."
2023-02-01,3,Stayed over a week,"This was a disappointing stay; I’ve stayed at dozens of AirBnB properties and have never felt “unsafe”. There were arguing neighbors, in the middle of the night, teenaged boys hanging out on the porch. The street is unbelievably busy, it’s difficult to even pull out of the driveway.
The house is not as clean as I would expect with an AirBnB property. I spent an hour scrubbing a stained, filthy tub, and also replaced the tub mat. The bathroom floor was not very clean."

It is on a busy road but we didn’t have too much trouble getting in and out and we didn’t really notice the road noise much from inside. Just a short walk across the street there is a little lake side park/beach. And Publix is really close by for those last minute necessities. It was perfect for our family!"

It is om a very busy road that can be difficult to get in and out of depending on the time of day. Theres also quite a bit of traffic noise in the morning.
The driveway is steep and you will need to inch out or you will scrape on the ground.
The house itself was clean and decorated nicely. The pool area was perfect and the bedrooms are a nice size. The little beach area across the road was great and empty the entire time. Nice place to sit and relax.
Javier was very responsive to my messages and was a great host. The location is very convenient and close to all the shopping you will need."

I worked from the house, and the wifi was very good, the desk large and nicely placed in front of a window - good for all-day Zoom meetings and people watching. The pool was refreshing in the warm afternoons, the kitchen great for cooking our meals - even had a blender for my morning smoothies. Appreciated the comfortable bed with nice fluffy pillows. Convenient to the Publix supermarket, the little downtown of Sebring, and an easy 15-minute drive to the airport. The lake is about a block away across the street; nice for an evening stroll. Quite a bit of traffic on the road out front, but it was not overly noisy and went to pretty much nothing at night. We’d definitely stay again if we were in the area."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at The Good Vibe House/Sebring at the end of October 2020 and had a wonderful experience. Very sweet house with a sparkling private pool, free wifi with no connection problems, and great cable tv. Liked the spotlights shining on the vehicle all night, too. Easy check-in and fabulous host! Stay THERE if you are ever in Sebring, FL. (You can walk down the street and jump in the lake - little lake ""beach"" park with picnic tables.)"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home it self is exactly as described, “The Good Vibe home is awesome! The home is located in a high traffic area but it is minutes away from a variety of restaurants and stores. We chose this place as a weekend getaway and we were very pleased with the experience and quick response from Javier."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is fabulous! Very well decorated and clean. Lots of room and a great value. Pool was very private and very well taken care of. House is located on a busy street and can be a bit noisy, but that’s a small issue in an otherwise great stay."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My third time at this house, and I enjoy it more each time. 15 minutes to Sebring Raceway, less than that to restaurants (national chains or funky local joints), location can't be beat, and the pool is excellent therapy after a hot day in the Florida sun. Javier is a very good host, too -- attentive to your needs without being obtrusive. All-around excellent place!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I strongly recommend this place to anyone. Beautiful place.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean home. Pool is really nice! I would definitely recommend Javier’s place.
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Javier was an awesome host
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time and the place was perfect! One awesome surprise is that this place is right across the street from a lake beach and even though you can’t swim in it, the views are amazing! It’s really a great summer vacation spot!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just spent two nights at the Good Vibe house with my family. We were planning on a one night stay, but this home was such a good value and and so clean and comfortable with a great location and pool that we booked second night immediately. Javier was easygoing and super responsive. I highly recommend staying here. Make sure to walk across the street and check out the sunset over lake Jackson"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was truly a great stay, amazing location and the home is welcoming with a great vibe!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was nicely decorated and very clean! Check in was easy!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice house
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Javier has worked hard to make the Good Times House a truly inviting place to be, to sleep, to cook a meal, to relax on the porch or by the pool. The home is well-maintained and stocked with unexpectedly helpful items, such as a wine corkscrew."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very clean house and host was so quick to respond to our questions. Pool was great but cold. Busy road but did not affect our sleeping. Bed very comfortable.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Javier’s house really has a good vibe. It is nicely decorated, so it feels like a home. The pool was perfect for us. We stayed with our kids. The only thing what we didn’t expected, was the noise of the traffic. We aren’t used to that. The location itself was good, aswell as the communication with Javier. We recommend it!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a Great place to stay at! Javier was super fast with his replies. There were plenty of clean towels, etc items. I highly recommend his place for all!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! We wanted to stay another night but it was already booked, maybe next time… 100% satisfied"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A home away from home. This was by far the best Airbnb I stayed at. Javier has a awesome spot and I will be back soon.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Truly a home away from home! Recommend and will always return when in the Sebring area. I've booked with Javier on several occasions now. Communication is always pleasant and Javier goes above and beyond to assure that your needs are met during your stay. Javier graciously hosted my father and his friend while in Florida for a long month stay and they too loved the bnb. Can't say enough about the home and location. Thanks Javier for being a wonderful host!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Javier was a great home. Although he was not there, he will respond right away. We enjoyed our stay, too bad it was a bit cold to jump in the pool. Already thinking of coming back!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second time at Javiers. Exactly what we expected as we had a great time our first stay. We’ll definitely be back again!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stay. Didn’t even see the pool until it was too late. Javier has thought is every amenity.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Very clean! Nicely decorated.
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and very hospitable hosts.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Quiet neighborhood and a well laid out space.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place. Perfect for two!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very restful stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved being on the canal. The view across from the dock is a vacant lot with a birdhouse, that I enjoyed watching the coming and goings. There was also a little cottontail that would share my evening. He didn't swim across the canal to visit with me, but he didn't mind me watching him frolic as the sun set each night. If you want peace while traveling and a place to come and relax this is the place for you. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam is a great host. Place was everything as described. We will definitely be staying there again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam Pam to all my Austin's and requests quickly and completely. The place was exactly what I needed for this business trip.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am from Sebring, but moved to South GA in 2019. My Dad has recently been placed on Hospice and we received a phone call that we needed to come quick. We found her quiet and quaint 1 bedroom very quickly and in a matter of minutes we had reserved the place and spoke to her about what time we would be arriving. We reserved our stay from Tuesday through Friday but after the passing of my Dad on Thursday, I knew I couldn't leave my mom the very next day. So I called Pam and told her what had happened and wanted to see about extending our stay by one day. The apartment we were in wasn't going to be available, but she assured us that we could, at our convince moved to the 2 story home that our 1 bedroom was attached to and that she would let us stay for the very same amount that we were already paying for the apartment. This house was beautiful, very large, with everything we could have possibly needed and the ability to stay and comfort my mom for another day. We will def use her again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and nice accommodations! Would stay there again should we be in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved watching the wildlife on the canal!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying at The Nest and I caught myself referring to it as “home”—that is probably the highest praise I can give for a rental!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy, clean and convenient."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice little apartment in a good location. had everything needed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam's place was perfect for what I needed. Will definitely return when I am back in Sebring!!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Thank you for a fine stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so nice to come home to a comfortable place after long days working at the nearby track. Easy to park and enter, quiet location and neighborhood. So happy to have a kitchen handy, dining table and chairs, and sofas to use and relax. Our favorite feature is the shower - plenty of water pressure and hot water, and the showerhead is high up (great for tall folks) and adjustable. Pam's communication also deserves five stars - very responsive and the directions/instructions were clear and easy to use."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay in Sebring. I have stayed here before and will stay again in the future. Everything you need in an apartment with the setting of being on a canal.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam's place was cozy and clean. We loved being on the canal, and took the canoe out daily."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pam responded quickly when I had a question about the entry process. The place was comfortably furnished and had everything I needed. I'll stay again if I pass this way.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my 2nd time staying at The Nest. Pam was helpful with making a last minute change to my reservation and check in was easy. Very convenient to all points around Sebring.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice in general.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean, check in was super easy, and AC blew cold. Will consider staying again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice and clean apartment on the water for a decent price! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Once again I had the most wonderful stay. Ms Pam is a fantastic host. The Airbnb is fantastic. I am looking forward to stay again. Thank you for a wonderful time.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We appreciated the quietness of the area and the amount of space within the unit. We didn't spend much time in the apartment, so it served our needs for a place to sleep and shower and have breakfast. The two things that concerned me were trip hazards outside with above-ground pavers and cracked cement patio (raised lip), as well as the bedroom set-up. The bedroom did not have walls that went to the ceiling. There was a 1-2 foot gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling, so while it was private, noise and light (from kitchen and living room) was audible and visible. If you're staying alone, it's not a problem, but if your partner gets up earlier or stays up later, this is disruptive. It does allow the wall mini-split (located in the living room) to provide heat and A/C to the bedroom, which is probably why it was designed that way."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Pam’s place.  She was a gracious and responsive host. Her place was neat and clean.  The proximity to Sebring Race Track was my main priority, only 15min from entrance!  We would recommend for anyone visting the track.  5 stars for us!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pam was very accommodating to our requests, prompt with her reply and service."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am so very happy to have found Ms. Pam’s home, that what it feels like home. I am excited to plan my next trip I would love to stay there again. I hope there is an opening. Thank you Ms. Pam for a wonderful time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little place. Clean, quiet, on a canal. Pam was very accommodating and responsive.
Good for solo travelers or a couple."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, well-stocked kitchenware, perfectly comfortable bedding.
I enjoyed the private porch and dock on the canal. Truly a hidden gem in Sebring"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place and service was great
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"perfect for what i needed, quiet after a lond day at work"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood is not well cared for so it’s not a good image as you approach. The home is nicer than most, but the host needs to tend to the walkway and back yard. The unit is larger than expected with a full equipped kitchen. My only exception to the inside is the bed. In my opinion it’s reached it’s useful life and should be replaced."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,this is THE BEST stay I have ever had and I have used Airbnb for years. 5stars for location and comfort
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The cottage is a great place to stay! I had an extended stay and had no troubles at all. Pam is very welcoming and responsive if you need anything or have any questions. I highly recommend taking the kayaks out for a trip down the canal while you’re there!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Of all the places in Sebring that i have stayed at , this was the best!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Pam's place was exactly as I had expected. She was very responsive and accommofdating. If ever in the area again and need a place to stay we'll certainly remember Pam.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,very nice place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Pam's place is just what the doctor ordered. It was the perfect location for me centralized in Sebring and was easy for me to get to where ever I wanted. Her house was very clean, and located on a beautiful canal."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved the canal and we had a great time kayaking 3 different times. We enjoyed the sunset on the kayak on Little Lake Jackson. Apartment was quiet and we slept well. Kitchen had everything we needed. It's small but was perfect for 2 people. Lots of interesting birds and zero alligator sightings. I would stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While we were unable to take full advantage of this great Airbnb, when we got back from our days at the track (Sebring Int'l Raceway) it was a welcoming and quiet resting place. Our only comment/suggestion would be to make future renters aware that the TV is Wi-fi streaming. We were under the misconception that it was cable. After finding this out, it presented no problem.
We will make this a go-to place for our future stays in Sebring.
Than you Pam."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can recommend. Everything was clean, quiet and private. Easy check in and out."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Not sure what all the reviews were about the bed ? I slept great! The place was super clean. Super comfortable. A/C worked great as well.
Yes a few older furnishings but in great shape. People should pay more to have a “vintage “ place to stay :) I will be back for sure"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ended up staying a lot longer than originally booked and Pam was very nice and accommodating. I really appreciated her help. The apartment was very cute, clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends 😊"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an enjoyable stay. I slept wonderfully - extremely quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Beautiful surroundings on the canal. Nicely appointed, spotless Airbnb. I look forward to staying here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This nest is a comfortable, clean, and convenient. I appreciated the well stocked full kitchen to make you own meals. Enjoyed being able to look out on the canal and the neighborhood is quiet, but close to US 27. I would stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay. Very nice comfortable bed and very peaceful setting.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got the 24-hour flu the day after I arrived. I was in no condition to go out shopping for groceries. I asked Pam if, on the off chance, she might bring me a little bread and butter. She came by shortly after with a care package of some nice groceries. Many thanks."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very easy check in. Very pleasant entry, inviting. Only stayed one night Not a good fit for TWO people as bed needs updating. Other furniture was outdated but not too bad. Kitchen table was just the right size. Nice touch with water bottle cold in refrigerator and ice already made in freezer.
Outside walkway was very well lit at night and nicely manicured.
The walkway was made of square concrete blocks, not good for someone with walker or cane.
I will come back here if the bed is changed to foam and not spring mattress."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This was a nice quiet area with good food within a mile or 2. The bed is due for replacement along with the recliner. Being there for a month was not as comfortable as we would have liked, but we made it do. Sebring was farther away from things we like to do in Florida and next time we will stay closer to the coast."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Awesome stay! We were there for a month so we really had time to check out the area. We will be back to Sebring and would love to stay there again!
The apartment had everything we needed to feel like home. Having a washer and dryer on site was a huge bonus! The kitchen was very well equipped and we cooked there a lot. The bed is comfortable and we slept well. We loved sitting on the patio watching the wildlife. Didn't see any alligators but lots of birds! The location was great and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Not many places in walking distance. There are some great stores, restaurants, breweries and bars in the area. Not too far from either coast. Pam is an excellent host. Since this apartment is attached to another rental, so she is there on occasion to clean and do laundry but is very respectful of your privacy and also friendly and helpful.
Thank you, Pam for a thoughtfully put together home!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is -as advertised- the perfect nest for two.
The old-school interior with wooden cupboards and floral designs gives this place a cozy and comfortable feeling. We loved every bit of our stay.
Even though the main house was rented, we enjoyed the quiet of the place and felt safe in the area.
The absolute best part is the canal right in front of the house! We were allowed to use the kayaks and went for a trip down the quiet and beautiful stream to the nearby lake. The nature is amazing, a perfect place to relax.
If you come here for work you will also have enough room to set up a small working area, the wifi is fast and works well.
The kitchen has everything you need for preparing a wide variety of meals.
Communication with Pam was perfect. She provided all the necessary information in advance and responded quick to every message I sent.
We loved our stay and will come back whenever we're in the area again.
Thank you Pam for adding this experience to our vacation :)"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit, and there is nothing negative I can say about Pam and her apartment. I like to cook, and it has a full kitchen. The TV setup is good, and it's got a nice shower. Pam is a terrific host. I think this place is a bargain."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Quiet, spacious and comfortable
Pam is an excellent host"

very friendly
apartment great for a couple or a single traveller
on a canal
nice residential neighborhood"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little space for 2 to spend time together after a day in Sebring.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The service fees on this place make it not worth the price. It is a concrete block building and while quiet and clean the aesthetics are low. Why are they so high? I'm staying at a hotel next time.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice 1br bnb with full kitchen, full bathroom, and comfortableliving room. Nice and peaceful neighborhood with friendly neighbors and also a canal in back they provide kayakand canoefor a peaceful trip down the canal."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great easy space. Close to race track. I was there for work and it was exactly what i needed. There were way more amenities than i had tine to enjoy. The birds and the water in back is really relaxing. Very pleasant stay.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying here! It was so relaxing to just sit on the deck and enjoy the birds, fish and sunsets!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, spacious and extremely convenient for biking to Highlands Hammock State Park!
Having a well-stocked kitchen, with anything you might need (including a toaster and kettle), was great. And I especially appreciated the very comfortable bed at the end of long days of biking!
Pam was extremely responsive to questions and self check-in went smoothly. Would definitely book here again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great relaxing place to stay in Sebring. It's nice to be on the canal and see the wildlife in the backyard.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a quick weekend getaway and this place offered more than we even expected. So much fun canoeing down the canal to Little Lake Jackson. Everything we needed was provided to enjoy our stay.
2021-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Not a bad area, nice that it has a dock in back. Very small accommodations. The grill is falling apart. The bed was the worst we ever slept on."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed with Pam two times, will stay again the next time we will be there. Love it!"
2021-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great price and location.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is better then I expected. The hosts are amazing and the place was wonderful. If you have a boat, bring it. You can dock right out the front door! The area of Sebring was awesome and I really enjoyed my stay. I would love to visit here again."

My only points of feedback regard supplemental amenities. The pots and pans need updating. They were so thin and old, they were rather difficult to use and it would be really nice for longer stays to have basic kitchen supplies like foil, saran wrap, oil, spices and laundry detergent.
But otherwise, I appreciated the convenience and cleanliness of the home and the hospitality Raul extended me and my mother and would highly recommend this BnB and will book again should I return to the area."

2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"on a personal note, the beds were firmer than I am used to, so if that is what you like you are in luck!

The nature reserve is a must and so is the soda/ice cream place in Sebring.

Since two of us got sick the day after we checked in, it was nice to have a house to relax and recover in just as if we were in our own home. Every little detail was paid attention to for her incomig guests. I'm extremely OCD and a germaphobe, this house more than exceeded our expectations.
