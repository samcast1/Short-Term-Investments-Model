2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed staying at Jordan’s place. It’s spacious, natural light, cozy, neat and clean. I’m very particular about smells: I am not happy when the house smells like an old place when not fully renovated and when there are too many detergents & scents. This house was perfect. The home also had a big fenced backyard and beautiful grass (they hadn’t had it in the pictures when I chose the place), so our dogs had such a great surprise, and I didn’t have to worry about having them on leash. Thank you for being a great host, Jordan!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great space and perfect for families. Beds were comfortable and everything was well stocked and easily accessible. The front steps were a little hard to navigate for some of our ""less abled"" older adults, so a handicap ramp may be a good investment for this property.

It was extremely windy and cold one day so we had to remain indoors, the extra throw blankets they had along with the dark shades made for the perfect movie day.
The pillows, beds and blankets were super comfy and the place was spotless! For being in such a small town this home was immaculate!
We'll be back for next year's Chicken Fried Steak Festival and will be booking again. 😊"

There was so much space in the house, which was just beautiful. The master bedroom was big, well lit with the big window and oh so nice king bed. The bathroom was huge and nice.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the weekend of the grand opening for the West Texas Living Heritage Museum in Seminole Texas,and this country homes served the perfect getaway for guests to come and enjoy.
And I truly feel that it was meant to be that we could put our guest who were from the Comanche nation, making it like a homecoming to Gaines County, this beautiful country home just a little out of city limit where you have a clear view of the beautiful sunsets and sunrises that we are famous for here in West Texas.
The front porch rocking chairs was such a home like touch. And much appreciated. Coffee on the front porch in the morning, watching the sun come up sitting on the rocking chair in 2023 is a gift in its self.
We live in such a fast paced world, to take a moment in the on the front porch in the country is like a good summer rain in the desert. Highly recommend this beautiful home.
Thank you Kyle."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean and spacious . Host was great and very responsive . However , feedback is to provide a better experience for future guests: ( we had 2 adults and 2 kids under 5 yrs)
1. There were no pool towels. We had to use bath towels, in which there were not enough towels because the ""pool towels"" became really dirty with the midland dust after taking outside
2. Kitchen is slim. 2 coffee mugs. 6 plates . 4 water glasses. No mixing type bowls/large salad/pasta bowls.There is no plastic in the place- so bringing a glass water cup outside was risky. It's pretty bare bones !
3. We had half a roll of paper towels and ran out quickly with no extras . No dish towels.
4. No laundry soap provided
5. Out of the 3 days we were there- the host showed up 2 times ( he messaged that he would have to drop by and clean the pool , and the meet a warranty repair person ) although host was accommodating and responsive - I still didn't want him dropping by at less than ideal hours ."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here with my kids for a few days to visit dad while he’s working out here in the oil field… a hotel is just not suitable for small children who need to run & play and be loud while they are doing cartwheels and watching tv and playing all day, the price was very fair as she had a full kitchen to use and I cooked every day and cleaned up after myself. She was stocked up with towels and linen very very nice and clean the backyard was perfect for them to play in & they made friends with some of the neighborhood kids it was a good experience! She has bedside chargers just in case you forget yours. Felt very very at home and peaceful. Hot tub is a big plus once the kids went to bed after we played games in the garage before bath and bed!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We would give 4.5 stars if we could! The only reason why we wouldn't give 5 stars is because of the hot tub. The heater struggled to get hot enough for my husband and he gave up on using it that first night. I'm not sure if it was just too cold outside, but we were really looking forward to using it. We did not get a chance to try it again before we left. I would have also loved to have charging ports on the bedside nightstands and maybe a place to hang coats near the front door. Otherwise, EVERYTHING was gorgeous, clean and very well stocked! We were not there as much as we thought we would be, so we did not get a chance to enjoy the game room either. The house was very spacious as well. Adrianne checked in regularly and was very upbeat and positive! We enjoyed our stay in her home."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at You Got Mel was awesome!
We feel we found the best place to stay in Seminole. Our hosts were very accommodating. They spared nothing in building these gorgeous apartments in a former post office building. They are modern, state of the art, professionally designed and decorated with fine furnishings, including 2 very large televisions. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Everything is extremely clean.
Check-in is easy with keyless entry. The building is very secure!
Communications with the host yield quick responses.
Melissa is a new Airbnb host, but it won’t be long before she will be a Super Host! In our book, she already is a Super Host as we can honestly say that we’ve had none better than she.
The location is perfect, within walking distance of many amenities including a nice restaurant, coffee shops, shops, and grocery store.
We feel Very Blessed to have found “You Got Mel”."
