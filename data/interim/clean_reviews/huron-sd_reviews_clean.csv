2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and quiet location. Bed is comfy, easy access from vehicle to house. Great little diner for breakfast two blocks down. Friendly locals. Very much worth the stay if traveling through."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found The Windmill to be the perfect place for our needs.
Jeff offers so much, the house is stocked with everything you would need. If you partake of any item in the kitchen, all you have to do is leave a tip on the counter so they can restock! How nice is that!! There is coffee, there was creamer, there was any kitchen item one would need.
Everything was clean and fresh.
We were pretty much there to sleep as our family gathered at another location, but sleep came easily. Bed was comfortable, you can control the temperature.
We would return to The Windmill any time we return to Clark.
The accommodations were excellent. Feel confident in your reservation! You’ll sleep well and seriously this home has all that you need!!
A big thank you to Jeff! We loved the Windmill for our needs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great little house. They have everything you could need. It was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. Jeff was easy to get ahold of if we needed anything. We will definitely stay there again.

The house was neat and cleaned, I am sensitive to scents but thanks to the host that they don’t use strong chemical products to clean the house and or strong scents of freshener. The house doesn’t not have a smell of mold or old dusty at all! Al Natural air refresher because its on a greenery landscape. Essential items are in stock, host is very thoughtful and generous! I would definitely stay here again when I go to SD!
Host, thank you for a safe and cozy home to stay in during our trip!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff is a stupendous guy! he had reservations about accepting my booking request due to his place being more setup for families and given that my group is four adult male workers I totally understood his concern. I assured him that we would take care of his place as if it was ours. Since we spend a lot of time on the road we prefer to stay at Airbnb's so that we're not cramped in hotel rooms and have that home away from home feeling..
He was very accommodating, very communicative and overall a pleasure to deal with.
if I am ever back in the area I will definitely stay there again."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a group of five with dogs visiting the area to visit the Laura Ingalls Wilder museums. Great location. Absolutely beautiful surroundings. Great place to take the dogs on a long walk. The internet/TV was out when we arrived due to a recent storm and before I could reach out to have it fixed someone drove up to fix it. Glad he did, he was personable, fun to talk with and had showed us a few things. The kitchen is well stocked. The beds/linens are comfortable and clean. It’s spacious and perfect for a quiet getaway. Definitely 5-Star!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was absolutely perfect for our small hunting group. Very clean.

Absolutely no complaints. Our host, Alex, was great to work with."

She absolutely loved it. It had a well-stocked kitchen for us to cook in. They even had extras like toothpaste and batteries that you don't normally see at an AirBNB. They also had a pack n play, a highchair and even provided cabinet locks to keep our little explorer out of trouble! I would definitely stay here again!"

Alan was a great host! Awesome communication and was helpful with whatever we needed. We will be back next year. Thanks again Alan. Highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were on a pheasant hunting trip. Usually we stay in a motel. This year we stayed at Alan's house. The house is nearly new (2021) and is nicely furnished and decorated. Alan said it was secluded, not another house in sight, and how right he was. It sure beats the cement and traffic jungle at most motels! Al
kept in touch with us before and during our stay to make sure everything was going well. If we had a question, he was great getting back with us. The kitchen was very nice, complete with all the appliance's we needed. We brought our own dishwasher (Don) so didn't need the automatic dishwasher that was available. It was the most enjoyable stay we could ask for.
Thank you Al from the Old Game Warden from Michigan"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A gem nestled in some beautiful prairie lands! We were looking for a way to get away from life’s everyday hustle and bustle and this home was the answer! Our dogs were huge fans of the expansive lawn and grassy areas and I loved that there were no ticks seen all weekend. Already thinking about another trip back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"what an amazing place, this is a hidden gem! the House is brand new and everything is in pristine condition. there's plenty of room and beds for a large family.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Patten Prairie Lodge is a great place to get away from it all without making compromises. You can't see any other houses from the property, but you still have municipal water, fiber optic internet, gas appliances, good cell service (4 bars on US Cellular), and a good dish washer. The place is clean and tidy with a well stocked kitchen.
The lodge is within an hours drive of world class hunting and fishing. Even if you stay on the property there are pheasants, deer, prairie dogs, and cattle to watch. When the weather cooperated, the star gazing was also really good which is nice if you live in a town/city where that isn't possible.
I highly recommend Prairie Patten Lodge."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best place I’ve stayed. Hosts are awesome and accommodating

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were just passing through, but would have loved to stay a few days in this peaceful, scenic location. The hosts were great, check in was smooth, and there were even farm fresh eggs waiting for us. I would definitely stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home with even better hosts.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing for anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle. Just a short drive off I-90, it was easy to get to and plenty quick to get back on the highway.
We enjoyed the beauty of the farm in the background and occasional animal noises. We gazed at the moon and then watched the sun rise the next morning.
The space was more than adequate for our family of six. Our 4 kids slept in the loft while my wife and I shared the main floor bedroom. My kids are already asking when we can go back.
I’d highly recommend Theodore’s place to anyone seeking solitude and serenity of country living."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Theodore was a very gracious host! I’m so sorry we didn’t get to meet him and his family. I wish I could just stay there longer. I’d like to walk down the country road. It’s the perfect place to snuggle in and read a book. So peaceful and quiet!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was everything it was described as. Very peaceful and a great place to disconnect and enjoy the peace of nature. The kitchen was stocked full of goodies as well as needed staples. It was very obvious they want their guests to feel welcome and like family. Highly recommend if you are looking for a cozy, quiet getaway to unwind and relax."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful and far exceeded expectations! The entire place was very clean and organized. What stood out most was extra mile this family went to provide food in kitchen! Bacon, yogurts orange juice, and well stocked pantry. Our kids enjoyed the upstairs area including the books and toys that were nicely arranged. The upstairs was a little hot by the evening but we cracked a window and slept just fine. Beds were very comfortable. The host is very responsive and helpful.
We will definitely be staying here again if it works out with our schedule as we pass through South Dakota. What nice, peaceful place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of kind unique cottage. Once you walk in you are pleasantly surprised. Theodore wife left us fresh farm eggs and freshly cooked scones. Would recommend to anyone what a peaceful return on small farm. Lots of animals to watch as well.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute stay just minutes from Mitchell SD! House had lots of amenities stocked for us and the kids enjoyed the bunk beds!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Theodore & Kara were wonderful hosts. They both went above and beyond, which I myself, appreciated immensely. The house was built with love and craftsmanship. It is absolutely beautiful. We are in Mitchell at least once a year and plan to stay if it is available. Thank you to you both for a fantastic stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home with everything my family could have needed. We stayed at Theodore’s for a night while driving cross country and we will definitely stay again if the opportunity presents itself. Theodore was very responsive and proactive with messaging. The kitchen was well stocked, including milk, coffee, eggs, frozen pizza, and fresh cookies (thank you, Theodore!!), which was a really wonderful and unexpected surprise.
The bed (downstairs queen) was very comfortable. It’s not the most giant space, but it was very comfortable, had everything we needed (and more!), and we felt right at home.
We arrived after dark, but the sunrise was spectacular."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for our family! Peaceful & relaxing. Kitchen stocked beyond what we expected. We all enjoyed our stay that was ""too short"" & would not only return but also recommend to family/friends!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful! Relaxing weekend away from distractions! Clear sky and the stars were amazing. Hosts were excellent and very accommodating!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were great hosts and treated us with more than we expected!!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Charming, freshly designed, cottage in rural South Dakota provided a convenient stop over while traveling across the state. Our family is short so we didn’t mind the low ceilings upstairs. Beds are super-comfortable and the hosts were very kind. Their hospitality was fantastic and even provided farm fresh eggs, ham and orange juice for us to prepare breakfast before leaving. We would love to stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay!
The house was extremely clean. Hosts were willing to make sure we had everything we needed! I highly recommend this place."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Love this cozy farm house! It was perfect for our family and so warm and inviting. I was impressed how well stocked everything was! They really did think of everything. Never have we stayed at an Airbnb so well stocked. The bar area was our favorite hang out spot. The decor was impressive and even gave us ideas on what to explore in Huron (old photographs of the towns nearby) There was a snow storm while we were staying here and it was the perfect place to be warm and cozy. It was even better than the description. We will definitely be staying here again when visiting Huron and would recommend it to others. Jodi was amazing- answered our questions right away even though it was in the middle of the holidays. She went above and beyond to help us and make us feel welcome!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at the Sandy Creek Lodge was better than we could have expected. It was a perfect place for our group to stay while doing some pheasant hunting and a little partying. Our hosts, Jodi and Marty, were as friendly and helpful as you could ask for. The lodge had everything we needed for our stay and then some. The cleanliness was exceptional. Sure beats living out of a hotel room for a week. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, clean out of the town place to stay. We've already booked and are looking forward to our stay for 2024. Thanks again to Jodi and Marty."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The sand creek lodge was amazing for myself and guest to stay while chasing pheasants in the area. Dogs kennels in the garage and game cleaning stations were a bonus and perfect for our stay! We had seven individuals and the lodge would sleep more very comfortable.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time here! Everything was just as described. The bar was a cool set up and the rooms were clean and neat. It had all the things we needed to make our stay great. The dog kennels and game cleaning room were perfect for us. Also really enjoyed the quiet, private settting."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful gathering place! Everything we needed for a comfortable stay! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We were there pheasant hunting and the place exceeded all of our needs. 10 guys and dogs had plenty of room to hang out have a few drinks and watch football after hunting, without feeling like we were on top of each other. Pheasant cleaning area with freezer was a great bonus. Place was well stocked we didnt need anything. Cooked most of our meals there without any issues. Great place we will be coming back!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Really really friendly host, every time i needed something they were always on top of it. Good place to stay at. Felt just like home."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Stay was perfect. Jack and Sharon let us in early to help facilitate the wedding of my son.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay! It was very roomy. Lots of seating and cozy. Only thing that could’ve made it better was another TV upstairs in the living room. But, the stay overall was great- it was private and we felt secure having my truck and trailers parked outside. Jack and Sharon were responsive and accommodating! Thank you!"

I highly recommend the Blue Abode!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful homey and clean. Had all the cooking utensils and stuff you would need for longer stays. Will definitely use this place in the future if possible when staying in town for work. Visited with Jack a few minutes, great guy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jack and Sharon were excellent hosts. We had plenty of room for our family and the location was great. Loved the local recommendations and assistance with additional crockpots at the last minute.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice and comfortable home! Jack and Sharon made me fill right at home! I will definitely stay again when I come back to town!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Nice, clean, quiet, and comfortable house. Jack and Sharon are very friendly and accommodating. We messaged back and forth a bit before our stay, and they made sure everything was in order for us before we arrived. We would definitely stay again. Thank you so much!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was a great little place to stay. Jack and Sharon are super friendly and are easy to get ahold of and talk to about whatever is going on. We extended our stay twice and they accommodated us both times with our hesitation. Very nice ppl! We enjoyed our stay the whole time!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Unbelievable stay it’s definitely a must if in that area you will be so comfortable has everything you need to enjoy your time ! Home is fabulous!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Gene was very helpful and accommodated myself and a coworker on short notice and was very flexible when we had some confusion with where we would be staying. The even provided some carmal rolls for breakfast! Would definitely recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Had everything you need to stay and cook your own meals! Perfect for hunting trips! Wish there was a tv, some cards, or games for entertainment. Overall great place to stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stay there 4 times now and it’s been great!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Affordable and clean. Gene has always been good to us and we’ve been there 4 times now.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gene’s cabin was outstanding. Extremely clean and very cozy and quiet place to stay. Gene was kind enough to have some refreshments and cinnamon rolls waiting for us. Very accommodating. We thoroughly enjoyed our time spent at the cabin.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The country lodge was a nice place for me and the guys to hang our hats at the end of a long day hunting. Gene was very quick to respond when messaged. Overall, a very nice place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, the cabin is a very quiet, clean place. They left us water and complimentary juices. I like that, I recommend it 100%"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Cozy little cabin. Plenty of linens, cookware, etc. My first AirBNB experience and it was a good one."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,If you quite literally don’t want to be bothered this is perfect for that. There’s hardly cell service. There’s no tv (which I don’t care) and there’s no WiFi of any kind. The living room was nice and cool but the bedrooms were stuffy. This place is about 6 miles off the beaten path and off of a gravel road in the middle of a corn field. It wasn’t a miserable visit and their aren’t many options of places to stay in such a small town but I don’t think this spot is priced accurately for what you get.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This cabin suited our needs well. Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a pleasant experience! The kitchen was stocked with anything one would need. They had water and juice chilled in the refrigerator. There was even a very tasty surprise left for us in the freezer.
The accommodations were very comfortable with lots of parking. If we are ever in the area again we would likely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was great. Gene provided a nice place for us to stay in a remote and private area. It’s worth the drive in this rural area. The neighbors were polite and there is a coffee shop 1 block away. It is a simple cabin as advertised and a lovely location.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was cozy and clean! Perfect for us! Thank you!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was hoping to stay closer to De Smet. Now however i feel the extra 25 minutes to Gene's airbnb is well worth the time spent driving. Very rural, and peaceful. We loved it, and will plan to stay again if we travel through SD in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! Beds were comfortable, everything was stocked beyond what we would expect! Even had caramel rolls for us! Very peaceful quiet neighborhood with very friendly people. Our grandkids had fun playing at the nearby school playground. We were surprised to find a coffee rotisserie in this tiny town. They offered homemade ice cream, oven roasted pizza and some baked goods. Nearby Osceola Lake offers a swimming area and kayaking. Thank you Gene and the friendly residents of Osceola!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location is very private and peaceful. It is a ways from town but definitely worth it. Was very clean with a lot of Amenities. There is no TV or WIFI but that made it that more relaxing. Thanks Gene!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was in a great location if you are a bird hunter or fisherman. The house was amazing. I enjoyed that there wasn’t any TVs. It allowed for a lot of good laughs with friends. They left the most fantastic homemade Carmel roll in the freezer for us. It was a slice of the Midwest for sure. I will be returning to this Airbnb.
2023-01-01,3,Stayed over a week,"A good place to stay
2 rooms, a living room, a kitchen , and 1 bathroom
All you really need. The kitchen came in handy

2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this cute place. The yummy cinnamon rolls, bottled water, orange juice and bread were nice extra touches.
It is a beautiful area. Nice back patio.
The second bedroom only had one outlet behind the door, which made it hard when running the fan at night. We tried to open the window to get a cool breeze, but could not. There was a window air conditioner in the main room.
We had trouble figuring out the shower, but a text to the housekeeper helped us figure it out."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice quiet place to stay
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Do not hesitate to book this place!
Gene is a caring and thoughtful host.
So many lovely touches - like chilled water and juice in the fridge. And if you get lucky, there may be a plate if cinnamon rolls in the freezer to warm up for breakfast.
It is an easy place to get to if you are traveling to or from the Black Hills/Badlands.
The beds are super comfortable with amazing mattresses.
Loved everything about this place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was great! We loved having our own place versus a motel. The check-in process was very convenient. It was very clean and in a nice little rural neighborhood. The caramel rolls for breakfast were a bonus! We would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you ever wondered what life on the prairie would be like, check this place out. We travel on bikes and Gene’s place was a home away from home.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the place was in a great location and has a great view of the lake. We ran into a small issue while we were there and needed to leave sooner than expected. Jordan was very helpful and easily refunded the balance of our stay.
The loft is certainly smaller than expected and doesn't have a fixed ladder yet. I think its fine for a pre-teen, teenager young adulty to sleep in but not the best for middle aged or older couples.
There were some personal effects there but Jordan was upfront and trusting about this.
It's and older tiny cabin on a beautiful lake and will be just right for the correct people!"

We had substantial rains while we were there and there were no issues with the well maintained roads or anything at the lodge.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great and cozy place to spend a week. Thanks Cora.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 4th time staying at Cora’s place. We love it! So cozy and relaxing. We didn’t want to leave. Cora is friendly and very responsive.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I kinda want to write a negative review so that the Silver Star Motel is more available when I want to stay there. Instead, I'll honestly describe it.... Very nice, quiet location, and great amenities. Clean, comfortable and accurately described. We stayed there on a hunting trip and it worked great for that. Cora, the host, was very responsive on the run-up to the stay as I had a few questions. She was also very accommodating. If you need some yard games or have a rainy day to pass away, there are plenty of options in the abode."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, fun and comfortable. Exactly what we were looking for for a brief getaway. We hope to return and stay - often!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Probably the best and cutest air bnb we’ve ever stayed at. Was even better in person than the pictures. We absolutely loved our stay and couldn’t stop telling our friends and family about it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location just south of town. Pet friendly was a plus for us
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! stayed here 2 years in a row for a hunting trip will definitely continue to.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place. Very cozy and well kept. Has everything you could possibly need. My friend, dog and I really enjoyed our stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at Cora's place. It was the perfect home base for pheasant hunting/fishing trip. The place was comfortable and just as pictured. It was the perfect mix of feeling rustic/country, but also real close to all the needed amenities in the city. We are already planning our next stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"4th year in a row we have stayed at the Silverstar, and for the 4th year in a row everything was phenomenal!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was clean and comfortable. Cool rustic place.
Would definitely stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WOW! What a beautiful place. incredibly cozy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Silverstar Barn was too short! The renovated barn is very spacious, clean, and comfortable and all of the décor is well thought out and adds to the beauty of this amazing place. The location is very quiet and private and close to Pelican Lake. Cora got back to us immediately both before and during our stay when we had questions. We will definitely be visiting Silverstar Barn again and next time we will stay longer!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time at silver star barn! Already booked another trip for the winter. Will definitely recommend to others!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Third time staying here, as always, an excellent place, a very peaceful place"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is the second time I've stayed here, great place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place. Not too far from town, but still out of the city enough to feel like you're properly getting away for a while. Everything was clean and we really liked how the place was decorated. They gave us plenty of privacy and were quick to respond when we had a question. One thing to know, however, is that the bedroom is sectioned off with a curtain and not a door so if you have kids that go to bed early you'll probably have to be quiet the rest of the night.
The suspended couch/bed was really cool! We want to see what the other two airbnbs on the property look like inside so we might just have to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a quick anniversary getaway. Was exactly what we needed- enjoyed playing bags and using the firepit.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cora’s place is peaceful and serene. I loved seeing the chickens walk past our door each day. It is a fun place with the swinging bed that is super comfortable. Every time we go to Watertown, we have stayed at Cora’s Airbnb. It is unique, clean and cozy. You will want to stay here when you visit Watertown."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place! We had a wonderful time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful! Cora was an amazing host and a great communicator.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This has to be one of the “BEST”!!Airbnb units I have ever stayed in. Everything about this place was just so comforting. The rustic decor adds to the ambience of such a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. The floating bed is the perfect comfort for sleeping an watching TV.. We stayed for a week while I was on work assignment , I felt like was coming home every evening. We had our dog with us. The area surrounding the Silver Star is plenty of room to run our ex-large breed . I would recommend to stay here to anyone. I will definitely stay here again when in Watertown. Oh and every kind of shopping you will need is 8 min away.
10/10 Silver Star !!!
Cora is a great Host an made our stay a memory for a life time . Thank you very much🥰"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for our family. Our three year old loved “the chicken house”, as he dubbed it, and didn’t want to leave. Proximity to town was great as we were in town for a Lacrosse tournament. We visited Pelican Lake as well, which was just a few miles down the road. The boys asked if we are ever in Watertown again to stay here again!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Words cannot express how pleased we were to find this treasure of a getaway! Several times during our stay I found myself looking around and thinking to myself how perfect it was! We visited during a snow storm so it was the perfect place to play board games by the fireplace with cocoa and s'mores! There wasn't a lot that caught our attention in town, but the Redlin museum was a fun and free distraction to get out and stretch our legs."

Already have reservations made for when my daughter graduates at LATC in the spring!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a spot to relax alone from everyone or with some companion and have a very laid back time, this is your place to go. Definitely worth your money. This awesome little spot comes with everything you need while away from home. From toiletries to cooking ware. I spent a week here. it’s very quiet, drive into town is only 5min from this location. Always hot water, full kitchen, great fridge, great wifi speed. Let’s not forget super safe & super clean location too."

The kitchen was extremely well-equipped but I didn't stay long enough to cook meals. It was a warm few days but the AC kept the unit cool and comfortable. The patio area was shaded in the evening and the perfect place to end the day.
If I'm ever in Watertown again, i will certainly choose Cora's place."

Decor was incredible, and accommodations were top of the line. Was able to cook multiple from-scratch dinners with in the well stocked kitchen. The wood burning fireplace created a great ambiance, but wasn't necessary to keep warm.
I'm getting nit-picky here, but the only thing I would recommend is putting dimmer-switches for the abundant lighting.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you see the Silverstar Barn is available, snap it up!
Cora has thought of every detail to make your stay as comfortable as possible. From the many fuzzy throw blankets to the piles of pillows to the fully equipped kitchen and gas grill outdoors to all sorts of items stocked in the bathroom you may have forgotten, the ambiance of the Silverstar and Cora's hospitality will make it an exceptional stay. Cora was very responsive to messages and we would definitely stay there again.
I recommend checking out what is going on in Watertown, popping by the Dakota Butcher for either a meal or take a few steaks back to grill, walking through the Terry Redlin museum and the beautiful grounds, ordering the Pie of the Week at Dempsey's pizza and getting yourself a flight of beer at the Watertown Brewery."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! Unique however very comfortable. Host was very good with communication. Would definitely recommend.

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place was really nice. As someone from the city, being here made my experience of the American country side, extraordinary. Everything in this place was neat, well organized, and well suited for all my needs. Contacting the owner was quick and easy. They were always friendly and so were the people of the town. 100% would recommend to anybody!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an awesome place to stay…private quiet and a little romantic!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn is super comfortable and cozy! It was very clean and nicely decorated. You are able to hear the neighbors a little, but this was not bothersome to us.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique and simple place to say
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB is awesome. I had this rental on ""my list"" for over a year and the stay did not underwhelm. So convenient to have a smart TV to cast to and an actual DVD player for movies - we utilized both. I was so excited about the swing bed, but ended up feeling nauseous when it would move/swing (which is not an issue regarding the rental itself, just my experience with it). We used chairs on the corners to stabilize it and it worked great. Everything is spacious and open feeling, the cute lights added ambience, and the location was serene. Great communication with Cora and no issues with check-in or check-out. There were times we could hear the people next door through the wall (additional rental), but it wasn't bothersome, just a heads up. The kitchen was lovely - easy coffee in the morning and big fridge for our food and drinks. I hate being hot and am glad to report that the A/C unit is sufficient for the space and did an excellent job keeping us cool. Lots of room in the shower and bathroom as well - I appreciated that.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and this one knocked it out of the park! It was amazing to have the woodstove during an October snowstorm. The swinging bed was so comfy and we enjoyed the complimentary Netflix to binge watch some while we hunkered down! The kitchen island is huge and was great for playing board games. The kitchen was well stocked with anything we needed for cooking and the oven was so new and fancy! Loved the huge fridge space as well! We would definitely stay again and also have our eye on a few other properties Cora owns!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Silver Star Barn is extremely welcoming and felt like we were staying in our own home. Having coffee watching the sunrise or coming back to a wood burning stove to warm up in the evening- I miss it already and can’t wait to come back. If you think the pictures look good, the ambiance is even better in person.
If you like generic and sterile hotel rooms that might have a mini fridge, this isn’t the place for you. It was great to have a well stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, and high speed internet access all while being a short drive into town."

The accommodations were not only clean and comfortable but incredibly spacious, offering plenty of room for us to relax and unwind. The grounds of the property were nothing short of a paradise. We enjoyed sprawling outdoor spaces that allowed us to embrace the natural beauty of the area, and the size of the property made us feel like we had our own private retreat. It was the perfect backdrop for outdoor activities and gatherings.
The location was fantastic, allowing us to explore the surrounding area and enjoy all that it had to offer. We can't wait to return, and we would highly recommend this host to anyone looking for an exceptional Airbnb experience!"

The property itself was a dream for hosting an event.

It was great to have a washer and dryer and lots of hangers and places to hang things to dry. We had no problem cooking dinner there, the bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. It’s a little off the beaten path so be sure to bring what you need so you can settle in once you arrive. Very cute place! Enjoyed our stay."

A destined spot to add some custom details to our excursion from professionals!! They blend power & space to make their own 6 door truck, amazing & huge!!
We enjoyed our visit & still had plenty of privacy. Accommodations are nicer than at my own house! Angel has it full of extras (food, zip lock baggies, paper plates, seasonings, butter, coffee, toaster strudels…) We also visited Sandys bar in Emery for famous lamb pieces & even better was Hartford steak house! My favorite part was the adjustable bed base…I could elevate my legs which helped tremendously with my back! I loved visiting with the family run business owners & employees, they were so kind & helpful! Genuine good people!! We want to confidently recommend this location & it’s a Must if you own a FORD! !!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. Sure beats a motel room and much cleaner. Quality in every respect. I won't go into detail because the owners have a very accurate description on AirBnb site. It's not huge so pay attention to narrative from owner sleeping accomodations and number of guests. There was a picnic table and chairs outside, so spent evenings out there. The town of Lake Preston has a nice grocery store and several places to eat. Definitely would stay there on a repeat visit."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Could not have asked for a more perfect place to stay. The bed and pillows were just like home. Kitchen well stocked with cookware and spices.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Split between 2 people it’s cheaper than getting motel rooms that don’t come close to touching the amenities space and convenience of having a house to yourself. Would stay again! Very close to local lakes with great fishing.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were here on a 3 generation ice fishing trip. Thoroughly enjoyed fishing this area for the first time. Caught tons of Northern and crappies and a few perch sprinkled in. The place itself was phenomenal. Centrally-located, appears to be brand new. So everything is sparkling clean, and all in perfect condition. The space was super usable. My only problem was that my seven-year-old daughter wanted to stay in the cabin all day and not go out ice machine: 😁. couple of things I really appreciate it, we're having a coffee for the Keurig, little games for children or even adults to play. And the inflatable Sofa pullout was amazing. Thanks David for helping us enjoy our fishing trip!"

We would have loved to explore the entire place but we were traveling with 2 small children so we only made use of the living area and one bedroom. The place was very clean and comfortable! There was a storm outside so it was relaxing watching the lightning from the windows. Would love to stay again if we are ever in the area.

The kitchen was fully equipped with every cooking implement you could possibly imagine or want, which made preparing meals easy. Details down to ziploc bags, laundry soap and coffee were covered!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is set up as a pheasant hunting lodge and has about any combination of bedding you could want or need. We 4 silver-haired old ladies in our late 70s and early 80s just don't want to have to sleep with anyone, so the 2 bedrooms with 2 twin beds each were perfect for us and no one slept in the 3rd bedroom that had, I think, a queen bed. It was nice, as well, 2 have 2 bathrooms on the main floor (one of which was 2 steps down from the kitchen into the back laundry area. All was perfect for us, and the kitchen was VERY WELL FURNISHED with about every appliance, spice, dishes you could ever want. About 1/4 mile from the owner's parents who came to check on us when we had a little difficulty connecting to the internet. (The basement had numerous beds set up as well as a well-furnished game room but not all of us even set foot in the basement."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cozy and comfortable! The area is beautiful and extremely quiet. Would highly recommend, it was only 2 of us with the whole house and it was a great stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this piece of remote paradise! Very comfortable for our large family and dogs!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great value. Clean and welcoming. Absolutely love it.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A perfect place for our family to stop and have some peace and quiet on our way to Mt. Rushmore. Beautiful open area to view the stars at night.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are no words to describe this setting as they have all been used before.
Such a peaceful place - it just feels like home the second you step into it. It had everything we needed, the house is so soundproof that we didn’t even hear all the thunder from the storm. We haven’t seen one for years - it was like a bonus. We will be booking another stay here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful stay for our family. It was a perfect stopover for us on our way from eastern WI to the Badlands.
A ton of room, incredibly quiet rural setting where we played frisbee and moo’d at the local cows.
Our son loved the map guestbook and old barn."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It did not take long for us to make ourselves right at home at Jennifer's! It was the perfect place for what we needed. We met up with my sister & her family here for an overnight rest before heading off for a trip through the Badlands. The location was convenient & easy to find. Easy check in, tons of space! 7 beds in the basement we didn't even need to touch... between the the 3 bedrooms, pull out couch & chair, all 8 of us enjoyed a good night's rest upstairs. The pool table was a hit. The place is well suited for groups and caters to hunters. We felt welcome and had no questions or concerns about anything. I appreciated Jennifer's proactive communication. Comfortable place to stay and a really great place for us to meet up to kick off a fun vacation. Very grateful for the many wonderful memories that started at Jennifer's place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an awesome place! Lots of open land, big skies, tons of room inside the house, plenty of parking with wrap around driveway and even fun stuff like a foos ball and pool table. Wish we could’ve stayed longer and did some hunting, but it was perfect for what we needed! And to be able to have our dog’s crates in the garage was a total bonus! All around very pleased!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this lovely home as part of our journey across country. Jen’s place was perfect. SO big, it was just my hubby and I plus our two dogs and we could have fit 10 more people very easily! The home itself is off the main street driving into town which was nice. The yard is huge, not fenced, but we honestly we only saw a couple of cars pass by the house they entire time we there so it didn’t matter with the dogs. There is also a little cafe close by, 281 cafe, that’s wonderful: great fried chicken and shakes!!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will not be disappointed.
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer is wonderful!:) Nothing to be disappointed by, beautiful nature view, wonderful communication, friendly and kind hearted people and cozy and relaxing."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the peacefulness & beauty of the location. The house was clean, comfy, and came with all of the amenities needed! The location is convenient as well. We will definitely come back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,is just perfect
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed here after a full day of driving cross-country for a move. The location was quiet and secluded despite being just a short drive from the interstate. There were plenty of beds in addition to large rooms and spacious backyard to get together and hang out. I’ll be sure to keep this place in mind if we are ever in the area again!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy and comfortable house. Peaceful setting, well equipped home, highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lots of rooms and space, great kitchen!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic house and amenities. Very spacious and friendly hosts.
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay very clean! We stayed there for a week of pheasant hunting, they have everything you need (we cooked a lot) and very secluded. Loved the downstairs with the pool table...I would recommend if your in the area...Will stay there again!"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Perfect location if you want to do some hunting. Very clean well kept secluded vacation spot.
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"We made a brief stop at Matt’s place on our way through the area. It was clean, comfortable and just what we needed for the night. Although we were not on a hunting trip, I think this would be a perfect stay for a pheasant trip, with plenty of room for hunters! Everything was well stocked and we had everything we needed. Thanks Matt!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,You won’t be disappointed while staying here.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"You will not be disappointed in the quality of this stay, every immenity imaginable just like your own home"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matt’s place was the perfect spot to rest on our road trip. I absolutely would recommend it to anyone. It was comfortable, cozy, and relaxing."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s enough capacity for even big family. We were so relaxed during staying here.
2020-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot! Its very much a farm house but conveniently located.
There were just two of us and our dogs, but there would have been room for 10 more! Great value for all of that space! The grounds were kept nice and our dogs loved running in the yard and down the road to see the cows.
Unfortunately we were too tired from our long drive to enjoy the game room downstairs, but looks like fun!
Incase you didn’t notice in the listing, dogs have to stay downstairs. And there isn’t a fenced yard, but the house sits back on a road that is pretty far from the highway, so there’s plenty of room for them to roam.
Would recommend this place to anyone! It’s not fancy, but comfy. Would be a perfect spot for a hunting group or a small family reunion."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Matt’s place is great! I would recommend this place to anyone. Lots of nice touches and plenty of room.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was amazing for our group lots of beds lots of pots and pans lots of privacy we were able to have a walk-through for a football team in the field I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a group gathering and have some alone time
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great pit stop for our family vacation. Absolutely love the place. Will definitely stay again if we come back through this way. The place was clean as can be. They are in the process of installing central air but they had portable ACs that kept the house more than cool on 95 + degree day
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Plenty of space and very clean! Beautiful property, and the bed was super comfy. Highly recommend!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful farm setting.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great people to rent from!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stop while traveling through South Dakota!!
Matt provides a wonderful home for both short-term and long-term stays. The house is fully stocked with essential amenities plus more!!
The WiFi did not work, but that was OK with us because we were finally able to get a good night’s rest and have a relaxing morning over a delicious pot of coffee.
The property is huge (dogs will love it). Be careful if you are arriving at night as the street sign where you turn right is not that visible in the dark.
This was true county living. :)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matt’s place is a great stopover if you are traveling through South Dakota, as I was. The place is remote, which means I didn’t have a cell signal, and that was fine with me. The check-in was a snap, and the kitchen had everything needed to make the stay easy. The place was convenient from the I-90 and was easy to find. Recommend for a quick stop!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stopover on our cross country trip. Very quiet and peaceful.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Definitely a hunting lodge during the pheasant season, and worked great for us out-of-season. We had a retreat here because our conference went virtual due to COVID. Great space, convenient location, kitchen with everything we needed, comfy sleeping spaces, and more than we could have asked for! TV and internet worked great. Hostess stopped by just to check in and dropped off cookies which was so nice! Gave us recommendations on a pizza place nearby that was delicious (Outback in Plankinton). We played games, had a fire, and just enjoyed country living for a week! Highly recommend and we plan to be back if we ever need a place to host another small group gathering!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved everything about the house and surrounding area. Huge yard, the house is bigger than it looks in pictures, the downstairs is such a fun area to play foosball and pool or just hang out and visit, the kitchen has anything you need to make a homemade dinner, the rooms are nice and everything is just placed so well throughout the house! It gave us that feeling of home! We are a Midwest family and when I think Midwest lifestyle this home fits it to a T! The only pain point we had experienced was it did get pretty warm in there in the later afternoon/evening, but it was in the high 90's outside. However, they do supply you with plenty of fans and there were 3 AC units upstairs to try and keep it cool. It was bearable for all the adults, but we had an infant and the heat really got to him and it took a long time for him to fall asleep comfortably. But again it was very hot outside and we did have quite a few people in the house! Such a great experience though and we will totally be coming back! If you are looking for that country lifestyle experience this is definitely the place for you! Thanks again Matt!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great location for a stay on the way to the Badlands. Matt is a great host and made check in easy.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,A
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to settle down for the night or many nights! Good for a small to medium size group with pool table, foosball table, poker table. The air con is floor units so if it's 70 or above at night, it might get a little warm. It's a great place though and the rest of the year air con isn't needed here."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A safe and secluded place right where we needed it! There are no other homes around and that privacy was welcome. There aren’t any other Airbnb’s around this location either. Glad to have found it. We played a lot of foosball and even got to watch a thunderstorm roll on. Matt was a wonderful host. Thank you.
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Matt's place for one night during our Trip to Badlands/Rushmore. It is located only 10 minutes off the I-90 highway in a quiet area surrounded by greenery. The place was very clean and had great amenities like Poker Table, Pool Table, Foosball Table if you are visiting with friends. There was a large living room, and the kitchen had all the needed things. We had a very comfortable stay. I would totally recommend it."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a place that allowed safe travel during the coronavirus pandemic while traveling with our dog. This place was perfect - we especially enjoyed the beautiful sunrise in the morning. Thanks to Matt, who answered all questions quickly!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! Clean, well stocked, lots of space, and Matt was very quick to respond and communicate. We'll be back!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked Matt's a few hours before showing up after deciding we wanted to push a little further into our cross country trip. He was quick to respond and made check-in easy for a late arrival. It was clean and had plenty of space. We were in and out pretty quickly, but for our short time there I have no complaints."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place. Quiet, clean and safe place to stop. Loved playing pool down stairs."

Very clean which was an important part to me. Strongly recommend if you looking for a place to take your family to just get away!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience. I highly recommend Matt’s place.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place was clean and quiet. There were several things to do including a poker table, a pool table and foosball. The house was very roomy and had 2 large screen TV’s. All the amenities were furnished which was great."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was wonderful. Melissa is a gem and totally responsive to every need. The house was cozy, clean and comfortable. She even worked with us for an early check-in. I know that's not always possible. Everything ""worked"" as far as appliances, lights, etc. A few obvious ongoing repairs (sheetrock, etc.) but nothing that kept our stay from being awesome. Plenty of room. Pet friendly. We had fewer family members stay than planned but it would still have been more than ample if all 10 showed up. The beds were so comfortable and a nice touch was having My Pillows on the beds which is what we sleep on at home! The home felt much like visiting my husband's parents home when they were living. I'm not sure of the vintage of the house but it definitely has a 1900's feel about it like the doorknobs, windows, ceilings, etc. Fun and lovely Americana decor. We are in the area often to see family and depending on overnight needs, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! This one is a keeper!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,They were great at communicating. The furnace went out that night and they were over in 10 minutes to fix it. Was a great place to stay for our hockey weekend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and amazing host! She even went by before we got there to turn the lights on for us since we were coming in late. So sweet!! We would absolutely stay again! Great little town too!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Every year I visit Huron with other teachers for a science and math teacher conference. It can be challenging to find a hotel room and some of us have to travel with our kids. Having a house for everyone just a few blocks from the event center was wonderful. The house also has activities for kids.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melissa's home had all the midwest charm. An old farm house feel with all the cozy touches. Melissa clearly understands large families and there was accommodations for all ages, from the pool table to toys and games for toddlers. The kitchen was well stocked including a coffee grinder, 3 kinds of coffee, and quality hot tea bags. There is also a nice water park within walking distance that we did not have time to use, but would have been perfect family entertainment. We would definitely stay here again....."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, clean. We enjoyed our stay here. Loved the pool table and ring swing game too!"

Melissa had multiple indoor and outdoor games to enjoy!
She was super flexible and helpful, definitely enjoyed our stay with her!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house is very nice and we enjoyed our stay. Some things could have been better, the couch and bed for one. They felt older and hard to get comfortable. The house is nice and spacious. We were in huron for wheel jam. While the house may be only 6 blocks from the fairgrounds, the walk would be about a mile to have gotten to the actual event. You could walk to downtown or the pool though. It was 90 degrees pretty much the whole time we were in town so we chose not to walk anywhere. We would probably stay again if we went back to huron!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"I booked American Blessings for our family to have Christmas together as we have outgrown our parent's local house. American Blessings was a perfect fit for us to cook, eat, open gifts, and space to stay over night for those that came from out of town. Listing was as described. The house was simple, clean and well furnished. The pool table was a lot of fun to have available. The host was quite responsive and accommodating."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at this property! I was in town from Nashville, TN and was walking at the SD State Fairgrounds. Talk about prime location! Melissa's property was less that a miles from the fairgrounds, and it made my long hours worthwhile knowing when I went back at night that I would be comfy and cozy and in a nice quiet neighborhood.

Melissa is also VERY quick to respond to any questions or issues I had. We lost power for a few hours one night, but so did 400+ other homes. I messaged Melissa at 2AM to let her know and she responded within 2 minutes. Now that's customer service! Thank you Melissa for a wonderful stay and I hope your property is available next time I'm in town. I look forward to staying again in the future!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our stay for my sisters wedding. The house was very accomidating. Although I wish there were 2 full bathrooms, the 1 did just fine since each bedroom has mirrors to get ready for the day with. The house was very kid friendly with some games already available to play. The porch was perfect for sitting and enjoying the beautiful weather while watching cars pass by. Great location as well so the drive is 5 minutes to many places and also many things are within walking distance."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, very clean home with everything we needed for our two night stay. It was nice to have so much room for our 2 year old and our 10 month old. Melissa let us check in a little early and that was greatly appreciated. We have never used internet tv and they were willing to come over and show us, that was really nice. We don't have internet tv accounts so we were unable to watch the local news like we are used to in the morning and evening, but it was fine. Being so close to Splash Central water park and where my grandma lives was so convenient! I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Huron."

Melissa has thought of everything, from kleenex in every room to extra, towels, linens, laundry soap, filled ice cube trays and all sorts of games. We had a blast when we had other out of town family come over one night. We played several of the games available to us, including pool. So spacious and comfortable and decorated in red white and blue throughout. Melissa was a great communicator, as well. Can't say enough about how smooth the process was!"

Neat architectural features in this older home, like the light switches and the heating registers!

Plus they put sand out on walk( as it snowed while we were there)!"

Cozy cabin, bigger then on the photos with absolutely breathtaking sunrise over the lake in the morning. such a great place for winter/summer fishing or just chilling at the lake. The cabin is right on a shore, so you can open the windows, enjoy the breeze and a view. We checked in last minute, so we really appreciated fast communication!"

I am also not super tech literate when I am on the road so the information was sent to me probably somewhere! There were other wonderful guests who let me ask and showed me where I was so it worked out great. The view on the lake in the morning was spectacular! And we slept really well in the quiet room. Thank you for hosting!"
