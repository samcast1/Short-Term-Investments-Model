From something as small as the new sponge at the sink to the yummy smelling shampoo and conditioner, soft towels (a lot of them), the comfy beds to the way she communicated - I would 100% recommend Megan's Place to anyone.
We visited the U.S from Canada and selected Megan's place for the price, proximity and cleanliness. It's a bargain in comparison to the nearby hotels and blows the state of those hotels out of the water! From the moment we arrived it was easy to find, simple to unlock the door, everything we needed was in the rooms and it was just SO clean and homely.
Megan, thank you for making this stay completely painless and being so kind, thoughtful and responsive. When we end up visiting these relatives again, I know where I'm staying!"

There is a green water above ground pool out back. With a toddler staying with us, the gate was very easy to unlatch and VERY UNSAFE.
The owner stopped by everyday to complain about how we parked. Don‚Äôt try to fit 3 or 4 vehicles here.
There is someone living in the basement. The listing just states no basement. We were not made aware of this and left early because of it.
There are a lot of spiders in the house.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space & great value! It is off a busier street & you can hear a train throughout the day / night. So if you‚Äôre a sensitive sleeper that may bother you, but it‚Äôs an excellent location to 90 & downtown Batavia."

2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,Good place to stay on the way home after a long road trip. The electric fireplace was going & a nice sign in the foyer to welcome us. It was on a noisy road & attached to a house that didn‚Äôt seem to have anyone living there but would‚Äôve been good to know about those 2 things on the listing as we got to the Airbnb in the dark. A good pitstop during our road trip.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bruce‚Äôs place was the best option for me as I had to book a place last minute. However, I was lucky it was available because it was an awesome stay as it was right on the main road but the inside had everything I needed. Bruce‚Äôs place was clean and comfortable and it matched the descriptions accurately.
I liked the metal framing exposed in the living room ceiling as well as the hand made concrete counters in the kitchen."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Didn't have the pleasure of meeting Bruce but he did communicate very well. Did not take long to reply. He also allowed us to check in earlier while some places don't. Place was clean and beautiful. The yellow pillows on the couch were probably one of my favorite touches. So soft and comfortable. Bed was a little small for my husband and I but that's mostly due to us being used to a king. Bed was still comfortable. Overall I would recommend if needing a place in the area.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Only stayed 1 night, nothing to complain about. What you see is what you get."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute place and Bruce kept it stocked with everything we needed! We stayed for a concert at Darien Lake - if you‚Äôre doing the same make sure to pre-book Ubers or taxis because it was nearly impossible getting one to / from. Once we did, it was a great stay."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce's place was exactly what we needed, a small, comfortable spot to relax and wind down after a day of hiking and driving. The location is convenient to alot of major areas of interest, although I do think it's worth pointing out that it is directly on a busy road with a lot of traffic, you wouldn't know that with the photos and writeup. Also, the space was clean but floors may need to be a little extra cleaned, bare feet were black after walking around for only a few minutes, but overall a very comfortable, relaxing stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location was perfect for what we needed, since we lived in Batavia for 33 years,it was nice to come back and visit."

I have family in the area so this was the perfect location to have my own space while visiting. Perfect central location to anywhere in Genesee County or Buffalo. The apartment was stocked with water and cooking supplies and the design touches made it feel modern and comfortable.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Comfortable place with heated floors and good internet. Bruce is a great host and let me extend my stay last minute. He also kept the driveway shoveled during a snowstorm. Neighborhood is very quiet. No laundry but laundromat is nearby.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean and cozy place to say when I came with my daughter to see Hamilton in Rochester and to explore the area for her 16th birthday! It was great having a location that was central to Rochester and Niagara Falls!
The apartment was very clean, warm (for these North Carolinians), and beautiful! Exactly as described. The kitchen was especially beautiful and well-supplied, although we never used it. The only thing I wish I‚Äôd been prepared for was the road noise; however, the White Noise app on my phone was an easy remedy. The bed was very comfortable!
As an aside, I thought I‚Äôd recommend The Coffee Press for excellent coffee and food/wine if you need breakfast or lunch out while in Batavia. And Roman‚Äôs on Main had delicious food and wine for dinner, with gluten-free options!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Everything was clean and as advertised. Kitchen was well stocked with utensils etc. I slept on the pull-out couch and was soft but not a full pull out, more like an extension of the couch, and traffic was a little loud, but I'm sure very quiet in the bedroom.

We really enjoyed the space as it was prefect for two and quite quaint. Note that you are located off a main road to and from Batavia, so there is some road noise, but not enough to disrupt our sleep. While we did not use any appliances or watch any TV, those items are there and of good quality. It was a quick stay, but a very good one.
Thanks for everything, Bruce!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a clean, comfy stop on our way to Rochester's Museum of Play at a fraction of the cost of downtown hotels. Our children loved having a separate bedroom with their own beds. There were other fun touches throughout they enjoyed as well. Some minor issues encountered during the stay were immediately addressed by the host. We did not use the laundry facilities or kitchen but the latter seemed well equipped (note, no dishwasher). We would stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute apartment ! It‚Äôs been upgraded and the beds are very comfortable! It is also incredibly clean. The only difficulty we had was finding the entrance but the host was super responsive and gave us details about the side of the house. Would absolutely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place to stay ! Well kept and cozy !! Jessica is incredibly sweet and communicative ! Felt like a home away from home üíï
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay at a reasonable price
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,R and R Home Away from Home is the best lil get away from home. Everything was so neat and tidy. Upon walking up the stairs yu immediately feel at home. Jessica is a wonderful host and goes above and beyond to make sure yur stay is one yu'll wanna come back to. Everything was stocked up and ready to go when Yu needed it. Also she gives great recommendations for places to visit like I recommend trying Pub Coffee Hub its in walking distance and makes really good breakfast burritos (my favorite is the M.F.B.A with both sausage and bacon) and if yur a fan of Friends the show yu'll love their selection!! Again can't thank Jessica enough for making us feel at home we had a great time and hope to do it again soon üíô
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice little place. I enjoyed staying there.

The apartment was immaculate and anything and everything we needed or wanted was at our fingertips. Stay with Jessica! You won't be sorry!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent - this will be the place we look for first when visiting family nearby. After staying in a few, this is the cleanest, most comfortable, and best located apartment in its price range in the area.
This newly renovated apartment is better than other places we‚Äôve stayed where the work was done to minimal standards - to the contrary the kitchen and bathroom were solidly built and well-done. Photos and description were completely accurate.
Our family of 4 was very comfortable here - beds were just right and our school-aged kids loved having their own twin beds in a separate room.
Overall, a wonderful new option - we‚Äôll be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was perfect for what we needed!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute space! I wanted to live there. It‚Äôs a cozy little apartment and met all our needs. Would definitely stay here again next time I go to Darien for a concert!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica was great and the place was wonderful! Highly recommend, when I see another show at Darien Lake I‚Äôll definitely be booking this place again! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is exactly as described. Other reviews mentioned the noise...the place is located on a state route that goes through the city of Batavia. Yes, there is street noise, mostly early in the morning when people are going to work. Before 7a, it is not too bad...maybe a truck going through at 5:30a but not steady traffic. I would suggest using the white noise machine or getting ear plugs. Sometimes late in the evening, after 9a, there can be noise. er
Jessica is very responsive if you need something and very considerate to one's privacy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful spot to stay. Lots of room for four adults.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean and spacious. Each bedroom was neat and pleasingly decorated. Loved the twinkle lights in the twin bed room!. The kitchen was fairly well outfitted (even had a French Press) with all the necessary utensils to cook our meals.. Keurig pods were available, but luckily we brought sweetener as there was little sugar supplied. The bathroom was wonderful - 2 bathrobes provided! The towels were good quality. Jessica ALWAYS responded quickly to my questions and was very helpful and friendly. She was flexible with our check our time, accommodating our schedule. 5 stars overall!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jessica‚Äôs air b&b is fresh and was remodeled with quality work. Jessica is very responsive, accommodating and very thoughtful in how she supplied the apartment. Incredibly clean and I‚Äôm picky about this. Enjoyed being within walking distance to Dewitt Park for our morning exercise. I‚Äôve stayed at more than a dozen listings and not many would I say I would revisit again if in the area, but I definitely would for this one."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a very comfortable, well-appointed (even had guest robes in the bathroom), and nicely decorated space. The multiple candles (battery operated of course) are a nice touch and create a relaxed environment. The bathroom and shower were very well done and everything throughout was new, clean, and well maintained. There can be a bit of traffic noise but there's even a sound machine in the bedroom (we didn't need it but it's there if you wanted). Thank you, Jessica, it's clear that you've worked hard to create and maintain a great space for your guests. We would certainly stay here again."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,I loved staying at Jen‚Äôs cottage! I booked her cottage for the 2024 total solar eclipse and it was the perfect spot. The lake was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great weekend away for our 11th anniversary, had everything we needed, golfed at Trent Hills golf course, super fun. The town of Batavia was cute. Cause a few bass off the dock. Wished it wasn‚Äôt so weedy maybe could have swam and no shade from the sun or umbrella. But overall we‚Äôd go back again."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice simple cottage on a lake. Very convenient to Batavia.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,December travel felt rustically cozy. While the weather was chilly and drizzly which was to be expected this time of year the views and location felt like a family homestead. Ed was communicative from the time of booking until check in. I can't wait to comeback when the weather is a bit warmer to enjoy the wonderful outdoor space.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time, caught lots of fish, and loved every second of our trip. We hope to stay there again. Thank you Ed!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home had everything we needed, and was comfortable and quiet. Our favorite place to relax was on the terrace overlooking the lake or leisurely paddling one of the canoes around the lake. The water was so clear and the water lilies were enchanting - we found three different varieties. During a very rainy day we enjoyed watching the storm through the large windows and playing some of the board games that we found."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a beautiful spot on a peaceful lake. Neighbors were friendly also. Ed communicated promptly when posed a question. We loved it, our second time there and will go there again ."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for what we were looking for, quiet/peaceful/relaxing. Mostly enjoyed sitting on the deck and paddle boating around the lake. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, this is a wonderful place to stay! Thank you Ed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for the July4th weekend, Ed‚Äôs place was so quiet and peaceful even though houses are close by. The area is a small friendly community. Nothing is too far away in town. Highly recommend for a stay outside of the city. We will most likely be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I was going to the buffalo-east area for a wedding. The price was similar to hotels a little more but worth the upgrade. Great backyard deck for relaxing. Wi-Fi good for work from home. Dog could come too which is a must for me.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to enjoy a vacation. The lake is beautiful and the bed is very comfortable
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very beautiful place. Relaxing
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our vacation at the Little Piece of Heaven - even though the neighboring houses are close by, we had plenty of privacy and peace to just relax and watch the lake from the porch. The decorations were cute and home-y but still made us feel like we're on vacation. There was plenty to do if we wanted, but being able to relax and have a drink in the sun was just what we needed. We'd definitely come back again if available, thank you Ed & Anna for the wonderful stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for the PGA Championship but wantes nothing to do with this City and Eds place exceeded our expectations

The lake view, sunrise, and sunset are awesome!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was peaceful, quiet, clean, and very cute. Everything we needed for our stay in Batavia. Ed was also a very kind, accommodating, and responsive host. We arrived for our stay in the middle of a pretty severe winter storm and Ed proactively reached out to make sure we were okay, which says a lot about the type of host he is. Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Little Piece of Heaven is a lovely A Frame lake house with a peaceful view of Horseshoe lake. We loved sitting on the deck and watching the ducks swimming. It is very quiet and minutes from central Batavia. The house is clean, and the bathroom and kitchen are nice. The place is stocked with staples to make cooking easy. We enjoyed our second stay and hope to come again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!!! Relaxing lakeside view. Very cozy. Host was quick to answer all of our questions.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was great. Exactly like described. Clean. Ed provided us with breakfast items in the fridge and cupboards. All the amenities anyone would really need. The fishing in the lake was really good. My boyfriend and I caught more than a few when using the paddle boat. Terry Hills golf course is less than 5 mins away so we golfed one day. There is a fire pit In the backyard with lots of wood already provided. My dogs really enjoyed swimming in the lake. Just a really nice stay/weekend for us to get out of town. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet relaxing stay somewhere.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Truly a peaceful nicely decorated cottage! We did use the paddle boat, but no time for the canoe.
Ed had many treats & things for us, which we appreciated!
Our dogs loved staying there too!
We will return again to A Little Peace of Heaven!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay at Ed‚Äôs place! The view is amazing and the house is very welcoming.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed‚Äôs place is a piece of haven. Imagine laying in bed and watching birds flying and fish jumping on the water. Bed was very comfortable and paddle boat was fun to take out and enjoy the lake.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably the most perfect get-away location I have found so far. The lake view is astonishingly beautiful, and the entire place feels a lot more secluded that it really is. While there are homes in the area, I did not hear one single sound during my stay, and the nighttime was very peaceful. I am definitely keeping this house in mind for future WNY trips and stays."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It truly is a little piece if heaven! The view was incredible to see everyday. We cooked almost everyday and Ed had everything we needed to do make our own meals. It was warm and cozy and surprisingly spacious the bed was comfortable. the kids even had a great time! Ed was so helpful and responsive couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience.

2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice camp great location. Within a hour to Niagara Falls and Letchworth State Park. Nice lake very quiet. Nice to sit on dock and watch the fish, couldn't swim off dock due to a lot of weeds. We went to swimming area on other side of lake. The only negative would be there wasn't a lot of room in the refrigerator due to food left there and the counters had to be cleaned a lot of food crumbs all over. Other than that it's a very nice place and great for a getta way."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a little piece of heaven is exactly what we were looking for. plenty of space for inside relaxation and a private yard for outdoor fun. The house has wifi and was cool in the summer sun. We grilled for dinner one night and took a quick ride into town for a trip to the local brewery. Great for a weekend getaway!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time staying here. We absolutely love it! Beautiful, quiet lake, fishing off the dock was incredible, such a cozy house. Close to Batavia, short drive to Buffalo, Rochester or Niagara Falls. Our favorite place to stay while visiting family in the area. And Ed is super nice!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed‚Äôs place is very charming and cozy. It‚Äôs secluded and peaceful but so close to many stores as the same time. Just under an hour to Letchworth State Park where we were headed. We had a lovely stay.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay in ‚Äúa little piece of heaven‚Äù was fabulous. The location very close to a lovely mirrored lake that was close to family and a couple of terrific restaurants, a friendly & helpful host, comfortable & attractive accommodations & a terrific ‚Äúvibe‚Äù all combined to make it a great AirBNB stay!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"‚ÄúA Little Peace of Heaven‚Äù could not have been a more accurate description. My husband, myself and our 5 month old stayed here for one night and I wish we had booked for a week. We use AirBNB often and this is my favorite place that we have ever stayed. The location was perfect and only a few miles from a great downtown with great food, an awesome brewery, and any grocery stores (or Target for diaper wipes!) that you may need. Traveling with a baby isn‚Äôt easy but we felt refreshed and rejuvenated after we left here. Thank you, Ed for your hospitality! You thought of everything!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Peace of Heaven was exactly that. This property is all around peaceful. Amazing getaway for any reason. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Ed‚Äôs place was warm and welcoming. The bed is comfortable and the view of the lake is very nice. The only things I‚Äôd recommend is wifi and curtains in the bathroom. Thank you for hosting us!

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ed's cottage is very comfortable and clean, and the lake view is peaceful. We made ourselves right at home. The only improvement I can think of is to offer wi-fi. Otherwise, it's perfect!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ed's Little Piece of Heaven exceeded our expectations tremendously. It was a beautiful cozy little home in Batavia, NY close to restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. We made the trip up to Western New York to visit nearby family for Thanksgiving and Ed's home offered all the amenities we needed and more. Ed provided some nonperishable food items that were available to us, a coffee machine, and just about any essentials you would need to make a comfortable stay. The home was very clean, which is a plus!! The pictures of this home do not do it justice, it is peaceful, a nice size for 2-3 people, cozy, beautiful home on the lake. I would stay at Ed's place again and again! The only other thing that should be noted is that there is no Wifi at Ed's home and only basic cable. This was no issue for us as we still did have cell service and utilized our hotspot. I would suggest bringing DVD's if you plan on having a movie night in. (DVD provided at Ed's). Everything else was amazing! We had a great stay at A Little Piece of Heaven!!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful place on a small lake. Quiet and private. Perfect for a weekend away. Very clean and has all of the amenities. Ed was very accommodating and responsive. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer. We‚Äôll definitely be back.

2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed's family 'little peace of heaven' truly is all that and more. Sure easy to find, bright open and comfortable. The lake is small but quiet and Ed has 2 canoes and a paddle boat that you can use to explore. You can eat on the deck, relax in the chairs on the dock or spend time in the very comfortable living room or dining room and enjoy the many games they have as well. The kitchen is fully stocked and the makings for breakfast included. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice having the fan and ceiling fan along w/ the breeze that blew in from the lake. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to the area (and maybe come to the area Just to stay here!)"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable house on a small picturesque lake. All the needed amenities for a vacation or short stay. Nice deck for sitting. Extremely convenient to restaurants, shopping and services. A small city in a beautiful rural area but accessible to Buffalo, Niagara and other nearby areas. We enjoyed shopping for our grandson at the old-fashioned toy store in town. Also convenient to the amusement park at Darien Lake."

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ed's place really is a little piece of heaven. My wife and I stayed for a few nights and certainly left a bit more relaxed than when we arrived.

We had a very nice day grilling up some clams, tying to catch some fish, and taking the boat out for a paddle. There was everything we needed and Ed was a great and welcoming host.
You are far enough away from the hustle and bustle but only 5 mins from restaurants and groceries if you need it!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, great price. No issues at all. Would love to make it back."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a restful and scenic place! We took the canoe out for a spin, and watched the fish from the dock. It was lovely!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the peace and quiet at Ed‚Äôs place. I enjoyed watching and hearing all the birds. The location was ideal for me. It is not easy to find places to stay in this area, so I am grateful that Ed opens his home to travelers. It is a real gem!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a serene relaxing place!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying at Ed's place very much. The lake is beautiful! And the home is very cozy and comfortable. I would love to stay again when the weather improves to really enjoy the outdoor space.
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed‚Äôs place is a fantastic spot to relax. We will certainly be back.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed is the perfect host and this cabin is definitely everything he says. A little peace of heaven indeed. It‚Äôs serene and scenic and to think it‚Äôs hand built by Ed and his son. It‚Äôs so warm and inviting we will definitely be going back. If we could stay half the year at the cabin and half home we would. Check out came too soon.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for several days over the thanksgiving holiday. The place was clean, convenient, and a perfect respite from the holiday craziness. There were various foods in the fridge and pantry, and getting in and out were easy. Ed was very communicative and helpful. Will stay again next time we're in town!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. I did not want to leave.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed is a great host! Charming & kind, you'll love getting to know him! He really makes you feel at home when you're a guest and has yummy breakfast treats. Waking up to the lake view from the bedroom is amazing. Enjoy his little piece of heaven!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a tranquil spot to relax and soak in nature, this is the place. Ed‚Äôs hospitality is spot on. Even though the weather was cool and rainy I was able to enjoy the outside view while sipping a nice hot cup of hot chocolate, stretched out on a window seat overlooking the lake. The furnishings are ample and comfortable. Ed contacted me the day of my arrival with clear instructions. I highly recommend this ‚ÄòLittle Piece of Heaven‚Äô."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed‚Äôs place was a pleasant surprise! We booked one night because we were doing a Halloween event in the area and we were travelling with our pets. We honestly didn‚Äôt except it to be so beautiful and wished we would of booked another night so we could of enjoyed it more fully, however that just means we will have to make it back! A++ accommodation! Highly recommend"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stayed here just passing through and we're surprised at what a gem this was. Will definitely return again.
2017-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 2 nights at Ed's cottage, to celebrate my husband's birthday and had a few things to do in the near by area (obstacle event & hockey game in BUF), Ed's cottage was a good location for a ""base"", as we live 2 hours in the opposite direction. The first night, we sat lake side with a glass of wine and a small fire, Ed left us enough fire wood to last an hour....it was very relaxing for the next day's busy schedule. The area had an unexpected heat wave the weekend we were there and although the cottage doesn't have a/c, we brought a fan (there's one in the cottage too) and survived, but didn't sleep good (we might be spoiled, as we have central a/c at home). I don't know the area well, and maybe we just caught the schedule just right, but there were freight trains at all hours through the night, that went through the area that can be heard, so if you're a light sleeper please keep this in mind. Otherwise, the cottage has everything you need, Ed is very easy to contact, check-in & check-out is super easy and sitting on the deck in the morning while we had our morning coffee was perfect. Per our future needs, we would consider Ed's cottage again."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed's house was fantastic! The house was very clean and welcoming, the view of the lake behind the house was gorgeous and serene. We had a little trouble finding the house at first because we checked in at night but Ed answered the phone right away and talked us through how to find the right place. He sincerely wanted us to enjoy our stay and that was evident in our conversation over the phone and the tidiness of his home. We were just traveling down I-90 and needed a place to stop and after 1 night we wished we had more days to spend there. Thank you for a fantastic stay! I would recommend this home to couples needing a quiet getaway or families with young kids (there are plenty of beds) :)"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a perfect little spot. Photos truly don't do Ed's place justice. We booked for a place to rest our head quickly while in town for a concert, but I wish we could have stayed for a week. A perfect little cottage that feels like home. Thanks again Ed!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely and comfortable one bedroom cottage on a small lake. The cottage has a 2 person canoe, a one person canoe, a paddle boat and plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy the tranquil setting. Highly recommended!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a spectacular place to relax and feel at home. The host offers abundant hospitality and clearly communicates all expectations. Even the neighbors are pleasant and welcoming! I highly recommend this lakeside venue if you're passing through the Buffalo or Rochester area.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed's place was a wonderful find in the Batavia area! Clean, easy to find, beautiful location, and perfect for our stay! Ed was very accommodating and helpful! Would definitely stay again!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a peaceful location with beautiful views of the lake, this is the place for you. We enjoyed having a fully stocked kitchen, use of the BBQ grill and being able to have morning coffee outside watching the fish jump. Only wish we could have stayed longer than one night. Will definitely be returning next year if it's not booked!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay by the water and so close to Batavia. Ed is a fantastic host and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more for a great stay. It is not a new structure but it met my expectations for an older lake cottage. The house felt comfortable with the windows open and fan on though there is no air conditioning. We also enjoyed access to the beach swimming area too which had a diving board and slide. I would stay again.
2017-07-01,4,Stayed one night,We were pleasantly surprised by the good location of the cottage on Horseshoe Lake. The building is a free standing cottage with one bedroom. Ed does not stay with his guests when they are there. Ed could not have been more helpful. The cottage is somewhat dated but certainly serviceable. It fit our needs of being close to family in the Batavia NY area.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great for my husband and our dogs to stay for the weekend. My husband enjoyed the fishing and I enjoyed the proximity to Buffalo.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed's place is heaven indeed! We came for two nights and the place was well prepared for us. Luxuries like milk and orange juice were waiting for us in the fridge. We enjoyed the facilities the place offered. Sailing the boat on the lake
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable rental right on the water. Host, Ed, goes above and beyond to be hospitable."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. The house and the lake are beautiful. Ed was very helpful and was happy to answer any questions we had.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ed's place is wonderful. It's right on the water, in a quiet neighborhood, has a full kitchen and outdoor grill. We definitely plan to visit again!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Heaven is as named and advertised. This was our second stay and we will certainly be back. But never soon enough.
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The name says it all! We stayed at Ed's over New Years weekend for a little extra space while visiting family. We never expected to be so well taken care of by Ed as well!
We arrived to him greeting us warmly with whatever we might need. Our stay didn't disappoint - the serene frozen lake and beautiful view was a joy and ended up being the mini break we never expected.
Practically speaking, everything you might need is here! The bed is very comfortable, the linens are lovely, and the sofa faces out a wall of windows over the lake. We currently live in an apartment, and we so loved the peace and serenity of Ed's place; something we don't get at home."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Peace of Heaven ‚Äî never wanted to leave, in fact! The layout of the home is perfect, allowing a view of the lake from just about everywhere. The patio and dock allow for serenity and relaxation. There is a nice walk to the woods nearby. Ed was extremely communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. Hoping to stay a bit longer next time! Thank you so much, Ed."
2016-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the cottage.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful cabin home nestled on a beautiful, quiet lake! Expectations exceeded all around."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ed was very prompt in his responses and extremely courteous. He made our very short stay at his wonderful cabin comfortable and easy. He went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and at home, which my son and I deeply appreciated.

I would recommend Little piece of heaven to people who are looking for a quiet oasis in nature. The lake is much more beautiful than in the pictures, and the house is fully appointed for the comfort. If we go back, we will definitely want to stay at Ed's house."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ed was very welcoming and helpful.
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A Little Peace of heaven is just that. The lake community was very quiet and peaceful. Accommodations and facility were well taken care of. Will stay there again when in the area.
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Ed was so accommodating and was so attentive to us. he provided so much for the price. The location was peaceful and will miss my coffee on the lake. Beautiful and relaxing !!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We arrived late at night and check-in was seamless. The home was very clean and comfortable. My son even said, ‚ÄúI would live here full-time!‚Äù Beds were comfortable, pillows were great, and the shower was perfect! This might be the best place we‚Äôve rented. Thank you for checking on us and being so kind. I‚Äôm so glad we chose to stay here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,absolutely perfect!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Linda and Phil went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. From the ice cream and water to the offer of firewood and extra chairs for a fire, they truly made our weekend special. The house was so beautiful inside and the location was perfect."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time using an ABB.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We had a lovely 2 night stay at the farmhouse. The setting was very peaceful and the horses were enjoyable in the background. Linda was a great host and fast to respond. The house was in pristine condition and she supplied more than enough products. The kids loved the treats! Definitely recommend for a quick or long term stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very comfortable and clean
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Home is beautiful and well taken care of! Linda was amazing. during a snow storm they took the time to shovel out walkways for us to get to our cars easily without us even asking! Definitely recommend if you are looking to stay in the area!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to stay, peaceful and quiet with places to keep your day fun only a few minutes away. We would definitely recommend this place for a stay if you are coming to the area!!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice enjoyed our stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent, really enjoyed our stay"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,So appreciate Linda and Phillip. They are exceptional hosts and provided a perfect home for our family to stay. It was warm and welcoming and the perfect place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,The home is an oasis of country privacy. Linda decorated the home exquisitely in fall and country fashion. Very clean with two fridges stocked with water and ice cream treats. Information for surrounding attractions and all appliances had instructions for easy use. Hosts very accommodating to insure we had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend and we would definitely book again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great more than what we wanted and communication was great as well for any questions we had , great host"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time! The house was clean, the beds were comfortable and the shower water stayed hot. The location was quiet, peaceful and pleasant. Would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is great, and the hosts, Linda and Phil, are absolutely lovely!
The house is very roomy and comfortable.
The beds are comfortable, and everything is squeaky clean.
One thing we REALLY appreciated was the absence of those awful chemical air 'fresheners' that are so unfortunately common in rentals.
Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the most amazing Airbnb our family has stayed in. Linda thought if absolutely everything to ensure we were comfortable and it felt like home. I 100% would recommend for anyone looking to stay in the area. (The horses and adorable decor are a great plus)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is adorable. So well stocked and clean. Great information regarding what to do in the area. We were extremely pleased with our experience!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,place was splotless and clean.Nice and Quiet
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this was a great place to stay. Linda is the best host iv ever had. I will definitely stay there again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Linda's home is located in farm country in Byron, New York. The location was perfect for us as we were staying within a mile from a family event taking place. The house has been recently remodeled and everything is perfect. We describe the decorating as modern country. The amenities are over and above what is expected including ice cream and ice cream treats in the freezers of both refrigerators. The air conditioning was fine for both floors for the weekend in July we spent. Linda and Philip were always available to answer any questions we had. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay for our family of 6."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oh my gosh, if I could give an Airbnb 6 stars this would be the one üòç
Very cute and comfortable, thoughtful hosts, and horses to watch‚Äîwhat more could I ask for??"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Linda is definitely a SUPERHOST x10!! Not one detail left out , definitely thought of EVERYTHING! We felt like we were right at home. Very peaceful & loved the decor! All the extra amenities were a nice surprise! From all kinds of ice cream in both freezer, cold water in frig, which was great since we arrived late! There were even travel size toiletries ( which was also great becuse someone forgot their tooth brush & toothpaste, lol. I definitely recommend her place & will be back!! TYSM!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give 6 or more stars. 5 does not do it justice. The small detached farmhouse is brand new construction and superbly furnished. There was an excellent interior decorator at work here. Everything harmonizes very well with each other. You immediately feel at home.
In front of the house there is a small fireplace with firewood and on the balcony there is a large gas grill. The beds are very comfortable.
The area is very quiet and you sleep very deeply here even with the windows open.
There is nothing lacking in the kitchen. The hosts are quite wonderful people. We had a nice longer conversation with them.
We wish Linda and phil always the best guests and still much joy with the farmhouse. Thank you!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well stocked for necessities. Super cozy and clean. Even ice cream and snacks for the kidsü§óü§ó
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"It was very homey, clean, peaceful. The ice cream was a nice surprise after 5+hour of driving."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Linda was an amazing host. This was easily the nicest Airbnb that any of us have ever been to. The location is is private and stunning. Every detail of the home was pristine and beautiful. There were clear instructions for everything we used and there were so many cute details. They have thought of everything that you need (plus things we didn't think of). The upstairs deck was a perfect place to sit and have coffee, taking in the scenery and watching the horses. The house is immaculately kept. It is a quiet area and a short drive to get to so many activities and sights. They had a great selection of brochures and guides for things to do in the area. I cannot say enough great things about this place. Highly recommend is an understatement. Thank you so so much to Linda for hosting our small group of Aerialists! We will be back next year for our 5k (if not sooner)."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This farmhouse is adorable. The decor is spot on! The thought they put into all of the amenities & information for the guests was amazing. Down to a table full of menus, & brochures of things to do in the area! It was SO BEAUTIFUL & PEACEFUL! The property is so well manicured, and the house was VERY CLEAN!! We would absolutely stay there again, and again!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful place. the house was spacious, clean, and accommodating I really appreciated starting here."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a get away from noise and stress, this is the perfect place. I reserved this place for Memorial Day weekend and it was beyond my expectation. The house is so clean and well decorated. Everything is new and organized. It‚Äôs about 1 hour 30 min away from Niagara Falls in Canada and 15 minutes away from Batavia NY where you can have a nice dinner and live music .
The only downside is that there are no food shopping markets close by, the closest is in Batavia NY, however I will definitely go back.
Linda is an amazing and great hostess, she really cares for the comfort of her tenants.
Thank you so much Linda for your hospitality.
Elizabeth."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My crew loved the location. Linda was very responsive to any questions we had. I would highly recommend anyone coming to the area to book their stay here.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just needed a place to sleep but got soooo much more! My family of 4 adults came to Rochester for a wedding. Everything was booked because of the PGA Tour & the Lilac Festival. Luckily this new listing came up & I booked it quickly. I almost cried when I walked into the house because it was even nicer than the photos looked - the house is open & bright! There was enough space for us to spread out plus space to gather as a family. On the main level is kitchen (just minus a stove/oven but includes microwave), a bedroom with a daybed style bed & trundle pull out, a 1/2 bath, laundry, open dining/living room/sitting area with electric fireplace. Upstairs is 2 bedrooms w/queen beds, full kitchen & full bath off the primary bedroom which also opens onto a deck with table & grill. Everything looked new & spotless. The kitchen was better stocked than my own including pots & pans, spices, dishes & utensils. The property was private & had a view of horses. 1.25 hour drive to Niagara Falls."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Philip and Linda were amazing hosts, and the small touches were appreciated. The area is quiet, private & relaxing and the house is unique, however, very practical. The bathrooms on both floors made it easier for my elderly mother, the bedrooms are good sizes and beds comfortable. The kitchens are both well equipped, with most items you would require for cooking. As an animal lover, the only thing I did not like about this place is that I couldn't touch the horses, but, definitely understand :).
If you don't reserve this place, you'll definitely be missing out on an amazing stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel has a wonderful home and a great location (very convenient for our stay). So glad we were able to stay there and enjoy the city and surrounding area (towns).
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Felt very welcomed and the place was stunning!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place is just beautiful and peaceful . Lots of detail to accommodations and had everything we needed and more.
All products are top notch and I even ordered some of the lotion and conditioner for when I get home.
Definitely would recommend to anyone .
Added bonus is a great ice cream stand right down the road."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice property in a quiet neighborhood. The back yard is surrounded by a privacy fence and a tall row of cedars. You‚Äôd never know that there were houses on the other side. The house was very tastefully decorated and super clean. Rachel was a great host. We‚Äôll be back again next time we‚Äôre in town!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel was very responsive and accommodating to our needs on short notice. The house has more space than expected and was very homey. It‚Äôs a cute place to stay for sure!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rachel was a fantastic host and super responsive. Highly recommend and we will be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house made me feel right at home. A lot of thought went into making sure you would have everything you could reasonably want & everything you actually need. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again should the need arise. I am a man who stayed alone & it was great However, a couple or a girls weekend would get the most out of staying here imo. The bed I slept in was comfortable & I liked there were firesticks as that's what I use at home. There's many compliments I could give but the fact I stayed a week & would return says it all."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay. Host puts a lot of effort into having a homey Air bnb
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was amazing! Very responsive, the house was beautiful and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay! Highly recommend"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a great visit and host was incredibly fast at responding. We loved the proximity to the places we needed to attend. The beds were so

The hot tube and arcade games was awesome. 5 stars stay if I‚Äôm in the area I would definitely book with Joey again. It made my birthday trip that more amazing"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt like the first guests at Joey's house. Everything was super clean and in perfect condition. The bed was comfortable and the area was perfectly quiet. We loved the big kitchen, the coffee maker (with coffee), dishwasher and gorgeous new refrigerator. The shower was really nice too. We relaxed on the comfy sofa in the family room and were happy to have the TV even though we didn't use it. It was nice to have access to the washer/dryer even though we didn't use it. The homes in the neighborhood are beautiful, and the back yard has a peaceful view of the woods. This was the nicest Airbnb we have ever stayed in, and we have stayed many places in both Batavia NY and San Diego CA. We will be back...next week!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spotless and cozy. It had all the amenities we needed for our girls weekend getaway. Very relaxing atmosphere with comfy beds.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice Place, very quiet."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the stay in Batavia over the Christmas weekend. The place was clean, lots of lighting, and very comfortable. Had plenty of space to make a full meal and open some presents under a cute little tree he had so kindly set up. Made great use of the hot tub, even in the cold! It was a wonderful house and would book here again if we come up next year."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was clean and cozy. Kids enjoy the pool and the arcade. Batavia is a gorgeous city. Joey was so kind to let us checking earlier and reply fast when messaging him. Would highly recommend! The place was so worth it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We travel often and rent many homes. Joey‚Äôs place was hands down the cleanest and most well appointed we ever stayed in. We had the pleasure of meeting him and his parents and they were super friendly and told us to call if we needed anything at all. The beds were very comfortable, hot tub and patio wonderful, we loved watching the deer outback in am and on. Thankyou again for sharing your home with us."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was nice and clean. Joey was friendly and great with communication. Big & little kids both enjoyed arcade machine. Downside there were four of us & living room only sat three. From the pictures, we assumed the setup allowed for a more private use of the pool. Though, in fairness, the online description does say shared pool/hot tub."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great 1 night stay at Joey's place. Girls had a great time swimming. The place had everything we needed for cooking and the host did a good job communicating.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood. They went all out with amenities and making your stay comfortable. Access to hot tub and pool was a great bonus for the hot summer vacation. (This is a rare find in Batavia). We didn‚Äôt realize the grill, hot tub and pool were shared and others may be using it. This was awkward at times. There was no outdoor fire pit. Overall, the vacation was still great. We enjoyed seeing deer and Fox in the backyard. The arcade game was a blast for all ages. Joey was very responsive and friendly!!"
