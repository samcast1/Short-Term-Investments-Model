The large backyard with beautifully landscaped firepit area is so nice. The location is close to Olean and Ellicotville but you're in a very quiet, family neighborhood.
The entire house has been updated in stylish, modern decor and Aaron has lovely antiques and artwork around that makes it feel like home. Each bedroom has a smart TV and the beds were very comfy and the kitchen was stocked with anything you could think of.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet & well-stocked house with nice furniture! Very clean, and pleasantly decorated for the holidays. Our hosts also made a little care package when they found out we had a birthday, which was lovely.

A great spot & we would definitely stay here again."

As a family of Van Gogh fans, we all enjoyed the Van Gogh prints hanging in the kitchen and small bedroom.
Aaron & Christine are wonderful hosts. When the WiFi unexpectedly went out, they kept us in the loop and made sure everything worked for us when it came back on.

This is a second floor unit. This unit is clean, private and quiet. I‚Äôve read the other reviews and yes, the heater does make ticking sounds from the expansion and contraction but it didn‚Äôt bother me at all. My only criticism was the bed. It was a bit uncomfortable. But nothing is quite like home I guess. For the cost per night, this is a great Airbnb. I will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Josh‚Äôs place is always pretty solid. We have stayed here multiple times over the past three years or so. It‚Äôs getting a lot harder to hear back from him - before and during the stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Finding Josh‚Äôs place was a bit tricky as the listed Airbnb address wasn‚Äôt the actual address. I was able to get a hold of Josh right away. The building/unit was actually located on the other side of the street. The unit was just as described. It‚Äôs a larger studio which was plenty for me. It had all the necessary amenities including a Keurig and k-cups which I appreciate! My only criticism is that the bed/bedding/pillows could be improved. But would I stay here again? Absolutely. For the price, it‚Äôs a great deal."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great studio space. Enough space that it isn't cramped and has everything you need. Was difficult to find as the map directs to you to the left side of the street and the house is on the right and set back from the road. I'm sure much easier to find in daylight than at night when we arrived.
Space has everything you need, though does smell like someone used to smoke in the space. It's certainly been a while and not fresh, just that dull, stale smell of a previous smoker, or maybe someone smokes in the building. But the space itself is clean and definitely met our needs.
You are in a neighborhood setting so don't expect it to be walkable to much."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Henley Hideaway. This spot was very cozy and welcoming. There were two very nice bedrooms and a full kitchen that made it easy to cook. Pets are allowed which was great for our pups to be able to join us and the back yard is fenced in so we could let our dogs outside without a leash. Our only complaint would be that we wish the grass in the back yard had been mowed prior to our stay as the grass was pretty tall and the weather was cloudy with on and off showers, so our small dogs got fairly wet when they would go out. Overall, it was a great place to stay for a reasonable fee."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to Olean in general; we were here to relax and visit with friends so it was everything we needed. Loved the amenities, decor, and well stocked kitchen, iron, extra pillows, blankets. Loved the AC as we came in a heat wave summer moment and the guest book was great to see recommendations from other guests.
Ate at Home Plate a few times which was a quick walk downstairs.
Josh was responsive to a bed issue and fixed it in a timely manner.
We brought our little one so would suggest a pack and play option as you definitely have storage room for one :-). We flew so it was hard to bring all the things we may need.
Thanks again and we will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great to get away for a couple of nights. Parking was a bit confusing due to a lack of signage. Otherwise, it was a well-kept, clean, and spacious place for the two of us. I would recommend it!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was working near olean and this place was 5 min away from my job site. Perfect getaway and very clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was Immaculate and very homey. Anything you could possibly want was available, we needed to iron a shirt for a wedding and there was an iron and ironing board! The only problem that I would say we had was it was super hot. But the day we rolled into town it was 93 degrees outside so that is very understandable. Would definitely go and use this location again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Second stay at Plumber's Loft 2.0 and enjoyed my time again. Some updates to the apartment since last time, which helped it feel even more comfortable. Central location and easy access to a lot of shopping needs. Will stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great alternative to the hotels near the St. Bonaventure campus. A 6-minute drive to campus and the price was great.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Would highly recommend
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you for everything
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what we needed. Walkable to many places to eat. Very clean and comfortable!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Space is amazing and more spacious than it did seem in the pictures. There was a whole closet in the bedroom I didn‚Äôt even know it had ahead of time that provided even more space for luggage. The day bed with the trundle was rather comfortable. Only complaint is not on the place itself but the fact that it is on the Main Street of town and lots of obnoxious motorists could be very easily heard waking us throughout the night. Overall a great deal for the price.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and adorable space. Close to everything in town. Traffic noise during the week is a little loud but the weekend was quiet. The climb up the stairs is a little tough for us older folks. The loft had everything you would need - toilet paper, shampoo and conditioner, soap, towels and full kitchen. Great value!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space. Would stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Atmosphere and sleeping options were comfortable, LED lights on the bar top were a fun addition and the loft was üëåüèºFor cleanliness. Nice location and near to Rock City Park which was our first stop."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great low-key spot to stay in Olean. Perfect for a couple or small family. Outside doesn‚Äôt look like much, but inside everything is clean, modern, and comfortable. Kitchen is pretty well stocked and the bed is cozy. A/C works great. There are 15 steep steps to get in so you will need to be physically prepared for that."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! It was just right for our family and worked out so perfectly. It was the perfect size for our 2 adults/1 child family. The rental was fully stocked, clean, and easy to find. I would recommend if you are in the area and have a small family! It is on the second floor so there are a set of stairs (no elevator). This was not a big deal to us but just know in case you are unable to do stairs. Overall, a wonderful stay!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,great host great place great location
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as always. Thanks!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed two nights at this location and found it worked reasonably well for us. The stairs proved to be a bit more than what worked well for one of us. It is well appointed, very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere and very clean. The four star rating came from the stairs and the difficulty reading the Airbnb parking signs. We spoke with Josh and he had ordered replacement signs, but they had not yet arrived. Designated off-street parking is always a boon. We would consider one of his other places if there's no stairs."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at the Plumber‚Äôs loft. We were a little hesitant at first glance - but once we entered the loft we were very comfortable and satisfied. For those sleeping on the day bed - you could hear the traffic and it was a bit noisy for this country girl - but we used a sound machine and all was well! We would definitely stay there again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in the Squirrel City! The place was incredibly clean and appeared to be recently updated, even the sidewalk out front of the building had been throughly swept. The owner was very polite and accommodating. I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a clean, quiet place to stay in close proximity to everything Olean has to offer."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Josh had a very nice updated Airbnb with nice amenities. Great local shops in the surrounding area. The couple downsides that I experienced: the place can get noisy because it‚Äôs living room windows are located right on the main road plus your above a business that sometimes you can hear conversations and when I had to change my checkout date due to work cancelation I messaged him 10 days prior to me leaving and I did not get any acknowledgment from the host. Also, I messaged him when I check-out and still no acknowledgment.
But again for the location and price compared to other Airbnbs and hotels in the area its a good deal."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy is the key word. Great space and great value compared to staying at near by hotels
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very comfy and clean. definitely recommend!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location. Close enough to where restaurants are to walk, but far enough for a quiet nights sleep. Truly enjoyed and will stay there again. Much better than any hotels in the area. This unit has everything you need and more. Great for extended stay."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nicely done renovation of an old downtown building. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Accessible to restaurants nearby and Great Wall is a block away or will deliver if you want Asian food. Be advised, it is a lot of food! Stairs into airbnb are a bit steep but can't be helped in these old buildings. I would stay there again and recommend it."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay if you‚Äôre ever in Olean, I will be back for sure! Nicely redone inside, bed & pillows were comfy, has all the things you need for extended stays, and is conveniently located to everything - stores, restaurant (even has a coffee/breakfast/lunch spot practically below it with good food). Wifi works well, tv has all the apps for you to be able to use and watch, and the place is also above a business so it was nice and quiet there - perfect to be able to work out of during the day as a remote worker."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here. The apartment is very clean and nicely decorated. We came to do some hiking in Alegany State Park very close by, as well as the Pfeiffer Nature Center which is well worth checking out.

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Josh place was clean and spacious for just us 2. The check in details and instructions of the key and parking was provided 2 days later so we must of unintentionally annoyed the tenants and businesses sharing the parking lot. But we now know the check in rules and would come stay again when we're in town. A few things such as coat hangers, wine glasses and a chef's knife would be nice to have."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed staying at Josh's place. The outside of the building doesn't look great, but the inside was fantastic. You can't judge a book by it's cover! Really enjoyed our stay."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Central location close to grocery stores. The apartment was spacious, very clean, and well organized. The living room faces the main street and unless a loud motorcycle went by I didn't really notice traffic noise from outside and at night it was quiet. The bed was comfortable. Once the sun went down the air conditioner really helped to cool down the apartment. A bit lacking in cookware, so no scrambled eggs for breakfast, but I was able to get around that. The entrance to the 2nd floor faces the main street, but is well lit. Would definitely stay again. Thanks!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Way nicer than you would think from the outside.
The neighborhood is a little commercial, and the road has a lot of traffic, but you can't hear the traffic AT ALL. very comfortable apartment, and we really enjoyed our stay. Nice bathroom, kitchen and the beds were comfortable."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Josh's place was wonderful! We were in town for a girls kayaking trip and his place was perfect for us!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very proactive host. When it snowed she came out and shoveled for me. And responded to all my questions. I booked pretty late and she went out to make sure the heat got turned on to make sure it was warm when I get there. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I throughly enjoyed my stay! The place is beautifully decorated and well-kept. It was cozy and neat. I took a walk one day along a path and then onto the road all the while feeling safe and glad to be among nature. It is not far from Olean where one can get anything needed and find restaurants and close also to Cuba which has plenty of stores and restaurants and is super cute. If you go to Cuba, check out By The Light of the Moon (a shop filled with adorable stuff) and Perfect Blend next door for coffee and more!"

We were in town for an event and are so happy to have found this peaceful gem.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What an adorable studio home away from home! Perfect when you are in the area for a couple of days and not planning on any major cooking. The owner made the best of a compact space, providing the basic necessities (coffee bar, microwave, hot plate, fridge) for you. Loved the games and the adorable outside lights, making it very inviting. The ""only"" reason for not giving it 5 stars across the board was because the bed was a bit too small and soft for our liking (my husband and I have a king at home!) Falen is the sweetest and a very accommodating host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and a helpful host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Guest House was very clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed and was decorated beautifully! We highly recommend this Guest House to anyone staying in the area or just passing through.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this lovely guesthouse while visiting Finger Lakes Region. It is tucked away in the most peaceful surroundings. Falen was exceptional in communication even while away. She was prompt and friendly. One of the highlights of my stay was the outdoor space surrounding the guesthouse. A serene garden awaited just outside, perfect for evening campfire. I highly recommend this serene retreat for a refreshing getaway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent host.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent host! Very accommodating.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Private. Clean. Some small things to consider would be landscaping pavers for the short walk across the yard. Had some muddy shoes as a result of a very wet yard. Bigger curtains on the one window. When the light sensor went off during the night it lit the whole room up. Otherwise great stay and very comfortable for what I was doing. I read the review about the cold temps so I came prepared. Overall good place to stay during warmer temps.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely love this little gem! Great for a get away.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable and quiet place to stay. It was clean and perfect for a night stay.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy. Was a little cold when we arrived but once we got the heaters rolling it was fine. The driveway going up to the house was rough to say the least. It was raining the day before. And if I didn‚Äôt have 4 wheel drive I definitely would‚Äôve gotten stuck the first night. Other than that it was beautiful
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! Perfect little getaway on a cold winter day to just binge watch a show and order in food. The space was clean, spacious and had everything you needed."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little spot that I‚Äôd love to revisit
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, nice location. The driveway to the back house (this airbnb is behind an actual house on the property), should not be used unless you have a truck or 4x4. It is pretty cold, despite using the fireplace on full blast honestly, but not so cold you cannot sleep. sadly there was not a second set of blankets for me (my friend got the bed, I was on the couch which is a pullout bed). So ask for more bedding if you need it! There is a hot plate, but no actual stove. So beware of that!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great to stay in, would definitely visit again!"
2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,When we arrived no heat was on. The high for the day was 30 degrees and it took 5 yo 6 hrs for the one space heater to make it remotley comfortable inside place. After a day of work in the cold it really sucked to be freezing while the place heated up. Supposed to sleep 4 people but aside from the bed comforter there was only one small and thin blanket availabe for couch bed. Would be impossible to sleep 4 as advertised.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place and a great stay, I will definitely be going back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a peaceful time,loved it and would do again."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a very nice stay! For being winter I‚Äôd say make sure to bring up a heater but other then that everything was great.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place nice view very cozy
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, quite just as advertised. üëç"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our quiet and calm stay here!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, quiet, remote getaway location. The place came as advertized, and Falen was quickly responsive to our few questions."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spur of the moment stay. communication was great. bright clean place to stay. very quiet and tranquil. saw a few deer during our stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and comfortable place to stay, and waking up to the beautiful deer outside made it extra special!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are someone who expects a hotel+ experience, this is not it. I‚Äôm not that person, and I found Falen‚Äôs converted man cave to be perfectly comfy. It‚Äôs not refined ‚Äî DIY finishes, some missing pieces, and a bit of off-roading to get to a convenient parking spot. But I found the listing to be accurate and honest, the check-in process to be very smooth, and the overall value of the place to be great. I would not want to do a long stay here, for fear of missing out on some comforts. However, I think this is a great listing for someone who doesn‚Äôt have a big budget but doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing a room in a house."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place had everything we needed, with smooth check-in and check-out. The place was easy to find, and in a good location near Olean"
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean cottage, comfortable bed. Saw deer every night. Not a good place for someone with limited mobility. The driveway to the cottage is a dirt logging road through a field into the back yard."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Falen‚Äôs place was great!
Secluded, quiet, and peaceful.
I highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and cozy Airbnb. We saw a lot of wildlife such as deer and rabbits which was nice. The Airbnb is very clean and had a dartboard and foosball table. It was everything we needed! 10/10 recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was perfect for a weeks stay for 2 people. We enjoyed waking up seeing the deer & enjoyed the scenery. This place is super easy to find and not too far out of town! We would stay here again!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Inside of place was as described but getting there was very misleading with the address given and no sign to indicate the correct driveway or communication about it beforehand.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Falen‚Äôs backyard cottage is great! Clean, comfortable, and fun. It was perfect for my quick business trip to Olean."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very clean and quiet and perfect for our weekend away! Great location, just outside of town but still very accessible. Would definitely stay again if we‚Äôre ever back in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Possibly the best AirBnB place that I have stayed in to date. The cottage was very clean, modern and updated. It was very quiet and private. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful, cozy place! It had everything we needed and Falen was wonderful to communicate with. It‚Äôs off the beaten path but really close to town and less than 15 minutes from St.Bonaventure, which was perfect for us. Very quiet, so many stars and we had deer outside of our window in the morning. Super clean and the bed was so comfortable. We look forward to coming back soon!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is perfect for a retreat, or wanting to enjoy nature. The view is breathtaking... the trees, the mountains and a lovely hello from a deer (or two) üòä"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Want to return if the opportunity presents itself
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for the nice clean space, and your willingness to share your yard. We would definitely come back! (And your bagels at the store were really good!)"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little place on the edge of town. If you are a stargazer or nature lover, this is the place for you! We were just visiting some people and really enjoyed our private little getaway. Definitely recommend this Airbnb"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a last minute trip planned to Olean and found this listing. Falen was a communicative, accommodating and timely host. The cottage was newly renovated and was very very clean. The location is perfect for a visit to Olean or Portville. We did have a shower issue - water dribbled out and didnt get hot but once Falen was alerted she had someone come right out and replace the shower head. Everything we needed was provided including coffee options, hair dryer and toiletries. The cottage is behind a main house and you have to walk through the backyard to enter. Recommend bringing a flashlight if you arrive back in the evening."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, new place in a beautiful area just minutes from Olean."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Keith‚Äôs place was as described and had everything we needed. We loved our peaceful stay. Keith was very responsive and made sure we had everything. Would love to stay again!!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kieth‚Äôs home was a great stay for us with everything we could‚Äôve asked for and more. Worked perfectly for our weekend family gathering with plenty of room inside and out. Loved the open layout with the kitchen and living room. Absolutely no complaints and would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Visiting family frequently and we always stay here, it's a home away from home"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice and clean. Would stay again

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was a very beautiful place. Love to the walk around porch with a great view off the back porch.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great time
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean. The location was perfect for us. We have family in all directions, so we were able to visit them. Really loved the wrap around deck and the huge yard. Hope to visit in the summer so we can enjoy it more. wondered if there is more outside furniture in the summer. It has a great backyard but know picnic table.
Look forward to returning some summer. Bonnie and Tom Welch"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were home for a Celebration of Life for my brother, so it was a rather difficult time; but we found Keith‚Äôs home very comforting and peaceful. It was immaculately clean and Keith was very prompt and accommodating with any requests. We will definitely be staying again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay, and as much as I don‚Äôt want people to know about this place, so it is available when we need it, Keith deserves to have this rented year round. Highly recommend. Our home away from home!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! It was even better than what we expected. The house had everything we could need. The house is beautiful and squeaky clean. The surroundings are beautiful too.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I only wish there was a bedside lamp in the loft bedroom so I could have read awhile.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve stayed here several times now, it‚Äôs always great."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Olean for a work trip, and stayed a few extra days to explore. We visited Corning and the museum of glass, Kinzua state park, Allegany state park, rock city park, and on our way home the PA Grand Canyon. We ate at so many wonderful restaurants such as Rafi‚Äôs Kitchen, Union Whiskey, Mangi‚Äôs Pizza, Bradford Airport Restaurant. All of that being said, there‚Äôs so much to do in the area within an hour or two. We weren‚Äôt at the Airbnb too much, but it was a nice place to cozy up, relax, and sleep. We slept in the loft after night one because the main bedroom mattress was so hard. Ladies, BYO blow dryer if you have thicker or longer hair. Overall, I recommend this place, especially for the price."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place will try to stay again if in the area.
Mike"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as advertised. However, the one of the features that was most important to us was the A/C. Not for the days, but for sleeping at night. Unfortunately, it was relatively ineffective in the bedrooms. Keith responded immediately when we requested a fan and was very responsive to any questions."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay! easy checking. beautiful clean peaceful home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our new home away from home. It is perfectly situated between our two aging parents homes. Very comfortable neighborhood.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Southern exposure was fabulous! It had everything we needed and more! The location was great; tucked away on a dead end street. Rock city park is close by and a must see!! We will be back! Thank you Keith!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Keith place is really nice. The living space is spacious. The balcony with the view on the forest is amazing. We saw rabbits and other tiny animals
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house felt peaceful and quiet even though we had neighbors and were close to town. The house had plenty of extra cooking oils and spices in the kitchen as well as extra toiletries in case you forgot something. It felt like home and was very comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay. Keith was very responsive, the house was very clean, and has a beautiful yard. The main level is very open, which made cooking very easy.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at many Airbnb's from VA to VT and found Keith's place to be one of our favorites. This is a single home, at the end of a small lane with a porch that wraps around 1/2 the house. The comfortable couches, open floor plan, privacy and natural sunlight pouring through the large windows makes the first floor a great place to hang out. The bedrooms are on the 2nd floor with a large master and separate loft room. It's also a very quiet Airbnb. Though we didn't use much in the kitchen due to eating out, it was well stocked with everything you'd need. My husband and I grew up in the area and we are excited to have found an excellent Airbnb, close to Portville, for future visits."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Another great stay at this place and we'll be back

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a fantastic stay at Keith‚Äôs house. Check in/out was easy. The house is comfortable and exceptionally clean. Super comfortable beds and great well appointed kitchen. All the south facing windows made the house bright and sunny when the sun was shining.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. It was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The beautiful deck was amazing and secluded on the back of the house with a huge lawn. Keith and his wife are very friendly and the whole thing made it an amazing get away!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Keith‚Äôs place for a short weekend getaway. It was great! The open layout makes the house feel bigger and the backyard balcony overlooks a beautiful field. We even saw a family of deer in the morning! This is a cozy, relaxing spot that served us well in these strange times."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place - spacious and sparking clean. Lots of natural light during the day. We were initially planning on seeing fall foliage in one of the state parks not too far away but unfortunately we came a week too late and missed the peak. But we were pleasantly surprised by Rock City Park which is only a short 12-minute drive away from the house - very pretty and great for a short hike around. If weather permits, the back yard is great for star-gazing at night as well.
Plenty of cookware in the kitchen, soaps/hand sanitizer in the bathroom. Aldi and walmart is also a short drive away - can get groceries and toiletries if you forgot to bring any."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean! Beautiful fall colors viewed from the porch!

Keith was communicative and helpful. Thanks for a very pleasant stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great place to land a family of four looking to escape the four walls of quarantine! The house has a great open feel and good vibe and we felt like we had plenty of room to move around for privacy and quiet--my husband and I sometimes had Zoom calls for business while kids were watching TV--and plenty of (multiple) sofa space to sprawl out on at night. We took a surprise trip to Niagara Falls, NY (less than 2 hours), explored Rock City Park, visited Kinzua Bridge, trekked in Allegheny National Forest, and the fire pit in the back yard was great for s'mores. But if you want Dunkin Donuts, you do have to drive about 10 miles out of town :) Highly recommend Keith's place for location, location, location!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Keith‚Äôs place was super clean and enjoyable. We felt right at home the minute we walked through the door. Super nice porch and super quiet area. Would definitely recommend and consider booking again if the opportunity arises.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After long lockdown in NY, my family really needed safe space to relax and enjoy nature. This place was sort of between Niagara falls and Watkins Glen State park, about 2 hours away... Even through it's located in town, if you are seating on the deck, you will feel like you are in the woods. You can hear birds chirping ... it was really relaxing. There was good wi-fi, which we needed for teenagers. Spacious enough for family of 4. We really had good time there!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for letting us stay at your amazing home ! Will come back again soon. Highly recommended

We found the house to be charming, cozy, and comfortable! We highly recommend this home to anyone who is staying in Olean or for a nice stopping place when driving through New York. We will definitely stay here again when the need arises. We also highly recommend Dewey's Deli within walking distance of the house. We loved the food...the fried mushrooms and onion rings were delicious and the subs were huge! Thanks for all of the extras you had available for our use, Keith!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is great for both short and long term stays. Comes equipped with everything you could possibly need and is very clean. Keith was an amazing host, extremely responsive to any needs we had and thoughtful in how he responded. It was mostly too cold for us to enjoy the outdoor space but the ‚ÄúSouthern Exposure‚Äù is truly marvelous, and with a wrap around deck and grill would be great in the summer as well. You‚Äôll likely catch a glimpse of some wildlife - we have seen deer, groundhogs and a fox during our stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! It is just outside of town so it's nice and quiet but close enough to run into town. It's nice and cozy and brings a comfort of home. Everything i clean and nothing is out of place. Would highly recommend and be a repeat customer. Any questions I had he answered in a timely manner.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very good hosts and the apartment was totally as described! Think 1965-1970 when considering but with the conveniences of the 2020s. We would not hesitate to stay there again if in the area. Great stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, close to Olean and St. Bonaventure.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting family.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really loved this place - it was cozy and perfect for what we needed. We were in town for a funeral, so we wanted to stay someplace that felt like a home rather than a hotel. The host was kind, very communicative and even had drinks/snacks in the fridge, which made us feel welcome. The location was easy to find on a main road not too far from the rest of the town. I wish we had been more prepared for the long, steep stairs leading up to the unit. If you or a loved one requires a wheelchair or has issues with stairs, this won't be the place for you. I also wish we were able to visit the antique shop underneath it during our stay, which should not be held against the host. Just know that it is only open 11a-4p Thursday, Friday and Saturday, so you have a short window to check the antique store out. Overall a very lovely place in Olean!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time we have stayed in the upstairs unit of Zachary's home in Olean, and it is always the perfect experience. Easy check in, the description of the unit is spot on, the bathroom has been recently updated and is much more functional than our last stay which made the stay even more enjoyable. We always love finding the cold bottled water, coffee and breakfast bars in the kitchen when we arrive. This unit is perfect for 2-3 guests, a comfortable living area, the AC window unit kept the space as cool as we needed it, and the kitchen was nicely stocked with some essentials for making quick meals in rather than dining out for every meal. I'm born and raised in the area but have since moved out of state, so it is nice to have somewhere nearby to all the places I miss when I come to visit, like Beef N Barrel, Napoli Pizza, Four Mile Brewery, a short drive to my hometown of Wellsville to get some Texas Hot, Spragues in Portville, and close to the grocery stores as well. We already have our next stay at Zachary's booked to visit again in a few months. Thank you Zachary for maintaining such a nice, quaint, comfortable unit for your guests.

The little touches (soaps, coffee, and extra linens/cleaner) made me feel at home, just in case I forgot to pack anything.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved everything about our rental. They had the old farmhouse decor which was very homey and comfortable. Beds and furniture were all in new condition and felt fresh and clean. It really did feel like a home away from home. Zachary left a welcome notebook that was helpful and informative. Thoughtful 'extras' like a kuerig and coffee pods, bottled water in the refrigerator, breakfast bars and many little things that you would find nice to have available in a kitchen setting. The bathroom had shampoo and conditioner and soap, and other items that you might have forgotten to pack, available for use.
The ONLY complaint, was that our key code to get in wasn't set correctly and we couldn't get in when we first arrived. (My bad that I did not have the airbnb app on my phone to get a message to Zachary) Thankfully, the housekeeper 'happened by' soon after and helped us get in and fixed our code. Praise God!
We recommend this place,... and now that we have in-laws in that area, we will use Zachery's place again if it's available when we need it."

This spot is in a rougher area of town, however I didn‚Äôt have any issues with security or criminal activity.
Also, the shower head is very low, but that‚Äôs not necessarily an issue for all! Just as a tall person, it made showering a little bit difficult.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tom is a great host. Very helpful and gracious. On the hot days offered air condition. When i needed help with the tv he fixed it rite away. The only draw back was no kitchen. A very small bathroom that fit one person at a time.a shower that was hard to get in. I would recommend his airbnb because of him also, Because the hotels around are more expensive and same size. Except the bathroom. The chairs are very comfortable. Which you do not get in a hotel. Thank Tom for a very nice stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Kathy‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend for my sister‚Äôs graduation from St. Bonaventure University!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wholeheartedly recommend staying at Tom and Kathy's place! There were so many great things about the Airbnb itself, as well as the hosts. First, the parking spot right next to the door was a pleasant surprise. No lugging suitcases across a big yard or up flights of stairs! And inside it was very clean and had a calming atmosphere. I loved the view out the back of the fields...it felt so peaceful, private, and like a rural setting. And yet, there are stores and restaurants just a 2 minute drive away, if you need anything! Tom and Kathy were very flexible when I asked about the check-in and check-out times. I really appreciated that. And also, at one point, I reached out to Tom about something and he immediately responded and went above and beyond to get me what I needed. He also recommended to me some local trails nearby, which was nice! If you're looking for a place to stay in Olean, look no further. I will definitely be back!!!"

I just booked an overnight stay while I was in the area, but the guest suite was everything as shown and described in the listing. I wish I could have stayed longer as the reviews on the site AND the in-suite reviews (they have a spiral notebook full of positivity about the place) reveal a 5-star experience. Last, but certainly not least, is the great VALUE of this suite; the decor, comfort, and responsive communication make it one of the best."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place and hosts! The suite was cozy and private, clean and tidy, and exactly as described. Hosts gave me restaurant and walk recommendations, were helpful, and were very flexible. I would definitely stay here again."

Second, it just felt so‚Ä¶ inviting‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs cozy and comfortable as soon as you walk in. Everything was neat and felt like a lot of care was placed into setting it up and making it feel that way. Finally the hosts are genuinely caring, sweet and very responsive. If I had any issues - which who could - I‚Äôm positive just from our interactions that they would have done anything in their power to rectify it. I can‚Äôt say enough about how great a place this is‚Ä¶ most comfortable bed I‚Äôve slept in, in what seems like forever. Would come back and bring a loved one just so I could play games with them while enjoying this cozy gem."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom, I enjoyed the unit or many reasons ; it was VERY CLEAN, had an at home feel to it and very quiet. The price made it above average compared to others in the area. I hope to visit again. Ann"

Their home was located in a quiet, lovely neighborhood and we enjoyed seeing the deer and rabbits that showed up every now and then. It was certainly a welcome retreat at the end of each day!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is much more like a private apartment than a room, with everything you need for a short stay. Tom and Kathy were very friendly, interesting and helpful. Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Kathy's charming, quiet space was just what I needed to relax before and after 3 very long and busy days of business! It was pretty easy to find, because the town they're in uses identical red and black sines to mark each house number. You can drive right up to the private entrance.
I was pretty tired when I drove in. Since you gain entrance by using a code that's part of your phone #, even if you're pooped, you can remember it and get in.
It's a well laid out studio apartment - warm and inviting with a sitting/ watching TV area, a kitchen area, a sleeping area, even a desk. The easy chairs and bed were cushy and comfortable. There's lots of light from the windows in the daytime. A very quiet ceiling fan which I used. A room air conditioner, which I didnot.Everything was quite clean!
The views of the yard are green and calming in early June. Early one morning I watched two groundhogs ""mowing the grass"" out of a window!
I would love to stay again on my next trip to the area"

,,,"This was the first time in all my years using air b and b that I packed up and left after one night of a 3 night stay. The heater which was two feet away from the bed was so loud we were kept up all night after driving hours to reach the location. Every time it started up it sounded like a dryer full of marbles, which woke us up every 45 minutes. I messaged the host over 30 hours ago to let them know I was leaving early and I still haven‚Äôt received a response‚Ä¶ left after 7 hours in the place and was refunded 35$. Vacation ruined"
,,,It is located next to a weed dispensary where you will smell weed. I was attacked by dogs from next door in the parking lot. Not in a safe environment and location. Blinds were all broken up inside for 3 windows. It looks good online but looks are deceiving. Once you arrive it was a terrible place. Have to climb maybe 15 steps to get to location airbnb. Host Josh could care less. Tried to reach out to him he totally ignored me and never responded. I ended up not staying there and checked in to a hotel instead. I requested a refund he did not respond. So contacted management of airbnb and received my money back.
,,,"Place was okay, however, the smell of the marijuana was unacceptable."
