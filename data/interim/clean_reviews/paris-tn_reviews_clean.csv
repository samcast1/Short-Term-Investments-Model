2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy’s home is beautiful and so peaceful! The space was cozy, comfortable and the perfect place to relax. She, her family and their pups are incredibly warm and welcoming and I felt right at home from the moment I arrived to when I was leaving. Very grateful for the accommodations. Would highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for a peaceful retreat!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely great experience. My Grandson loved the “bunkhouse”. Great time fishing in the pond. Only issue was that google maps did not guide me to destination and had me on Tom White road at an electrical substation. Amy got us straightened out. Great experience!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little secluded place! the dog greeters was probably the best part, they were beyond friendly! very clean!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect for brief stay and Amy and her husband are great! The kids enjoyed fishing in the pond and playing with the dogs. We would definitely stay with them again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Would greatly recommend staying at Amy's place! Very welcoming host in a peaceful setting! My kiddos loved fishing in the pond during our stay and playing with Pepper, the dog. Great location to feel ""in the middle of nowhere"" to unplug and relax but still convenient for shopping. Surrounding towns have great things to do with the whole family! Wifi/cell service is spotty, but was a plus to us!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my first AirBnB experience and Hannah and her cottage definitely set the bar high! We spent over a week at the cottage and it felt like home. Hannah made sure we were settled in and had what we needed. Communication with her is top notch and she is always quick to respond. I can't wait to stay there again next fall. My family has begun a new tradition of staying here.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's house is inviting and comfortable. In a natural setting so you can see wildlife yet you are only like 10 minutes from town. When we walked in there was a refreshing scent and natural light in the house. The house has decorated notes from Hannah on their requests, so much better than a note stuck to something. The beds were comfortable, and plenty of linens were provided. We had one small issue, where a blind broke while we were using it and Hannah made sure it was fixed very quickly. Hannah's house made for a quiet and peaceful stay. Hannah's house will be our number one pick when we visit Paris!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We recently stayed at Hannah's beautiful property while in the area for a multi day fishing tournament. This is an outstanding property that is extremely clean and well supplied. The country setting is quiet and relaxing, but very convenient to town and the lakes. We had no issues with our stay, but Hannah made it clear that she was available should any arise. We highly recommend this property and would stay again if the opportunity arose. Dennis, Ronnie and Becky."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Hannah was an awesome host. She made sure we had everything we needed. She even went out of her way to help us with a boat parking dilemma. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our fishing tournament. We will definitely stay here again.

This house is adorable, and covered all the bases of anything you would need. Tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Scenery is very pretty too. The town of Paris has plenty of good places to eat. Moustos, Aces, Toms and Take Me Back Cafe did not disappoint us. Hannah took great care in making sure there were many personal touches through out her home. Shows that she is very proud of her property. I only wish i could have stayed alittle longer."

Hostess is very easy to communicate with and had provided all kinds of extra supplies that is not normally provided. Loved that it was handicapped accessible and has adequate provisions for handicapped. If you are looking for a place to stay this is it. It’s quiet and has some beautiful scenery. There was an abundance of wildlife to watch as well, which my husband and father in law loved."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was a superb host. The home exceeded our expectations. The beds were super comfortable. Can’t wait to return. Thank you, Hannah."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is packed with every necessity you could need for an out of town trip. From the electric teapot to the fireplace in the bedroom, Hannah has thought of everything to make your stay wonderful. The cottage is clean, has fluffy white towels, and thoughtful touches throughout. It is easy to find in a very quiet country setting. We watched a herd of deer as we drank our morning coffee. If you need a quiet, exceptionally clean place to stay while you visit west Tennessee, this is the place."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were no pics of the outside on the listing, so I was a bit puzzled when I pulled up. The place was nice and clean though. I had txted Ginger ahead of time, asking about the bedding arrangement, but didn’t get a reply. There was a queen bed, and thankfully a pull out cot, that I slept on. It was comfortable. Nice TV on the wall with a lot of channels, so was great, for the limited time we were there. Would definitely stay again"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything is modern and new. We really enjoyed our stay!! Hot water on demand!! Very rustic and well planned. Thank You!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed a night stay for a wedding about 10 minutes away and this tiny home was PERFECT for the night! Very cute, close by, safe, and thoughtfully set up. Also a great spot if I were to go back for a lake weekend or something when I have more available time!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, to many curvy roads to get to. Only thing is the tv did work, wouldnof like to have watched tv when I was laying down. Was a great place though, thank you very much"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was exactly as described and very comfortable. We were traveling for a funeral and didn’t check in until later in the evening, due to the time of year it is (12/1/23) the fog was a little thick but that’s exactly what you can expect when driving. So if you are planning on getting there after dark make sure to be aware that it is close to a lake and there is fog. There are no complaints to be had with Ginger or her cute home. We are beyond happy with our stay and if we ever travel back to the area we will definitely book with her again."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"As super hosts ourselves, we were not expecting food crumbs and dried food on the kitchen table. ￼ The bed seemed quite soft and not the most comfortable. All in all we had what we needed. Download speeds were excellent, and the heat and hot water were both plentiful. ￼
This is an old house, some of which has not been updated. ￼
Geri always got back with us, though not always promptly, and often outside of Airbnb."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was as expected and clean. Though we only stayed one night, we could tell the cabin was well stocked with cooking stuff, extra towels/linens, dvds, etc ..it’s a nice place to enjoy Paris. Geri communicated well, kind, and was helpful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely use again in future. convenient, clean & cozy"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This home is not a 5 star hotel. It is the perfect little place to stay for a few nights or a few weeks. It was convenient to be able to cook for ourselves when we wanted and plenty of locations when we didn't. Geri stopped by to check on us. She is a very nice host. We would do it again! Thanks Geri

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cute and comfy place in a great location close to everything!! You get alot of space for the money. Geri is the most attentive host we've ever had, she was very helpful and friendly! We would definitely stay here again!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is not a fancy house, but a comfortable place in a friendly neighborhood. Well worth the price - a great deal. The host was in Florida when we were arriving, but we spoke by phone and text as needed, and she answered all our questions.
Nice large back yard. Paris is a small town, but we were close to everything we needed and learned our way around quickly.
I'd recommend Southside Cafe for breakfast or lunch, and don't miss Rocky Ridge Pit for some great barbecue."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful place, flexible and communicative host"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed at Geri’s placed several times. It is not fancy but it is very homey. The place is always clean and ready for my visit. I feel safe in the neighborhood. Geri is great to work with and easy to communicate with. I will definitely stay there again.

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Geri was a great host! Communication is excellent. The setting is just what I needed. It was quiet and 3 minutes from the Henry County genealogy library and archives.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and easy to get anywhere from there and far enough back in the suburbs and it’s a cozy place to stay

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! It is close to eating and shopping. The neighborhood Is cute and quiet. The home is older but very home like and very comfortable. It was very clean. The other two apartments were also rented and you could hear when they entered their apartment but then it was quiet. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable clean more than we expected.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time and are grateful for this lovely place to stay in the future when we are in Paris 💛

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful host. Relaxing place. Very clean and quaint~
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice older house in a good location . Quite neighborhood. Easy access to highway. Host was wonderful.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little space! she made sure to connect with me before getting to the house!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had such a great time! Great place for a get away or just for one night! Super clean and neat! Great location!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Geri is very friendly and willing to go above and beyond for her guests. She responded to my inquiries and messages quickly. The house/apartment was cute and was in an area of good walkability. The only negative was the bed, which was very loud and uncomfortable; every time I or my friend shifted, we would wake the other up because of how squeaky it was. Overall, it was a very good stay at a great value."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very great place to just take a load OffMAGNIFICENT HOST!! WILL BE BACK!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and small apartment with good wifi and close to town. Older decor that made me feel like I was stepping back 30 years, visiting family. Price point is great for a weekend trip to Paris!"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The price is fair for the accommodations. I used this location for nothing more than sleeping, showering and eating at the desk and that worked for me. There were stains on the couch, mattress and wallpaper peeling. Not what I am used too.
My contact Geri was pleasant and accommodating for a late check in. The nightly rates were low, the water was hot, the AC worked fantastically and the small town location had plenty of restaurants without traffic. The site is only 30 minutes from KY and only an hour and a half +/- from Nashville."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to stay! Quiet place and close to everything you could possibly need!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, cheap. exactly what I was looking for. Geri was super communicative and went above and beyond as a host.
My one complaint is that the upstairs is also rented out, and I believe the bathroom is located directly above the bed. That and lack of insulation means you'll be woken up by the sound of your upstairs neighbor urinating and flushing. Unfortunate, but hey, you get what you pay for."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience! We would gladly stay here again. Very clean and cozy! Excellent host!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean place, good location. Nice neighborhood. The host was very friendly and accommodating"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was just what my son and I needed. Very clean and peaceful...Geri made the check in easy... Looking forward to staying there again...
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome host and one great stay++!! Thank you!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute and cozy. Perfect location and ease of rental. Thanks so much Geri for the last minute accommodations.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a lovely time. Quiet and clean getaway
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, roomy and quiet place. Great location close to everything.."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet, and well kept living space. Certainly enjoyed my stay."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My time at 'The GetWay B' was wonderfully peaceful. Geri's hospitality was amazing. She is a great host, fun person to talk to, and is involved in the local community. The space itself is calm and well-equipped. Full stove, oven, freezer/refrigerator, microwave and more. It's close to the town center and there are sidewalks all along the way, which was nice. It was nice to 'unplug' from the internet as there was no wifi (as stated) and I also had no cellular data service (Ting). I really loved staying here and hope to come back."
2020-07-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,This may be fine for a couple of guys certainly not for a single female.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, excellent location, pristine clean, attentive host, great porch swing, comfy and inviting-I'll be back!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay. The house was very nice and clean. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Paris, TN."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful stay at Geri’s place. She was an excellent communicator and the home is absolutely charming. Will definitely return when I’m in the area again.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Another great visit to Paris. Geri is terrific. Highly recommended. Tony
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great stay at Geri’s place. She’s terrific and really knows the area.
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Geri's place in Paris was conveniently located and very clean. Quick response back to me when i needed some help - would definitely stay again when in Paris.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful older home with large parlor (living room), large country-style kitchen with full-sized stove and refrigerator, pantry, and lots of cooking and storage space. The bedroom is very comfy and inviting and has a full bath off the bedroom with a claw-footed tub and shower. There a full front porch with porch swing and plenty of off-street parking. There is also a back room with exit to a very large back yard with barbecue grill and picnic table. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful and residential - lots of lovely older homes. This place was immaculately clean, and Geri went above and beyond to be accommodating for a ""short notice"" stay for a family situation, even to the point of waiting for me on the front porch when I came into town late. If you are in the mood to break away from the ""seen one, seen them all"" white, square, noisy, unsafe motel room, this place is a lovely bargain. One more thing, even though there is another apartment in this house, the good thing about older construction - plaster walls - you could not hear a thing next door. I hope I have done you justice, Geri. I will stop now, but I really did love your place."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If ever visiting in Paris Tennessee please contact Geri as her home is very well kept and met all expectations. She takes great pride in what she does with Airbnb. Thank you Geri A friend forever with lots of memories!!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, ill be back"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri’s place was perfect! I am a traveling therapist working night shift; her place was quiet and sparkling clean! I absolutely loved the nostalgic claw foot tub!
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need more space than just a bed to sleep in, then that is where there is value for staying in this home. I was aware there was no WIFI so I came prepared with a book to read in our down time. TV was for use with DVD's only, so don't stay here with an expectation of watching trivial TV while you are there. Clean and close to most eating places, quiet neighborhood. Old house with old features, but quaint and most importantly, clean. Geri was delightful."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri’s place was clean and just the right size for our weekend in Paris! She found out we were on an extended honeymoon and left us the sweetest gift! Will stay with her again if we find ourselves back in Paris!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place clean and quite.
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was one of my favorite places. Everything was so clean and in order. If I needed anything, my calls and texts were responded to promptly. Thank you for being so kind and helping me when I needed anything for the apartment. I will be back one day soon."
2017-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Believe them when they say built in the 1930’s. The plumbing sucked. I tried to take a bath and water would go everywhere. There is no WiFi, two TVs that play only dvd’s, and trying to sleep was awful since there was noise coming from the house all night. (I assume from being so old)."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! The hosts are very nice, the place is clean, the neighborhood is quiet, and there is a nice backyard for relaxing. This is my go-to spot for when I travel to Paris for work."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and neighborhood. Easy walk to downtown, and close to all other needs!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, Geri is kind and helpful and very accessible."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So..... First I'll start by saying I've never visited Paris, TN ever. I traveled here to stay from Tues-Saturday from Dallas, TX as a getaway and to visit. When I pulled up Geri was there and she assisted me with my belongings. When I walked in the House/Apt. living room I could already tell it was perfect. I proceeded to the kitchen and there's just enough counter space, Refrigerator, etc. Basically everything you need for a long stay. You then walk into the bedroom and it's comfy and spacious. The bathroom is the perfect size and has enough storage space. I love the claw foot tub! The front porch is nice with a swing and the neighborhood is quiet. This is an older house but kept up very nicely. Geri is a wonderful human being and she was there when I needed her. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay with an awesome host! Thank you Geri 😁"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Air BnB is extremely clean and well kept and exactly as described. Great communication from the host and made to feel welcome by her as well. Was ready to accommodate my needs and check in was a breeze. Absolutely no complaints noted by me. I loved my stay as I felt very comfortable there and would gladly return! Thanks for everything!
2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was great.
Geri was very friendly.
Good location for restaurants or shopping.
20 minutes from Paris landing-Kentucky lake.
No cable TV but plenty of DVD's to choose from."
2017-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked great for our stay
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Geri was available when we arrived, came right away and greeted us, showing us around and warming up the place! The home was clean and tidy. We enjoyed talking together and Geri was available by phone when we called. Cozy neighborhood in a wooded area. Neat claw footed tub! I would recommend."
2016-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Geri was great! Met me at the house to get me settled in. Since I was traveling by myself, the noises of a different house hindered my sleep the first night, but overall a good stay."
2016-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri was great and very accomodating
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Geri was a very kind and gracious host. Our trip was planned at the last minute, but Geri worked with us to make sure everything went smoothly from the time We made the reservation until we left. She provided a DVD played and a good selection of dvds upon our arrival. She also gave us a quick tour of some nearby venues as well as ideas for places we might like to visit during our stay. The neighborhood was quiet and in a good location. The home was clean, charming, and welcoming. We would love the opportunity to stay at Geri's lovely home again."
2016-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay. It's a nice little town and Geri was a great host.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The upstairs Apartment has low ceilings but it was perfect for me and my husband. There’s a nice living room, dining area and kitchen for cooking your own meals. In the bathroom there is a wonderful large old tub or outside the bathroom there is a shower if preferred. The bedroom was large and the bed comfortable.
It was a pleasure to talk to Geri. She is a wonderful host! I would definitely recommend staying here if in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Geri's place for the night, we felt it was a very pleasant and comfortable spot. Geri was very communicative before our arrival and her instructions to get access to the place were very clear. Great location near gas and grocery store that we needed to get to next morning, it was just what we were looking for. :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cheap, clean and comfy. The couple is very nice and helpful. The lady gave me a tour and told me everything I needed to know upon arrival. I had my own mini fridge and fast internet and they respected my privacy. One thing to know is make sure to let them know if you’re hot as they tend to leave the AC off otherwise."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went down to go visit my boyfriend for the week and Geri's place happened to be right in the area. It was super affordable and the apartment was perfect for me to stay in. Super cozy and it was so nice having my own space. Geri was super welcoming and great with communicating as well! If I ever need a place to stay while I'm down there again, I would 100% stay here. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very clean, looked just like the pictures, felt like home, very comfortable, aside from the low ceilings it was perfect. will book again ! price was good. got exactly what I paid for !"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Geri was a wonderful host with a charming apartment. The walkway was well lighted and the place was very clean, quiet and easy to find. Geri was very friendly and while I was pretty busy during my stay, I enjoyed my chat with her and appreciated the check in to make sure I was enjoying my time there. Overall I would highly recommend this stay and the lovely host.
Please note that the driveway is gravel and if checking in late you will park in front of the house."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Geri's place was great! The space was clean, as described and had basic household items you'd need for a longer stay in the kitchen. She also has a Roku TV, DVDs and a puzzle for entertainment. The neighborhood is close to everything in town and I felt safe. The layout of the space is unique and it fully met my needs for my stay. Geri is an excellent Airbnb host. She is one of the friendliest people I've ever met and I enjoyed our conversations. Her communication was proactive and responsive and she provided clear instructions for my stay and local recommendations."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quirky but great for a quick visit.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Super good value for a cozy spot. Geri was tremendously helpful and hospitable.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay here. Geri was very helpful and made sure I knew exactly how to get to the apartment. Was a lovely place with a very comfortable bed and everything I needed to live comfortably for my stay. Felt like a home away from home and would 100% stay here again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kitchen has lots of room to prepare food. Roomy comfortable bedroom. Office with adequate desk space, quiet undistracting environment.
Ethical, responsive, and accommodative host, kind person. I am grateful for the way Geri handled her role. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Perfect for a “short” stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We found Geri's Getaway C loft unit exactly as described in the listing, located in a peaceful and wooded area yet not far from restaurants and shopping. We found Geri to be very responsive to communication and easy to deal with.
Highly Recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely worth the price for a quiet, peaceful getaway. Read Geri’s description. She is fully open - the ceilings are short in places, the floor squeaks, and there are stairs to climb - but it was just perfect for a single person. The arrangement is a bit awkward and the shower is in the dining area, but it is an attic apartment and I had everything I needed!! There isn’t much beyond salt and pepper in the kitchen so bring what you need, but I used the kitchen for almost every meal and it was great. Geri reached out to me via text before I arrived and I appreciated her opening that line of communication. It was a lovely few days and I was able to finish a project that I had been working on for a while. Also a bonus - the very reasonable cleaning fee!!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very great stay. Thankful for Geri being responsive and open to all my questions! She’s been great to work with. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Geri was very friendly and proactive in communicating before my arrival. The apartment was as pictured and a great size for one person. To enter, there's a flight of stairs to take. The ceiling height inside was no issue (I'm 5'7"" and didn't have to duck down at all unless I was at the sink in the bathroom). The location is perfect, quiet and safe."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and communication was great! The place was beautiful and exactly as described
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Decent little inexpensive place to stay in Paris. I'll admit I'm easy to please but it was overall clean and satisfactory for the value. Geri was great.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and Geri made it a great experience!! Getaway C was clean and really cozy! Geri went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect and it was!! I highly recommend getaway C to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Paris!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Geri is very easy to work with and accommodating. The space is charming with its angled ceiling line. I really enjoyed the larger window at the entrance. That is a great place to nap, work or read!"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time to stay in Unit C upstairs. Geri is a superb host and she keeps the upstairs unit very clean. We did not get the Roku working this time either. Tried to follow directions, but did not work. The wifi works and is very good."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful as always!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was warned that this apartment had low ceilings, and it did, but I’m only 5’2” so it was perfect! I was traveling by myself and this place was just what I needed. I was still close to everything but had my own secluded area to go to. Highly recommend"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cozy place to stay. Height in some places requires a little getting used to but still nice to stay in. Would go back as it’s a serene apt away from noise.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway “C”… upstairs studio apartment is definitely a gem in Paris. It’s convenient and close to everything…
It’s furnished with everything you need. Ceilings are low~ But not an issue for me @ all.
Geri is absolutely a Super Host!
Definitely would recommend 😉"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri is the sweetest host and this space was as advertised. Super cozy and perfect for 1-2 people! Definitely take the height recommendations into considerations. Anyone over 6 feet will need to duck in certain areas of the house! Everything was clean and well put together in a nice area. 10/10 recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Geri’s getaway was exactly what I needed for my stay in Paris! It’s also great when the hosts are very nice and helpful👍 I will definitely be staying at her place when needing a clean, convenient place to stay in Paris,TN 👏"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cute little place to stay at in Paris
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simple basic apartment, nothing fancy, but very clean and peaceful. Easy keyed access. Great location, quiet street and neighbors. Host is great communicator and responds quickly. Can tell thought went into details for guest's needs and amenities, including plug in fans and emergency fire escape ladder. There are hand soaps at sinks, but be sure to bring your shower soap and shampoos. Only really noticed the low ceilings in the bathroom. Bath with door has sink, tub, commode, then has a very small one person shower in the dining room. There is a standard refrigerator and a standard oven with stovetop. Bed is basic and comfy. Both the living room and the bedroom have large TV with DVD player."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Geri was incredibly nice and easy to access. She gave us a clean and comfortable place to stay.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A modest apartment with all the necessary amenities perfect when visiting Paris, TN. It’s located right between downtown Paris and the main shopping area. Take the height considerations serious. I’m 5’11” and bonked my noggin a couple times. A definite consideration for a cheap stay in Paris."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place for anyone wanting to spend a weekend in Paris TN. Very clean, close to resturaunts, and shopping. Terrific for relaxing."

2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,As billed. I didn’t have any issues.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Geri has been an angel. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Geri contacted me well before my trip to make sure that everything would be perfect. We also stayed in contact during the stay. A perfect host.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean affordable place to stay if your in Paris or surrounding parts !!! Great check in !! Pretty much in the heart of the city !!! You won’t go wrong here
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The apartment was cute and it had all the features needed for a home away from home. Residential setting but very close to town. Plenty of parking space for our kayak trailer. Geri was a wonderful host. She was very friendly, accommodating, and quick to respond."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have stayed in Air BnBs all over the world and we enjoyed our stay at Geri’s space. Geri was clear and communicative. The apt was bigger than we expected and clean. We appreciated the motion sensor on the front of the house bc we would get in after dark-so that was very inviting.
The location was convenient and the view to the backyard was beautiful. We will stay with Geri again!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Getaway is very quiet and away from the busyness of town, but is very close and convenient to shops and food. Geri was awesome to work with and was very accommodating."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Geri was so friendly and even set up a mini-scavenger hunt for things to do around Paris! I would stay here again if I'm back in the area

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed staying here. Made me feel at home. Close to restaurants and shopping. Owner was great.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a different home booked but ran into problems at check in. I found this place as a substitute and the host replied quickly and allowed us to book and check in within about 30 minutes. Everything was as it was described. The house was very comfortable and exactly what we needed. Check in and out was simple. Had a few waters in the fridge and a nice candy jar on the coffee table. We felt right at home. If ever in the area with a small group again, we will definitely look into this house first. Rhonda was a great host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you like cows, you'lll love this quaint house"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, very clean and host is always making sure everything is good."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place facing west so the sun is bright through the front windows in the afternoon, but not a problem with an adjustment of the blinds. The house smelled fresh and pleasant when I entered. The furniture and beds were comfortable and there was even a rocking chair. There are no curtains on the windows, only blinds, which was fine with me because that's the way it is at my house. But that makes it very bright in the mornings if you can't sleep in the light. I have a night mask so no worries for me. It's easy to find and easy to check in. Very peaceful setting with view of open land across the street. Kitchen has everything you need. I was alone but there are two bedrooms and ample space for several people to stay. Excellent place. Excellent host. There are a lot of wifi options but the one for this house is the first or second one so easy to connect and fast. I attended a zoom meeting when I arrived and no lag or buffering."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great house
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rhonda was a fantastic host and I would definitely recommend booking a stay at the Caledonia House if needing a place to stay in Paris, TN."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tastefully decorated and comfy. Everything you need is available for use! Quaint setting well taken care of and clean. The hosts definitely put effort into a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere for the guests. Would most definitely book this again if I am in the area. Super nice people and willing to provide if anything else is needed. I give 5/5 stars....beats any hotel accomodations!!! 😊
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough good things about Mark and Melissa’s place. Comfortable, spacious, VERY clean, close to town, easy to find, safe, beautiful farm views (to this city girl). There was a sign in the yard for farm fresh eggs, I asked Mark if I could get a dozen and they were delivered within minutes. If you’re coming to the area, you won’t regret staying here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was great. I really enjoyed my stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cried when I left. It was the perfect place to land for a great rest. Mark and Melissa took us on a tour of the farm animals which I loved and gave us recommendations of what to do in the area. The home was bright, cheerful, clean, almost brand new. The roosters did not wake us up. I hope to stay here again very soon.
As a special treat they sell fresh eggs, so ask them to leave you a dozen in the fridge."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mark and Melissa’s place is amazing. Beautiful and Peaceful spot. Great location next to everything you need, very private and safe. Great hosts always available if you need anything."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Was exactly what we needed for a recent work trip
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! The hometsead was very quaint, quiet and cozy. One of the nicest airbnb’s we’ve stayed in. Finding the place was very easy, check in was a breeze and our hosts were super helpful with any questions we had. Not that it would’ve bothered me anyways but i never even heard the rooster. Would definitely stay again for sure! Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay in a lot of places for work and this is the best one so far!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visited Mark and Melissa’s little paradise just this last weekend for a wedding, what an amazing place to stay at. I definitely would not mind staying here again.
Amazing people that went out of their way to make it feel like home."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's description of his place is spot-on, including the roosters and the homestead setting. We were so happy with the cleanliness of the space, the extra amenities, and functional decor. The kitchen is very well-equipped and even has an Instapot! We found everything we needed and Mark and Melissa were so friendly and accommodating. We even got to meet the goats and their kids. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Paris!
If you are a light sleeper, be sure to bring earplugs so the roosters don't wake you at 4:30am. If you stay in the winter, the furnace can be loud. Earplugs for light sleepers are a small price to pay because everything else about Mark's place is perfect! I completely agree that this is a favorite place to stay on airbnb!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Being a person from Paris this place was perfect! M & M are wonderful people and were very kind to us and do take you up on the offer about showing you the farm! Do not be shy they are so nice. :) Everything in the home was great as well as hearing the roosters. 🐓
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have rented a lot of houses through VRBO & Airbnb, & this little place will be at the top of our list to return to. Don't let the fact that it's a mobile home deter you from booking, because when you're inside it feels like a quaint little farm house. It was spotless clean, had plenty of towels & washcloths, extra blankets & pillows, & a nicely stocked kitchen. We are usually in the Paris area twice a year & won't hesitate to rent at m & m Meadows again!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,The hosts were absolutely amazing! The place was so great!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a family wedding and Mark’s place was the perfect home base. The beds were comfortable, baths clean and well-stocked, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We enjoyed watching the chickens and goats out the back windows."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay in Paris. I loved looking out at the garden and goats. Mark and Melissa generously let us extend our check out. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Looks just like the pictures.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's place had all the little things that you need for a comfortable stay. we don't always find everything that's needed.
Some places provide the bare minimum or essentials that are old or barely usable. That's not the case for Mark's"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I came to this Airbnb because it was close to my hometown but far enough away from it. It was peaceful and the view of their farm animals from the windows were the best. The place was pristine and comfortable and the kitchen island was my favorite feature of the place. Will definitely stay here again if it’s available next time I come visit. Mark was very responsive and communicative. Definitely worth the visit.

We really enjoyed our stay and would return in a heartbeat. Thank you for everything."

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay in Paris at Mark’s place. We were in town for our son’s graduation from Bethel U and were so happy to have a place that was as nice , clean and beautifully decorated as Mark’s listing. It is hard to find such places in that area, and I would highly recommend it for anyone coming to this location for a stay!! Communication and check in was great as well."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's property is wonderful! Very peaceful, has all you need, felt like being home. It was in the country enough to be quiet, but still very close to anything you might need. The only reasons my family did not rate it as 5 stars is the master bed was uncomfortable and the gravel walkway can be difficult to maneuver. Thank you for everything Mark!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mark was an excellent host. He responded to each message within minutes. I asked if there was a bread knife for my homemade bread and he made sure one was there and visible when I checked in. He met us after we arrived. There was a possible tornado warning for that night and he made sure we knew where the closest shelter was. Thankfully there were no severe storms! The accommodations were exactly as described. Mark has some farm animals and generously showed them to us. This was a wonderful place to stay and Mark was very hospitable. We'll be sure to try to stay there again if we're in the area.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in Paris for family but we had an awesome time at the place. Mark and Melissa were so friendlyand just all around great people. We would highly recommend staying there. And when we go back to Paris we will book there again for sure!! Thank you so much

We don't get that privilege here in the city. Mark and Melissa were very friendly. We hope they have an opening next time we come to Paris. Thanks Mark and Melissa for allowing us to stay at your Airbnb. John and Penny (from MICHIGAN)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay, place is always perfect"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. New mobile home; clean, new furniture, well-supplied kitchen, new appliances, comfortable beds, spacious bathroom, semi-rural setting. Mark and Melissa were excellent hosts. They gave us extra leeway on checking in and out due to winter storm and snow. They swept off the steps (front and back) to the trailer and the windshield of our car. They checked daily to see if we needed anything. Very easy to talk to, but gave us plenty of space to enjoy the place. Excellent value for the price. I would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay again, 2nd time booking. Will be booking again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful stay at this Airbnb. The location was perfect for our needs, and the rooms were clean and cozy. While the listing did not make it clear that the building is shared with the host's family business, it did not significantly impact our visit. We attended a local festival and needed to borrow lawn chairs for a parade; the host was incredibly accommodating and quickly provided what we needed. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and truly appreciated the warm hospitality from our hosts."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bonnie's place is a great example of why I tend to favor AirBNBs over hotels. The space itself was in an unusual spot (located on commercial property) but felt very quiet and safe. The entrance was literally 5 steps from the parked car. The bathroom was spacious and I appreciated cotton sheets, which most AirBNBs don't have. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. Where a property like this shines is the little extra things. We were there to see the eclipse and heading out for the day we were able to grab a couple of paper plates and a ziplock bag for our picnic lunch that we forgot to plan for. Also, the following morning when we were planning to head home we discovered that we had a completely flat tire. Bonnie's son was at his place of business next door and whipped out an air compressor and got us pumped back up before we could even ask. We're very thankful to him for helping us make it to the tire shop without having to change a tire in the rain!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This space is exactly what we needed! My husband picked up a few shifts at the local hospital so my 3 month old son and I decided to visit from 2 hours away! We were so very comfortable at Bonnie’s cozy home for two nights! The scent and decor is so inviting and relaxing! Cooking dinner the first night was so great not to have to rush out the door with the baby to eat. Watching Netflix and snacking on Bonnie’s snack basket was also a treat! We enjoyed dinner the following night at Olive Pit it was really great! The location for my husband couldn’t have been easier! We will be back for sure!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was absolutely perfect for me during my extended stay while working a travel assignment at the local hospital! It is clean, quiet, and located just a few miles from HCMC. The full-size kitchen was well equipped and allowed me to not have to eat fast food for every meal. There is plenty of room for parking, and I always felt safe there. Bonnie was very responsive throughout my stay, and she even had the mattress replaced within 2 days after I mentioned it felt “well used”! I highly recommend Bonnie’s place to anyone staying in Paris! Thank you for a wonderful stay."

We enjoyed grilling outside, we were happy there was a firepit...

We’ll definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, clean, elegant home.
I felt safe, it was very private, it had everything plus!
I rarely cook at an AirBnB but I did this time. As I travel often, I come with my spices…. But this one had the basics and more which is awesome.
Thank you for such a comfortable, just like home atmosphere.
I’ll be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and wonderful hosts
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had 6 adults (3 couples) staying and we were all very comfortable. We had some family come over from the area to visit and had plenty of space for entertaining inside. Unfortunately we didn’t stay long enough to be able to enjoy all the things she had to offer for outdoor gathering due to rain. Next time we hope to have a fire and do a little cooking outside with the barbecue grill she offers.
The area is very beautiful and felt so safe.
This was our first family reunion and we all can’t wait to plan the next one. Shanon I hope you will let us stay in your beautiful home again real soon!
The Anderson’s and Springer’s"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shanon’s place was one of the nicest and cleanest Airbnb’s me and my wife have ever stayed in. Shanon was always quick to reply if I had any questions or concerns.

The place was super clean and stocked up with essentials. We would stay there again and would recommend this place to Family and Friends. Definitely worth a 5-Star rating!!

Shanon is incredibly responsive, helpful and kind, but always respectfully of your privacy. You can tell she's put a lot of thought into making the home comfortable. As a woman traveling alone, I really liked that her family was a stone's throw away if I ever would've needed them, but also never felt too close. I slept well every night of my stay and would recommend to friends and family."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ralph and his brother Everett were both great. There were bad storms and they were concerned and checked in to make sure we were OK.

Located on a farm, the surroundings were peaceful and calm. I spent time out back just watching nature and relaxing in my downtime from sightseeing around the area. The host was very responsive, and the directions for accessing the property and check in and check out were clear and concise. The home was nicely decorated, the furniture was comfortable and it truly felt like home away from home. I surely want to stay here again in the future."

The kitchen was amazing and he had everything that we possibly need and then some. I love the carport and the road next to it that leads north I walked every day and did my walk and so it was amazing. And he kept the temperature. Nice and cool on a hot day and walking in was just amazing and it felt awesome. I would definitely give this place a five star rating and then some and I will definitely come back next year and do it all over again. The only bad thing is I wanted to stay longer because it was so homey like. Ralph did an excellent job and I loved it.

The milk, OJ, coffee, creamer, and granola bars that were provided was a nice and welcoming touch. The central AC worked really well. Common areas were clean and spacious. Ralph was available and accommodating when needed. This was our 8th time using AirBnB and Ralph's rental is definitely near the top of our list of our favorites so far! Would love to stay again if we're ever back in the area."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and serene surroundings. Well worth the money. The host is very respectful of your privacy but readily available if you need anything. The house is well stocked with supplies. We were very fortunate to find this place when we did. I can not say enough good things about the property or the host. Thank you again Mr Ralph for everything!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were traveling with kids to visit family. The house had plenty of room for the kids to move around and for everyone to have their own space. Everything was clean and well put together. Kitchen was well stocked and they were so considerate to even have some milk, coffee, and breakfast/snack items there for us. That was so much appreciated because the last thing you want to do after driving 8 hours is go to the store. We will definitely be coming back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lots of room, Ralph is a gracious host, he was worried about us checking in after dark and he went back to the house and turned the carport light on so we could find it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay here. It's difficult to find a place close to my family, and this worked out great. Cozy, comfortable, clean, and quiet. Yoder's store is right down the road, and the discount was a great touch. We will return."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved all the special touches, including a half gallon of milk and orange juice in the fridge when we arrived. Also, the coffee and tea selection for the Keurig and the other extras.
Even with all the issues we had because of a rare winter event, everything was fantastic. The heater went out because of the freeze and it was fixed right away. Issues with a broken pipe was taken care off within the hour. I can’t express enough how grateful my husband and I are for the care and thoughtfulness we were provided with our stay. Wonderful all the way around!!!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for our stay. The small touches were perfect. Clean and comfortable. Host was responsive for any questions. I’ll be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ralphwas very nice and quick to respond to my messages. very nice comfortable home. will definitely stay again when in the area for work.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Ralph was absolutely amazing! We had a couple issues but our calls were answered immediately & with kindness & patience. (Our nerves were a little frazzled after a 9 hr car ride) I would definitely recommend Mr. Ralph and this location!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ralph responded quickly to my questions and the cottage was very clean.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic, comfortable cottage. Everything you need for a pleasant stay. Close enough to Paris for dining, shopping or anything else you need but far enough out to feel secluded. Owner was amazing. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ralph was a wonderful host. He was easy to get in touch with and always pleasant. We had some plans change last minute due to weather and he was very flexible and accommodating. The extra kitchen amenities were wonderful: juice and milk in the fridge, coffee and tea k cups, and granola bars and other snacks. There was also a 10% off coupon for Yoder’s country store, which I highly recommend using. We are very happy to finally have an Airbnb in Paris to stay at when we visit family. We will definitely be back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wildas cottage is like being at home! We stayed for almost a month when we came to visit family in Paris. It's a very short drive into town from Wildas. Paris has everything you need. I also frequented the Yoder Country Store just a hop up the road. They have almost everything! From sandwiches to smoothies to groceries. The house is large and convenient with two bathrooms. Very cozy and a large kitchen. Full laundry room with detergent. Beds are amazingly comfortable, nice linens too. Everything is contained here for your stay. Loved the carport and the dogs loved to huge lawn for exercise. Ralph and Jan are excellent hosts! Stay here for a wonderful experience and kind and friendly hosts!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kim and Brent were great host for our family meet up. My nephew greatly enjoyed the chickens! We all enjoyed the fire pit and the front porch swing.
We did get some bad weather while we were there that knocked out the power for a few hours. The house was well prepared for it with lanterns, and we enjoyed our time living the Laura Ingalls wilder life for a few hours. Kim and her husband even extended an invite to breakfast.
Brent, even took the time to show my brother in law, a close up of the bee hives. We definitely plan to be back, and hope to be able to get years of memories for our children here!
Definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"

The amenities are amazing, Kim thinks of all the little things to make you feel at home."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Then cabin was absolutely adorable. We didn't want to leave! We were only in town for two days, but we most definitely will be back for a much longer stay. The cabin was spotless and the amenities were outstanding. There are oodles of games, both indoor and outdoor, left for visitors to play. There were even treats for all of us, including our puppy!
Outside you'll find a huge seating area in the beautiful wooded area, with fire pit and comfy chairs, that would be perfect for roasting marshmellows. This cabin is perfect for a family get together.
Kim, the host, was a delight and very responsive. You won't find a better host. We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this wonderful cabin! Our third stay here and it’s the best. Great location, beautiful area, perfect and comfortable house with everything you need. Kim is very responsive and great at communicating before and the during the stay. We’ll be back. Thank you again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's log cabin is lovely! The living room has plenty of room for guests to sit. The furniture was comfortable to sit on. Throw blankets,
if needed. Plenty of board games to play, if you preferred not to watch television. The kitchen is good size. Kim had bottled water in the large fridge. She had packaged popcorn, cookies and candy in a bin on the large dining room table. The master king size bed was the most comfortable cabin bed we have ever slept on. Extra blankets in the closet. We slept great! The bathroom was spacious. Kim has extra toothbrushes, toothpaste, and shampoo, if needed. There was an abundance of towels and washcloths available. We really enjoyed our stay at the log cabin! Thank you Kim for giving us a piece of home away from home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and would definitely stay there again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third or fourth stay here and I cannot say enough positive things about this place and Kim!

The communication was perfect and proactive. Can’t say enough great things but definitely will save this as one of our favorites."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay. The place was cute and cozy. Kitchen was stocked with all necessary items. We felt right at home.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this cozy little cabin. There were board games, a dart board & even corn hole to keep the kids entertained. The place was very clean & well stocked. They even had snacks which the kids enjoyed. Beds were comfortable and we had chickens roaming around when we woke up. Would 10/10 recommend staying here."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kim was an excellent host. Great communication from from the day of booking until the time of check out. The cabin was very nice, well appointed, had thoughtful extras and plenty of info available on surroundings near by. Our plan was to visit Paris, TN which is less than 10 minutes away, which we did. We also checked out Murray, KY on the recommendation of the Cabin notebook we found on the coffee table. It was a lovely visit to both sweet little towns. We would definitely stay again"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We always love staying at the cabin! Nice owners too!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time to rent Kim’s property . This cabin is worth so much more than what she charges . There are many things provided that I usually have to pack & bring . Property is incredibly clean ( which is the main reason I use AirBNB over hotels ). Grill is a big deal to me as this is a business trip so I cook my own meals morning & night . Her’s is perfect & cooks evenly. Beds are comfortable . TV has a lot of choices & is easy to use . Plenty of space to “ spread out “ Kim’s “ response time is incredible & she is so very pleasant . My only complaint is I was not there for very much down time . Hope to use the property some day for leisure .
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a comfortable place with soft leather furniture, nice clean beds, great TV with good reception and channels and pet friendly. I appreciated the outdoor lighting when taking out my dogs. The host was so helpful and graciously let us check in early."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay, its a very comfortable, relaxing little cabin. I will look it up in the future if we ever need to stay in the area again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing little slice of heaven. We were in town for a family funeral and felt right at home. Everything you could want and more. Such wonderful hosts, always communiting, even weather details regarding hazardous road conditions. The perfect home away from home, especially under our circumstances. They love hosting puppies, lots of amenities for our baby. Well documnented details of the area and amenities. Spaxioua and comfortable. Nicely decorated for the log cabin feel. Will visit again. Very fair pricing for what you enjoy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always great stay at Kim’s. We always stay here when we are in the area. To us it feels like home away from home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at the cabin but will not be the last!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was great, not far from Murray which is where we had to be for an event and the drive in wasn’t bad at all."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect accommodations!! We loved our stay and if back in the area will definitely go back. Not only did she have a jar of dog treats & a basket full of snacks for us the fridge had any condiment you would need!! There was a fantastic fire pit in the backyard and they had it stocked with firewood. Highly recommend staying at Kim’s cabin. She is a fantastic host.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was awesome and cabin was too best one yet would definitely recommend to stay there I’ve been to a lot and this one was best yet if could give ten stars I would lol
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at the cabin. It is perfect for our family. It is close to family and the things we wanted to do while we were in town. We will definitely like to return.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kim was incredible from the initial booking until even after we left. I didn't have many questions, but whenever I did, she responded almost immediately. the cabin itself fit my family's needs perfectly and was great to come home to after a day out. Everything was extremely clean and organized. Excited to stay many more times."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"it was great, I would go back"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is my go to place any time we are in the area and always will be. I already have my next stay booked!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for vacation, great host, all around great time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Kim’s property was perfect ! I have stayed in so many other properties that were nice but not near as well equipped as Kim’s . She has thought of everything. As well the property is beautiful & quiet which was good as this was a work trip . Value wise it was great as well. Kitchen , living area & front deck are larger than they look in the pictures. I will definitely book Kim’s cabin when I return to the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we loved this place!!Perfect location close to Paris such a quaint little town we're gonna move there!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful trip and a wonderful stay at ""The Little Cabin on the Highway!"" The cabin was beautiful, comfortable, extremely clean, and felt like home while we were there. Kim provided anything that you could need (and then some) in the cabin to make your stay easy. Kim and her husband were very gracious hosts!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a cozy cabin!! plenty of space,we were able to entertain guests. Kim even offered to supply us with more firewood. The hosts have several chickens, Kim brought us over an 18 pack of delicious fresh eggs!! We have family in nearby Paris, TN. This will be our go to, if available for all future visits!!
Thanks to Brett and Kim for a wonderful relaxing vacation"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We chose to rent this cozy cabin due to parent weekend at Murray State. Kim was a great host and we enjoyed our stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed at this cabin, and it just keeps getting better. It's so peaceful and so relaxing. It just feels like home. We had a very emotional trip for a very special grand opening this past weekend, and at the end of each day coming back to the cabin was just like coming home. It gave us the peace and quiet and the relaxing atmosphere that we needed so badly. Thank you Kim and Brent, you two are great hosts and you have a wonderful place there. I can't wait to see what you do with the other house. I know we will be back. And we will always look to stay with you guys."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect get away for our family. We have 2 older kids and we all have sweet, trouble free dogs that are part of our family and struggle to find places that don't charge an arm and a leg per pet. They are welcoming to pets but just want you to care for & clean up after your pet...easy! We're so thankful to have found this place!! We love Paris Landing and its not far from there. Honestly, the photos don't do the cabin justice. It's way sweeter and more comfortable than we imagined. Every game you can think of to play, they have. And like when it said fully stocked kitchen, i didnt think we'd have coffee or spices, salad dressings, or butter. I was just thinking plates , bowls, pots & pans, etc. I didnt expect toiletries but we needed a few and they were there.. So many nice extras! Then she offered and treated us to fresh eggs!!! Real fresh, like from her chicken!! It was such a treat. The cabin is such a delight. We didn't want to leave but left thankful and refreshed!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place was well maintained with plenty of amenities. All in all, a great place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim and Brent were awesome. Very friendly. Our son was doing a road trip and met up with us in TN and they allowed him to park his camper at the cabin and plug into the shop for a gew days. Even brought us fresh eggs. Couldn't have ask for better host. Welcomed us to the area since we just purchased a home not far from them
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay. it was the perfect location for us. everything you need was there and if you had any questions they were always very helpful. we definitely plan on visiting again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay!! Very responsive and the house was super clean and as described. The host thought of everything to make your stay wonderful!! Will definitely stay again if in the area!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Little Log Cabin by The Highway really is by the highway but set far back enough that it is quiet in the cabin as the traffic noise is hardly noticed. It is a nice-sized cabin to comfortably accommodate and sleep our family of six. The cabin is well stocked and very clean. There are also numerous board games , dart board, and a corn hole for outside fun. Nice fire ring with 6 Adirondack chairs for sitting outside. Being by the highway you are confined to the property for walking so the cabin is a good base for exploring the surrounding area. The host is extremely helpful and even offered to do our laundry when the washing machine broke during our stay! A very cozy and relaxing cabin for family time."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kim was an awesome host! Not only did she give us all the info we needed ahead of time, but she also had a great book in the house with recommendations for food, destinations, and instructions for things around the house. We especially loved the fire pit, the wrap around patio, and the free range chickens!
The only con was that area had very little going on in terms of food. But we would totally stay here again. We stayed one night and went to the Blue & White Grill (based on the menus they had in the cabin!) and that was very homey and tasty. Fried okra, hush puppies, etc. Very Southern!
We were comfortable in the home! Thank goodness they had wifi because it was a mostly dead zone for us with T-Mobile. Kim was super sweet and left us snacks in the kitchen table, and had a well stocked bathroom, refrigerator, and coffee station. A nice find on a long road trip."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kim was literally one of the best hosts I’ve ever encountered! She was responsive and helpful! Her place was cozy, clean and welcoming. I can’t wait to stay here again! Thank you for an amazing stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kim and Brent was so nice and their little log cabin is amazing. They thought of everything. Well be staying there again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was very helpful and friendly. The cabin was beautiful and incredibly clean. VERY pet friendly and the location was just a short drive from restaurants, activities and shopping. We will definitely be staying again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we walked in, we were excited to be there. We will book this cabin every time we are on this side of Tennessee. Anything you forgot, they thought to have. It was just amazing, only great things to say."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at at the Log Cabin twice now. Once a few years ago and once before the 4th. The porch swing and grill are perfect for a breezey day and there are multiple games to play. The kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, condiments, and what not. There were even seasonings. They remember the things you're likely to forget, like the salt and pepper, haha. They were always quick to respond and check-out was super easy! We have loved both our visits and will be back next time we are through!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the Little Cabin and we were not disappointed. Kim and Brent were great hosts, very friendly and personable. We enjoyed the amenities of the house as well as the property. We had plenty of everything. We got to know the hosts a bit better on this stay and we appreciate them even more. We are looking forward to what they have planned for the future. This house is worth every penny and more. We will defiantly be back.
Thanks, Kim and Brent!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very welcoming, comfortable and peaceful, and only about 5 miles from Paris, TN which has lots of restaurants and stores. And the host is sweet, very responsive and thoughtful by leaving lots of amenities we might have forgotten and goodies for our consumption. We absolutely enjoyed our stay!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The location was great for us! My husband and I took three days and traveled to five surrounding states. The nearby town of Paris was so quaint and we loved the Eiffel Tower there! So thankful the cabin was pet friendly! Loved the homeyness of the cabin that takes you back in time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, Convenient, and had all the necessities. Friendly host, very responsive"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy cabin!! We loved it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful and relaxing stay! We plan to stay here again next time we're in the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clear instructions, home is super comfortable and well placed for a relaxing getaway. I see myself planning trips based soon the availability on this cabin in the future."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect setup for anyone but especially outdoorsmen like myself and the guys who accompanied me. Very clean and organized. Lacks absolutely nothing for a perfect getaway. Already planning our next bookings!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Kim's cabin was wonderful! This was our fourth visit to this lovely cabin. Feels like home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very awesome and friendly people would recommend 1000 times over
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Home away from home! I felt comfortable the moment I walked in. I honestly don’t have anything negative to say at all. It’s a nice place with comfortable beds, sofas etc…"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great cabin/space - we loved walking around the property and certainly felt very cozy inside also.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kim’s cabin was great! She thought of everything, from extra blankets to even giving us farm fresh eggs we enjoyed our stay so much. The rooms were clean, kitchen was up to date, and living room was very comfortable. The porch swing was also a great place to spend the afternoon! I would highly recommend staying at Kim’s cabin!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super, super clean!!! One of the cleanest places I've stayed at!!!! I am picky when it comes to cleanliness and Kim's log house really met my expectations. The beds/linens were well taken care of, looked new, no stains/rips/pulls, overall excellent shape and super comfortable too! A fully stocked kitchen is a must for us since we like to cook our own meals and Kim's kitchen had absolutely everything we needed. We stayed during a night of bad weather with possibility of tornadoes and Kim sent me a message the morning of our arrival to give us clear instructions on where to go should we need the storm shelter. She was always responsive throughout that day when I reached out with weather related questions. We were in Nashville for spring break and decided to extend our stay but wanted a change of scenery and we were really lucky to have come across Kim's cabin. We will definitely stop by again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An awesome place to stay! My family and I throughly enjoyed this place. A clean and cozy cabin in a great location. They provide some board games and have a fire pit, all of which we enjoyed. The host is WONDERFUL, and great with communicating. We had some rough weather one day of our stay and she reached out to make sure we had everything we needed for the impending storm. We look forward to our next trip and hope to book here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Log house is exactly as described. Clean, cozy, and has everything you could need for your stay and more. Check in and out is as simple as it can get with zero hassle at all. This was my first time using Airbnb and Kim has set the bar high!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect choice for our family of 7. Quite the cozy cabin. Hosts were generous and hospitable, even to the point of helping us charge the dead battery in our van when we were ready to leave."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is amazing. Wish it was our destination and not just a stop our way through. Cabin has everything you could need, and more. Highly recommend"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was Awesome! They went above and beyond for me!
We had a great stay and the location was peaceful and amenities are plentiful.
Great place to stay we will be back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin sleeps 7 and there was a baby crib set up when we arrived. It was perfect for a family birthday we had because of the roomy kitchen and open room plan with the living room. Everyone had a place to sit down. The fire pit was the draw for the family. We had planned to go to a restaurant but decided to relax in doors where we were not rushed!! Then all the adults except me went outside and had time by the fire. The kids did to and had plenty of place to run!! We all loved it. Plenty of games to play!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Check in was easy. Everything was spotless. Kim was very responsive to any questions. I liked that they had a binder with history about the cabin and local food recommendations.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was absolutely gorgeous! Myself and my family all felt right at home as soon as we checked in. Kim thought of everything to keep family’s entertained from the board games to the corn hole set up. Highly recommended!!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect for my family. I will be back over and over again. It was a record breaking cold with near blizzard conditions supposed to be the day we arrived. I contacted her. She answered immediately with a big Yes to coming a day early. They were double checking the cabin when we arrived ahead of bitter frigid cold, to make sure all was good. It was warm inside and we put the central heat to the test in negative actual temps and -20 windchill. It never hiccuped one time and she checked on us several times. So comfy inside. Fur-babies welcome and even had a crate available. We didn’t have little ones but I saw a crib and pack n play in closet. Lots of blankets. Tons of towels. We didn’t run out after 4 days. Loved this!!! Full kitchen with everything. Welcome basket with snack and some drinks in fridge. Games, books, corn hole, and fire pit among the great touches. It only gives me 5 stars to rate, but I would give a 10 if I could."

The cabin was very clean and well laid out. Kim has everything labeled for your convenience and is excellent with communication. The cabin is well-stocked with many amenities. In fact, the area lost power our 2nd night there. Kim communicated with us right away to make sure we were okay and knew what to do. This made for a fun memory of playing board games by lantern light (provided in the cabin). The beds were very comfortable. There were plenty of towels provided. Night lights were placed throughout cabin for safety. There was even firewood and lawnchairs provided for a campfire. Their chickens live with them next door.

There was plenty of room for us all. We would definitly stay again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The unit is a converted garage on the property of the main house. While the room itself is all-in-one bedroom, living room and kitchenette, it was super clean. Lots of items packed into the space for convenience and comfort. Like - a remote control for the thermostat, frosty mugs in the freezer for icy cold drinks, and a bowl of mint chocolates for your sweet tooth.
The surroundings were beautiful and there were two comfy rockers in front of the property in the shade where you could just sit and look at the lake across the street. You could swim right there in you wanted, or there was a little nicer beach just around the corner. I also enjoyed walking in the trail just across the street in the beautiful, wooded preserves. We found a local burger joint nearby that was surprisingly good as well.
Mostly, though the host & hostess were great! Welcomed me personally, invited me to sit on their screened porch, have a beer and just chat. Felt like I was visiting family"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sammie and Potana were excellent hosts! I got there in time to take a swim in the lake across the street before the sun went down, ate at a restaurant based on their recommendation, and even took an evening walk.
When checking out, I forgot my charger and hair product, so Potana called me before I left their neighborhood to turn around. Upon retrieving the forgotten items, Potana surprised me with WARM oatmeal cookies for the Road!"

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were so friendly and accommodating! They met us as we checked in and also checked in with us several times for our weekend stay. The apartment is just as described and was very clean. It did have a smell that seemed to be smoke from long ago. Unfortunately that smell is very hard to get out. The bed was super comfortable and fresh flowers were put out for us along with 2 bottles of water in the fridge which was a very nice touch. The shower did not have very good water pressure but was not a deal breaker. The location to the lake was walkable but I incorrectly assumed it was the owners property. It is public property and there was a lot of traffic on it and tons of 4-wheelers even late at night which made for a less peaceful stay. Our biggest problem was the wifi, as we had a big problem texting/calling to check in on kids while we were there. We have ATT and were told Verizon is better. Overall a very nice stay for the price."

CLEAN, 2 comfortable Bedrooms, 1 Bath, cozy sitting area, nice front load washer & dryer if needed, front and back porches. It is near the hospital but it is still very quiet at night. There is also nice, polite neighbors who have the cutest home back yard bar next door, and again still quiet. We were in town for a couple of family memorials and this was ideal to destress after services. We hope to be back in the area for better reasons and when we are, we will see if this place is available. Owners communicated well and even left us a delightful souvenir."

The sunsets were amazing to watch from the cabin's front porch in their lovely patio furniture and we enjoyed watching the goats being fed and play around. The two beautiful puppies on the property were friendly and one enjoyed playing with our girls near their playset. Being able to bring our own puppy with us was so helpful and their puppies were very welcoming to Loki.
Upon check out, Ralph was quick to respond to how we could help clean up the cabin while we prepared for departure.

It had everything we needed for our one night stay, from extra bed linens, to kitchen utensils, to bath towels. Ralph stated they live close by on the property (can see their house from cabin) and offered to share their household supplies if need be, but that wasn’t the case because they already had everything at the cabin.

Ralph took the time to call prior to our stay and offer us an out if we didn't feel comfortable with the lack of storm shelter. He also provided a list of storm shelters in the area. Ralph was always very responsive and a pleasure to work with. We had the cabin to ourselves, but it felt like in a moments notice Ralph would take care of us.
Cabin was as described. Very clean, spacious, and full of amenities that we wish we could have enjoyed more if it wasn't for the weather. The area was very peaceful and a great place of your looking for a quiet country getaway.

I had seen someone else post this fact before we went and I found it to be so true. The host was so nice and made us feel that he really wanted us to have a good time. He and his wife really care and do all they can to make this a nice experience for a family. Don't hesitate to stay in this beautiful cabin. It has everything you can think of for a nice stay. The scenery was beautiful. The goats looked as big as welsh ponies to me. It was also so nice to see chickens roaming. There is a bathroom with every bedroom and also a half bath by the garage. Also a beautiful outdoor play area for children. There is everything one could think of for an enjoyable time. Our 17-year-old son got to enjoy some time with 2 of his friends. They enjoyed the firepit and the spacious area at the top of the stairs that was perfect for teenagers to hang out. They laughed and carried on like teenagers that were really enjoying themselves. The laughter I heard from my son enjoying himself was the most beautiful part of the whole trip. We all went outside several times during the night to look up at the huge sky full of stars. We are talking about coming back as soon as we can and spending more time just to sit on the beautiful porch and relax in the country air.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For any family looking for the perfect place to stay in Paris, this is a real great place. It is super comfortable and feels like home. The photos online do no or do the amazing woodwork justice. Each room was done with antique furniture that made it feel so special. The host was very good at communicating and made certain that if needed he would be available. We did not get to enjoy some of the outside touches (it was cold and due to our schedule time was limited). I can definitely see a family enjoying the fire pit and playground. A little distance from town, but the cutest country store nearby. If we are to return to Paris TN again in the future this will be the first place we check for availability."

,,,"It saddens me to write my first ever negative review. Maybe at one time, this was a good place to stay, and maybe with a lot of attention and hard work, it could be again, but currently it's a rodent house. When I checked in, I did not see the glue traps the host had placed around, nor did I see the huge Servall Pest Control card that was under the night stand. I'm sure if I had, I would have asked questions.
After finally getting asleep around midnight on the very old squeaky mattress with scratchy sheets, I awoke around midnight to the sound of chewing and scratching in the kitchen, which had no door to divide it from the bedroom. This continued on for hours, keeping me awake, and making me very nervous. I waited until 7 am to text the host to ask if she had mice or rats, and to tell her I could hear chewing. She replied back ""Mice, I'm sure. Just need to get some glue strips."" I was surprised at her response as I had already without looking found one in the bathroom beside the tub, and two in the kitchen. I text her back, ""I'm not rested and pretty creeped out"". Her text back to me was unreal, ""I've been up all night worried about all thus over time and keeping this business going. I'm creeped out too. We will tell Helen to get glue strips. You are bugger than it is. Lol. Rembrr you are the adult, the one with thumbs. Lol. You can drive and cook. What do they do. Eat and shit. Eat and shit. Lol. Is ok. Go in There and claim your place in the world. You can do it. Fight, fight, fight. What can he do? Eat ya? No, no, no. Lol."" Stunned and certainly feeling ridiculed by someone who I expected to be appalled that I had such an experience, I text her back ""Ok. Well thanks for your concern. I will be checking out today."" To which she text back "" Lol. You ok, Chick.""
Even though I had paid for two nights, I stayed from 9pm to 7am the first night only. I immediately filed a complaint and a request for money back with Airbnb, sending screen shots of the text messages and the pics of the glue traps. I shudder now to think the hours of chewing was probably the mice trying to free itself. After the host's response, I just could not stay there.
The positives were a pretty quilt on the bed, and the clawfoot tub with shower added on, however the towels and washcloths were very worn and needed replacing.
I wish I didn't have to write such an review, but it has to be done so no one else has my experience. I wish the host well and hope she gets her rodent problem under control, just maybe she shouldn't rent her place until she does."
