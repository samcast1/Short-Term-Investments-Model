2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, walkable to many shops and restaurants. Beds and pillows comfortable; we slept great. Plenty of room for our family of 4. The house is old but clean. Appreciated the number of towels provided. Could have used more blankets and another key. Friendly host with the clearest parking and checkin instructions I've ever seen. Would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect for our family of 5 visiting our son at IUP. Large bedrooms, nice accommodations and met all of our needs during our stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darcie , is an excellent host. Always quick to respond. The apartment is located in the center of town walkable to many restaurants. Don’t pass up booking here. You will be very pleased."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great! Many restaurants/ bars were walkable. I was a little bit worried that we wouldn’t be able to find an Uber or Lyft to things that were further away, but it was no issue at all! We loved the disobedient distillery and the local Thai place was fantastic. The location is right in the city, and to be expected there is some noise from the street but nothing that takes away from your stay. Darcie was incredibly responsive."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming place!
One thing that stood out: I called ahead to let Darcie know the guests were arriving late. She immediately indicated she'd go over to the unit and turn on the lights, so that the place wouldn't be in darkness when they arrived.
This was so thoughtful of her."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we were in town for Thanksgiving with family so we spent very little time there. it was a warm, clean, comfortable space to come back to at the end of our days. instructions on parking and entering were very clear with photos. very good experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a great place and a fun location! The Host was extremely kind and super friendly during our communication. I highly recommend this AirBNB and Darcie as a host!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Spacious three bedroom was very comfortable for 5 adults. Clean and well appointed and the price was very fair.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peacock Palace was a nice place for our family of four to stay for a few nights while visiting family in Indiana. It is right downtown and easy to walk to restaurants, etc. Darcie was extremely responsive when we had an issue with the A/C and went above and beyond to help resolve the issue quickly. We all (especially our kids) loved the colorful peacock decor and unique space. The bedrooms were quite large so we had plenty of room for all of us. Thank you, Darcie, for being such a gracious host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place in the heart of Indiana. Darcie is an awesome host and quickly communicated with us during our stay. We’ve stayed at multiple places she manages, and I look forward to our next stay with her."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darcie was the most thoughtful, responsive host I've ever had. I loved being right on Philadelphia St. and Darcie thought of everything. I especially appreciated the water filter pitcher. I travel for work and travel with a faucet attachment filter so I don't have to buy bottled water and to have filtered water waiting on me was super nice. I would recommend this place to anyone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peacock Palace was a great place to stay. It is right in the heart of Indiana and had everything we needed for our visit. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at one of Darcie’s locations! She was a great host and the location was perfect ! Gorgeous place !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I picked Tiffany's place because it's located in the heart of the Indiana, PA, business district and basically across the street from a restaurant where I was having dinner during my stay. I arrived about three hours before check-in and Tiffany was just finishing cleaning and said I could put my stuff inside. That was appreciated.
Tiffany's place has 4 bedrooms on the first floor and two bathrooms. The extra bathroom, with a walk-in shower, was a strong selling point. The choice of bedrooms and bathrooms made me feel a little like Goldilocks with one difference — everything was just right.
Tiffany is friendly and ever so helpful. The beds were comfortable. The AC units worked great. Parking was free in a lot behind the house. As far as accommodations, everything was perfect.
If you're going to Indiana for a homecoming or football game or graduation, I'd steer you to Tiffany without hesitation. And the next time I stay overnight, Tiffany's place will be my first choice."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, nicely decorated, friendly host"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice. Clean. Felt like home. Tiffany was probably the nicest host I've ever had.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn’t have asked for a better place for my entire family to visit my son. Tiffany was very kind a flexible during my stay.

I will be reserving this home again on any trip I make to see my son. I highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Right in town so it’s close to multiple restaurants and bars. Rooms are nicely sized with comfortable beds. Plenty of parking which is quite nice. The back bedrooms (facing Philadelphia St) can be a bit noisy since it’s right next to the main street, but it’s easy to get used to and it quiets down later in the night. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"Great stay for the It’s a Wonderful Life festival. Only issue was noise from the top apartment-barking dogs the first day and really loud music the second. The apartment itself was large, clean and comfortable."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place for our group. We were all sad this was just a quick stop to rest on our road trip. Would be a perfect place to bring a larger group for several days!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host/owners were very friendly and communicative. I really appreciated her giving us a heads up that there were events that weekend (college town) & at times neighbors can get loud. We didn’t really experience any loudness or disturbances but knowing that ahead of time was very helpful to plan for our children. The place was great all the way around and had plenty of parking.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great stay! Would definitely come again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Third time we have stayed at Tiffany’s place. Perfect stop close to IUP campus and uptown Indiana. Roomy, cozy and clean."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Tiffany was a great host and accommodates for large groups! We held a retreat at her house and she gave us many recommendations for restaurants that would accommodate 12 and told us about the area with her guestbook.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiffany’s place was perfect for what we needed. Definitely plenty of room for bigger groups but was still a more than comfortable place for 2 people. Absolutely would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The cutest place!!!!! Was the perfect size for our group and we had a ton of fun there!!! So much to do nearby and the best location all around! So thankful this was available for our trip into town- thank you again!!!!!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiffany was a phenomenal host!!! This was our first Airbnb and it couldn’t not have been any better. The pictures and descriptions were spot on. Tiffany was very responsive and answered all my questions. We will definitely be staying here again when we come to visit our daughter at IUP. Staying at her place was hands down better than any hotel. Was nice not having people stomping above you or kids knocking at your door at 1am and running off. Location was perfect for all we had to do over the weekend. Super clean and had everything you needed and more!!!! Thanks again Tiffany.

This property is a lot of value for the money."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second year in a row my family has stayed here while in the area for a family reunion. We are so glad we found this house. It’s big enough for all of us, and it has a great kitchen we can use to make our dishes for the reunion. Tiffany is an amazing host who is wonderful with communication. They upgraded the kitchen, and the house was even better than last year. Everything is clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here."

2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"This place was perfect for my family to stay in while we celebrated my daughter's graduation from IUP. It was clean and comfortable. It served our purposes. Responsive host, and no problems."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tiffany's home was just lovely, clean, extremely spacious with a full kitchen and massive tv. Loved the radiator heat and the general ambience that made it cozy and feeling apart and yet we were steps away from Philadelphia Street and an endless array of shops, restaurants, coffee houses AND the Jimmy Stewart Museum.
We plan to make a return trip to beautiful Indiana, PA next year and hope Tiffany will host us again. We look forward to coming home again."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place for a mini reunion and visit to campus and town.

2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"Good location in downtown Indiana, PA. Very walkable, lots of restaurants/bars in area. House comfortably slept 4 adults and 2 children. Can technically fit more, but would be tight/sharing rooms."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the rental! Plenty of space, comfortable beds, & a great location . We loved being able to walk to the downtown stores & restaurants. We walked down everyday except Christmas Day to Cafe Amadeus for a latte & European pastries!
The best part of the rental was being able to bring our dog! She loved walking downtown & we felt safe leaving her in the rental during the evening to visit with family.
Definitely recommend!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The townhouse is very nice and located on the edge of downtown. It is close to everything and there are a lot of choices of places to eat. Tiffany was very helpful and was even able to let us check in early.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice and roomy rental. Was perfect for our traveling family for a wedding weekend. Plenty of towels and it was so nice to have the beds made up upon arrival. Tiffany responded quickly to our questions.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great listing
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The space and location are perfect for us and make our visits back to Indiana so much easier. We have also stayed in the upstairs of this house and we prefer this one with the two bathrooms and less stairs but both are great spaces and the hosts are fabulous and very thoughtful.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Nice spacious 1st floor apartment. Nice comfy beds, a washer a dryer and a nicely stocked kitchen."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a spot in the heart of the action in Indiana, this is the spot. Lots of bedrooms and space. It’s right across the street from the Jimmy Stewart museum and if you are a fan. you will definitely want to take the tour.
Tiffany was very helpful, we had an issue with the TV and she came over and took care of it. Thanks again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! House was very roomy and comfortable! Walking distance to the downtown was a plus! Would definitely rent again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed in a place that Tiffany has. Both times were great. She is a great host, very easy to get in contact with and responds quickly. Her properties are clean and comfortable. I would stay at one of her properties again if I am in the area and would highly recommend her to anyone else"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice location, close walking distance to downtown area, restaurants/bars and the Jimmy Stewart Museum. Our host was quick to respond, check-in and check-out process went smoothly. House worked well for extended family to stay to attend wedding. Older house, but well maintained and clean. As advertised."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tiffany was a great host! She was very friendly and helpful. This rental was spacious and had what we needed for a weekend stay. The only thing I did not like was that there is no central air. There are AC window units in the bedrooms, so my bedroom felt great. However, the bathrooms, living room, and kitchen were hot because the temperatures outside were high during our visit. I am used to AC throughout the house, so that was the only thing I did not like. As long as you are prepared for that, you are fine. It's a great deal!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The host were nice, I would recommend this spot to anyone in the area!"
2022-08-01,4,Group trip,"We enjoyed the spaciousness of this stay. We had a lot of room to mingle and a bed for each of us with room for more.
The location couldn’t be beat as far as walkability and ease to get to local shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The hosts were very kind and informative but we did have a major issue with the house next door. Apparently it’s student housing and they threw a huge party just feet away from the bedroom windows. It was a pretty restless night even over the window units inability to drown them out."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Right in the middle of town! So conveniently located- you can literally step out the front door and walk to pretty much anything- restaurants, bars, boutiques, shops, library- everything. . PLENTY of parking- we had our 2 vehicles plus our cargo trailer and still there was plenty of spots left. The side yard is perfect for playing catch or yard games! if we are back in Indiana we will book this place again"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, Tiffany was very friendly and communication was great, fantastic location and a very beautiful town"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect place for us. We were in town to set up our Japanese nephew for grad school, and we loved the location, size and utility of the unit, the great kitchen, and the laundry machines - not to mention the huge television in the living room. Indiana is a charming small town, and this house is perfectly situated a short walk from the cafe's and shops in the center of town. We found it to be wonderfully suited to our needs, and an excellent value."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tiffany and her husband have a beautifully renovated house on Philadelphia street. Our group greatly enjoyed this house for its super convenient location, nice price for a large group, and open communication with the hosts. This Airbnb was leagues better than a hotel, and offered 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms! Tiffany and her husband responded quickly to any questions we had, and were ready to lend a hand when needed (I locked myself out once 🤦‍♀️). We will be booking with them again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Really nice Airbnb. Great living room with enough space for everyone. We stayed here with 7 girls and it worked perfectly. The 2 bathrooms are a big plus. Tiffany always helped us and the communication with her was great.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Down the street from IUP. Had a great stay owner response quickly. Plenty of room for at least 8 guests.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great value and location! Host is very helpful, and the place is spacious and well-provisioned. Perfect for families with children -"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Tiffany was an outstanding host who was easy to communicate with and very helpful! Her house was comfortable and worked very well for our group of 9. The kitchen also worked well for preparing our meals. Would definitely stay here again!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value and great location! Good wifi and comfortably sleeps many people!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,great stay...close to IUP
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a comfortable stay at Tiffany's house. House was exactly as described. Tiffany was prompt and very jovial in her communications.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Great location near campus, kitchen had everything we needed. Would stay here again."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic location and everything was awesome. Exactly what we were looking for.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very spacious apartment, 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms were a great space for us while travelling. Tiffany went even further to provide us with a high chair as well as a crib for our toddler, all in all a good stay. The kitchen could have been a little bit cleaner and unfortunately the apartment upstairs had a late check in with other guests and it was quite noisy."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Great price! Tiffany is very responsive! We will definitely be back soon!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location! Large enough for everyone to have their own space.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! Very attentive owners pre arrival. Check in was easy! Parking is great!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Tiffany was an amazing host. Very communicative and the location was perfect!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a cool place fr, it was clean and nice as hell. Tiffany was such a great host and I really loved her sense of humor, she communicated with us greatly always checking on us. I really like this sort of hospitality. I would recommend her place to anyone that came to visit Indiana PA to checked it out. He or she gonna like the place."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A comfortable, roomy apartment, a very responsive host, easy parking, easy check in/out, and a great location surrounded by places to eat. (Note: eating out is definitely easier than cooking out of the apartment). I'd definitely recommend that guests have a plan for white noise. We got hit with a particularly loud Saturday night with drunk neighbors. Tiffany is great and is putting in place information to help future guests who encounter this problem. I fully intend to stay here again if/when the opportunity arises!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is even nicer than it appears in the photos. It is very spacious and the location is perfect - a short walk to campus, and right on the town’s main street but a block or so away from the more commercial/bar area. It was spotlessly clean and the beds were very comfy. I can’t imagine ever staying in an Indiana hotel again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place and if we need to stay in indiana again, we will definitely be checking the availability here."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tiffany has superb communication and is sweet as can be. Definitely recommend staying here! The house is huge, clean, comfortable, and super accommodating."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are usual hotel guests but had our dog this trip. We have enjoyed the house,location, and access to our hosts. It is incredibly spacious and has everything you need. The renovations completed so far are beautiful. The only downfall is that we didn’t find this sooner."
2022-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The location is great with easy access to everything in town. We anticipated more street noise, but we were pleased that it wasn't a concern. The space itself is large and was great for a bigger family to spread out with 4 bedrooms and 2 updated bathrooms. Tiffany was very accommodating and good and quick at communicating with us. Our family is used to quiet, so it was very difficult having an extremely active day and night family above us. It wasn't a level where we felt like we had to leave, but we were glad we brought fans and white noise machines to help drown out the running feet. If you plan on cooking meals, check with the host on what is available. I am sure she would help to provide what was needed."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Tiffany was great! She responded promptly and made check in so easy!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very pleasant stay and very helpful! Booked it again for another week!
2022-01-01,4,Group trip,"Tiffany and Dan were great hosts. They were very hospitable and attentive to our needs. They dropped by a couple times to do some improvements on the house, but other than that we didn’t see much of them. The house was nice and had lots of space for guests. The newly renovated bathrooms were wonderful!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan and Tiffany were gracious, inviting hosts, and the townhome was exactly what we needed, as described. The living situation with 4 adults was very cozy, and we had a lovely stay. Definitely plan on coming back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Tiffany was a gracious host. She was really great at responding to any questions I had. My friends and I had a great weekend in Indiana and we were able to stay in close proximity to all of the restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay! The location isn't very private but we were only staying one night so no big deal
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home, great location, very hospitable host! My family truly enjoyed our stay at The Divinity Inn."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,excellent home. perfect location.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Thanks so much for making your home available. The house has so much character and my mom who is 83 said it made her feel like she was home in the house she grew up in Pittsburgh. The work wood is exquisite and space is immaculately clean.

FYI, there is a bar/restaurant next door that plays music loud into the night so be mindful of this if you are a light sleeper or have any kiddos."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and clean. Host was receptive and checked in mid week to make sure all was well.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We have family in town, so we're in Indiana frequently. This is a great meeting place and jump off point to walk to bars and restaurants on Philadelphia St. Two of the best bars/restaurants in town are basically attached to the property. The house was spacious and charming. The front porch was a surprisingly entertaining people and dog watching spot. The bicycle shop across the street has 2 really cute and very obedient pups that hang out on the grass all day that we could watch for hours interact with customers and passersby."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic stay! The location is perfect, so close to downtown and restaurants. The house is beautiful with so much character and charm.

Easily walkable to all of Philadelphia streets finest, including Indiana Eye Center, who fixed our 11yo’s glasses after he stepped on them. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly, and Mary Anne was a wonderful host! This is the perfect home away from home! We will 100% return!!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Two things that I was not pleased with was the loud music from the restaurants late into the night and only 2 bathrooms for 8 people. Other than that loved the location and the house itself. I actually knew the family who lived there!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house is a beautiful old house., very nicely decorated. Great location close to restaurants and coffee shops. House is roomy with lots of space for guests to spread out and have private space. The house was very clean. The free washer and dryer came in handy. I would highly recommend this home and hope my family and I will be able to return sometime."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Divinity Inn is a beautifully restored, and updated, Victorian home. It can comfortably sleep 8-10 and is well appointed with a nice coffee bar and stocked kitchen. We loved the location and the charm of the house!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our family truly enjoyed our time here! Beautiful historic home that provided everything that we needed for our stay. Great location for exploring the area, close to many restaurants, coffee shops and local sites. Check in was simple. Host was great to work with. We definitely will rent again when in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Eight of us girls visited Divinity Inn for a local staycation to just hang out, play cards, and reminisce. We saw the AirBnB photos, but OH MY, it’s even more beautiful in person! A couple of our gals can’t do stairs, and there is a large bedroom on the ground floor with an accessible bath that was perfect for them. The rest of us loved the other rooms so much we didn’t care where we slept! We all spent hours at the huge dining room table playing cards and snacking. We went to Brunzies for dinner our first night. The food was wonderful, and our server was delightful. The next morning was spent at the shops on Philadelphia St. but we couldn’t wait to get back to our beautiful Inn for more gaming. On our last night we walked next door to Benjamin’s restaurant in a gorgeous Victorian home with an “old Hollywood” bar, gazebo, patio, and grape arbor. The food & service were fantastic, and the owner was SO gracious. We’re so in love with Divinity Inn we already rebooked for the Fall"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed the beautiful house, well furnished with many amenities. House was a beautiful Victorian with great architecture."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our group of friend's really enjoyed this Airbnb. It was a true home- spacious and full of character. Everything was very clean and easy to find.

Mary Anne was right there when we needed her and she is very gracious with her time and assistance. The beds are very comfortable and the home lends itself to peaceful rest and plenty of room to entertain. We were glad to be headed home, but sad to leave this beautiful Victorian home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Moire and Randy are absolutely gracious hosts. Moire is quick to respond to questions and her breakfasts are To Die For. The scones, the quiche, the oatmeal. I stayed 5 nights so got to taste all of it. Sitting at their kitchen table is also a delight; the bird feeders out the bay window and the stream just beyond make it idyllic, heaven on earth, and just what my soul needed. The Spring House is cozy and decorated very cute, with antique and rustic things. It gives it a very homey atmosphere. A comfy bed, too. The setting is bucolic. The beauty of the farm and the animals make is perfect for R&R. I hope I can come back some day. I wil try!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The spring house was a beautiful, quiet getaway. it was the perfect place to spend the night ahead of a long drive in the morning.

I would definitely stay here again in the future."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay here! The view was gorgeous; the animals were adorable, Moira and randy were absolutely delightful and so kind, breakfast was fantastic. I for sure want to return in the warmer months to explore local hikes and their creek. We came during late November and despite the cold outside the spring house was so toasty and cozy!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most beautiful, peaceful setting. The hosts were gracious, the house was beautifully furnished, the working farm and surrounding property was amazing.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had the best time here!!!! My lab and I stayed for a night while traveling on a road trip. We are from the city so to be on a farm with so much space and peace was beyond enchanting. We both love animals so much so it was amazing petting the horses and seeing the chickens, sheep, and donkies run around. The hosts were so friendly and communicative and made my stay feel so welcoming. There were nearby restaurants where I was able to order amazing Thai food. I brought a book to read for entertainment and did a lot of walking around during the day. There was a cute tree swing by the pond where I also unwinded while my dog went swimming. I cannot wait to come back"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful property! We loved the animals and the breakfast was wonderful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was so lovely staying at the Spring House! Moire and Randy were both so kind and welcoming. The house itself is adorable and very comfortable, and we loved being able to walk around the property, sit by the lake, and spend some time with the animals. Moire’s breakfast was delicious and her hospitality was unmatched. Thank you so much for hosting us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice, quiet weekend with family. The farm was peaceful and the scenery was beautiful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time. Was quiet & great views.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay - seeing so many farm animals and playing with the barn cats was such a treat. Breakfast was worth the trip alone, yum! thank you so much for your hospitality!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our stay! The decor was very charming, and the bed was firm and comfortable. There was no air conditioning, but the ceiling fans and insulation made for a comfortable stay.
It was peaceful and serene. Plenty of privacy. Just what we needed to relax and unwind. We enjoyed the farm animals. Though the barn was nearby, the animals were pretty quiet, enjoyable, and there was no problem with odors.
The hosts were extremely hospitable and friendly.
Breakfast was beyond what we had envisioned or expected. It was filling and the homemade scones were oh so good! Yum!!! My husband enjoyed them so much he wished he would’ve asked for a second one. Lol."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice, absolutely beautiful. You’re so close to everything yet still tucked away in a private setting. Everything is as described, you can watch the animals threw the windows or hangout with the barn cats. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire is the most amazing guest and cook! This is the real deal BnB, with a peaceful serene environment and delicious breakfast. I will definitely be returning!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were attending our daughters graduation from IUP. We wished we had found their accomodations when she was a freshman! Moire and her family were very welcoming. We enjoyed everything from breakfast, the farm animals and our bonfires by the barn. Very convenient to campus for the graduation events too!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy are the kindest hosts, they are a ton of fun too. The breakfast is superb! The area is absolutely lovely, and the place we stayed at is just SO cozy, beautiful, comfy. We felt at home from the start. The animals are a delight. The whole experience is unforgetable!! We truly had the best weekend. Thank you so much, Moire and Randy!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time. Marie and Randy made us feel right at home. Breakfast was charming and super delicious!! We will back for sure!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a remarkable stay at Moire and Randy's. Very friendly, we were able to share time and great discussions.
We recommend this lovely place, quiet, in the middle of the countryside. This particularly healthy environment has allowed us to fully recharge our batteries.
Thank you again for the beautiful meeting!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time there! Moire was the best host ever! Everything was exactly as described and exceeded our expectations! We will be booking this again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Moire and Randy were fantastic hosts. Over the top hospitable and friendly. The spring house was perfect and right next to the barn so you can see the animals out the window. Very sweet place.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was very serene and we felt right at home when we arrived. Moire was very warm and we had lengthy conversations over breakfast and dinner. Her niece Emmy gave us a farm tour and it was great. Our daughter enjoyed their dog and other farm animals. The food was delicious. Lamb was the best I have ever had. Moire made sure she made items my daughter liked. She ate as much as she would at home which has never happened in the past. Moire was very thoughtful in everything she did. We will go again when it’s warmer.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Moore & Randy's was the quintessence of lovely! The breakfasts somehow lived up to those amazing photos! I loved everything, but especially the view from the sitting area and the ginormous oak tree & swing. They (including animals) were so hospitable, welcoming us into their home, showing their barn & welcoming to walk about ""free range"". It was a privilege to stay--and now I will clearly be binge watching felting videos on YouTube! I see how it would be such an equally lovely venue for events."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t praise this beautiful location enough. We loved our stay at Upper Spring House, from the cosy interior to views from every window. We loved we could bring our senior dog along & he enjoyed the daily walks around the farm trails.
Each morning we walked across the field over to the farmhouse & loved to greet the many farm animals along our way. Moire, Randy & Emmie welcomed us into their home & Moire cooked us the most amazing breakfasts with a Scottish influence & was more than happy to cater to our dietary needs. Moire even provided baked us scones to take with us on our early start to attend the Groundhog Day event.
The farm was picturesque with the snow & can only imagine how wonderful it would be during the changing seasons. We would highly recommend this as a place to stay & hope to return again some day."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Morie and her husband Randy could not have been better hosts if they tried. While the accommodations were absolutely wonderful, the breakfasts (we actually stayed with them for four nights) each turned into a lengthy discussion of the benefits of 'farm to table', each other's backgrounds leading to the opening of the B+B, and possible additions to the B+B project such as a five-hole, par three golf venue. Lots of family history with both Moire and Randy centering around sheep, various sheep dogs that have been part of the family, and the originator of the farm, Morie's father - a true Scotsman missing only a grand picture of him in kilt with bagpipes. I know we disrupted Randy's daily schedule in the barn feeding and caring for the sheep, donkeys, horses, chickens, and cats but the no less than two hours each morning chatting with our hosts was priceless. If you would like an escape from the routine of hotel and minimal breakfast - look no further than this B+B - really!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't even know where to start. The moment we pulled in we felt at home. Greeted by the many animals and the coziest of little homes we could have asked for. She nailed the details of with personal touches, coffee/tea/hot coco assortments and a plate of homemade gingerbread cookies that were to die for. We dropped our stuff on the incredibly comfortable beds and headed outside to explore. We were instantly taken back at the surrounding beauty. Only 3 miles from the town we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere. The horses neighed, the sheep baaaa'd and the kitties meowed... not to mention the chickens. Honestly it was heaven on earth. The hosts were not only very helpful but very kind and accommodating. The homemade, farm fresh breakfast was out of this world and the conversation even better. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone who wants to slow down, have peaceful surroundings, and incredible food. The wifi also worked well for those who want to get some work done!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Could not have picked a better place to stay for the weekend! Will stay again and pray the weather is better so we can enjoy the farm more!! Moire's breakfasts were through the roof amazing - I'm sure i gained weight!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing stay we had! It’s definitely one for the books!
The place is beautiful and the hosts are so wonderful! They are so kind and they treated us like family. Moire cooked breakfast every morning and she told us so many good stories. We enjoyed every moment and we were sad when we left. However, we felt inspired by the work that they do. I wish we live close but we hope to come back someday soon! Thank you Moire and family!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Grace!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing hosts and beautiful location
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm is a very magical place and so is Moire. If you’re on the fence, take the plunge. It is as charming as it looks! And breakfast (the view!) Is a highlight and a great start to the day."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend! Moire has a gift of hospitality and she has made the airbnb so adorable. We had everything we needed and she cooks an amazing breakfast every morning that is restaurant quality. Such a peaceful and beautiful property. I would definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity to go back to Indiana, PA!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s an absolutely beautiful piece of land if you’re looking to get away from the city and Moire and Randy were wonderful hosts.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great, cozy spot."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful working farm; great amenities and little touches in the rooms; and warm and hospitable hosts. The Spring House is a perfect place for families - lots of room, and our little one loved being around the animals."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy are the absolute BEST hosts! This wonderful little property was a breath of fresh air.
My husband and I, along with my service dog, really could not have asked for more.
The spring house was wonderful! Quaint, nostalgic, hidden. Everything we needed for a 3 day, night stay was there. Moire cooked an amazing breakfast at the main house every morning, we never left hungry. These folks absolutely moved our souls, great stories, shared faith and plenty of laughs.
We feel blessed to have found this gem of a location.. like a stay in the French foothills only 5 minutes from downtown Indiana, PA."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Spring House is a beautiful little gem. Gorgeous property, wonderful people, cozy and country and rustic. The house is tidy, and the hosts were responsive. I reccomend!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed the visit very much in this farm setting. It was so relaxing to watch sun rise as well as sun set with horses , sheep and all the farm animals in the background. If you are looking for a rustic getaway this is the place to be for a quiet peaceful getaway! The hosts were very friendly and served awesome breakfast every morning."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"there are places, and then there are those places where time seems to have stopped to allow people to connect.
Moire and Randy’s farm is one of those places. their memory will remain forever.
thanks for warming our hearts.
Highly recommended!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful farm, gracious hosts… we loved our stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in the spring house was an enjoyable retreat. The bed was quite comfortable, and the sitting area in front of the double window provided a great spot for reading, prayer, and sipping coffee while watching the happy animals. A short trek to the top of the hill at the end of the property was worth the effort. I found a beautiful view of surrounding hilltops and farms, and I enjoyed the hawks soaring overhead and across the distant fields. One of my favorite parts of the stay was breakfast at the farmhouse each morning. The company of Moire and Emmie was a delight, and the food was delicious."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and quiet host was amazing
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem of a place! It lives up to all the wonderful reviews and then some. Moire and family are wonderful hosts. The location is truly beautiful, so peaceful. The Spring House is quite charming; well-appointed, comfortable, clean, spacious yet cozy. The space stayed cool with the ceiling fans and cross-breezes through windows. The bathroom was spotless and the composting toilet had no odor at all, would hardly notice it was not a regular toilet. Shower with great water pressure, beds very comfortable. We enjoyed the opportunity to wander the property and enjoy the beautiful scenery and animals. Moire welcomed us when we arrived and helped us to get oriented to our stay. Our family really enjoyed the tour of the barn and the opportunity to interact with the animals as well. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location, easy to find, great local restaurants nearby. We would definitely visit again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing farm house in some of the most beautiful country I’ve ever seen! I was served a delicious farm fresh breakfast and felt like part of the family. 10/10.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quite adorable place, Moire, Randy and Emma are very friendly, kind and welcoming! Enjoyed seeing all of the animals too!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, genuine people, very pleased from start to finish with our stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was even better than described. The food, the farm, the animals, everything was everything we wanted and more for a quiet weekend and will definitely be back soon."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough positive things about my stay here!
First the host is wonderful about communicating! The farm is very easy to get to. There is a flat ramp at the spring house and flat ground if you’re staying at the main house, for those having trouble or heavy suitcases.
The spring house was sparkling clean and was decorated absolutely adorable! There were plenty of towels and toiletries, in case you forgot anything. Huge table to make and food at.
The bed was so comfy and after a full day in the country air, I fell asleep in minutes each night!
I would like to add it’s a perfect place for a woman to travel alone. It’s very safe and off the beaten path. Host is on the same property if you need anything! In the spring house you will complete privacy but it’s nice to know someone is close.
I can’t describe how wonderful it was to have my coffee each morning, looking out at the scenery and the animals! So much to see and do if you don’t want to leave yet so close to town, you can have it all here.
I cherished every moment here and I consider the host, her family and the travelers I met there, friends. I will go back again and again. I’m so grateful to have found this slice of paradise!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay and breakfast! The country is beautiful and everything was clean and comfortable. It was lovely walking the country side and property. Make sure you bring proper foot wear in case of rain! The hosts are absolutely lovely!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time at Moire and Randy’s spring house while in Indiana PA for a wedding. The tour of the farm was awesome and we loved getting to use the fire pit and take in the views! We wish it wasn’t raining during our stay so we could have walked around more, but that is all the more reason to return. Moire and Randy are fantastic hosts and we enjoyed talking with them over the amazing breakfast they prepared for us! We will absolutely be back and look forward to our return trip!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Spring House B&B is a gem! The atmosphere is so conducive for relaxation! Moire and her family are so warm & welcoming! We did a girls weekend there and cannot wait to return! Moire did a felting class with us as well. It was a totally new experience for us and so fun! I would definitely recommend this as a weekend getaway for the girls or a nice romantic couples getaway! The animals are so friendly and soothing for the soul. Sitting around the pond and feeding the fish was just the self-care we needed! Thank you Moire again for everything!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really lovely stay at the farm. The hosts are exceptionally gracious in their hospitality. The grounds are beautiful, the farm is clean and well-maintained, and the spring house is quaint, cozy and relaxing. We sincerely appreciated being able to bring our pup, and Moire was more than willing to accommodate food requests in the morning."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent stay. Moire answered many questions quickly before and during our stay to help our families' planning, and went above and beyond to give us a welcoming farm experience. The house is spacious and clean, and the land is perfect for outdoor loving kids to roam. Breakfast was a real treat. They were generous, and the kids are happy. All in all, great!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely cozy little cottage with great views of the animals. Moire and her family were so warm and welcoming.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming and quaint Airbnb was the perfect wedding night getaway for our son and his bride! Moire is the most gracious of hosts and decorated this honeymoon suite with rose petals; candles; sparkling cider, cheese, and fruit tray; and even more little thoughtful additions to make their stay so special. This perfect little springhouse cottage nestled on a sheep farm in Indiana County is perfect for so many reasons. Thank you, dear Moire. You remain a blessing!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Burnhead Grazings. Moire and Randy are thoughtful and kind hosts with a great talent for hospitality and excellent farm-to-table breakfasts! Their unique little family farm with a small cabin fed by a natural spring is one of the main reasons I returned to the area and brought my family with me this time! We thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the sheep, chickens, horses, donkeys, and friendly cats. We were only there a short time, but we left feeling like family!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend staying at Moire’s beautiful place if you’re looking for relaxation and a peaceful environment! Moire and her family are wonderful hosts who graciously share their property, animals, stories, crafting classes, and delicious breakfasts with their guests. We stayed in the private spring house, which was cozy, warm, and inviting. It was beautifully decorated, very clean, and was stocked with everything we needed. We loved the barn and animal tour Emmy gave us (we highly recommend asking her for one when you stay!), and we also recommend taking a felting class with Moire if you’re able to! The location is extremely convenient since it’s only a 5-10 minute drive to all stores and restaurants, yet has the feel of being far from any town or city since the farm is so large. We really enjoyed our time there and hope to return!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing. There’s is no one place to start! This is a must stay! Hospitality is amazing, breakfast was amazing, the spring house was homely and simply amazing, Emmy (niece) was amazing, Moire and Randy were amazing! You will not regret anything about your stay!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Spring House is a great retreat. Moire and Randy are gracious and inviting. Breakfast is outstanding, a definite bonus. Clean and safe!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Spring House was perfect for our weekend getaway, and the breakfasts were delicious."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy were great hosts! The spring house was very cute, clean, and cozy. If you’re looking to explore the country a little bit and meet some great locals then I highly recommend staying here. Definitely not the normal “hotel experience” but an even better, more personal experience. I will say the floors in one part of the house are quite cold sometimes so bringing slippers is a good idea, and the toilet is not a normal toilet but a composting toilet (no flushing). That being said if you follow their directions for using the bathroom you will never smell anything.
Also, if you have the chance, definitely get breakfast with them at the main house and chat with their family. They are all extremely nice people and have some great stories. They can also tell you a lot about the history of the farm! Overall an awesome experience… would definitely stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was nothing short of perfect at the spring house. Breakfast was delicious every morning. Our dog loved being able to come with us on a trip too. We will definitely be back soon for more R&R!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I could not recommend the stay at Burnhead Grazings enough! Truly out of a picture with hosts that are above and beyond! The lush landscape just enhances this picturesque home and the decadent breakfast treats. You must get away to this sweet stay and make sure to capitalize on a conversation with your hosts!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Moire and Randy were true hosts. They are so gracious and generous to open their farm house and their barn to visitors. We felt completely at home. Kids loved seeing all the animals and meeting the cats. We loved the scrumptious breakfast. we will visit again for sure when the weather is better .
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I along with our newborn baby and dog stayed in the spring house at Burnhead Grazings for two weeks around Christmas 2021. Everything about our stay was absolutely wonderful. Moire and Randy were welcoming, gracious, and kind hosts who were dedicated to ensuring we had the best stay possible. I greatly enjoyed the conversations I had with both Moire and Randy throughout our stay and Moire’s daily breakfast was phenomenal. The spring house was cozy while not cramped, well stocked with necessities, and was quite comfortable - they even set-up a little Christmas tree for us. The wood-burning stove heated the whole space and added to the ambience (there were multiple electric heaters there as well, so you don’t have to use the wood stove for heat if you don’t want to). The composting toilet was easy to adapt to, and there was no odor with the use of the vent fan. The setting of the farm and being surrounded by all the animals provided a serene atmosphere for us to unplug and unwind, yet it is still very convenient to the town of Indiana. Everything about our stay was outstanding and I recommend Burnhead Grazings without hesitation - we very much hope to return to stay again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed for a one night stay in Indiana pa. I was visiting my daughter who plays basketball at Iup. The stay is a convenient 10 min drive from the university. Very private and beautiful converted spring house. The bed was comfortable and lots of pillows and blankets to choose. Roku tv to watch from bed was relaxing. Enjoyed the Keurig for tea and coffee. Homemade breakfast the next morning was the best breakfast I’ve ever had!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire was the perfect host. She paid attention to every detail including dietary needs and my desire to have a better reading lamp bedside in the spring house. The spring house was cozy, quiet and relaxing. Views of trees, rolling hills and animals were a treat. We even got a tour from her niece! Ask about her felting and lambskins-items are for sale! Highly recommended!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay on the little farm. Absolutely loved everything about it big Rollinghills, the sounds of chickens and sheep waking you up in the morning. It was absolutely perfect clean and peaceful. Would highly recommend this."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Magical place and setting! The breakfast was incredible and communication great.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My third stay at this loving retreat. The people and land just take you peacefully in. Walk the land and just breathe.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Moire and Randy were very friendly and made us feel like their personal guests instead of just visitors renting a room. Moire's breakfast was great, Randy was very helpful in welcoming us when we arrived, and the animals added a nice farm family touch."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying in the Spring House was more than I expected. I arrived hurried and stressed and left rested and at peace. It was a wonderful experience for me!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed the peaceful setting and wonderful breakfast. The Springhouse is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We hope to return again.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and her family offer a unique experience -- a sweet Spring House home across from a beautiful barn, a nearby creek, quiet and pastoral setting, big breakfasts, and time for personal reflection. It was a pleasure getting to know the horses, sheep, goats and chickens, too!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I wanted to get away from the city and go to a cute farm and we found that and so much more at Shepherdess Moire’s farm. The view from every direction was amazing. The sunsets were perfect and the sunrises were gorgeous. We even got to go stargazing at night and saw some shooting stars! Randy was so wonderful and let us help him feed the animals and we got to pick up fresh eggs from the chicken coop! The horses were beautiful and the other animals were so friendly. Don’t even get me started on the breakfast!! Moire’s breakfast was very very delicious and she makes the best scones I’ve ever had! We had a wonderful time and would love to go back in the winter!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend a stay at Burnhead Grazings. The host family takes hospitality to a high level and the property is so serene and relaxing. Their faith is very evident in how they treat their guests and live out their lives. We were blessed and renewed by our time on the farm. Oh! And VERY well fed with the farmhouse breakfasts, too!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay! We’re looking forward to coming back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My 3rd stay, 2 weeks this time to see friends and family after vaccination, and is top notch!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I look forward to my next opportunity to stay in Moire's Upper Room of the farm's Springhouse. I got more than a place to stay. I enjoyed a respite unlike any other. The experience was wonderful! Her home-cooked breakfasts were a treat, the guest space was comforting and private, and the farm's bucolic ambience was just perfect for a relaxing retreat."
2021-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Location is fantastic! The second bed is futon, fyi. The toilet is compost style (think outhouse, inhouse) BUT NO ODOR, so not bad in that respect. Overall we had an enjoyable stay. Moire is very sweet and hospitable!"
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Moire and Randy, for hosting us. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning during our 3-day stay. Weather in mid-April in east Pennsylvania was a bit dreary, but staring at the sheep up on the hill was very relaxing. We did get a brief tour of the barn, and I got to do some reading, which was nice."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved it. The guest house is so cozy, so clean and it’s right next to the barn. Thanks to Moore’s family kids had so much fun being surrounded by the farm animals. This place is perfect for relaxing. We haven’t met such a great hosts as Moire and her family. We hope to go back stay there again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Spring House was beautiful! Breakfast was amazing, Moire and her family were so sweet! We loved meeting all the animals and getting some fresh air! Would stay again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Air bnb should list this property both in places to stay and experiences. Moire and family are nothing short of amazing. The peace and quiet, paired with one of the best breakfasts I've ever had was an ultimate experience. The house was amazing, the hospitality and touches were amazing.. and the fellowship and love from one family to their guest was the ultimate experience. I will be back for sure and highly recommend this little slice of heaven tucked away."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The value in this place is awesome! The place is so clean and comforting. The little touches are amazing the woodstove is great! Moire and her family are awesome I’ll show you around the farm and explain anything you need to know. And the breakfast is that she cooks are out of this world, breakfast breakfast is that we had was on the first morning was pancakes with oranges and nuts and this most awesome orange sauce nice fruit and yogurt it was awesome. This morning what is the most awesome pumpkin oatmeal with apples and walnuts. And lame sausage, and fruit and yogurt., If you go out hungry it’s your own fault she gives you really good portions. I give this place a 10 it is way beyond anything I could’ve ever expected. Thank you so much Moire and Family! God Bless"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire’s place is lovely. Directions for getting there were real easy. We stayed in their spring house and it was very quaint and cozy. There were nice amenities for us to use. The compost toilet didn't bother us at all. There is an attached fan to it which was a great idea! We LOVED the animal barn next to us. Sweet Emmy who also lives there showed us goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, and we were able to see some baby sheep . The breakfast Moire made was exceptional each morning. We ate like a king and queen there. We also had nice conversations in the morning with Moire and her family. Lastly, we enjoyed our walk from the spring house to Moires house. It wasn’t to far from us but far enough we got a small walk in. I suggest trying this place out. We plan to go back again in the future. Thanks Moire and family!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely, cozy mid-winter stay with Moire, Emmie, Pumpkin, Snickers, and all the animals. Our girls loved meeting the baby lambs, and breakfast was delicious. We hope to visit again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely FANTASTIC. The location is everything you would want it to be, country setting but 3 minutes to Walmart!
The animals are fabulous and well cared for. Moire and Emmie are wonderful, and make you feel so welcomed. I’ve always thought sharing breakfast in a strangers home might be a bit strange, but I promise- you won’t regret eating some of Moires fabulous food and engaging in conversation. She has this way about her that makes a person feel accepted and comfortable from the minute you meet her!
We can’t wait to go back!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I had a lovely stay at Burnhead Grazing. The Upper Room of the Spring House is so cozy, the hosts are warm and inviting, Moire’s breakfasts are outstanding and the farm is so peaceful. My daughter absolutely loved meeting the animals on the farm tour. A perfect winter getaway."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a winter weekend here and it was perfect!The space is large and has multiple areas to sit and relax, if you never wanted to leave the farm you wouldn’t have to! We enjoyed waking up to the animals outside the window, the location is 5 min from town, and Moire’s homemade breakfast is better than anything you could get at a restaurant! We look forward to returning soon."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire's place provided just the cozy stay we were hoping for! Even though we are not used to farm life, they made everything so welcoming; her niece gave us a tour of the farm and introduced us to all the kind animals. They helped us clean the snow off our car and from around it with their tractor, and even provided the tools to do so. The wood-burning stove worked perfectly and kept us warm. And, while we were curious what a composting toilet was, as we never experienced it, it actually wasn't so different from what we are used to (and we found it didn't smell at all). Also, Moire was very responses to our calls and questions. Thank you so much!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't begin to describe how wonderful our stay was at Moire's home. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that the history behind Burnhead Grazing is so touching and I am happy to be able to support a family continue their legacy of farming and in all their new and wonderful endeavors! Moire herself was such a joy and the location was simply picture perfect. If you want an escape to a farm surrounded by plentiful animals and a wonderful family and a charming little home, book this stay before it is booked up! We will absolutely be returning!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! This home has incredible charm and Moire's homemade breakfast every morning was a game changer! Loved it!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had been in a rough place for the last few weeks and desperately needed some break from work, and am more than happy that I got to stay in Moire’s place for a quick weekend getaway. Moire, Randy, and Emmy are so kind and welcoming that they made me feel like I had already known them before. Listening to Moire’s wonderful stories (which will resonate in me for a long time), walking in the wood with morning sunlight, seeing the farm animals, and having one of the best breakfasts in my life (all the reviews about her breakfast are not exaggerating - she really IS an awesome cook!) made our 4hr-drive worth it. We wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you, Moire, for showing hospitality and being accommodating to the point where you did grocery shopping to find tofu and tried tofu stir-fry for the first time in your life so our vegan friend also had breakfast. It is greatly appreciated!
P.s. The room decor is fantastic & the beds are very comfortable!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Host and her super helper Emmy are the best. My family had a great time from eating home made farm style breakfast and touring of the farm.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was nice gate away in this tough year . We liked to stay with so many sheeps , goats , horses and donkeys . Highlight was farm tour and horse /pony ride for our son . Thanks again !!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Had a blessed day.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and her family really are the perfect hosts. This farm is a lovely place to relax or explore, whether you want to hang out and read, tour the barn with its friendly animals, or enjoy some conversation with the family at the delicious and very filling breakfast. It’s surprisingly close to town but feels very out-of-the-way. Overall a very warm and cozy experience with just a hint of adventure. Highly recommended! Ask about felting classes :)"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Spring House is very clean and cozy, nicely decorated as well. It is right next to the barn with a variety of animals, also right next to the acres of pastures for sheep and horses. the animals are very friendly, our toddler was able to pet and interact with them.
Moire is the most wonderful host. - super responsive and considerate. the breakfast was also very nice."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay on a family farm. Space was perfect. Breakfast was delicious. They take great care of their animals - and their guests!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Burnhead Grazings was more than we could have thought or imagined! Our missionary team stayed with Moire and she expressed incredible Biblical hospitality is unlike any other. This faithful woman is gifted beyond measure and treated us like family. Thank you, dear Moire, for absolutely everything - you are such a blessing!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! The house is great and roomy, the animals were so fun to pet and watch right next to the Spring House, and Moire was an amazing host who can cook an incredible breakfast!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Burnhead Grazing is a beautiful retreat out in the country that still is close to everything in Indiana. The space is so special and quaint! Moire has made the Springhouse absolutely stunning and perfect for any stay! If you ever get the chance to stay here, please do it!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the view and cozy stay. Would come back again! Moore is an excellent host.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying in the spring house and we already are planning for our next trip! It was somehow even better than the first time with new little touches in the house. We enjoyed fresh snow, great food (Moire's homemade breakfasts are out of this world!), and great company!! Highly recommend staying here!!!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don't miss out on breakfast! Moire is an excellent host and even offered up extra clothes and shoes for us when our luggage was lost. Her reviews of local stores/restaurants was spot on. We enjoyed being just outside of town on her lovely property.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Morie’s Spring House is absolutely beautiful! We would highly recommend staying with her, wonderful breakfast and accommodations. She was warm and friendly!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire is a king and generous soul and truly wants to share the best of her sheep farm with her guests. The spring house is private, beautifully decorated and had enough amenities that with a little planning I didn't have to leave the house during my weekend retreat. Breakfast was wonderful and Moire even researched my special dietary requirements. The bed and bedding are super comfy and the animals are close and fun to interact with. Truly, though, experiencing Moire's kindness and gentle spirit is best part of this airbnb experience!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really appreciated the cozy room and beautiful surroundings! Thank you so much!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here a few times over the last year. Host is great and the house is even better. Best Airbnb in Indiana by far!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, loved hearing the sheep talking to each other while laying in bed!😁🐏🐑 enjoyed spending time scratching the donkey's ears and talking to the 2 horses.🐴🐎 the breakfasts were top notch and our host nailed the dinner recommendations! Some time swinging by the pond was a delightful reboot! We even were able to watch fireworks from the bed! 🎆 Moire and Randy were wonderful hosts!!! Hope to return some day!"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy check-in and very accommodating... Cabin was well decorated and cozy... We thoroughly enjoyed our stay...
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful. An amazing little cottage right in the middle of a beautiful farm, you can wake up with your coffee on the porch and sheep, donkeys, and horses grazing just a field away. Breakfast was great each morning, and Moire was a considerate and personable host. If you want a unique get away and touch of real farm life, you can't do better."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend! Thank you Randy and Moire for an excellent time. The Spring House was very clean and a great place to stay.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a welcoming place this is! The setting is beautiful with sheep, horses, and donkeys grazing on a lush, green hill right outside the Spring House. There is no waking up to the clamor of city life here, just the gentle conversation among the ewes. Moire served the most scrumptious breakfast- imagine eating fresh scones and homemade jelly, yogurt topped with sweet berries, and then followed up with eggs and sausage sourced from the farm itself. The accommodations are perfectly planned to reflect the history and charm of the setting with comfortable beds and many interesting details to take in. This is a most memorable airbnb choice and Moire’s hospitality is genuine and generous."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don't hesitate to stay at this wonderful place. We stayed in the spring house. It is quaintly decorated and will meet all your needs. Hearing the sheep was music to our ears. The owners provide a wonderful breakfast. We also enjoyed learing about the history of this property. So glad we chose this accomnodation to attend our son's graduation from IUP.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Moire was a fantastic host!!! Everything was perfect!! Love the farm and the animals!! Breakfast was spectacular! Great time!! Thanks Moire!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very welcoming a wonderful place to stay.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay in a historic (over 100 years old) yet modernly furnished small building over top of a natural spring. It was wonderful to listen to the sounds of the farm and relax. We look forward to returning for the full experience (we were both sick. :( ). The location is ideal for anything in downtown Indiana. Great breakfast and conversation with the host. Well recommended!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great people, great food, excellent communication, great farm tour, the world's cutest little lambs, everything about this place is GREAT!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoy all the benefits and comforts a beautifully decorated, private location nestled on a scenic farm where you can enjoy peaceful moments to stop and enjoy life!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot stop thinking about our stay and just how spectacular it was! We are so lucky to have found Burnhead Grazings it was a privilege to spend the weekend with Moire, Randy, and Emmy! We shared lots of great conversation, amazing food, and laughs as we had the full farm experience! Cannot wait to come back in the spring! Wishing we could give more than 5 stars!!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Moire and Randy were amazing hosts! It was my birthday and Moire left a little cake with a candle in the Spring House for me! He food was delicious and she gave great recommendations for local places to eat. We had a great time in the barn with the animals while Moire and Randy tended to the chores...you do not want to miss the miniature donkeys! Moire definitely has a gift for decorating and everything was spotless and beautiful! We can’t wait to go back!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will find this place to be much more than expected. I have stayed in Air BnB's internationally and Moire's place was absolutely the best. Not only are the accommodations beautiful, clean and quaint, Moire goes out of her way with exceptional hospitality. She welcomed us to learn about her lambs, explained the history of her farm, taught us to felt, offered us some of her homemade food, and was very kind. If you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle and relax in a slow paced, farm environment, this is the place for you."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire’s amazing hospitality makes me want to come back nearly every weekend. The little house feels like home, and the original breakfast adds a special touch."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful farm land, and a wonderful cottage! We had a great weekend stay, and Moire was wonderful"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. The guest home was clean and there's a cozy wood fireplace next to the bed. It's quiet and is disconnected from technology. There's no TV and no Wifi, but that's part of why we loved it so much. We just sat next to the cozy fire and just visited with each other. In the morning, we would visit the farm house and Moire served us such a delicious breakfast and we got to eat it and watch the stream nearby. Moire and her husband are such welcoming people and it felt like we were home visiting family for the Holidays. The driveway is a little steep and is a little muddy. Our Subaru made it fine, but it's something to note if you're planning on booking the summer home. This trip was one of our favorite AirBnB experiences. Highly recommended if you wanna nice cozy place to unwind and get away from technology."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was great, 5 stars all around the board. Will definitely be staying here again!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This year for Thanksgiving, instead of my daughter or I driving the 12 hours to be together, we thought, ""Why don't you Just Meet Me In The Middle"" and we decided The Burnhead Grazing Farm Spring House Retreat sounded perfect for us.
Moire and husband Randy were super hosts. They welcomed us into their home and treated us like family. They even included us in their family's Thanksgiving dinner.
The stunning property, including a meandering stream and abundant birdwatching, were in full view through Moire's kitchen window, all while enjoying her yummy homemade breakfast only added to the charm, and the pleasant walk over to the barn to visit the farm animals was a bonus.
From the moment I arrived it felt like I was at home and I look forward visiting again."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great find. The cabin was adorable and so rustic. Breakfast like a 5-star hotel.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We could not have asked for kinder people to be our host. We enjoyed becoming wonderful friends. Everything was charming and peaceful. Breakfast was amazing. We will be back.
2018-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Moire was very helpful. Breakfast is very nice. Location is adjucent to the Barn and scenic.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great place!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, charming, and perfect weekend getaway. Staying directly on the farm, with the animals in sight was very unique and special. Makes for a perfect retreat from city life. And both Hosts are warm and welcoming. Can’t wait to go back...."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Burnhead Grazings. Being so close to the animals was a treat and the warm hospitality that Moire and her family showed us was the icing on the cake. This stay really took us back to the farm B&Bs we stayed at in Ireland.
The amenities in the B&B were really awesome and included a brand new remodeled bathroom with shower.
We even enjoyed the a cooling drink in the basement spring room. Looking forward to returning soon."
2018-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Moire and her husband Randy were wonderful hosts. She was very quick to respond and easy to work with as our schedule was last minute crazy. They are gracious and hospitable without being invasive (if you’re an introvert like me). The breakfast provided each morning was delicious and I loved that so much of it was produced from their farm. The rooms were very clean and comfortable though a little warm in the day with the unexpected heat and humidity. They are truly blessed and are a blessing.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"You must book a stay here, it is so picturesque, my camera & I will surely be back~"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow we had a great time here, so much better than any hotel, food was great, beds were comfy, definitely recommend!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot just outside of the Indiana Borrough (a few miles only!) with wonderful hosts. I teach in the Art Department at IUP and we put a visiting artist here for a week-long stay. The farm setting gave her a taste of the charm our region has to offer, as well as a delicious home cooked breakfast and a place to be away from the campus and relax a bit during her down time. My folks also stayed here for 3 days last fall and it worked out equally well for them. Moire and her husband Randy are generous and kind. I've made new friends!"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the Spring House and had such a wonderful time. The Spring House had the hospitality and warmth of a traditional b&b, but the house provides lots of privacy and room to explore. The food was incredible, the location was peaceful and the room was really comfortable. Moire and her husband Randy were such warm and generous hosts, they let us explore their sprawling land and they let us help feed the animals . We had such a great time and we can't wait to go back!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire is such a wonderful host! We had everything we could ask for a weekend away from home. The rustic cabin is the perfect getaway and still close to what we needed in Indiana. Friendly animals and beautiful scenery, we can’t wait to come back!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Found this to be a perfect country retreat, not far from town. It's a private house set on beautiful meandering property, well secluded even from the main farm house. Now after foliage time, property still lovely to look at ;grass fields alongside creek and woods for walking. Farm animals graze and birds pass overhead. Very relaxing. Roomy with attractive interior and conveniences such as mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The delicious breakfast at the main house was created using farm fresh ingredients with perfection by the most friendly and kind host. It is quiet. Restful. Comfortable. Historical. Great place to unwind."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic, and romantic spot. Moire is an incredible host! Was my birthday weekend and she arranged for a delicious cake and bottle of wine in an adorable little barn nook under the cabin. She was super helpful with any issues and with local advice. Made a delicious farm fresh breakfast too.
The farm is gorgeous, with adorable animals. The cabin has a modern rustic decor and was such a romantic place to spend my birthday weekend. Thanks Moire and Randy."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy's Spring House is delightful, and so are they. They were warm and inviting and told many good stories. Beautiful view, comfy bed, and the homemade breakfasts were delicious, too!"

It's close to everything, which was nice as we were visiting a friend from the college.
The bed was also very comfortable.
There was some cleanliness issues, though Im sure the host will address those by the time this review is public.
Everything else was well worth it, and the size was perfect for our family to stay in while visiting friends. Overall, I would recomend this place for that purpose. Again, Alyssa was super friendly, helpful, and proactive in giving clear direction and instructions!"

apartment. We loved it. We were in town to visit the Jimmy Stewart attractions. It was a quick drive or walk to everywhere we needed to be.
Indiana was our second stop following the Solar Eclipse events in Erie. We arrived with a pile of dirty clothes and it was a joy to encounter Alyssa's large capacity washer and dryer! Thank you for a great stay."

The main bedroom had a huge king size bed and it was very comfy!! They have a TV in the bedroom which is great!! Also tv in living room. They installed the bedroom window AC unit for us and it worked very well. There is a busy road next to the bedroom so you constantly hear cars driving by, but that didnt bother us at all. We enjoyed this stay very much and will most likely be back!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved the airbnb for my daughter and her boyfriend, who was visiting from Georgia. Since my daughter is from the area, it was nice for her to be close to town, etc. The house was clean, and the second bedroom worked out for my other daughter to stay one night and spend time with her sister. The space itself was kept nice and worth the money spent."

When I walked in, I was simply blown away by how clean the apartment was and how updated and up to date the apartment was. It even smelled pretty. The place was spotless. It really did feel like home. The bed I slept in was new or newer and very clean and very comfortable. The hosts were/are very responsive and very quick at answering my questions before I arrived and even after I was there. I highly recommend this location and have recommended it to my large family that visits regularly. For sure, this will be the first place I book when traveling again to Indiana PA. I am one very happy camper. Seriously folks this was such a wonderful find. Thank you Hosts, I traveled under less than idea circumstances as my Mother is ill. This experience made the trip a pleasure. Peace."

The place is clean, stocked, owners are friendly, etc, etc, etc. There aren't any negatives and we will absolutely be staying again if it's available. Don't hesitate to book if you're going to be in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy to find. Home was clean and perfect for our use - overnight stay for a local conference. We didn’t use the kitchen at all so I’m not sure about how stocked it was. Beds were comfortable. A/C units were a little loud in each room but we were grateful for them during a warm bout in late October. Great restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay again."

I arrived at night. Entrance to the rooms is in the rear of the building which had no lighting. I had to use my phone flashlight in order to see the door lock. I would recommend the porch be cleaned up a bit - maybe painted and include a porch with a motion light."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean. Nice accommodations.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"""Discover your perfect retreat in downtown Indiana, PA!"" The description and photos on Airbnb of the home are to the letter but still give no justice to actually experiencing the space.
I accidently booked this location thinking it was minutes away from my cousin's wedding. It was an hour and a half away. Dazed, happy, joyous, sad, grief stricken, and tired were the succession of emotions I exprienced before arriving at Alyssa's Place. Happy accident because I struck gold. It was the perfect respite me and my family needed after a bitter sweet journey to a wedding and saying final farewells to another cousin who was taking his last breaths.
Alyssa and Tyler were very responsive, offered to go above and beyond, friendly, accommodating, gave helpful instructions, and were flexible on my check- in time. The space was absolutely gorgeous and beds slept well. The location had beautiful surroundings, it was very peaceful, and private. This is a must visit retreat location."

The kitchen was very nice. The was enough room for all of us and worked much better than a hotel room."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had a good stay overall. The location & amenities available were solid. The apartment in general was good. Unit is remodeled [sinks, appliances, etc.], just a note that unit is not completely renovated. I had no problem buying groceries and storing them. PLENTY of space and storage in my opinion. It was just me but unit is furnished well overall; just missing a Kleenex box and a bulb for the lamp. Roomy enough for 3, just keep in mind the one full bathroom.
It was HOT the two days I was there, so the room air conditioners were challenged keeping the areas cool. That plus other tenants may be the causes for fragrances that emanated a couple times during the day.
All in all, the stay was ideal for me. I appreciated their hospitality and ease with things all in all while there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

Only suggestion to improve the property is to enlarge the shower. It was a pretty tight space.
Beyond that, great stay!! Definitely worth the value."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at an affordable price. Alyssa’s place was very clean and spacious. Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna and her family are wonderful hosts. The cabin is always clean and spotless for our arrival.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the Curry Run Cabin. It was a pleasant stop on our trip.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is well-appointed, cozy and super clean. Host communication was timely and responsive. Based on the description and photos I was expecting a much more secluded location surrounded by nature. The cabin is private, and has a very nice garden, but it is located right off the highway behind a propane company (visible from the front porch, across the manmade pond) and next door to another large house. Outside of this slight misrepresentation, I found the cabin as described, and had a very nice stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Curry cabin is a wonderful place to stay. The bed was very comfortable. The place was very clean. I enjoyed the fresh flowers on the porch The host was very responsive when I had questions. We are hopeful that we can make a return trip to the cabin one day.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great cabin, the pond was amazing. My daughter caught fish and had a ball. We couldn't book a hotel for her graduation so this cabin was available and so much better than a hotel room. I already have friends renting it this summer on my recommendation! Thank You!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Currey Run Cabin is my favorite Airbnb!! This was my 3rd time to stay there and won't be my last.

Thanks for everything !!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Donna was very responsive from the initial email to book. The place was perfect for three outdoor teenagers. The cabin was the perfect size with a sitting porch to enjoy my morning tea and book. Getting places was easy and convenient even though the cabin was not in town (exactly why we booked it). Overall, our family experience was wonderful!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Donna was really great to work with. The cabin was very nice. The huge shower was great and the fireplace was so cozy. Loved the huge porch with nice seating area. Nice size kitchen to cook in with the needed Necessities. And complimentary K Cup Coffee. The bed in the main room does need replaced, it shakes real bad. And the mattress is hard to get into but it’s real soft. Had a nice time here. Thank you"

At one point I asked about tin foil, as I was unable to find any for cooking on the fire. The host apologized and said they had been meaning to buy some. I assured them it was no problem and that we'd do without. I kid you not, within 3 minutes, the host's husband was handing me some from his pickup truck. Just a classy operation that I'd highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time at this wonderful cabin! Best place for a quick recharge.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Donna was very responsive and helpful for anything I needed. The house itself was beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend staying here.

2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice area , pretty clean, found cigarette bud under bed when moved it cuz dropped phone. Bed made bunch of noise when slightest movement is made , place is cozy and comfy couch. Donna is great at communicating and fast responses , only 3 stars becuase it could of been cleaner and the bed feeling like it is going to fall apart , and only being 1 tv in the master room no where else , if it was $130 then id say good deal but after the fees it was 200ish each night about and not rly worth that in my opinion"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A very clean and cozy place to stay. We wished we had more time for a longer visit. It is a great place to stay to kind of get away from it all. Very pleasant.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in the area for a relatives funeral. It was very nice to have a nice quiet place to rest. It was very restful and peaceful there
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Nice little place for a quick getaway.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Donna is a courteous host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For a comfortable, peaceful getaway. A little noise from the road, but not close enough to be disturbing. Lovely to sit outside and relax."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect place for a quiet getaway withmy friends. The cabin was cozy and the grounds were beautiful. Fall was the perfect time to go!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was a rainy weekend.. but it didn't bother us we had a great time myself my two girls and my niece a great girls weekend in October thank you so much Donna
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's place was a nice base for exploring the area. As she mentions in the listing, you can definitely hear road noise but the lake is peaceful and the path behind the house is nice. The full kitchen is really handy and the fireplace is cozy. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a blast. The pond next to the place is home to a beautiful flock of around a dozen ducklings. The place was private and clean. The indoor fireplace kept us very cozy. I would love to visit again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We always have such a nice relaxing weekend when we stay at Donna's cabin. It is the most peaceful, pretty place. This is definitely our go to when we want to just get away for a few days."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are return visitors and always will be, as long as they're willing to have us! This was our honeymoon stay, and it was gorgeous! The muscovy duck that frequents the pond has 10 beautiful babies :)
In cleaning up and making the beds, I had a small mishap and knocked over a lamp, breaking the shade. I panicked, but I wasn't met with anger or cruelty from our host. We love this place and the people who own it are top notch!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was fantastic. From the hand drawn map of the walking trail, the chainsaw carvings, the beautiful family of ducks (mamma and 10!!! babies), the tree house, and the pond next to the fire pit, it was perfect. Just out of the way enough to be private but also you could jump in your car and get groceries or have a night out if you so choose. I will cherish these memories for a long time, worth every penny."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and peaceful scenery
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was what we expected and we enjoyed being in a cabin in the woods which was a nice break from the desert where we live. Donna is very friendly and accommodating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying at Curry Run. Loved it more than the first time. Fish were very active, caught blue hill, perch, and a total of 13 large mouth bass over the weekend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had another very relaxing stay at Curry Run Cabin. Peaceful, private, great location. Host is very responsive. Have stayed there several times over the last few years and we have already reserved the cabin for two stays in 2024. Very highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin. Beautiful spacious bathroom. In fact the whole cabin was spacious and well kept. Many Amenities. Very peaceful days. Our weather happened to be perfect. The pond and Lily Pads were a nice attraction. Both fishing and watching the cute ducks and a heron. All and all it was a relaxing fun time.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Curry Run Cabin is so peaceful and beautiful. The cabin itself was very clean and had plenty of room to move around. The kitchen was big and inviting and the bathroom was probably the nicest I’ve had on any vacation, especially for a cabin! There wet trails to walk and the pond was great. There was even a family of ducks that were on the pond the whole weekend. My favorite thing was watching my 4 and 5 year old play around the pond while my wife and I just relaxed on the porch. The owner was very responsive and check in/out was a breeze. I found nothing wrong with this place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay to get away from the big cities. Make sure to look for the Diesel sign, as the cabin is hidden from the road."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our third time staying at Donna’s cabin. The kids loved using the kayaks and exploring the trails. Very peaceful setting but close to civilization. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.

Would definitely come back here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible place. I'm working in the area and this was right where I wanted to be. There were plenty of kayaks and paddles available. Enough K-cups for a thousand winters -- and some delicious packs of fruit gummies. Thank you!
Oh -- and what an amazing shower! I really couldn't have asked for anything more. I'm just hoping I'll still be able to do some work in the fall/winter so I can try out the fireplace as well.
I will absolutely be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at this cabin/cottage. Donna is excellent and responsive host. If you like the woods and a pond this is a great place to enjoy both. We came in town for a wedding and this was a great option over a hotel. Thankful for the A/C in the humid/wet June we are experiencing. Our young kids had a great time as well. The swing was good as well as watching the ducks meander around the pond. The kayaks were nice as well. I’m glad we found this place and hope to return in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend staying at the Curry Run Cabin- my family and I had an amazing time there. It is the perfect little retreat for anyone looking to slow down and enjoy nature at its finest. My daughter loved sunbathing from the kayak, both my sons appreciated the treehouse, and I had lots of fun fishing and just observing all the wildlife. Donna was a wonderful host- she was very easy to communicate with and was very friendly. The place is kept very clean and tidy and it is very well stocked. The place as well as the host is very welcoming and inviting."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cute and charming little cabin. Great first experience using Airbnb. Absolutely Will recommend Curry Run to friends and family. Hoping to visit again some day.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Curry Run Cabin for a quiet, peaceful and relaxing oasis in nature; My family has stayed here multiple times. It's modern amenities among nature. We truly enjoy every second of our stay and always plan our next visit before leaving. * This stay, we got to watch the ducklings play in the pond. **Delicious s'mores and roasted hot dogs at the campfire under the stars sitting on the chairs is a favorite of ours. ***Best place to stay for anyone looking to chill out in nature from the hustle bustle of life"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin by a wonderful pond. Very much enjoyed the wildlife and relaxation. Clean. All the comforts of home. Highly recommend. Would surely stay again some time. Bring your fishing rods ;)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying was great, definitely will do again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a restful time in the cabin as we attended our granddaughters graduation this past week end. So enjoyed the porch and pond view with our coffee in the morning. Thanks for everything Donna.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing location. Always very clean. Friendly, responsive host. Already have another stay booked."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very charming, cozy, and peaceful cabin. Very clean and cozy. I only wish I could have stayed longer than 1 night. I would definitely recommend staying at Donna's cabin to anyone looking for nice, relaxing getaway."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the third time that my wife and I stayed in Curry Run Cabin. We love it so much. The cabin is so very comfy and cozy, very private, quiet and surrounded by nature. The downtown area of Indiana is just about 10 minutes away and it has several quaint shops, good restaurants, and at least two major supermarkets. There are many options for outdoor activities in the area. My wife and I especially like walking around Blue Spruce state park. Donna is a warm and gracious host who communicates very well. We will be back again I am sure."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,curry run cabin is always a nice peaceful place to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very lovely place to stay, the weather wasn't great for my trip, but that's kind of okay (and obviously not Donna's fault lol). It was nice to sit on the porch and listen to the rain platter on the pond. Lots of birds. Even saw a heron once! Birds are cool."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked the Curry Run Cabin as a stopover while making our way back to NY from OH. We had a later than expected start which resulted in us reaching Donna’s place pretty late but she was very flexible, friendly, and responsive. There was a “Welcome Whitney” note that brought a huge smile to my face. The space is bigger than expected with a spacious kitchen and spacious bathroom. There’s is a fireplace that makes the place feel nice and cozy, especially early in the morning when my husband got up to fish. Since we got in late, we made the most of the morning by sipping coffee by the fire while reading. My husband went to the pond to practice his fishing before the long drive back. It was a nice little respite for us."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,another great weekend stay at curry run cabin. I cannot wait to get back there. the pond is wonderful and the wooded trails are beautiful.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the traffic noise at night (at no fault of the host, just noisy trucks using their engine brakes), the cabin suited our needs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really peaceful location with a nice hike close by. Also food delivery available. Love the lake and being close to nature.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful time at curry run cabin! We love the outdoors and you can’t be anymore closer to nature than being in the cabin. My husband loved fishing in the pond and Tim was so nice and gave him tips and even a lure to catch the most fish! We felt right at home. Plenty of things to do and see and would love to come back! Thanks to our amazing hosts!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend here. Great location and the pond has very healthy bluegill, bass, and yellow perch. The wildlife around the pond is awesome too. The cabin is very comfortable and we had an excellent stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a weekend while attending an event at the Kovalchick Center at IUP. The cabin was very cute and cozy and felt private, while also not feeling isolated. It was easy to get to and it was an easy drive from there into Indiana to access restaurants, stores, and the Kovalchick center.
The hosts were very kind and communicated well. We had trouble turning on the gas fireplace and Donna and her husband went over right away and got it working.
Overall, we enjoyed the cabin very much! It was warm and cozy, especially sitting in the living room with the fireplace on. It was great to come back to and relax in the evenings after spending all day at the event. We would stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was very private and peaceful and perfect for what we needed for the night. Donna was quick to reply and very helpful and responsive
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of four really enjoyed our restful weekend at the cottage. Donna went out of her way to set out a box of toys for our young children. We enjoyed the trail to the tree house and a morning of caning in the small pond out front. The fireplace was cozy and the couch was very comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place if your looking for something quiet and nestled back in the wooded area. Would definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The crackling fireplace was the best! Thanks for everything, Donna."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for two nights and had a great time! Really enjoyed our time at Donna’s place. It’s a very convenient location to downtown Indiana for restaurants and the cabin itself is very cozy. We loved the fireplace and hope to come back when the weather is nicer for relaxing on the front porch and fishing in the pond! The only thing we didn’t love was that there was no TV in the living room. We weren’t planning to leave the cabin much during our stay and ended up just going to purchase one to watch. Overall lovely little place and would like to go back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay we cozy and convenient! The cabin was spotless and the jacuzzi tub was a nice surprise! We would recommend highly!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely in every way
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Me and my family had a wonderful time staying at the cabin during New Years weekend! The cabin itself was perfect and described perfectly in the listing. very roomy and had everything we needed to have a small little New Years party with a 6 and 8 year old. Location was right next to a lovely college town tha contained any possible store you could need and had a lovely campus to explore. Donna was very responsive and made sure our stay had no issues.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was open and cozy. Fireplace is obviously a staple. The bathroom was my favorite, very spacious and cozy feel. We were so happy that it was decorated for Christmas and it completed the feel, atmosphere, and warmth we envisioned."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed this very well-stocked clean cottage by the lake. We spent the weekend in December. The Christmas tree and fireplace were a cozy special touch for a getaway as husband and wife. We love the movie It's a Wonderful Life so enjoyed the Christmas-lit town of Indiana and night and the Jimmy Stewart museum during the day. We would come back again to this little cottage any time of the year.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! This cabin is so cute and cozy! Very clean, fully stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, and felt like home.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Donna and Jan for another great stay, the great communication, and the awesome hospitality. We will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked away from the city, but not too far away, is this quaint little cabin that will remind you of the times you spent growing up. A simpler time. Things seldom seen now are like warm hug of nostalgia here. A couch, large enough to accommodate everyone, no TV but a warm snuggly fireplace to gather round and actually talk. Board games rather than computer/phone screens. A table to sit and write or color in a book.
A wonderful place to recharge, reconnect, rediscover, or realign. No matter your path this is truly the place to do it.
Easy access to the road, we heard zero noise from the highway and I’m a very light sleeper. A small man made lake is right in front of the cabin, complete with a beautiful array of domestic ducks, wild birds, and the occasional jumping fish. Lovely farms, country roads, and state Forests 🌳 near by. Less than an hours drive to Pittsburgh, close to local farm fresh eggs, and right up the street from the very good Portia’s Donuts, where they make an EXCELLENT Ube bubble tea. As a chef, I definitely recommend them!
I also thought the service and pancakes were good at Crouse’s."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, cute & comfortable! Had everything we needed and more."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice little spot for a quick getaway. Definitely recommend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Curry Run Cabin is just the getaway we needed for a disconnected weekend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful rustic cabin to get away and reconnect with family. Comfy beds, comfy couch, fully stocked everything. The guys loved the fishing and the kayaking. The trail to the treehouse was beautiful as was the entire cabin overlooking the pond reflecting the gorgeous colors of the fall leaves. We will definitely be back to make more memories ♥"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved every moment of our stay at the cabin. It felt like home <3
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Loved watching the wildlife at the pond and taking walks in the woods. The house is well stocked with supplies needed to cook your own meals. The hosts are very responsive to any concerns. Centrally located to all the area attractions.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful peaceful space. perfect for an escape from reality.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and relaxing.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Curry Run! It met our needs well and the fishing was the BEST part..even our young children loved fishing! Also enjoyed hiking to the treehouse, kayaking on the pond and seeing deer!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint cabin. Quiet relaxing place to stay. Easy check-in. Will stay here every time we visit Indiana, Pa"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little cabin just close enough to get away for a night or a week!! Will be back for sure!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Donna was a great host and very accommodating. I hope to visit next year.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is a very cozy, comfortable, and quiet get away in Pennsylvania:) we really enjoyed our stay:)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were very accommodating and helpful for our stay. The cottage was small and quaint but perfect for our family of four. The pond was lovely for the view and for kayaking, and the trails were nice for walking. The only “downside” was the traffic noise from the highway, but we were far enough away to even tune that out, especially when inside! All in all a great experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time visiting even better than the 1st time visiting; My teenagers and husband truly enjoy being outdoors at the cabin. There is so much to do. My family enjoys grilling out and cooking over the camp fire. I enjoy working on the covered porch using the Wifi, breathing fresh air, and watching my family have fun together. It's so refreshing to wake up rested after a good night's sleep on the comfortable beds and cool cabin. The remodeled bathroom is like a spa. Curry Run Cabin is peaceful, refreshing, and perfect get-a-way. Highly recommend staying at Curry Run Cabin... I can't wait to visit again. I hope your stay is even better than my stay. Best wishes!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at this cabin. This time we brought the kids. They loved the pond and cooking over the fire. The cabin was comfortable and cool. We hope to be back again soon.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay. Very clean and quiet. Communication was spot on. Would recommend this stay
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great pond location, hidden away, ready for a country cabin rest. Great!"
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Donna is a great host and communicator.
The cabin is definitely rustic and lacks some of the amenities you might expect given the price ( a working water filter was on my list). Also, there is a significant Christian influence in the cabin, so something to note if the Bible verse burned into the wood floor might make you uncomfortable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, excellent stay. As others have said, US422 is right there so there is a bit of traffic noise. But still, the property is beautiful, with many butterflies and hummingbirds visiting the porch area. It's close to Indiana, and not too far from Johnstown. We did pass up the place when we arrived, though—the turn snuck up on us!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was adorable for a glamping experience. The water pressure is decent and the fuzzy blankets were perfect. The air conditioner struggled to keep the small cabin cool, so if you run hot (like my husband) bring a fan or two. I also have very bad allegeries which can be set off by dust, mold, and freshly cut grass. I take meds, but something in the cabin kept irritating my allergies beyond the normal. Just a heads up to others with extreme allergies. Overall it's a cute hunting cabin with all the luxuries home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is so peaceful! I loved having my coffee on the covered porch watching nature and enjoying the view of the pond. The location was close to our destination town and check in was very easy. Donna was very thoughtful and easy to communicate with. Can’t wait to return again, hopefully soon!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna’s cabin was fantastic! A great weekend getaway. It was clean and comfortable, had a very well-supplied kitchen, a huge shower, and such beautiful natural beauty all around. Definitely recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful.everything I expected.i am going every month my wife's idea happy wife happy life. Yeah that's what she says . lol clean.good fishing.thanks Mrs Donna.spotless
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay with lots of comforts and amenities. We loved the pond and kayaks, the jacuzzi tub, the details, and the ease of staying here. We definitely recommend it and hope to stay here again! Felt like home by day 2."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for a weekend getaway for a family of 4. My kids absolutely loved the natural trail, treehouse and kayaks. Very peaceful and cozy."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and relaxing weekend at Curry Run Cabin; Lights on when we arrived made it feel warm and welcoming. Donna was a caring and thoughtful host. Highly recommend staying here for a quiet time away from the hustle bustle of life. My family already booked another weekend. We can't wait to return. Grateful hosts share this cabin with others like us.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our 2 day stay at Curry Run Cabin in early June. The cabin was spotless and comfortable and it was quiet inside -- beautiful wood floors, walls, and cabinets; it had everything we needed / wanted for relaxing, cooking etc. We saw an abundance of wildlife as we sat on the front porch and when walking around the pond -- muskrats, herons, orioles, frogs, a huge turtle, fawns, hummingbirds, fish, white ducks...this made our visit! We got some delicious strawberries etc. at Yarnicks' Farm Market a few miles away (but almost got nailed by traffic as we pulled out onto the highway heading back to the cabin). Hosts Donna and Jan were friendly, welcoming, and responsive; check-in was flawless."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool place with lots of outdoor activities on-site. Close to lots of fun stuff as well.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Curry Run cabin is our favorite place to stay when my wife and I visit Indiana, Pa. It is so cozy, comfortable, quiet and homey. It is in a great location. Close enough to Rt 422, yet far enough from the road that there is not excessive noise. We enjoy watching the wildlife while eating breakfast."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely peaceful. Beautiful cabin inside and out. Everything that was expected. Will be definitely booking again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So nice to get to stay at the cabin again - Donna is a fabulous host, and we were treated to the sounds of frogs and the sight of deer at the pond during the evenings. Will definitely be back! Thank you again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing stay!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"While we did have a short time there, I know we enjoyed the stay! Every morning waking up to fish was a surprise with seeing deer, beavers and had some canadian geese swoop down on the pond! There was a drawback with the constant car noise and bright lights at night but it didn't affect me too much. The host was very helpful and responded quickly. The cabin itself felt cozy and I would like to visit again someday."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing location. Just a short 10 minute drive to downtown Indiana. Such a beautiful property, with a small pond and seclusion. The cabin was very clean and cozy. I even got a surprise and saw a mama deer feeding her fawn by the pond early one morning. The host is wonderful and communicates quickly. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is a great getaway for a weekend. There is more than enough to do right on the property (including kayaking, trails, cookout, and bonfires), but its also close enough to other local places for a dine-out/hiking. The hosts are great folks, you will really be well cared for here! We have already decided to make this a semi-annual weekend vacation spot!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are repeat visitors to Curry Run Cabin and absolutely love it! Last time we were here in summer but this time it was colder. The colder weather gave us a chance to relax by the fire and be cozy for our anniversary. We also went to a couple local restaurants for our anniversary dinner. We had a great experience as usual and plan to return again in summer, as we really love the kayaks and sitting on the porch."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a little slice of heaven, if you’re looking for a clean, peaceful, cozy cabin this is your place! It is near a main road with a good amount of traffic but you can’t hear the road much which was great! If you’re looking for a place to stay with a wonderful pond and cute fireplace cozy cabin this is your stay. Donna and her husband are wonderful sweet people who have some beautiful land to walk through and enjoy the sound of the birds. John and I will be coming back again in the fall for sure, we love this place and are so glad we found it. A seriously great stay and value for your money is spot on, plus the local area is so cute and the shops and restaurants are great!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Curry Run Cabin and the cabin was just a nice and cozy as we remembered it to be from our first visit. We especially enjoyed warming by the fireplace in the evening and looking out at the beautiful view of the pond just in front of the cabin. We did not cook much but, when we did, everything that we needed - and more - was available to us. For anyone who enjoys a walk outdoors, we recommend Blue Spruce park where you can walk entirely around the lake (or, a shorter distance of course if one chooses). For authentic Thai food, prepared by Thai chefs, Thai@Indiana is one of the best Thai restaurants that we have found anywhere. Check-in and check-out was very easy; and Donna and Jan communicated very well when we had questions. My wife and I highly recommend Curry Run Cabin."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rustic cabin was very clean and ready for us to stay. Donna was very prompt in her communication and respectful! We appreciated all she did for us and our group.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Curry Run Cabin is an amazing little place to stay. It's always very clean and so quiet and peaceful.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway! Was perfect for our trip.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my time here. The gas fireplace is lovely and there are several blankets around to snuggle with. The kitchen is big and they have several pots and pans. There is also a dollar general 2 minutes away which makes it super convenient to buy some quick groceries or anything we forgot. I hope to come back
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin was great. Such a nice little piece of heaven. Thank you Donna for the great stay.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Curry Run Cabin is a magical place. Clean, cosy, and comfortable, with a great location if you want to explore the natural places in Indiana County and everything you need if you want to relax at home. Comfy beds, nice bathroom layout, lovely details. We enjoyed the cabin in February but can't wait to return in the summer to enjoy the pond and kayaks. Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing place, plenty to do and plenty of the see."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute cabin on a beautiful property! We had an amazing time. Host was very nice and quick to respond.

2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,This cabin is in a great location. It's quiet and offers a wonderful place to stay and connect with the surrounding nature.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to begin - I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at Curry Run Cabin and our host, Donna! The cabin is just as cute in person as in pictures! The surrounding scenery is gorgeous, especially the lake right in front of the cabin! The cabin was IMMACULATE and the decor and furniture were so cozy and created the perfect atmosphere - especially the fireplace!The location feels so private but there are so many local restaurants and shops, no more than 10 minutes away! It’s perfect! We plan to make it our “go to” when in the area! Donna was incredibly attentive, kind, patient and welcoming!! This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn’t have asked for a better stay or host!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very cozy and Donna is quick to respond to any questions! Very quiet and peaceful location.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice quiet cabin, perfect for a night away."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,The pretty curry cabin is perfect for people who loves the luxury of cozy simplicity
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good host! good communication and amenities.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna was a fantastic host, and the cute cabin was perfect for a friend-cation. We loved the fire place (and our hosts were quick to offer instructions when we needed a little help), the many fuzzy blankets, and all the homey touches (including a Christmas tree!). Donna left so many suggestions for dining and things to do. Enjoyed our walk around the trail and all the amazing home carved touches. Definitely spend some time in historic Indiana, especially the Jimmy Stewart Museum. Convenient to a main road which made finding and getting to places very easy."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank heaven we found this spot! :) Everything was exactly what we needed and we were beyond lucky to be able to instant book this gem at the last minute. It was a cozy, romantic spot for bird watching, a forest walk, even a campfire thought we didn't get to try it. Donna even surprised us by setting up the Christmas tree. It was a very healing spot, curated with beautiful local art and homey touches. Our host was so kind. It was a little hard to find in the dark but her instructions really helped. TV, puzzles, books, and the best view from the little isle on the pond of all the birds made this a perfect place to slow down, reconnect and appreciate the good things. Good recommendations for local finds, and a nice sized bed, but we ended up on the bunk beds because my back likes a firmer mattress. I slept so soundly. Check out was a breeze! It was so nice to read the lovely notes from prior travelers. Donna goes the extra mile and it shows. We are both grateful and look forward to our next staycation!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place that exactly suited our needs. Fireplace was a great way to heat the house. All the other necessities were included.
We enjoyed our stay, and look forward to staying next time we are in town
Thanks for everything"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to relax!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was absolutely one of the most amazing I’ve ever experienced on airbnb. Such a warm and cozy experience for the oncoming winter season completely surrounded by a beautiful view, not to mention clean and tidy. I would definitely recommend this stay and will 100% be booking again for another getaway."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful anniversary and early Thanksgiving with our kids at Curry Run. We've used airbnb to find several cabins and this one might be our favorite so far.
The location is perfect - relatively secluded and close to many beautiful parks and trails, yet the drive to Aldi/Walmart is super quick and easy. The pond is lovely, I love the fire pit option, and the cabin itself is so comfy and cozy. Having a toddler with us, I really appreciated that the furnishings and decor were sort of minimal/non-cluttered but it didn't feel like it was lacking anything either.
And if that weren't enough to seal the deal, Donna and Tim were so gracious and attentive. We will definitely be back if we have the chance."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a peaceful weekend away together at Curry Run! Check in was a breeze. The cabin was cute and cozy, and we really enjoyed our time cuddled up in front of the fireplace! The kitchen was equipped for us to make our own meals. The cabin is secluded enough to enjoy the peace and wildlife, but close enough to highway if we needed anything.
It was a little too cold this weekend to enjoy the pond or trails, but we plan on coming back when it warms up a little to take a hike to see the Tree House on the property!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is great. Very cozy with all the comforts of home. Very clean. Check in was a breeze. Husband and I will be returning in the Spring.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy cabin, had a wonderful weekend!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and adorable cabin! My second time staying here and I'd recommend it to anyone! Donna is such a nice hostess and makes the place homey.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna was such a welcoming person! the cabin was very very clean! We had a blast and can't wait to go back again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin was the perfect little getaway. The fireplace was our favorite part! Everything was very clean and the full kitchen was a great bonus. Would stay again!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great weekend
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we were only passing through but is great place to stay. clean.
it is right off the hwy, so you will hear vehicles. seems like the area has a lot of outdoor activities to offer.
Donna is great. very helpful accommodating. wish I could have met her."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is great so is Donna!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cabin complete with private walking trails, small pond, and a stream."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very calming, had a great time fishing in the pond, catch and release. Beautiful area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great location for visiting family. Really enjoyed having my morning coffee on the porch looking out over the pond.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Curry Run Cabin is a must when staying near Indiana. It is just so cozy, warm and homey. Fun to watch the wildlife around the pond. Easy check-in and check-out. Great communication with the owner."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is so calm and beautiful, into the woods! I will be coming again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A beautiful spot, and it was just what we needed for a calm get away. It is right next to a road, but you can't really see the road because of the trees. Even though you can hear the cars on the road, we had a lovely, relaxing getaway in this pretty spot. I loved sitting on the porch looking at the Little pond. We saw Turtles, a heron, hawks, groundhogs, and bunnies. There is also a pretty walk in the woods marked by colored flags so you don't get lost!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A rustic hideaway but very convenient to Indiana.
it has all the amenities you'll need for a wonderful stay.
The pond and wildlife were a joy to view while sitting on the porch for breakfast."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is clean and cozy. The fishing in the pond was amazing with medium size shiners from Dean’s bait in Indiana. Enjoyed the short hike.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. Very close to a major road and town but feels very private. Lots of space to stretch out and eat or play games. There is a beautiful pond in front if the house and we enjoyed watching all of the wildlife. Inside was very clean and the ktichen was well stocked. We highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darcie’s place was cozy and felt like home. It was extremely clean, with some thoughtful touches (like the HUGE shower, extra comfortable beds, waffle station, and flamingos)! We slept so well after our days visiting friends. We lived in Indiana for several years, and this was the perfect visit back. All of our favorites were in walking distance…great location. What a wonderful stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of space. Great, comfortable living room. My family enjoyed the flamingo decor. Much more interesting than a drab hotel. Darcie and Jill were very attentive, and the location was prime."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly Recommend this place! Darcie was amazing, flexible, and extremely responsive. We loved the personal touches and homey feel! We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a short weekend visit!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darcie was the best host I have ever had. I wish I had found this place sooner. I will be back!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this place! Parking was easy and close to entrance, which is always my biggest concern when booking an AirBnb. The inside is BEAUTIFUL, clean, and has soo much room. Lastly, right on Philly st which makes it easy to walk anywhere whether closer to IUP, or local restaurants/bars. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved the Fancy Flamingo! It was very clean!! Darcies place pays extra attention to small details that make the stay very inviting and comfortable! Hope to return very soon!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darcie was very friendly, instructions were clear, the place was charming, comfortable, and exactly as expected! Nice to be located directly in downtown Indiana. Beds were comfy. Would definitely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Philly street. We were able to walk everywhere! Apartment was super clean and the host really thought of everything I make your stay enjoyable. We told several people about this place in town as well. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place looks way better and bigger than the photos! Darcie is super friendly and helpful with information about the place. Great location as well, walking distance to all the cool spots in town. The rooms are big and comfortable, as well as the bathrooms, massive shower, and beautiful kitchen. We had a great time staying at Darcie’s place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darcie is a great host! Very friendly! Communicates quickly and very attentive ! Her place was clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darcie’s place met all our needs. The location was in walking distance to numerous places to eat in Philly St. which we appreciated. She was good about communicating with us and we appreciated her hospitality!
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Furniture was less than adequate and comfortable for four adults to relax and spend any time inside. The only place to eat was around a counter in the kitchen with uncomfortable stools that are too tall in relationship to the counter. No good place to play cards or game. Smoke alarm was removed and laying in the kitchen with a dead 9v battery beside it; other smoke detectors missing or malfunctioning. The entrance way and steps leading from the front door is dingy and smells of mildew. Not where in second bedroom to hang clothing. Host makes a good attempt at hospitality but apartment works against her.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here while in town! A really cute place at a great location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second year we stayed at Darcie’s place. We felt just like we were at home. We will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks for sharing your home, Darcie! It sure beats staying at a hotel. I'm a clean freak when it comes to staying at other places and yours gets 5 star. It's located in a nice neighborhood and road noise wasn't at bothersome. Our 2 year old was so excited about all the flamingos :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Indiana for IUP Family Weekend. Darcie's place was just as described, so cute and did like the shower room and little touches, the welcome note and box of funfetti pancake mix (we did not eat) the location and parking were great. It was Folk Festival on Philadelphia St and we had a view overlooking the band. Everything was in walking distance. We had dinner in on Saturday night and had everything we needed in kitchen. I had problems getting in but its because I did not pay attention to directions LOL. But Darcie responded right away and there was really no waiting time. It is an older building with updates and it was very homey and we will go back! Loved the decor of the Flamingo!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVE this space, Darcie! We didn’t have to go out and purchase ANYTHING. The decor is bright and welcoming. Jill was readily available to go above and beyond with helping. We’d like to reserve this space annually during Labor Day weekend as we attend a Christian Conference this time of the year, every year. Could you please direct us as to how we may do that?"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for allowing us to stay. It worked out perfectly for our biking trip to Ghost Town Trail. We rode during the day and then returned to the Airbnb and was able to walk to get our dinners in the evenings. Great location for walking the downtown area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Darcie’s place was perfect for first time visitors of Indiana. The location is close by to everything in town. The place was spacious and had all the amenities you could need for a short or long stay. Would highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"stayed here 3 weeks while working in town, very nice accommodations. Darcie and Jordan are wonderful hosts who go above and beyond what's expected. my co worker forgot his hat and they were ready to mail it back, luckily I ended in town this week anyways. would definitely stay here again when in the area"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place on Philly st. Would definitely stay here again
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location just off Philadelphia Street. We arrived at night, in poor weather, so it was a little bit harder to locate the parking lot but the host provided good directions. Were it not for the blizzard and sub zero temperatures it would have been a great place to walk to restaurants and shops. The building is old but the heater worked well and we stayed cozy during inclement weather. Kitchen is well stocked with everything you will need and the unit was extremely clean. The only thing to note is since one of the bedrooms does look out on Philly Street, you get a bit of bar noise in the middle of the night so if you are a light sleeper you will probably want to claim the back bedroom. Overall it was a great find and we enjoyed our stay, we will definitely check to see if the unit is available the next time we travel to Indiana."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice neighborhood
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"working in town, great place to stay"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot to stay! Great place with great space and comfy beds!!! Awesome huge shower!! Wish I would’ve found this place earlier! For 3 years we came to IUP to watch our daughter play volleyball but she’s done now. Thank you Darcie!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,All as expected.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great clean convenient location
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darcie's place was a dream. It was VERY convenient, very well equipped, and was everything and more of what we wanted. She thought of everything. Her place and she is a real gem."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"super clean, every detail was taken care of! The care and thoughtfulness of the host really shines through in the service, style, eye for detail shown in the apartment. Look for us each year"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, clean, good wifi, well stocked kitchen and coffee machine. Would absolutely stay again. Great for uptown activities on foot."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is amazing. It’s big, super clean and extremely nice. It has everything you need. And it’s right in town. There’s so many awesome things about this Airbnb it’s to much to list but if you get the chance to stay here don’t pass it up bc you will regret it. This place was a home away from home for me. Darcies Airbnb is what give them such a great reputation."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute.. super clean.
Location was perfect, we never had to get back in car.
Darcie thought of everything. All we had to do was show up.
We really enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Moire's and Randy's farm was certainly unique. The grounds were lovely, the dogs delightful, and the hospitality exceptional. Randy gave us an unforgettable tour of the barn where we got to see and hear many lambs and sheep as well as horses, a donkey, and two barn cats.
Moire and Randy were very accommodating to our uncommon schedule and needs. We appreciated the comfortable bed, the spotless environment, the tasty and bountiful breakfast, the handicapped bars in the bathtub/shower, and the friendliness of the hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Randy was a helpful host and made a fire. The bed in the room was top of the line. The food and coffee were delicious. The setting had a real homey farm vide. We had a great experience!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book your stay, you won't regret it!! The location is idyllic, the farmhouse cozy and beautifully-decorated, and Moire's hospitality unmatched. The breakfast was delicious. All in all lovely - a true bed and breakfast. I can't wait to come back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic! Wonderful farm, highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy were wonderful hosts. Their farm is beautiful, their hospitality unmatched and it was an overall wonderful weekend!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Moire, Randy and Emmy were very accommodating. The farm is beautiful and the farm animals down to their two energetic pups were very friendly. Should we return we would do so perhaps in the spring or summer to see the property at its peak beauty. I’m sure it is quite a sight in bloom and the green pastures. The breakfast was absolutely delicious!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely long weekend at the farm. Our hosts were very accommodating & we were spoiled with 5 star plus wonderful breakfasts. (Loved those scones) Our sleeping area was a pleasant surprise in comfort & restful sleep. We enjoyed our time immensely & hope to come back in the future.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the car to indoors, we felt almost like family coming to visit. A warm smile & a hearty hello greeted us in the yard (for our situation). The walk around the property was very nice to do especially since we were visiting a new area. It was great to see the animals on the hillside. Afterwards, warming up by the fire was delightful. Bed & room was comfy. Bathroom met our needs. Breakfast was tasty with a beautiful view. We had lovely conversation with the family. Similar interests would draw us to be their neighbor! : ) We'd visit again in another season of the year. Thank you! Blessings on all!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful farm. Very cozy ,peaceful and the hospitality was top notch. We felt like part of the family. The farm fresh breakfast was delicious.. So grateful for our time spent in there home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Moire and her family are great people. I felt welcomed and loved. Their home is amazing, so quiet and refreshing. It is also full of her family's memories which I loved. I am glad I got to know them and see their beautiful farm and animals. I highly recommend it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Moire and family are like no other! Thankful for new friends and a beautiful experience!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was really lovely- It's super peaceful, the breakfasts were amazing, and I loved getting to walk around the property every morning. The leaves were changing and it's just gorgeous this time of year. Moire was an excellent host & really generous."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an incredibly peaceful stay with beautiful and restoring views. Moire and Randy were great hosts. They were attentive, kind, and loving. There are many areas to explore on the property all of which offer their own calm and bliss. Moire's breakfast was lovely, amazing scones and delicious fresh farm eggs! Thank you for a special and re-grounding stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Had an amazing stay at this quiet little getaway. Moire and her husband Randy were very hospitable and made our experience super comfortable and cozy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At Moire, Randy, and Emmy, you're in good hands. Rarely had such a feeling of being at home. Nice conversations and a breakfast prepared with love every morning. If it's been granted, we'll come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words do not do justice to the beauty of this BnB - but I will try.
The fields surrounding the house provide a comfortable level of isolation - even though there are many amenities within just a couple miles.
There are so many places to walk, benches and chairs to sit on, and things to see. I found myself relaxing on the back porch catching up on a little light work - all the while distracted by the small wildlife living their lives as if I wasn't there. No sounds of humanity - just the gurgling stream, and birds chirping.
Later on, near sunset, I walked over to the pond and watched the bluegills and bass drinking in the last rays. I sat in an Adirondack chair and watched the sun dip behind the trees.
Moire and Randy are just as pleasant as the surroundings. To say that they are gracious hosts would be an understatement. Quinn the Corgi was a joy to entertain!
I hope to find the time to come back for a longer visit in the next couple of months."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying here was lovely! I felt very welcomed and comfortable in the single bedroom in the main house. The surroundings are beautiful. I enjoyed visiting the animals, sitting by the pond to read, relaxing on the tree swing... I had access to the living area & kitchen and so many wonderful little spaces outside. There were teas and coffee always available and a lovely breakfast in the morning! It ended up being a wonderful short getaway.
Thank you Moire, Randy & Emmy! (Quinn the dog is also very sweet and kept me company)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The farm is so beautiful, as are the people who host you. It was the perfect place to lay my head for a night, after a long day’s drive. The breakfast Moire cooked for us all was absolutely delicious (orange walnut pancakes, yogurt, fresh fruit, orange glaze and bacon)! Plus a delicious cup of coffee as soon as I woke up. The conversation at breakfast was equally wonderful, with Moire and Randy and two visiting pals. It isn’t often you get to engage in a complex conversation with strangers. And what a pleasure it was.
The grounds are beautiful. Moire and Randy really care for their guests and it shows."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very family oriented everyone very friendly and the animals put the icing on the place.. Thanks had a nice time."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much! The host Moire, is a lovely genuine person. She and her niece made us feel like family. The home is very quaint, as advertised. The property is a piece of heaven. The morning breakfast alone is worth staying with Moire. Property is very close to downtown Indiana and restaurants. It was tough to leave paradise and we feel we have made new friends. We definitely hope to get back for another visit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. Absolutely beautiful. So peaceful and enjoyable. From the wonderful breakfast, gorgeous surroundings, to the sweet lambs playing.
It was perfect. Our host was responsive, kind and friendly.
We will be returning here."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I travel a lot so have stayed at many homes on Airbnb. I must say this host is the absolute best, so friendly and accommodating. Very responsive. And the land! Heaven on Earth!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Moire and her husband are such a delight. Their place is a hidden gem! It is a sheep farm and a running creek through the property. I wish we could have stayed longer. We were served a fantastic breakfast. We will definitely be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire is very hospitable and a great cook. Her breakfasts were excellent, so tasty! It was fun to be on a sheep farm with horses, donkeys and chickens. Her place was just the right distance from town - easy to get there yet far enough to be rural."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and Randy are friendly, hospitable, and also knowledgeable. We were able to walk around on their field and hear about the family story. We also got the opportunity to visit the barn and learn some animal fun facts from them. We also appreciated the breakfast provided Moire. That's fantastic."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a weekend gateway!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time with Morie and Randy whom opened their home to us. Just wonderful people. Enjoyed my conversation with them and the Christian values that they adhere to. God bless them.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful property and can't wait to return again soon.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Burnhead Grazings was absolutely lovely. We came for a 2-night couples getaway, and Moire made sure that it was a sweet and special stay. We especially appreciated that she offered us our choice of the Queen Room in the family home and the Upper Room in the Spring House, since both were available. We stayed in the Spring House, a cozy, delightful cottage just down the stream from the family home. It was beautifully decorated, warm and comfortable, and peaceful throughout the day and evening. Other highlights were the wonderful conversations with Moire, Randy and Emmy throughout our stay, the phenomenal breakfasts, and delightful interactions with the animals on the farm. Indiana also has several fantastic restaurants and shops that are not to be missed! We are planning to come back with our 2 children sometime in the near future. Thank you, Moire, Randy and Emmy, for your loving hospitality ❤️"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the nicest air bnb in a shared home we have ever experienced. I felt like I was home at one of my Aunties homes. Moire and her family were kind and generous and it was wonderful sharing time and conversation together. We will definitely be back if we come that way again! Thank you Moire!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Moire and her family were absolutely wonderful hosts. It was just like being a part of their family, right at home, and yet pampered as guests.
I found such peace on the grounds. It was like a mini vacation/retreat. Well worth the stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just want to say that words don’t explain the connection I felt with the host! First and foremost, I felt genuine hospitality and like I was with family. I felt refreshed and ready for a new start, like I can go on now! If you are need of restoration and healing this bnb will make that happen for you. I cant say enough, the animals were amazing, we got to pet sheep, donkeys, and horses. This place was truly divine stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to Burnhead Grazings. This stay was even more of a delight than my first. Moire and her husband went above and beyond to accommodate my unique needs as a traveling gig worker. Rest assured, you will not be disappointed! This isn't just a roof over your head for a night or two, this home is something special. Five stars."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay. Morie oriented me to the farm and I took two long hikes. I was very close to town but being in a valley the nights were quiet with no road noise, little light pollution, and absolutely wonderful. The room was more than comfortable. The B&B breakfast featured bake goods made by Morie, and eggs and bacon from the farm. I loved talking with the hosts and hope to return again soon."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Moire was a great host. I felt bad since my dog was with me and not the most well behaved but she was so calm about it. She made breakfast and dinner and took my dietary needs into consideration 10/10
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gracious hosts! Impeccably clean, cozy and restful. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Freshly baked cookies and water next to the bed was a beautiful touch. Festive Christmas decor throughout the farmhouse. Even the bedroom and bathroom were decorated for Christmas. We toured the buildings and the grounds and were served a delicious homemade hot breakfast. Freshly baked scones better than any bakery. Your entire family will enjoy this quiet peaceful home and be moments from town."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!!!! Wonderful hosts that loves everyone like family. Can’t say enough good things. we felt right at home. We were running late and they communicated with us making sure we were good and wanted to make sure they were there to greet us. Moire made a great breakfast for us each morning. It was nice to try some new things as well. The house was decorated for Christmas so it made the stay extra special. A beautiful quiet location not far from town. The morning view of the stream at breakfast was great. We would definitely stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was absolutely wonderful! My husband and I stayed the weekend of Thanksgiving and it was the perfect spot for the holidays. Moire and Randy were such great hosts; very kind hearted, compassionate, and hospitable. Not to mention, Moire is a fantastic cook! Breakfast was delicious! The room and bathroom were perfect for our two night stay. The farm is very peaceful and totally feels like a spot out of a hallmark movie! We hope to be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"When planning for year 3 of The Veterans Half-Marathon in Indiana, PA, my wife and I try to stay overnight locally since we reside close to two hours away. All hotels were booked this year so we opted to try an Air B&B. What we found was so much more than a place to sleep and shower. What we found were excellent people who love others like family and accommodations that were second to none. From the very comfortable bed, to the immaculately cleaned bathroom, and the gourmet breakfast that powered me through 13.1 miles of early November heat( yes, it was in the mid 70’s and 80% humidity that day), we felt like we were the most important people in Moire’s and Randy’s lives. My biggest regret is not having more time to spend at their charming farm, I would have loved to see the rest of the property and the barn and livestock. Therefore, we will be scheduling another trip to Indiana to spend additional time getting to know Moire and Randy’s estate more intimately. Sometimes you just meet people that make you feel like you’ve known each other all your lives, that’s Moire and Randy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Moire is an amazing host! So welcoming and kind. She is also an amazing cook. The property is just like the photos. We loved our stay here and want to stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Beautiful setting and very relaxing.
Great recommendation for ice cream, Meadows.
Breakfasts were delicious and filling. Enjoyed our conversations with both Moire & Randy.
Would stay again next time in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So relaxing to enjoy the view while having a home cooked breakfast. Our hosts were so welcoming and accommodated our crazy schedule. I wish we had been there longer and been able to see the whole farm and animals. Great location close to all the area attractions and restaurants.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect stay. Moire and Randy were great hosts. My husband I had an excellent time. It was so peaceful. We loved seeing all of the animals everyday. It was so nice of them to allow us to tag along for the morning feeding. I honestly don’t know if there is anywhere else like this place! The only complaint I have is that I wish we would have booked longer !!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely recommend this Airbnb! Moire is such a sweet, sincere host who really cares about her guests and we are so glad we got to meet her and hear some of her story. The house and surrounding farm is a beautiful place with several seating areas to sit and relax. The pleasant sound of the stream, the pond, the gardens, and farm landscape also made the place enjoyable and relaxing. Downtown Indiana is only 10 minutes away which made going out to eat quite easy. Breakfast was also a special treat - she’s a great cook!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the house while visiting our son at IUP. IUP is only a few minutes away. We truly enjoyed the experience of staying on a farm. Breakfast was excellent, much better than what you get elsewhere"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Moire is a lovely person who provides a warm welcome and a wonderful breakfast! The grounds are incredibly beaucolic and natural. She also has lodgings at her spring house (wonderful breakfast included) and HipCamp sites, (does not include breakfast) on the property if you have allergies to pets, which are part of her home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"God’s glory and majesty is on full display at this beautiful farm. Moira and niece, Emmy, are warm and inviting. The home is gorgeous, large but cozy. The bed was comfortable and the space was private. I wish I’d had time to enjoy all this farm has to offer- walking trails, feeding fish in the pond, taking in one breathtaking view after another. Perfect place for prayer, thinking through decisions, enjoying nature. This place is blessed and I feel blessed having spent time there."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful relaxing stay we had! The location is just perfect it feels as though you’re somewhere in Europe. And can we talk about the next wonderful breakfasts that Moire made for us. We loved it! If we’re ever back in the area, we’ll be back!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My stay at Burnhead Grazings has been absolutely wonderful, from the very first welcome to the last talk has it been one if the most welcoming and heartwarming stays I've ever had. Surrounded by beautiful nature and blessed by the most amazing and wonderful people and the best breakfast I've ever had, I can absolutely recommend staying here to re-energize and getting a break from the busy city and work life."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Moire was just perfect. She really made us feel like home and the room (and house) was super cozy. Highly recommend going here. Indiana also had a lot to offer, which was a pleasent surprise, although we just spent most of the time relaxing at the farm. Moire's breakfast was also amazing!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really beautiful home and farm. We ended up staying in the detached cottage near the barn and it was super nice and peaceful. Moire and her family were friendly and easy to talk to, and the breakfast was delicious. We came as a getaway from the city and I’d fully recommend it for anyone looking for some peace and quiet"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely - When I first arrived, I thought, Wow. The setting is the best part of this place; but then I met Moire and her family, and had breakfast, and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings.. I don't know if I can pick the best part.
So... to try to write the kind of review I would like to read... The setting is idyllic. Beautiful - and not far from civilization while still being peaceful and private. That being said, there are hills, and rocks, and country things - pets, crickets chirping, fireflies glowing, frogs croaking - if that's your idea of heaven, you are in luck, but if not, this may not be the place for you.
If you have difficulty with steps, there are two to get in to the house. Once you are in, there are no steps (although I did not go out on the back porch or deck, so there may have been some there.
The bedroom is cozy, and you truly could come in with just your clothing - everything you need has been provided. If you are a larger person, the space between the end of the bed and the wall is narrow, but there is a very comfy chair to sit in and an office chair with a place to work. There were plenty of blankets and pillows. Note that your bedroom is down the hall with all of the bedrooms, and, while you have a bathroom to yourself it is not connected to your bedroom - you will walk just a few feet down the hall to get to it.
The common area is comfy and, truly, you will feel as if you have gone to stay with your favorite aunt.
Breakfast was wonderful. On the day we were there, we had fresh fruit, yogurt, potatoes, eggs, sausage, juice, coffee (and tea if we wanted). Everything was very good - and farm fresh.
Before we left, we were sure to get a tour of the farm - and got to meet the animals.
If you want a peaceful country setting, this is your place! I loved my stay with Moire, and would have loved to stay longer."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for peace and quiet, look no further. Driving under the canopy of two grand trees that greet you upon your arrival, the outside world seems to drift farther and farther away as you make your way down the long, winding driveway. Moire is the perfect hostess and will take care of your every need! Our stay was filled with tranquility, animals, amazing breakfasts and enjoyable storytelling. If you’re looking to get away from it all and for something different from the normal B&B experience, this is the place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is hard to imagine how beautiful and bucolic this sheep farm is until you spend a few days there! Moire loves hosting and cooking the most amazing breakfasts for her guests. If you are wanting to enjoy wildlife of every kind in a friendly setting, spend some time at Moire’s home. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. This place is magic and Moire wants your stay to be memorable and does everything she can to make it so. Hospitality at its finest!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire made us feel like family from the moment we walked through the door. The location was perfect for us and the setting beautiful and serene. A delicious breakfast awaited us every morning and when the schedule didn't allow for us to sit and enjoy it, Moire packed one to go. Couldn't ask for more! If you're in the Indiana, PA area it is definitely the place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Gracious hosts and a fabulous breakfast!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very special place!
A comfortable home, wonderful and warm conversation, nature abounds and….. it is close to town and everything you might need!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous property and amazing hospitality! Moire accommodated my gluten-free needs with ease and made two 5 star breakfasts ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful haven - Moire and Randy are warm and welcoming, as is their beautiful, hearth-centered home. The valley is just beautiful and I especially appreciated having free rein of the grounds (just wear good boots if you go out in the fields on a spring day!) Breakfast was amazing. Truly an incredible find."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, scrumptious breakfasts and terrific hospitality. We enjoyed walking the land all the way to the top of the hill along the tree break. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing and I would 10/10 recommend it to family, friends, or strangers! The location was beautiful, the food was phenomenal, the bedroom/bathroom were the perfect amount of space needed and both very clean. Moire and Randy were excellent hosts, accommodating anything we needed - even packing us a to-go breakfast for our early morning departure on Groundhog Day!
An added bonus was the unique experience of being taken on a tour of the barn and getting to be up close and personal with the sheep, donkeys, horses, and chickens!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Burnhead Grazings is a peaceful and restful haven. We enjoyed the beauty of Moire's home, the surrounding countryside, and the delicious food for breakfast. It is also conveniently located by multiple restaurants, microbreweries and other shops in Indiana PA. If you are looking to get away this is a lovely place to go. Make sure you try the homemade lamb sausage!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the most wholesome place to stay, wonderful family, beautiful farm. 100/10 please stay here."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect and peaceful getaway close to home. Moire and Randy were very friendly, and made you felt welcome."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t rant enough about what a wonderful stay it is at BurnHead Grazings!!! Moire and the family are so friendly and warm, the farm is beautiful, the spring house is so quaint and comfy. My family and I stayed for an extended trip and the best part of the day was sitting down to an amazing breakfast that Moire made.
The location is perfect! Just outside of town with running routes and so much nature!
I recommend a stay here 1000%!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience staying with Moire and her family at Burnhead Grazings. A lovely farm setting in a welcoming home!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a trip back to simpler times and traditional values and experiences. It’s nice to enjoy nature as it’s intended and learn new things about sheep and farming, with good conversation with good people. Beautiful scenery as you can swing on a tree swing and watch the sun set, and sit in the breakfast nook in the morning and eat with the birds and other visitors. Definitely a trip worth taking and experiencing. I hope to return."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire's the most wonderful hostess and her home is the perfect place if you're looking for respite! She gives you as much space as you'd like while still being available to provide suggestions for meals and things to do locally, or just to enjoy a nice conversation. During my stay, Moire asked if I'd like to tag along for morning chores at the barn which was a treat, and she even shared a demonstration of wool felting for a project she was working on! There are lots of comfy places to read or sit outside, as well as the gorgeous property to walk along and reconnect with nature. The breakfasts were all delicious as well. I feel well-rested and rejuvenated after my stay with Moire at Burnhead Grazings and am looking forward to a return visit in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time with Moire and her family. The property is lovely. They were extremely accommodating and kind. We hope to return
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just can't say enough about this place. On every level it was the best Air BnB / hotel / inn stay we have ever had. We felt like we were visiting family. Moire shared her story with us, about how her father bought the farm to raise sheep and Australian sheepdogs. We shared horse experiences and saw the barn, horses, minature horses, goats, sheep and chickens. The whole family was very friendly and positive; they went the extra mile in every way. Breakfast was spectacular - 5-star restaurant worthy. It was a very relaxing and restorative time - just perfect. I will be coming back again and again."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice room on a breathtakingly beautiful farm with babbling brook, lovely trees, and lots of animals to pet. It was disappointing that Moire was away and therefore there wasn't the full farm breakfast (but lovely scones) - she did give us a heads-up about this. Super clean."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely property, and Moire and her family are great hosts! We will be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Burnhead Grazings is a charming, peaceful retreat. Moire, Randy, and Emmy are not only welcoming, but are fabulous teachers and storytellers. I would most definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when in the area."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From being greeted at the door by gray cat, Mr. Pipps, and border collie, Briggs, to the sumptuous daily breakfast, everything about Burnhead Grazings is warm and welcoming.
Come to see the sheep but stay for to enjoy the sheep, the rural green fields and tree-lined lanes of the PA countryside. This peaceful and serene setting allows you to fully recharge after such a trying 2020."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moire and her husband are incredible hosts. We felt completely at home in their beautiful and cozy house, we had great conversations with them, and their property is absolutely beautiful. We felt so relaxed and well cared for.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Escape for a spell by crossing into Burnhead Grazings and experience this hidden oasis of simplicity. Wake to daily gourmet breakfasts served piping hot. Stroll the property and allow yourself to loose track of time. Watch the miríade of birds as the fly, feed and chirp along the babbling stream. Sit by the lake as the dusk approaches, sip your coffee and feed the fish as they swim to greet you. Visit with the sheep, lamb, donkeys, chickens, goats and horses and be one with the energy and warmth you feel around you. Just walk, breathe, relax and be. If you’re looking to unplug and recharge, there is no better place to visit. Moire is the ultimate hostess, artist and chef. Absolutely amazing! For more information on this property and my stay from 04/12/21 through 04/15/21, visit the Burnhead Grazings Facebook page. Thank you again Moire & family!"

The breakfast Moire prepared was super delicious!!! I’m so grateful I stayed with this family and I highly recommend people who wants to feel close to nature and animals come and stay here !!! ❤️
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique experience! Me and my partner went up to get away from the city for our 2 yr anniversary and it was lovely :) we even got to hold baby lambs :0 it was nice and quiet a good change from the city, and everything was super clean. Moira and her family were so accommodating and sweet - it was great to walk around the farm and by the creek despite the cold. Hoping to return in the summer !"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Some things you can expect: adorable farm animals, DELICIOUS breakfast, a cozy room, and being extremely cared for! Moire’s hospitality was astounding. She welcomed us into her home and gave us a valentines day weekend we will never forget! Some highlights include seeing a sheep give birth and a wonderful farm to table breakfast. She even gave us a dozen eggs to take home with us! You can’t go wrong staying with Moire. Also check out Levity brewing company if you’re looking for adult activities- we loved the food and beer!Thanks again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Words can’t describe the blessed stay we had at Moires home. The stay was amazing for rest, conversation, and rejuvenation. I appreciate the lovely personalities of this family.
We felt comfortable, peace, joy, relaxed, hope in the future from our rest, creativity reflowed from our veins, love resourced, connection to nature, farming & animals. We plan to visit again!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the ideal place to stay if you are looking for peace, relaxation, kindness, cleanliness and hospitality. We can’t say enough positive words about our experience and stay. We stayed while waiting for our adoptive son to be born and it was incredible!!! Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay and be with him for 2 nights after the hospital! We so appreciate Moire and enjoyed our stay tremendously. We can’t wait to come back!!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Peaceful place to be relaxed and enjoy Indiana.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My roommate and I had the most lovely stay at the farm!! We came to Indiana PA for a furniture sale, which was conveniently located right down the road. While Moire’s property was right by the warehouse, it felt like a secluded little slice of heaven! The serene pond, the sheep, the friendly dog- it was all perfect. Moire made us feel right at home, making sure we were comfortable and made us an outstanding farm-style breakfast. And given COVID, she was very cautious and respectful of our wishes to keep safe distance.
My only regret is that we didn’t get stay longer! 11/10 would recommend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful oasis. Enjoyed sitting on the swing by the pond, getting a barn tour to see the goats, tasty breakfast and comfortable bed. As a reminder this is a homestay so there is less social distancing. Check out the spring house listing if this is an issue."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Burnhead Grazings was more than we could have imagined! Our missionary team stayed with Moire and she expressed incredible Biblical hospitality is unlike any other. This faithful woman is gifted beyond measure and treated us like family. Thank you, dear Moire, you are such a blessing!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful experience. Exactly what we were looking for...a nice and quiet experience that you could only get on a working sheep farm. We had a great time visiting the animals after a short walk to the barn area. Plenty of room to get some extended walks in on the 68 acres.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a hospitality. We loved the warmth shared by the family and they took care of all our needs. We are definitely going to visit again.

2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We were greeted with warm smile! This property is amazing. Moire was so wonderful to me and my family. I will be back. Be sure to join in with farm animals if given a chance. I plan to stay at the spring house as soon as possible. We left here feeling rested and renewed.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Moire was an amazing host! We had a great weekend staying for Groundhog Day. She gave us good advice and made us an amazing breakfast!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"At Burnhead Farms, you can expect a warm welcome and great conversation from the host, a collection of beautiful animals to greet and observe, a charmingly decorated upper Spring House, a big, comfy bed, fresh, tasty spring water, warm shower, acres of hillside with roaming sheep and horses, and well-preserved atmosphere of peace and natural beauty. My husband and I hope to stay there again in the future."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I were in a search for a cute place to spend a weekend. When we saw this place we both decided that it’s “too good to be true” and instantly booked it.
The place was beyond amazing! Almost like we walked into a fairytale, everything from the interior and the outdoors space to the breakfast was magical.
The hosts are incredibly sweet people with whom we had a pleasure to have a wonderful conversation over extremely delicious breakfast cooked by Moire.
We will definitely come back !"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the best ever AirBnB we stayed in. Highly recommended and can't wait to return with a longer stay so to enjoy Moire's freshly baked scones with scrambled eggs from her own free range chickens and the cozy and picture perfect setting. We loved it and you owe it to yourself such a treat!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Moire's place is a safe, welcoming place where everyone can experience God's love, joy, and beauty. The animals and landscape are beautiful. The fresh country air is crisp and invites you to come back again. The people are kind, and it's a great little place to get away. We are a young married couple who would definitely stay at the Spring House (a separate little private house) next time. Thanks Moire!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Moire’s place was just what we needed after a long trip across the country! Her farm was so peaceful and she was wonderfully hospitable and accommodating. Breakfast with a creek view in the morning was delicious and picturesque. We loved staying at Burnhead Grazings and would highly recommend it for a relaxing and quaint weekend getaway!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you plan on staying at Burnhead Grazings, you are in for a real treat! My husband and I needed to take a weekend away from the stress of living in the city and staying at this sheep farm did just the trick! Moire and her family go above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome with a real PASSION for hospitality. The day starts with a DELICIOUS farm fresh breakfast. I am still thinking about her fresh scones! She welcomes you to observe her daily farming chores and invites you to explore her land as you please. We spent a lot of our time relaxing on a tree swing and laying in the grass reconnecting with nature, or cuddling up with her pup Brig and cat Pip, which was a dream. She also offers excellent tips on local restaurants, shops, and hiking trails so, there was never a moment of confusion on how to plan our day. Local parks, trails, and nightlife were only minutes away. Also, her home is spotless and charming! I cannot say enough good things about our visit and I hope to return sometime soon!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend with Moire was amazing! Warmest hospitality and beautifully decorated home, special homemade breakfast and treats are generously included in this heartfelt visit. Definitely going to visit again! Miss it already ♥️ Thank you Moire and Randy:)"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Wonderful farm to table breakfast. Morie is a great host!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous stay on the farm with Moire! She is the most gracious host. The setting is awe inspiring. You’ll feel your blood pressure go down as soon as you drive up the lane. Breakfast was outstanding. And of course you can’t forget about the sheep, the horses and the mini donkeys. You won’t go wrong with this one!!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hospitality and amazing stay! Thank you!!
2018-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and quiet rural location.
Wonderful hot tub
WiFi is spotty"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's always a pleasure to spend time at Moire and Randy's house. Comfy beds, delicious breakfasts, and good conversations. What more could you ask for?"
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I came to “Burnhead Grazings” Indiana, PA for “Groundhog Day”. We have been to many Airbnb’s but this one was supreme and by far the very best!! Moire made us feel like family from the moment we stepped into her home. The setting was idyllic with the rolling hils and grazing sheep, along with the warm and inviting home, especially the wonderful fire in the cozy sitting room, where we sat on that cold first evening with a glass of wine, getting to know our hostess and all about the surrounding area. It was a perfect beginning. Getting to accompany Moire, as she tended to her evening chores, feeding her sheep, miniature donkeys and chickens was a special treat! Moire is an excellent cook and the delicious breakfasts she served each morning were sublime! It was also a pleasure to chat with Moire’s husband, Randy each morning before he left for work Moire packed all of her “Groundhog Day” guests a delicious breakfast and gave us warm woolen blankets, as we headed off at 4am to see “Phil.” During our stay, we checked out the “Jimmy Stewart Museum” in downtown Indiana and each of the restaurants that Moire recommended . . . Superb! I could go on and on about the pleasure we had, while staying at Moire and Randy’s home but the best way to understand is to take a trip to the delightful little town of Indiana, Pa. and then drive out into the beautiful countryside for a little slice of heaven at “Burnhead Grazings “. You will not be disappointed. We will be back again, Theressa and Stan"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Moire is by far the best host I've had. I've only had a few but she treated my girlfriend and I like relatives coming to stay. My car broke down on the drive up and she was a great communicator and let my girlfriend check in and I arrive close to midnight. Beautiful home, breakfast, dogs, space to walk and talk, and they chat too! Excellent. Would love to return."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to spend the weekend. Beautiful views all around and a beautiful house to stay in. Greg is super proactive and a pleasure to deal with. Have no complaints.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed for our daughter’s graduation weekend at IUP. The house is beautiful and has wonderful views. The location is very secluded and quiet, as advertised. Just about 15 minutes from Campus, it was very convenient for all the events we needed to attend.
The home is spacious and we had plenty of room for the family and friends staying with us. The newly renovated bathrooms and kitchen were lovely, and everyone felt right at home.
Some water pressure and WI-FI issues, but nothing that caused a real problem. We had lots of rain during our stay, but I can imagine that the grounds would be amazing to explore in better weather."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The setting of the house is incredible....very secluded and surrounded by beautiful trees. Lots of big windows to help appreciate the outdoors from inside. The common area was very comfortable and had plenty of room for six adults. The kitchen was well-equipped and had everything we needed; we did not use the kitchen on the lower level. There is a newish covered gazebo-type structure outside the house that provides a wonderful immersion in the surrounding nature. We had no trouble going up or down the driveway...it's a typical dirt drive.
Be aware that there are only two ""enclosed"" bedrooms, one on the main level and one on the lower level. In addition, there is a queen bed in the open loft upstairs...a beautiful room but no blinds or curtains to keep out the early morning sunrises. There is also a bed in the common room on the lower level; it is open to the downstairs kitchen but has a curtain that provides some privacy from the common area.
All in all, we had a wonderful stay."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Super relaxing, quiet, and peaceful country home with a view."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highpointe was a perfectly peaceful, well stocked and thoughtfully appointed countryside stay. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning surroundings! It is very peaceful and private. Instructions were very clear. Clean and comfortable. We even enjoyed taking turns playing the piano upstairs—the acoustics were great in the open room! We had one minor issue with a toilet on arrival, but clear instructions were left on the table on how to contact the host and/or a local representative and it was fixed for us by the time we returned from dinner! A perfect place to use as home base for a multi-generation family attending IUP graduation ceremonies."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic place to stay! We had a couple of initial issues but Greg and his extended team took care of it without any fuss - everything was taken care of.
This property and house are beautiful, perfectly situated making this a perfect place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful setting! Breathtaking views. Greg is an absolutely wonderful host. We had a wonderful weekend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time here. Stayed here last year for a wedding and found out there was another this year, so we immediately rebooked. The view is absolutely beautiful. Last time we were here in June, this time October and the difference in seasons makes a big difference. The leaves changing colors made it even more beautiful. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want a relaxing getaway."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful! It is very well equipped and extremely clean. The view is lovely. The downside is the trip up the driveway, it was more daunting than we expected. The host tried to make it clear in the welcome instructions but it was still more than we expected, we made it though. However, we did end up leaving one day early since there was rain expected and we were concerned with traversing the driveway after rains. There was also an issue with sulfur smell in the home, airing it out helped and it was noted that they have random issues with it in the house info left for us. Communication with our host, Greg, was good and he reimbursed us some of the cost due to the need to leave early, which was much appreciated. He also told us that they are scheduling with contractors to work on the driveway. If that can be smoothed out a bit and the sulfur remediated or house vented in some way, it would be a perfect spot. If you have 4WD or high profile vehicle you would have no issues. It is a beautiful place to stay, once you get up the drive :)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Greg is a great host. This is my second time there. Beautiful house and property.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful house and location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip in two years, and it was a very good start. The house and view are gorgeous.
The exterior pictures on the Airbnb page haven't been framed to avoid eyesores, there aren't any. The long steep driveway means that no other houses are nearby. The house is near the edge of grass clearing surrounded by trees. I don't even remember seeing a power line, which I guess means it is buried. On the other side of the house the hill slopes down giving a view. From the entrance floor you can see the ridge top across the valley. A few radio towers are the main sign of civilization. From the top floor you can see down into the valley, with fields and route 422. The house has lots of big windows to see in all directions.
I like the interior decoration. For many homes pictured on Airbnb, I think, well, that would do. This place is more to my taste. (Other than a few deer heads.) You can judge for yourself, the Airbnb pictures are representative.
The wifi was good enough for FaceTime calls, throughout the house, so I could show off the place with a quick virtual tour. The Verizon and T-Mobile reception seemed fine. (Except for an old Verizon phone that hasn't been upgraded yet. The 3G network seems to be already mostly gone here. It will be gone everywhere in a few months.) There are plenty of electric outlets.
The air conditioner is indeed loud, but opening some windows was a better option when we were there. Be aware that one window in the loft doesn't have a screen. I didn't notice, letting in a large wasp. Luckily it didn't take long to get it back out. I didn't see any other indoor wildlife.
The foyer with its outside and inside doors was useful for unloading and loading our car, without risking letting in bugs.
Indiana PA is less than ten miles away, and big enough to have the usual stores.
We explored a little bit of the Ghost Town Trail and the Hoodlebug Trail. But there is much more to do in the area, so it would be nice to come back for a longer stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous, well-appointed house that's earned its name! Highpointe is on top of the hill, overlooking beautiful treelines as far as the eye can see. It's the best of both worlds: all the comforts of home in a completely private wooded landscape. Our group of six was perfectly comfortable and enjoyed our stay greatly. An ideal AirBNB experience for anyone looking to get away from it all."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for a family get together. There was plenty of space for all of us. While the property is rural it is still close to everything. Though there was a warning about the road, I didn't find it to be difficult. Finally, remember this is a rural property and anything next to the woods, especially in Spring, might have a mouse or two. It says nothing about the property which was well maintained. You might want to keep on scrolling if the reality of country living would be too anxiety provoking."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect. I almost gave up on Airbnb because of how uncomfortable the beds are. The beds here are very comfortable. The views are spectacular. The interior is beautiful.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great host. Clear instructions, well maintained property. The drive up can be a little tricky for cars with low ground clearance. The view from the top is worth it. The house was clean and cozy. Would love to visit again."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful place to stay while in Indiana, PA. It is not far away from the actual town to get groceries, etc. The home was clean and spacious. The location is very private, and there is a long steep hill to drive up. The hill is a dirt country lane, but we had no trouble getting to the home even in the rain. This is a location that I would recommend and would likely return to if I am ever in the area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place with amazing view! Highly recommend this location.
Host was very responsive to any questions and provided personal local preferences which were spot on, for our group.
The home is clean and comfortable. Perfect getaway for friends or families! Thank you for opening up your place, for others to enjoy"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in this house several times in the past couple of years because it’s a convenient halfway point to meet out-of-state family. The fact that we keep coming back should be testament that this is a quality stay. The views are gorgeous, the house is spacious and well kept, and the owners are friendly and communicate well. We always see wildlife and appreciate the short trails in the woods. There are several quirks to the house including the water system and the incredibly loud AC unit, the driveway is a beast, and the basement has a distinctive odor that’s distracting but not a dealbreaker for us. Overall, we are likely to come back and would certainly recommend it. It’s a nice house in a beautiful, secluded location."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is exactly as advertised. Very quiet and private. Excellent cellphone and internet service.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Greg’s cabin is amazing! The location is perfect! Super peaceful and the stars at night are absolutely amazing!
The drive way up is a little sketchy, but nothing a car can’t handle!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It's a lovely cabin up in the mountains! We really enjoyed our stay here. A highlight was too barred owls hooting to each other as we sat around the campfire.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a perfect get away place; the views are spectacular. There was a pair of cardinals to great us every morning and then of course we saw deer, rabbits, etc..."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Greg was very helpful and flexible with our check-in and check-out times!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and spacious house in a beautiful and very secluded location.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeds expectations- spacious, comfortable, surrounded by beautiful greenery. Greg and his family are superb hosts and Juno to attend every need. It would be great for a small family reunion."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great experience, host was responsive and thorough with explanations and support questions. the property was lovely and was a great place to enjoy the outdoors and spend time with friends. lots of beds and the most comfortable couches I've ever experienced with an Airbnb. would love to stay there again."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! We enjoyed the nature and the time away with friends!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The gravel road seems a bit steep, but oh my, is the views worth it. Actually, the road isn’t that bad, especially if you have an suv or truck.
I could just stay here and look out the windows, no reason to go anywhere, it’s beautiful. Greg is very informative before, during and after your stay. I would absolutely recommend this place. We have another wedding in Indiana, pa next year and we’ll definitely be back."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Greg was so attentive and got right back to us with questions! His cabin on the hilltop was amazing and was so unique and offered amazing views. Highly recommend :)
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful peaceful place. The house was very clean and comfortable. Kitchen was well stocked. The communication with the owner was easy and informative. We really enjoyed our stay. It was so nice to decompress after this past year.
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, spacious, and everything you’d want in a short get away. Six of us stayed for a weekend and we are planning to come back again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely weekend getaway. There were only two of us, but the house easily accommodates more people. Greg was very friendly and responsive. I imagine the views in the fall are amazing since the property overlooks so many trees. Very clean & comfortable!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Amazing “camp” in a remote hilltop location. Perfect relaxing weekend getaway!
2021-02-01,4,Group trip,"The trip up the mountain on the gravel road is worth it--the location and views from this home are incredible! It rained most of our weekend, which was fine. We loved watching the forest, valley, and distant mountains in the changing weather and light. During breaks in the rain, found lots of trails to hike and a great spot for campfires. Great spot to just absorb the beauty of creation that surrounds this home."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're ever considering booking Greg's place, book it immediately!! With all of the chaos in the world, Greg's retreat is the calm you need. It is clean, very warm , and inviting. The views are priceless, it has everything you need. Bring some games & food and you are set for an amazing time. Greg was nothing but sweet and accommodating in his quick responses. Don't hesitate & book now!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is beautiful with a spectacular view! As I drove up to the house there were four deer in the front yard. The house was immaculate and the decor fit the country setting. The rooms were large and able to accommodate the seven of us. We enjoyed sitting outside around the fire ring. Greg was very easy to work with and was prompt answering any questions that I had. We had a great time!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This large home is surrounded with beauty. It is very private and relaxing. We saw peaceful wildlife, too, and the sky was amazing on a clear night."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,a beautiful area
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to come and relax. Great views, nice amenities, fun place to stay"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Gregs place was awesome for our family of 6! The listing says it’s 3 bedrooms, but really it’s 3 bedrooms plus an open loft with two more beds, so we had plenty of space to spread out. The house itself was beautiful and had amazing light with lots of windows. The property was remote but close enough to everything we needed it wasn’t a hassle. The area around the house was very private and had gorgeous trails and open green space. Everything was meticulously labeled and organized and perfect for our stay. Communication with Greg was easy and his detailed instructions were easy to understand and made getting to the house a breeze. We really enjoyed our time at Highpoint and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, relaxing, and very safe retreat."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what a view! You will not be disappointed with your stay at Highpointe. From the amazing views to the spacious rooms, this rental has everything you need for a relaxing getaway. Our group of 8 enjoyed the local state parks during the day and boardgames/lawn activities at night. It was a perfect vacation for all of us!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"Highpoint is perfect for anyone looking to get some solitude and escape, but live lavishly all the same time. Beautiful views from everywhere in the house. Reminds me of the hunting camp I have always wanted.. haha. Greg was a great host and very responsive. We had a minor issue with the water system at 1030 pm, and Greg, his brother Doug, and the nephew Max were all available to talk me through resolving the issue in minutes. Would recommend to anyone I know."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay for the week at Highpointe. It was clean, peaceful, spacious, and quietly located with some great views of the surrounding area. Tons of natural light, and plenty of space for a group or large family. Greg was a TREMENDOUS communicator and super accommodating. Had a great time getting away from the day-to-day and spending some time away at Highpointe. Definitely would recommend!"
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a comfortable stay. The view is amazing! The beds and living room furniture were comfortable and we felt very much at home. The air conditioner is a bit loud but it was too warm to turn it off for very long. Other than that, we had a great stay. Would recommend and stay there again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Greg's was a great place to relax both inside and outside. It was wonderful to just take in the great views and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. A great place to social distance!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very roomy and completely private space surrounded by acres of trees. There is an entire family of hosts and the two we interacted with were great! Only downsides were air conditioning units that were a bit noisy and the satellite tv went down several times, but it was a very hot and occasionally stormy week — so these issues might not be typical. Beds and furniture were comfy and the kitchen was well supplied. A very pleasant place to spend a few days away after months of working from home."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,This is a wonderful place to stay. Our group enjoyed a pleasant 4th of July weekend here and could not have been happier with the space and accommodations provided. We would highly recommend to others who are looking for a place to stay in/near the Indiana area!
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"We booked the cabin for a ""girl's weekend"" and loved it. The view was amazing and the cabin was in excellent condition when we arrived. Check-in and check-out procedures were easy. A word of warning about the steep driveway (which was a bit more difficult after a heavy rain) but we made it. Don't let this deter you, just be advised if you have a choice of vehicle. All in all, we had a lovely time and would recommend."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Sacred place and space to embrace God's creation. May all those who visit be mightily blessed and moved by this sanctuary...
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don’t know where to start in this review; to sum it up, I highly recommend Greg’s place for your stay. I booked this place in January of 2020 for a surprise engagement with my soon-to-be fiancé. Greg was in on the surprise the whole time and was very responsive to my thousand different questions. Unfortunately I had to move my reservation from the original date in April due to Covid, and Greg was so easy to work with the rescheduling. When we arrived in May, the place was immaculate. The views were amazing, and there wasn’t anyone around to intrude on our moment. I couldn’t have asked for a better location for an engagement, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking along those lines or for any other large or small event. This was my first time staying at an Air Bnb, and I think it’ll be a challenge for any future hosts to top the experience Greg gave us."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,Very Pretty home on a hill with a gorgeous view! Greg and Haylee were very communicative and gracious hosts. The house had everything our group needed- even down to an awesome restaurant grade coffee machine! 5 stars all around.
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place is adorable, clean, and has amazing views! Greg was a fantastic host - very communicative before and during our stay, making sure we had all of the information we needed and felt right at home. Would definitely return!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing view and very relaxing space. Would love to stay again!
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"We experienced a very enjoyable stay. It was clean and cozy with a beautiful view. The stars were incredible. It was a lovely retreat. Greg was a very responsive host. The only thing I would note was that the driveway was a little steeper and rougher terrain than we expected. We had no problem getting our vehicles up there. But we ended up not ordering an Uber because we feared the Uber wouldn't come up the driveway. Perhaps Uber has gone up in the past, and it would have with no problem. We just decided to drive ourselves to our destination. Overall, I would gladly stay here again."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful spot with nice accomodation for a large group. Make sure you go up prior to late at night, so youre familiar with how to get to location! Greg was very quick in communicating and was upfront with questions/issues!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay at this house! Greg is a great host. The house is a beautiful get away and great retreat spot. We will definitely be back!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough good about this place! It is spacious, beautifully decorated, and all of the furniture is so comfortable and the entire place was sparkling clean. The kitchen is fully furnished and anything you could want to make a family meal special is there for you. It was the most relaxing time any of us have had in a long time. As for the location, the views are indescribable and the night sky enthralled all of us. We didn't want to leave and can't wait to return. There was not one single downside to this wonderful property. Everyone in our party agreed it was someplace we would love to return to again and again."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We liked this place very much and we never seen such place before. Comfortable house on the top of the hill, surrounded by the forest. Everything was 5 of 5 points: cleanliness, amenteties, communication with hosts and so on, thank you, Greg."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place with a beautiful views. Would absolutely stay again!
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Nice place, friendly host, bathroom
Carpeted, 10/10"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Greg was an excellent host and had stellar communication. We were very pleased with the accommodations and Greg’s flexibility with our schedules.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Greg’s place was the perfect spot to stay while we were back in PA to attend a family event ! The home was spacious and the views were exceptional. First experience on Airbnb and it was a great one thanks to Greg.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being new to Air BnB we weren’t quite certain as to what to expect. However, I must say that we were absolutely thrilled with the accommodations that we selected for our very first stay utilizing Air BnB. The home was beautiful, extremely roomy, and exceptionally clean. The communication with our host Greg was unsurpassed. We highly recommend High Point!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,Greg was a wonderful host! The house is beautiful and thoughtfully decorated. The scenery from the top of the hill was stunning through all of the windows! We had enough room for our large group of people to comfortably get ready for our event the next day and also make some great food. Definitely a great place to stay!
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Phenomenal mountaintop views! Great place to go and unplug; easy access, yet feels very remote."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent house in a beautiful, secluded location that provides easy access to town."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Greg's place was the perfect spot for our family celebration! The space was warm and inviting, clean and comfortable. My family felt right at home and we had plenty of space to spread out! The house had everything we needed, my son even made a wonderful Mother's Day breakfast for me! Thanks so much, Greg and Hayley too!"
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! Spectacular views!
2019-04-01,5,Group trip,Exactly what I needed.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay! It was clean and they really thought of everything! Anything we forgot- we were able to find one here! They had everything needed for cooking and a lot of extra activities (such as games and cards). It was quiet and peaceful!
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg’s place was great! Incredible views and solid communication throughout.
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,I made a last-minute reservation at Greg’s place but sadly it had to be canceled due to weather conditions. I very much appreciated Greg’s immediate and thorough communication to me through the cancellation process.
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,Great quiet place to relax!
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,The space was so warm and welcoming. We absolutely loved the feeling of truly being in nature and just looking out in the morning while drinking our coffee. The home was gorgeous and it was a perfect place for our family to gather.

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely view of the valley. Big windows, lots of light."
2018-09-01,4,Group trip,Greg's place is just like you see. It was immaculate and had everything we needed for our group of friends. The views were spectacular and the house was beautiful! The only thing to be careful of is the steep road going up to the house and heed Greg's warning about shower use. We had the water go out on us for a few hours. It was a minor inconvenience but it was definitely still worth staying there. It was worth it just for the seclusion and amazing views and wildlife (saw a few deer)!! Thanks Greg for letting us stay in your beautiful home!
2018-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Greg's place is beautiful with breathtaking views and a spacious place to stay. There are amazing windows everywhere so can enjoy the outdoors. The house was decorated so nicely.

2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous location with lots of views of the valley below.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved this Airbnb. The log cabin style interior was breath taking. It is very open and perfect for entertainment.

2018-07-01,5,Group trip,It was a beautiful place to stay. The view is really nice and everything in the description is accurate.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house will amaze you. Wonderful bedrooms, master bath with jacuzzi and location, location. On top of a hill, alone, peaceful with gorgeous views. Kitchen was well stocked. Had big TV and great sound, lots of windows.
We were very pleased and wished we had more time to enjoy this gem!!
GO THERE!"
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house and yard. Greg's place is huge with tons of space both inside and outside of the house. We really enjoyed the fire pit and beautiful views. Excellent rural getaway. Would stay again and highly recommend this place to others.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I had a wonderful time staying here. It's a very relaxing and quiet location. The property and house are both beautiful; I look forward to the chance to stay here again!
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,Greg’s place is rustic and amazingly scenic. The views! We enjoyed a relaxing weekend exploring and an evening around the fire pit. We hope to return again!
2018-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin. Great location, with amazing views. Perfect for a weekend getaway with friends."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A unique space with more than enough room for everyone. Communication with the host was a cinch.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house has a remote feel, but is close to the IUP campus and activities. The amenities inside the home were fantastic. We will stay here again for sure."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect location for a wedding in Indiana.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, good communication"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highpointe is a fantastic western PA cottage hideaway. We've stayed here multiple times, for multiple events, and I would recommend it to ANYone with a desire for a private and beutiful getaway."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home on the hilltop. Great views, comfortable space, loved the peace and quiet, the stars at night, as well as the care in how the house is managed. We saw turkey, deer, groundhogs, and had wonderful restful evenings every night. Any time we visit Indiana, we'll be looking at this place first."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greg's place is a lovely retreat perched on a mountain top. The house has an open floor plan. It is clean and comfortable with a well equipped kitchen. The views of the Pennsylvania countryside are breathtaking. Greg and his family took great care to see to our comfort. For a quiet getaway this is the place to stay.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, great communication from the hosts. Very much worth every penny!"
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. Location was awesome. It sits high up on hills and the views are amazing. Plenty of space for 6 of us. Also great communication. Yes the road to get to house seems a little interesting but no worries trust me we easily drove up and down hill in a 12 passenger van with no issues. Would stay again
2017-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home that is very private and secluded. It is in a convenient location and is about 15 minutes away from IUP campus. There is a fully equipped kitchen and ample space to cook. We did have some communication issues with the host, but it was our fault and did not know the house rules would be so strict. We were there for a wrestling tournament and had invited the team that was staying at nearby hotels for dinners at the house. We didn't know you had to be a registered guest to be in the home. We talked to Greg after the visit and he was very approachable and worked with us to reach an understanding. He was also very generous and sent us belongings that were left in the home. Overall, a good experience."
2017-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall a great place to stay - responsive, helpful hosts; clean; has everything you need (linens, towels, shampoo/conditioner, soap, hair dryer, etc. - just like a hotel); and beautiful, beautiful setting. A few things to consider as you decide where to stay: 1) This property has 4 very comfortable sleeping areas, but none are fully enclosed. Also, all 4 are full of windows and very bright during the day. So, if you are traveling with toddlers or babies, it can be a bit challenging to find a secluded spot for them that will be conducive to napping and noise control. 2) This property is at the end of a steep, gravel driveway - if you are traveling in winter and expecting snow or ice, I would take this into consideration before booking again since I don't have an all-wheel or 4-wheel drive car (to be fair, neither did the host, so it may be entirely do-able to get up there in the snow, but its something I would talk to them about). As I said, however, overall a great experience and I would definitely stay here again."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! It was very relaxing and with a great view!
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description of the house was accurate and the views were amazing. The host was very accommodating and responsive. The house had everything we needed for the weekend and was very comfortable. We are looking forward to going back next year!
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly what I was looking for. It was very private and the view was beautiful. It is very clean and everything was provided including bed linens, guest towels and wi fi. Everything is exactly as described. Greg was great to communicate with and even gave some personalized directions to make it easier to find. We loved it there and would definitely go back."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our family of four did not get to stay long enough, but we found the house very comfortable and roomy. Could easily hold 8. Communication with Greg and his niece, Tori, was very easy. Check in very smooth.

The hill up to the cabin was quite a steep climb in our minivan, but that is how you get the beautiful view!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The room is quiet and the view is good too!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The place is gorgeous and the view is spectacular. We have already recommended it to friends.
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The was a wonderful Airbnb experience. The house was fantastic, on the top of a small hill with views all around. We enjoyed the large windows, large living space and well equipped kitchen. Communication with Greg was excellent. It was ideal for a mini family gathering halfway between NYC and Michigan."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Greg's place was beautiful. One of the best views of western PA I've seen in awhile. On top of that Greg was very helpful and accommodating. The place was very clean when we arrived and everything was exactly as advertised. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area again.
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Greg was great, gave detailed instructions and his place was clean and fun"
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely oasis for our family of four! Views were spectacular and it was much more spacious than anticipated. Although we spent little time there as we were in the area for a major fast pitch softball tournament for our daughter, it was a perfect place to make meals and relax between the 5 games she played in 24 hours. Clean and had everything we needed - including the washer and dryer. Would love to return, perhaps soon! Thanks again to Greg and his sister, Jennifer - both were responsive and the hospitality was wonderful!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely wonderful! Pictures really don't do it justice. I wish we had more time to spend here, but Greg and family really made us feel welcome for our short stay."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in the three level wilderness guest house along with a group of 7 other people prior to a graduation ceremony at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). The home was beautiful, peaceful and cozy! It's also literally 10-15 minutes away from IUP's campus. The hosts, Greg and Jennifer, were extremely helpful and accommodating. A member of our group accidentally broke a lamp in the living room during our stay; when I informed Jennifer, she told us not to worry about it and to enjoy our day! :-) How gracious of her?! Needless to say, I would highly recommend this home to anyone!"
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway on a private hilltop. This place was spectacular. Upon our arrival we were informed that there was a fresh jug of milk in the fridge and coffee in the cabinet for us. The family that owns it Greg, Jen, and Doug were absolutely fantastic to deal with. Unfortunately we were there for work and didn't really get to enjoy all relaxing elements of this place, however the steam shower was great after some long days at work. Don't let the fact that there is well water scare you. Unlike most places with well water you won't even know the difference it's that good. I Will definitely be back to relax. Thanks again Greg, Jen, & Doug."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. It is a cute small house that can sleep many people if needed. Tiffany is on top of communication. She gave us a gps address that took us right to the parking behind the house. The area felt safe and it was quiet and peaceful. We will definitely stay here again when in town.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very comfortable home and super friendly host.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Host was responsive to questions. Quaint home. Plenty of seating.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was clean, and the neighborhood was quiet, Tiffany was very responsive to our questions.
Having to park in the back on weekdays, with the long walk through the grass in the rain while carrying all our things, was about the only downside."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very welcoming place this was our first time ever in Airbnb and it was well worth coming back again to stay. Very sweet kind hosts. Thank you.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing visit to Tiffany’s lovely home. Tiffany was very responsive to my questions and had a genuine interest in us having a good stay. It was the PERFECT location for our visit to IUP and we will be back. Thank you for an awesome stay!
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"This house is cozy and a nice place to stay with the family for the weekend. There is 1 king, 1 queen, 2 full and 1 twin size bed. the upstairs room is super cute my daughter loved it up there. Tiffany responds quickly when messaging. She had everything we needed to make dinner for a night. The only downside to staying here is parking. You have to park in the back of the house on the other side of the backyard, so you have to walk through the grass to get to the house. when we got there it was wet and raining a little so the only shoes I brought were soaked before we even got inside. I wouldn't let this stop me from staying again but I would bring a different pair of shoes to walk in the wet grass. Overall it was a good stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I came into town for one night to visit family and to celebrate my grandmother's 99th birthday. After looking for a decent hotel with adjoining rooms for my family and I, I realized that it was going to be almost $300 for two hotel rooms. I decided to check to see if there were any smaller airbnbs that were priced better and came across this home. I wasn't looking for 5 star accommodations just some place that had enough beds and bedrooms for my family and I. This was the perfect little place just outside of town and worked for everything that we needed. well definitely keep it as an option next time I'm in town to visit!"

Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Tiffany's place was perfect for going to the Groundhog Day festival up in Punxsutawney - only about a 40 minute drive! Her house had everything my boyfriend and I needed for our short stay, and if a train went by, we never heard it. We loved the shower - great temperature control and water pressure."

Our dogs also had a very nice yard to stretch their legs in."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Every thing was very good. Our house we stayed at was an older home inside but very well kept up. We were only needing a place to stay for 2 nights. We were gone for most of the day so we never used anything in the house but was fully equipped to do so. A few blinds need replaced for appearance reasons but everything we needed was there for us.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for my friend & me (IUP alumni) to meet up for Homecoming weekend - it was sparkling clean, nicely decorated & within walking distance to campus, area restaurants & uptown.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Old but cute little house. Stairs to the second floor are pretty steep and could use a night light. Odd assortment of kitchenware. A fine value but nothing fancy.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always a good place to stay
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Property met our needs for our overnight stay. I would just say that the rear parking, there is no walkway which was a struggle wheeling bags across grass during rain. We did get a spot out front after dinner so that was good."
