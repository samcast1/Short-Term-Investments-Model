2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house! Great place to stay for a quick trip. House was just like the pictures and clean!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot near to a super fun and active area.
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"the pool was full of algae, bugs, and dirt. tried to clean it of and couldn’t. there was stain on everything outside and i cousins even sit down. the house smelled, the crosley and blinds were broke. the shower head was dirty and rusted. the hosts failed to respond to me when i sent them the pictures of the upsetting circumstances and tried to claim that i was lying even though i had pictures"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a quiet historic neighborhood near an elementary school. We asked that our elderly sister to be allowed to smoke in the back yard and were refused, so just beware that there is no wiggle room on their rules."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Completely worth it for the comfortable REAL beds, linens, blankets and pillows. Hands down the most comfortable beds - BOTH - I've come across using Air BnBs in over 5 years.
Location is great, had no idea that Gallo Blanco was open again which I hadn't dined at since they were at the Clarendon - so that was a great surprise and within walking distance. Amazing how the neighborhood has evolved over the past 20 years - for the better.
Private driveway parking was nice. The kitchen has everything, if I needed an extended stay, I wouldn't hesitate to book this place for a week as the kitchen will have everything you'll need, lots of condiments, spices, odds and ends too.
The air conditioning was ice cold and the ceiling fans were powerful, you NEED this during Phoenix summers. Any complaints I might have had are simply nit pics and not worth posting compared to the overall quality I experienced."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Cute, comfortable and just as the listing described. Would definitely return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay! The kids pool in the back yard was perfect for our kiddos and the house was cute and cozy! Will definitely stay again when we come back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely decorated house, super comfortable spaces with all the amenities one might need in a central location. Also easy communication with Dan and Fran. Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location, house and decor were lovely and what we needed. My complaints are that the outside gate doesn’t stay latched/closed (no communication about this) so my dog got out and we had a very stressful moment, luckily she came right back. Also the pool was really dirty so I only felt comfortable sticking my feet in. Not a fault of the owners, but the neighbors had a crazy loud party until 2 am (we even called the cops) so we got no sleep on our last night. Was disappointed that I got no response from the host when I messaged them these issues."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, kind host!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Cactus House was a great place to stay while in Phoenix. It was close to downtown and in a nice, quiet, and clean neighborhood. The restaurant recommendations provided by Dan and Fran were excellent. The home was exactly as described in the listing. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice place to stay with easy check in!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The house was clean and much like the listing. The pool was a little green so we didn’t go in.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable house in convenient location. We ate at two restaurants recommended by host that were very good.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Comfy beds and felt very cozy. We are not to picky but the bathroom drain needs to be fixed. Every time we took a bath the water would not drain fast, causing it to have about 4in of water in the tub. Also, we were going to use the extra comforters but they were dirty, luckily the ones already on the bed weren’t . Overall we saw past that and enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay in for a few days!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a short stay, but the place was great. Clean, comfortable, exactly as advertised and walking distance to tasty restaurant options. Dan and Fran communicated everything we needed and we had no issues."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute place! We were happy at how easy it was to get to from the airport! The kitchen was well stocked...spices, tea, condiments, etc. We'd recommend."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Cactus Cottage. The decor and design of the house was really cute and a big reason we were drawn to it. Our kids loved the games and we loved relaxing in the backyard. There were a few things needing maintenance around the house, but the hosts were super kind. They responded right away when we had an issue and were willing to help. We also appreciated the recommendations for places to visit in the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in a great location. Only 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix, 20 minutes to Scottsdale, and 20 minutes to Tempe. It was nice staying in a home just a bit outside of the city so not to deal with any city traffic. The first thing we noticed when walking in were all the details. We loved the aesthetic of the cactus house and all the decor inside. We especially loved the biñho board and it was our first time playing this game. We had so much fun playing once we got home we had to order our own. If I ever visit Phoenix again I would definitely stay at Dan and Fran’s. Not to mention all their dog friendly additives like the treats, bowls, and poop bags. Made us wish we brought our dogs."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dan and Frans place was centrally located and had the comforts of home. It was a cute
little spot for us to stay while we had an early Thanksgiving celebration.
The living room was a great place to hang out, even had a few games and a record player. The kitchen had just about everything we needed to cook the big meal and plenty of dishes to serve it on.

The place itself suited our needs fine. Comfy bed. Tastefully decorated. Everything we could need was there for us.
Phoenix would not be a choice destination for us, we were there for a business conference, but being able to come home to my dogs was everything!
Thanks so much Dan & Fran!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"October 2023
We really enjoyed our stay at the Cactus Cottage... The kitchen was pretty well stocked with basic items such as seasonings, oil, pots, pans, and utensils. The beds were comfortable. However, the pillows could have been a little bit more firm. The temperature in the home maintained a comfortable temperature. there were a couple of cobwebs we cleaned by the table in the kitchen, but maybe it was there for 🎃 vibes. Our grandson really enjoyed the tank pool. The neighborhood was walkable. We walked to the Welcome Diner for breakfast and walked over to Xanadu for coffee.. We even ventured over to Roosevelt Row... And even met a neighbor near to the property..."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dan and Fran’s place was the cutest little cactus cottage. Very nicely decorated, super clean, and dog friendly!! We loved their backyard and the sweet treats they left us for our pups. The neighborhood surprised us a bit, as the cactus cottage is definitely one of the nicer houses on the streets, but it’s a pretty quick drive to restaurants and the freeway! We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful home in a great location. It’s a good combination of being close to downtown while the neighborhood itself is quiet / peaceful.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The host was absolutly amazing! We wanted to check in early and they were so fast to respond and allow us to check in. The home was filled with plants and had such a great vibe! The neighborhood was very nice and had that historic feel to it which is always fun. Super close to stores and food places. Thanks for such a great stay and a wonderful home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I used this Air BnB as a landing spot - so wasn't here much. The place was lovely, I'm not sure as a single woman that I would have walked around at night - and there was some noise from the city that is clearly included in the description - but the space was comfy. I felt safe. I was sorry it wasn't warm enough to go in the pool. The kitchen had everything that I needed. It might be noted that the washer and dryer are outside - under cover and worked fine. Dan and Fran were super responsive and went out of their way to be helpful I see why they are ""super hosts""."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at the cactus house! We were in town for a Suns game. Only took a few min to get to the stadium. Great location, nice little house!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and had games and a small pool.
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay at Dan and Frans went well until our last night when we went to enter the home and the door keypad had lost power and wouldn’t unlock. I had tried contacting Dan and Fran that night but it was late and ultimately we had to get a hotel room for the night. In the morning we eventually made it into the Airbnb after some minor miscommunication with the lock box codes. That morning we checked out and I got an apology from Dan and Fran. They offered to compensate for the last night but I asked for them to compensate for the hotel room instead and I would just pay the total rental charge amount. They refused and only offered me compensation for the one night stay and some of the cleaning fee. The place was nice but after this I’d recommend staying elsewhere to avoid any inconvenience.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute bnb for our quick stay in Phoenix. It does allow pets so there was definitely a lingering odor of dog food but the place was very clean. Was told by a few Uber drivers to be aware of our surroundings in the area but we never felt unsafe (though we didn’t walk around at night).
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dan and Fran are amazing hosts! We hope to stay in their home again in the near future! Home was adorable, clean, and comfortable! Thanks again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little house! Close to the arts district, museums and lots of good restaurants!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying at the Cactus Cottage and definitely not our last. Fran and Dan were excellent hosts (again) and even made our dog feel like a valued guest with a little tray of treats, dog toys and even poop bags. The home was spotless and had a nice hot shower. We loved that the house was walking distance to the new restaurant we saw featured on Netflix, called Tratto. We had a fabulous meal and came back to the cottage and plaid the cactus themed card game which rounded out our perfect stay. The back patio was lovely too, we will be back again. Thanks Fran and Dan!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was simple and beautiful. I had a very restful stay there and enjoyed a lot of the area. Just my style.

For us"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan and Fran were super friendly and made our stay easy! The house was very cute, loved the green door! Thanks for having us!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Well decorated house and as it was expected to look like. The beds were comfortable and the backyard was a perfect place to have a family barbecue.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was in a perfect location, near downtown Phoenix and near by many restaurants and coffee shops. The house was equipped with everything you might need."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome- I hope 2visit again ntha Spring.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very responsive when I asked about turning up the thermostat.
The shower water temperature was luke warm and could not be adjusted.
Comfy beds and couch! Super cute decor."
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have to be honest because I would love to know things before I stay somewhere. The place was very nice and clean. Dan was great with communicating and coming to the house to try and make things right. That being said my stay was not comfortable at all. I checked out a day before my checkout date because we weee so uncomfortable. First thing, my husband and I got bit up my mosquitoes, we killed like 4 of them. We did bring this issue up with Dan and he said the house hasn’t had any issues with them and Phoenix was prone to mosquitoes. I am in Town for business at least 2 weeks out of the month and never had any issues with mosquitoes. We just dealt with them. Second thing was the shower. The water does not get hot in the shower at all! You will get barely warm at best. All sinks get super hot. This was a deal breaker for me. I did message Dan and he came over and turned up the water heater, but when we showered that night it was literally no difference. I ended up sick taking cold showers. The night before we left I boiled hot water and took a bath just to get some kind of warmth. I felt like this was not real, but it was happening because I had no choice. I tried to thug it out, and I did for the most part but we just couldn’t take it anymore. If you are ok with cold showers and barely warm showers this place is perfect! No other complaints at all. Beautiful place, but was just so uncomfortable."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying here. The decor, games etc were fun and the house is clean and beautiful.
The place was not ready for us by the time we checked in. We came back again after leaving our bags at the Airbnb.
Also the listing is misguiding. It says 6 guests, 3 beds but, there were two beds and a blow up mattress. The space is small to blow up the mattress and use it. We felt a bit misguided by the listing because the blow up mattress was not mentioned."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dan and Fran's place was great! Everything was just as described and they were extremely helpful and communicated well. Would stay there again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The bnb was perfect, with the location being outstanding as it was both close to the airport and city centre. Dan and Fran provided everything we needed and responded quite promptly. The house itself was beautiful and we appreciated both the decor and the different spaces. Overall fantastic Airbnb, and we will definitely be staying in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked this house for my parents and daughter. They loved everything about this place. My mom loved the ambience and decor and asked me to recreate it at her house haha.

Definitely booking again for a weekend getaway for myself!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. Thank you for making us feel so welcome. The house was in a perfection location with lots to do all around it. We were just minutes from the Herd Museum, Botanical Gardens, airport and many other interesting places. A good day trip to the Grand Canyon will leave you speechless and this house is a comfortable place to come home to reflect on the wonders. My daughter loved your home and now wants to move to Phoenix. Thank you again for allowing us to rest our heads at your beautiful home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for my friend and I! We were visiting for business so we didn’t spend much time at the property but wish we could have spent more!

Great Home."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying here! The location is great and the neighborhood is very quiet. The house was very clean. Lots of nice touches that felt like you were in a nice home rather than a sterile Airbnb. Really appreciated the fast communication as well. A huge bonus was that the property is dog friendly. It's sometimes really hard to find a nice dog friendly place and they went above and beyond.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was EXTREMELY clean. Check-in was very smooth. Fully stocked kitchen, fast wifi, comfy beds, and the location could not be beaten. We walked to a super Mexican Restaurant just down the street for dinner and it was the best margarita I have ever had. I thought the pool was going to be really small but it was actually very roomy and perfect for us to hang in and enjoy a nightcap. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the back deck and the fact that they provided great coffee and creamer for us was a huge plus. We will definitely be back."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place worked out great for us. Arrived overnight & left overnight, so the keyless entry worked great. Central location worked well. We also wanted to separate rooms so if someone is awake when the other is sleeping, they can watch TV or read with light on. Need to get one more inexpensive mirror for when two people are getting ready at once. Otherwise, place worked great for us, we would stay there again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect Location for anything downtown Phoenix. We stayed here because of a conference at Phoenix Convention Center and it was only like a 8 minute drive. Grocery and lots of restaurants close by! Easy access to highway. The house itself is small but perfect and cozy for two people. We each had our own bedroom and bathroom on each side of the house for privacy. Comfy beds and great kitchen. There is a small little backyard with privacy from the neighbors to enjoy the heat! Easy access to park right in front of the house. Overall, great stay and would choose again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our one night stay. Would have no trouble spending a week here. The house is well equipped and very comfortable.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful modern decorated home. The place was spotless, central located, quiet neighborhood. Easy to check in and super comfortable. I would certainly book again with Lisa when I visit Phoenix. Thabk you for having us in your beautiful property."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed one night and had to leave early to catch a flight. The house was very comfortable and we would love to come back and spend more time there. It was very close to the Heard museum and a Peruvian restaurant we enjoyed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute place! We were only there about 15 hours. Just a quick place to sleep before the airport early in the morning. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the house.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in downtown Phoenix. A perfect space for two couples.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lisa and Wayne’s place was really adorable. We were there for only one night, but would have loved to stay longer. They had everything we needed in terms of amenities as well as for cooking (olive oil, spices, etc). Instructions were clear and their communication was quick. We recommend this place to anyone and would happily stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Came down for a weekend of spring training. good location to the parks we visited.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really the Platonic Ideal of the AirBnB. In the heat and clutter of a big dusty city, here is a minimalist clean white space with everything we needed and nothing we didn't need. My sister and her husband had one bedroom & bath, my wife & I took the other. We're all kind of fussy & picky people. But we were stoked! We had our own private spaces plus a roomy common space to share. Well-stocked kitchen, private tiny yard with a fruiting lemon tree, silent neighborhood, walked to the grocery store, to a gorgeous park surrounding the Heard Museum, to the Vietnamese restaurant across the street from the Thai restaurant. We even liked the crazy cat guy down the street: cats looked healthy, and he was pleasant to us. Highest possible recommendation."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very comfortable stay. clean. beautiful, just like the photos. would stay here again."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for one night and it was very clean and beautifully decorated. It’s also a close drive to the airport. Our only complaint was that is was so hot inside and we weren’t allowed to lower the temperature below 70 degrees and the fan supplied to us, was broken. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can only say that this home is charming. The decorations were well chosen, the kitchen very well stocked with equipment, and the beds were comfortable. Even though it was a small space, it was just perfect for 2 couples. The living room was great for hanging out & the bedrooms far enough apart that you didn't feel right on top of each other. The location is easy access to downtown & the 10 Freeway. There isn't much of a backyard but I would highly recommend this house if you don't mind being indoors."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic location for us as we landed after midnight when we arrived in Phoenix. The home was immaculate and updated. We grabbed breakfast at Ollie Vaughn’s before we headed on our way. Thanks for having us!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great trip to Phoenix and Scottsdale due to staying in this Airbnb. It’s the perfect size and is great for two couples as they are private bathrooms for each. The house is well decorated, well kept and safe. We all said that if we were ever coming back, we would immediately stay in this Airbnb again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay in Phoenix, very centric and close to everything; specially to the airport! The place is not that big but is perfect on size. Very comfortable and just as the pictures!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Lisa and Wayne’s place. The house was spotless and the beds were very comfortable.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for our long weekend stay. Plenty of space for two couples/4 people. Short drive to everything we wanted to do.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place. Extremely clean and great communication from the hosts. Would stay again :)
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the property was quite pleasant overall, but there were a few areas that could be improved. The space was trendy and well-furnished, albeit a bit smaller than anticipated. While the neighborhood was peaceful, the surrounding scenery wasn't particularly remarkable. A notable issue we encountered was the presence of dog hair throughout the accommodation. Unfortunately, my wife is allergic to dog hair, and this significantly impacted her comfort and health during our stay. Despite our efforts to clean up, she was unwell for most of our visit. Additionally, having only one TV for all guests proved to be a bit inconvenient. In our experience with short-term rentals, multiple TVs are standard, and it would be a beneficial upgrade for future guests. We suggest that the owners consider addressing these points to enhance the experience for subsequent visitors."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place would stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, just like the photos, tidy, very good bathrooms, new and clean, very comfortable rooms, spacious"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything exactly the way described.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Wayne are pros. Book it. You will not be disappointed. The location is central, equally convenient as the upscale downtown hotels for a fraction of the cost.
The difference is instead of one hotel room you get a spacious two bedrooms, 2 full baths, living room, kitchen with large kitchen bar work space & thoughtful designer decor. You will feel good immediately upon entering."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stunning place. Was only in town for one night before flying back home but this was a wonderful place to rest our heads at the end of a week long Arizona trip!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, had lots of thoughtful things, like hand lotion in the bathrooms and filter water in the fridge!
I definitely would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Wayne’s place was very cute and a perfect location. The neighborhood was cute and we felt safe during our stay. The beds were comfortable. The Nespresso machine was a great touch. The bathrooms had soap, shampoo and conditioner as well as a small hair dryer. The only thing we didn’t care for was the shower design with only half glass. It looks cool, but no matter how careful you are water gets on the floor. Also, because the house is older and has beautiful wood flooring it creaks when you walk, only an issue if you are a light sleeper and someone else gets up. Otherwise great stay. During our stay the smoke detector started chirping due to a low battery in the morning. Lisa and Wayne were very fast to fix the issue and respond. It was fixed by the time we returned after our outing. Great stay."

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was good, the check in/ check out process was seamless. The house lacked some cleanliness for example one of the kitchen pans wasn’t clean and nobody seemed to check the bedroom drawers when guests leave. At the time of our stay the AC was not working. It was heating instead of cooling so we left it off and opened windows/doors to ventilate."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is perfect for traveling pairs, couples, family who needs two separate bedrooms and bathrooms. It was central to all the locations I wanted to see while in town, and walkable to a few local restaurants and a small corner grocery. Downside is Uber prices are $$ at certain parts of the day. The place was clean, furnished and stocked well. Love the washer/dryer availability. Hosts were super responsive and gave great local recommendations.
PS… The Coronado is DELISH."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment was really beautiful. It was incredibly clean and well decorated. Street parking was easy, right outside the house. Neighborhood was cute and felt safe, a lot of people walking their dogs or taking a stroll with their kids in the evening. A few minutes drive from the city. You get in via an electronic keypad that was easy to operate, and the thermostat was also easy to change. Both beds were comfortable, on opposite sides of the living room so there is also some privacy if traveling with a group. I wish we could have stayed longer!"

I highly recommend this space for couples and small families who want to be centralized to the city."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friend and I stayed here for one night for an event that was taking place nearby. The neighborhood was quiet yet conveniently located. It happened to be within walking distance of at least 4 vegan/vegetarian eateries, which was a major plus for me! It was very clean and appealing. We loved the kitchen (although didn't get a chance to use it), and thought it very convenient that a washer and dryer were available. This house is nicely renovated/decorated (although not vegan, as you can probably tell by the photos) and felt cozy and welcoming. It was very clean and appealing. The showers had hot water and good water pressure, and there were clean/green personal care products available. Check in and checkout were effortless. I would love to stay here again if I am in the area."

It is located close to downtown and restaurants. We will choose this place in the future!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To be honest, I will use this place again if possible. It is close to downtown and highways. However, the surrounding neighborhood is a little concerning. Just want people to be aware of this and make sure you bring all belongings inside with you. That's pretty much the case in any major metropolitan area anyway. The house is very nice, comfortable and we actually enjoyed the small backyard area to sit outside a bit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located to everything we needed. Clean, spacious atmosphere."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice, clean, well maintained space. Perfect for me and my little family for the couple of days we needed to stay. Great location and super walkable to cute restaurants and coffee shops. Great value…Would love to stay again."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would recommend this property to all my friends and family that come to visit. reasonably priced and available last minute at 7pm with super easy self access to the property. My A/C went down for a couple days and reached out to the host to see if property was available last minute and within minutes the host responded. What a great experience!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful and clean. I love how there are sunlight coming in. My husband, on the other hand, complains how outside can see everything inside and how the light wakes him up in the morning. I guess, it depends if you like the sun. Everything you need are there. Thanks the host for stocking up amenities. One of the household rule is to keep the AC at a certain degree, which was fine for me. For other like my husband who aren't used to Phoenix heat may need to reconsider. Overall, I like this place. For a 2BR2B, it's a reasonable price. We stayed for two nights. I would stay here again, but asking my husband to use that squeegee as requested in the household rule is pain. Maybe if they change that request."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place! Courtyard in back was definitely an added benefit!

We will definitely be back to your place!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As others said, pictures did not do it justice. This home was super CLEAN and new. Especially loved the private patio and grill outside.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Airbnb! I stayed here for a work trip. Had to travel to different areas and so it was more convenient to be outside of the city. The Peoria casita was perfect! Surrounding area is beautiful. It was peaceful, safe, and the accommodations themselves were high quality! The Peoria Casita is beautiful! Will definitely stay here again! My only regret was not being able to enjoy the casita as much as I would have liked as I was out and about for working meetings most of the time. Highly recommend!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pristine and beautifully decorated. Everything was spotless. They have new furniture throughout. It felt like a true home with the kitchen fully stocked with cookware and a new washer and dryer. It was only a few minutes to major grocery stores and restaurants Sunsets and sunrises were outstanding, the kind you see in calendars of AZ . Really lovely place. Highly recommended."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was spectacular! It was located a little off the main roads which was very good because it was so quiet at night! There wasn’t any highway noises or anything. Even though it was still in the middle of a new area of construction; the house was cozy and comfortable- definetely recommend people to stay here!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was close by our family that we were visiting. Surrounded by beautiful houses and hills. The hosts were very nice as well. I would definitely stay there again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the nicest places I’ve stayed in AZ, would definitely book again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Peoria casita was the ideal location for our family of four! The casita is located on in a quiet residential area, but only minutes from the grocery store, restaurants, and some local shops. The home was pristine; felt like new and very clean. It looked exactly like the photos online. We loved having a full kitchen and separate living space and even made use of the small yard with the kids during the day. Loved having laundry onsite as well! While the living room is certainly large enough for a pull-out if the owners ever consider it, the blow-up mattress was king-sized, comfortable and easy to use. We could have used some extra pillows since some of us sleep with more than one, and a few extra towels/wash cloths. We feel so lucky to have found this incredible house and hope to be back on our next visit!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went out of state for a funeral and when I was looking for an air bnb the only thing I was concerned about was how far it would be from the cemetery. This listing was highly rated and I was very surprised with how spacious it was once I arrived. It was very private and extremely clean. They had things like cotton swabs and cotton balls available which I thought was a nice touch to make us feel at home. The washer and dryer was in the room and I thought it would be loud but I just closed the door to the linen closet and I was able to sleep peacefully at night while doing my laundry. I highly recommend this air bnb. When I come back to Arizona I will book here again. The hosts were extremely helpful and kept checking in to make sure I was enjoying my stay. Considering the circumstances, I really did enjoy my time here."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay at Leslie’s place. The casita is very nice. It was very clean and nice and private.

I would definitely stay there again on future visits.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Leslie’s place was wonderful! It was comfortable and we felt right at home. We have small children and our toddler loved going out on the patio and I loved he could go out and have a safe and secure area to play. The house is brand new so everything was sparking. There is new home construction going on all around the house but it was never a problem. I wish we could have stayed longer!

Very responsive and offers great check in/check out times. We enjoyed the spa-like scents provided in the home. It was the perfect “nest” to rest and rejuvenate in after a week of hiking. A beautiful couple’s getaway for sure, and the second bedroom/bath provides an additional private space."

Everything was amazing… even down to the towels!
The views (day and night) were mesmerizing!

I cannot wait to stay again.
THANK YOUUUUUUU!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t have the words to fully describe The Nest ! It was the perfect getaway resort for just my husband and I. It was exactly like the pictures but oh so much more than we could have ever imagined. Very intimate, peaceful, and breathtaking. While we did explore, we were truly ok with just staying at the house and hanging out with one another. Thank you so much Carla for creating this beautiful space. I also thank you for being so easy to book with. I’ll never forget this AirBNB experience!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly the pictures don’t do it justice! Very beautiful home and such an amazing view of Phoenix!
Will definitely be coming back in the future!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The 360 views are worth the ticket price. Everything is very clean like you would find at any 5 star resort. This is a hidden gem. A little piece of heaven.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far the coolest Airbnb I've ever been in. Carla was fantastic, and her home is very special. You must check it out."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Nest exceeded our expectations! The pictures make it look amazing, but they don’t do it justice. Not only is the house clean, but there has been so much thought put into details. If you forgot to pack something it’s there! The fresh flowers were such a nice unexpected addition! We would love a trip back to Phoenix just to stay at the Nest to relax. Carla is extremely responsive. Don’t look any further. Book now!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a little slice of heaven!!! The view is breathtaking and the space is perfectly comfortable and chic. Carla is very responsive and gracious. I will definitely be returning.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest is a real gem, as is the host. I would highly recommend this place for a couple or a single traveler. Just fantastic all the way around!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was absolutely fabulous! We had looked at different hotels and airbnbs but nothing spoke to us like Carla’s place. As a former Phoenix resident, this was a wonderful new experience. If you are looking for something more special than a hotel or a regular house, this is what I would suggest. The only trouble we ran into was the hot tub was not working for our stay. Carla was very gracious and bought us dinner for the inconvenience. I will be recommending the Nest to my anyone visiting Phoenix and I will definitely be looking to stay here on my next trip back!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely beautiful. Amazing what you feel just sitting in the living room or the pristine hot tub or the very cozy bedroom 360° views all the way! Thanks Carla! You did not disappoint. We will be back soon!

I am definitely planning on staying here again. They have a system where old renters leave food and/or drinks that they don't use, for future tenants to enjoy so it doesn't go to waste! The fridge was clean and there is a hilarious guest book! Lots of fun!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla was a great host. She answered us very quickly on any questions we had. We absolutely loved the nest it was so beautiful and the views were amazing.

My only complaint… our stay was over too soon! We will definitely be back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The nest was just as amazing as advertised. Gorgeous views of the sunrise & sunset, very comfortable bed/sleeping area, clean home, and Carla provided some great amenities. This was one of the coolest Airbnb’s we have ever stayed at and we will definitely look to stay here again next time we visit the Phoenix area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The abundance of 5 star reviews tells you all you need to know…Book it! And add an extra day because you will not want to leave. If peace can be found in a city, it’s right here, above it all. The view is sooo picturesque that it inspired us to be early birds for those few days we were here just to get the soonest glimpse. With a cup of tea in hand, we woke up everyday to a magnificent sunrise peaking out from behind the mountains. It was simply incredible. Though there was peace to be had, you could also find the city life not too far of a drive. The home was clean, the wifi strong, the bed/pillows comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked. So if you’re looking for serenity with the option to go out for a good time, book here. If I’m ever back in Phoenix, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. I hope that you who are reading this gets to experience it for yourself. It’s special. Thank you Carla for sharing your home with us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unbelievable view & perfect amenities

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awsome place and one of the most unique in all of phx. You will not find anything like this. Views are incredible and the hot tub is the icing on the cake. Very well stocked and had everything you need and more. Cara was super friendly, responsive, and a great host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest was an awesome experience! The views are amazing. I would highly recommend this place. Carla was very responsive and accommodating!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! Would recommend to anyone who wants to see phoenix with amazing views! Thoroughly enjoyed the “NEST”. Will definitely stay the next time we are in the area! Carla is a fantastic host!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique property amd a fun experience.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Nest was everything we could have asked for and more. The 360 views were amazing. We loved the house so much we didn’t want to leave and decided to cook dinner at the nest both nights. The kitchen had everything we needed. It truly was a wonderful time. The bed was very comfortable and the hot tub was the icing on the cake. Best Airbnb stay yet.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This place is so cool! Carla went above and beyond with her communication. The Nest is a really unique and beautiful place to stay if traveling through Phoneix. I have stayed at lots of AirBnBs and I have to say The Nest is my favorite! Every detail was thought of and the place is so unique, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning views from this one of a kind Airbnb. Such a peaceful home with so many great spots to sit and enjoy the sunset or fresh air. Bed was also really comfortable. Highly recommend this stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There are some Airbnb’s that you stay in because you need a clean place to stay…
Then there are other Airbnb’s that you stay in because you want a break from the monotony of everyday life and have an extraordinary experience of being alive.
Carla’s place would definitely be the ladder.
To say this place is magical would be an understatement…
The experience of having a glass of wine while overlooking the aerial views of Phoenix as the sun sets is something you and your significant other will never forget.
The pictures don’t deliver on half of what you’ll feel when you stay here. It’s extremely clean, modern and well thought out.
You’ll be impressed with the fine details that have be laid out in every corner of the home.
If you want the experience or being alive don’t look at any other properties, this is the “one” you’ve been looking for.
And because you’ve read this entire review this is the sign that you need to book now before someone else does.
Enjoy"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was hesitant to book with Airbnb again after my last horrendous experience but I’m so happy I took a chance on The Nest! Carla was very responsive and helpful with instructions on how to drive up the driveway and get in the house. The view is immaculate! Everything was clean and she even had snacks set out. The hot tub was warm and ready. Carla even had ramen noodle cups in the cabinet! I can’t recommend The Nest enough and I don’t usually stay at the same place twice but I would definitely come back here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful views…. They rivaled a $4 million home that I just sold within a mile of this home…. Thanks Carla

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay and wonderful host. Of course everyone coming to the Nest is there for the views and it won’t disappoint! But the whole place was excellent. The living area was comfy, the bedroom was peaceful, the bathroom was clean, the kitchen was super handy. One con: I got addicted to the Nespresso machine and had to order one for myself! Thanks a lot Carla!! The steep driveway was not nearly as scary as I thought it was going to be and parking and turning around were really easy. Incredibly thoughtful touches like menus to local restaurants that can deliver to a nest and the numbers for local massage people. Can’t recommend enough and can’t wait to come back!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t even reflect the absolute awe of this destination. Nor do they show all of the minor-detailed accommodations. Things like a makeup mirror in the shower, cabinets full of spices, and a little note on instructions for something will show up before I even thought to ask! Couldn’t have asked for a better place to relax and rejuvenate.
(And yes, the views ARE that gorgeous!)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!
Incredible view of the whole valley, with beautiful sunrises and sunsets! The Nest is such a high-end and trendy place, but yet completely comfortable like home. The furnishing are hi-end, and the decorations are unique, creative and oh so trendy! Loved the kitchen ceiling light, the keg light over the sink, and the shelving unit under the bedroom TV is so swank!
The couch is extremely comfortable and reclines on both ends. It’s a toss up as to whether the couch or the bed is more comfortable!
We had breakfast on the deck every morning and enjoyed relaxing in the amazing jacuzzi in the evenings.
Carla is an exceptional host and responded immediately to all of our inquiries!! Her pride in The Nest is evident in the way she communicates with you! 5+ Star host all the way!
We look forward to returning to The Nest the next time we are in the Phoenix area! This is our #1 place to stay now! Loved it!"

You will find a unique, calming experience at the “Nest” where you will be 15 minutes to Scottsdale and 15 minutes to downtown Phoenix.
Besides all the restaurant in Scottsdale we found a new Greek Mediterranean restaurant a few blocks away called The Palms Mediterranean on 12th at Northern that we did take out - yummy. Delivery is also an option.
Carla was a great host, responsive when you have a question and invisible when you want your privacy.
We will return. Vin & Kate Deschamps"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla’s home was spotless. Incredible views. Great hot tub. Loved our stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a magical location I was in awe the whole time we were there. Loved every minute of it.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla was everything one would want. She was available and responsive in regards to the few questions i had. And the place was exactly as advertised
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely amazing. Stayed here after my wedding and the place was great for two people to just enjoy a weekend together. The views were insane and most definitely a unique experience. The hot tub on the deck was incredible and there’s a little hidden fireplace area that was cool. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved ‘the nest.’ It was even more stunning than the photos. Everything was spotless with awesome amenities. Carla was responsive and quick to give suggestions.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very very cool spot. Unique perspective from the nest. Look forward to a return trip one day.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are so glad we chose The Nest among all our options. One of the best airbnbs we have experienced!
Perfect for two, this cool place is all about the view. Besides that though the house is clean, comfortable and very well stocked. Of course we loved the hot tub at night with all the city lights below. Carla was a most helpful host to us for our first time in Phoenix!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice. It well kept and very clean. It’s also in a very peaceful and private area. It’s the perfect getaway for two! Carla also was an amazing host. She was very responsive and went out of her to give us a breakfast recommendation called, “Luci’s Orchid” which was great! And she even put out little happy birthday snacks for when we first arrived. This place is a 10 out of 10 and we would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll start with wow and finish with wow. This is more of an experience than lodging. The view is outstanding. The hot tub with the city lights below and the stars above make you not want to go to bed. The bed is wonderful too by the way! Attention has been paid to details like lots of towels, a well supplied kitchen, and instructions on anything that needs them (even the guitars hanging on the wall were in tune😬). The driveway is fun with just the right amount of scariness. The location is easy driving (within 20 min.)to all the best sights and lots of great restaurants. We would love to hang out here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this absolutely beautiful home with amazing views to celebrate my wife’s 50th Bday. Carla even decorated the home with birthday wishes & balloons to help surprise her upon our arrival. Will definitely book again for future visits!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful airbnb. The view is spectacular and the amenities make it feel very cozy.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The reviews that have been left are absolutely true! What an amazingly lovely place. My only question is when can i book again. The view from tbe hottub and the bed were out of this world!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Everything in the description was accurate. A perfect place to go for a private getaway.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm late to do this review because, quite honestly, I have not yet acclimated back to ""real life"". I stayed at Carla's place solo, my first Mom retreat, and it was everything I needed. Her place is magic! I was so sad to leave. Carla's home is gorgeous from every angle, and you feel at peqce from the moment you walk in. The views are breathtaking, and you feel like you are in your own private castle. the hot tub is especially fantastic. The bed was one, if not the, most comfortable I've ever slept in, to the point where I actually asked where she bought it! I have recommended this home to many friends already. It is the absolute perfect escape for a couple or, like me, a solo (and successful) reset mission. Thank you, Carla! My return trip is in the works!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was worth the investment. Seeing the Phoenix skyline, the sunset and sunrise. It's very serene being on top of the world. I really appreciated all the accommodations from the robes, to the reclining love seat to the hot tub. This is a place I'll probably stay at at least once a year for a Staycation."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to spend a honeymoon or anniversary. Views of the city at both night and sunrise were amazing! Hot tub was very clean and plenty of towels, linens and kitchen ware to use. My wife asked if we can come every year on our Anniversary going forward!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful space, perfect for a couples staycation. The home was perfectly clean and the space is designed beautifully! the views are truly stunning and the hot tub and fire pit were amazing bonuses. We enjoyed our Christmas weekend here and can't wait to return again in the future! Thanks for sharing this beautiful space"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest was a perfect little getaway. It’s got everything you need to spend a weekend or a month. Incredibly beautiful views of mountains during the day and of the city lights at night. Situated on the very top of the hill and with large windows on every wall the 360 degree views are spectacular. I’d love to visit again as we didn’t get to try the jacuzzi or the secluded fire pit. We loved our stay and highly recommend a stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing experience. It's so beautiful. I was too afraid to drive up the steep driveway but Carla helped me through it. It's so impressive all the work they put into this place. Memorable experience! I love the telescope. Just do it! You won't be disappointed
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible spot and the perfect getaway
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla’s Place is an experience in its own with the drive up to the beautiful 360 views. I took my gf here a couple years ago and now I took her back here to surprise her with a proposal. Carla was more then helpful and accommodating assisting me as much as she could with recommendations and the home home was clean and had everything you would need for your stay. Thank you again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here and that says something. Perfect for honeymoon, anniversary , any romantic trip or alone!! Cannot match the view anywhere in Phoenix. I would stay the entire year if I could !!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful getaway. Would love to return on my next trip back to Phoenix. And the hostess was wonderful, very responsive. Thank you for hosting us !"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could I would give this place at least 6, maybe 7 stars. I am a local to Phoenix but wanted to find a staycation spot for my girlfriend's birthday that was private and had great views. I for sure made the right decision with this place. You can see every corner of the valley from the ""Nest"", sunrise and sunset are incredible!! If you are on the fence with a few places just book this one, you won't have any regrets. You'll mostly be looking at the great exterior views but inside is beautifully designed and has your convivence in mind. Carla was an amazing host and went above and beyond. It's a little pricey but in the end you will make priceless memories, it's worth it, just do it!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla's home exceeded expectations all around. Unique place and location. Everything you needed was provided. Extremely relaxing, especially after 6 days hiking around Arizona. Fantastic sunsets on the deck that seemed to last for hours. Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,best view in town
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Nest is truly unique and makes you feel like you live in a millionaire's penthouse! The drive up is worth the view! My husband and I can not believe we were able to stay at a one of a kind place and we hope to come back just for the bnb. Carla is very communicative and answered all of our questions. We can not recommend this stay enough!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A new unique original experience brought to life by the owner Carla. This place is enchanting and will make your spirit soar, it stimulates the senses to create lasting memories. Carla is dedicated to authenticity in design and has created an index of time & space, a place of rebirth, which she calls the nest. I highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla’s place has a trifecta of breathtaking location, stunning architecture and meticulous attention to detail. Hands down one of the best AirBnBs we stayed at. Carla was clear and open in communication. The space is utilized to perfection, and the house has many perks to lounge outside, stargaze, or do a BBQ. Jacuzzi is amazing. You indeed feel like you are on top of the world, surrounded by the beautiful scenery. Beautiful, romantic, and exquisite stay! Thank you, Carla!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view is stunning! I’m so glad I chose the Nest over any nearby resort. Sublime spot.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views. Great location. Can’t wait to stay again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, I would definitely stay here again! It looked exactly like the pictures, the morning sunrise and sunset were amazing to watch with the 360 views. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The only thing to be aware of is the driveway is very steep and a little hard for Uber/Lyft to find."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carla was an incredible host. She was very responsive even when I was trying to book last minute at the tail end of a business trip. Staying here is an experience! It was the perfect way to end my trip after a long week of meetings to relax and decompress a bit. She has thought of every detail and anticipates the guests needs. Grateful to find this gem and appreciative of her hospitality. I highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carla went above and beyond when putting together this space for sure. It had everything I needed (cookware, snacks, condiments, oils, TP, paper towels, tissues, towels, lotion, toothpaste, soap, blankets…). It felt tranquil and secluded enough while also being easily accessible to delivery drivers. Would be perfect for long term stays for sure. I booked this place because I read another review that read something like “if you’re on the fence about staying here just do it”, and after my stay I agree completely. Just book it.
Tip: The outdoor shower is nestled among the rocks, totally private, and has a warm setting."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a nice place to stay. A beautiful view over Phoenix, and with a jacuzzi on the balcony. Nice to see the stars twinkling. The apartment was fully equipped, air-conditioned en well furnished. Highly recommended!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is amazingly breathtaking. I plan on returning every time an overnight stay is necessary in the Phoenix area.
Every possible need or want was provided for. Carla was responsive to each inquiry and provided helpful hits prior to our arrival. The view and energy of the property is buzz worthy. The house was welcoming and the bedding and blankets were the comfiest. We were lucky to have been able to stay and enjoy this property.
Thank you Carla for sharing your labor of love."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest offers breathtaking 360-degree views! Beautiful and clean home with all the amenities for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nest was more than just its AMAZING view; Carla went out of her way on decorating the place and there were a lot of small, thoughtful extras all throughout the house.

I’m looking forward to coming back to work remotely, hideout and soak in gorgeous views all day long."

Any additional items that I required, Patty quickly provided them and communicated well. The neighborhood is lovely and safe.
The outside shower is also a fun addition. And don’t let the old school washer and dryer fool ya, they work better than any of the new ones. Wish I could have some like those everywhere I stayed.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and highly recommend."

It's like a cabinet door that does not line up to close fully. bed was comfortable, lots of pretty plants to look at, a pretty convenient location. overall, it was okay for a couple of nights, but I would not recommend anything longer."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patty was a fantastic host before and during our stay. We arrived late from the airport and only stayed one night but still felt just as important as longer staying guests! Studio B is BEAUTIFUL and they had all amenities needed for us! Would stay here again and again if I’m back in town!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stay one night at Patty’s place but it was worth it! Patty was very easy to communicate with. Her place was very quiet and comfortable all we needed during our long trip. We hope to come back in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 Recommend this Airbnb! It was awesome place to stay at! Super clean, unique, and peaceful! Looked exactly like the photos! The bed was super comfortable, linens were soft, bath supplies good quality! The hosts provide recommendations for places to eat which honestly made it so easy not having to vet out the millions of options nearby! Because yes! this is a great location with lots nearby, yet private! Loved the neighborhood, wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a lovely space, and the local reccomendations were a huge bonus. Patty and her husband were very gracious hosts."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very charming studio with beautiful surroundings. Patty and Ron were very kind and helpful. Will come again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a week and fell in love with the neighborhood. The Airbnb felt like a sweet little getaway surrounded by beautiful cacti and flora. Very private, great outdoor shower, sweet little outdoor area, and overall wonderful experience. We really enjoyed going on evening sunset walks in the neighborhood."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding. Patty's place did the trick. 5/5--clean, private and peaceful. We loved the little backyard space and we were surrounded by greenery. Just what we needed. would stay again for sure."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, well equipped and very easy street parking right by the property. Can drive to downtown or get on the freeway to go elsewhere in the area easily.
Would stay again if I find myself heading back to Phoenix!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place looks beautiful inside and out and the surrounding plants are gorgeous. But, at night, there are roaches everywhere outside. We were sprinting, trying our best to not let them inside. I definitely wouldn’t hang outside at night and it honestly made us not want to leave the Airbnb again once it was dark out. Also, I’m not sure I would recommend this place as a romantic getaway, as the bathroom door does not really shut like normal doors. So there’s not really any bathroom privacy. If that doesn’t bother you, than great. The location is good and close to all of the downtown Phoenix stuff. All in all, everything was fine!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for attending my downtown conference! This place has an awesome set up! I would stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to find with a smooth check-in! Looks exactly like the pictures and really loved all of the greenery surrounding the patios; it made the space feel like it wasn't in the middle of Phoenix!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patty was proactive in reaching out and made me feel very welcomed. The space was perfect for what we needed for a night in Phoenix. It is near the heart of downtown Phoenix and less than a 10min drive to the Van Buren venue (which is what made it appealing for me since I was going to see a show there). I would stay here again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space tucked behind the pine trees and cactus. It’s a residential neighborhood so if you’re looking for anything besides R&R idk what to tell you. Easy self checkin and cute aesthetic.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice cozy place perfect for a date night paint and sip!! Only thing for me was the bed was to low but that’s just because I like my beds higher lol but overall the place was clean and Patty left great check in instructions.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patty was very helpful! I had a question shortly before check-in and she was very prompt at responding. Her studio is super cute and was the perfect place to stay the night before an early morning departure out of Sky Harbor! Would absolutely stay again.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here!! Very modern kitchen and clean. The bathroom was lovely as well, only thing maybe I'd recommend is a way for the floor to drain that's right outside the shower it gets very wet. We used both the inside and outside shower and absolutely loved it! it's lovely to shower outside in the morning when the sun is starting to come up. The water pressure was great as well and there was already some soaps there for us as well. I would stay here again 😍"

Every window uou looked through had a perfect picture of calm. The layout was comfortable and relaxing. Not a lot of fluff and stuff which was great. Area was walkable to Historic Grans Street, Encanto Park and lots of Beautiful Street Art. Highly Recommend when you want to get away from the rush of life's busyness. Thanks for a wonderfully peaceful time Patty."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cute place and super cozy. The outdoor shower and meditation/seating area was a nice touch.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"THIS IS THE PERFECT ESCAPE, Studio B has incredible charm!!!! I’ve stayed at many air bnb’s around the Phoenix and Scottsdale area and this was my favorite location by far! The neighborhood was beautiful, quiet, and safe. You walk through turquoise gates and the vibe is very magical with blooming plants & succulents. There is alot of intention inside Studio B with artful and industrial vibes. I personally loved the choice of the outdoor shower. The host Patty was exceptional, friendly, and accommodating!!! I’d definitely love to stay again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described & looks like pics! Beautiful, cozy & peaceful stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had an incredible stay in Patty’s studio. The space was so private and something about the concrete design made it feel so luxurious! Pics are super accurate but the space is even better in person. Clean, airy space.
Parking on the street was easy though I did have to park a few houses down. I’ve always felt a little uncomfortable parking on the street in front of other people’s homes but I felt safe parking where I did. Home is located in a gorgeous neighborhood.
Bathroom door situation was a little weird and didn’t really have much privacy as the folding doors don’t actually shut they kind of just touch.
Overall it was a great stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patty was incredible! Place is amazing and looked exactly like the pics!!! Would definitely stay here again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! There was a large amount of local plant life to enjoy as we got in. The house was picturesque and very comfortable. Patty had a binder of fun lical attractions, and well as books and magazines. We enjoyed looking through the Arizona picturebook amd learning a little pf the state's history.
Overall, this place is a gem! I wish we could have had more time there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Studio B had a great layout the industrial design was great! Even though you share the property with someone else you still feel like your on your own place. They did a great job giving you privacy when building studio B. Patty was very proactive about letting us know we could reach out if we needed anything. Over all the stay was great! If you don't know your way around AZ please look at Patty's recommendation book it will help you.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing Amazing place! Super gorgeous. Felt like I was in a oasis!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for the night before flying out of Phoenix. Patty was very easy to work work. LOVED the outdoor shower, so peaceful! Thanks for a great stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our little oasis in the desert in the backyard surrounded by lush plants and lots of privacy. If only we had time to use the outdoor shower but it was a quick visit, but we'll be sure to try it out next time we visit. ;)
Wonderful place with comfy bed and all the amenities one would need and within walking distance to a really cool neighbourhood full of art and good food - just what we're into. Highly recommend."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, cozy spot near downtown! 10/10 would stay again. Great vibes"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We come to Phoenix fairly often for work and this is definitely the best AirBnb we have stayed in! A hidden gem in a central residential neighbourhood - when we unlocked the door we felt like we had stepped into an oasis. Small but perfectly formed, the space had everything we needed and the outdoor shower was the cherry on top. We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quick stay after an 11 day AZ honeymoon to prepare for our flight home. Very comfortable , utilitarian on concrete structure with elegant touches and a plethora of cacti growth surrounding. Fun, comfortable , and clean atmosphere!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patty’s BnB is always booked for a reason! It’s super peaceful and private, great for a weekend getaway. Check in was a breeze, and the room itself was very comfortable. We loved the outdoor shower, and the well stocked kitchen. The AC paired with fan was great at night, but I do give warning to more heat sensitive individuals that it may get toasty during the day.
Overall fantastic BnB! Very cozy!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at Patty & Ron’s place and it was another great stay, I love staying here and will likely book again sometime 🙏"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, minimalist and yet still fully appointed with all the mod cons (full fridge and freezer, dishwasher, built in counter-top stove, microwave, coffee maker). Every time I needed something I found it: sponge, ziplock bag, scissors, tons of extra towels, iron. Patty thought of everything!
Garden is stunning, lots of succulents, inside simple decor with a great touch.
Oh, and whimsical mix of backer panel and rough edge concrete in the bathroom. Cool technique!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely residential neighborhood, felt safe and walkable. Two blocks from I-10, so noisy at all hours, but closing windows & doors helped. Had a great night’s sleep on comfortably firm bed. Walls of windows opening onto two small private patios gives both spaciousness and privacy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect quiet, serene place to rest and relax. We also appreciated Patty’s quick and responsive communication. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patty’s place was accurately described and we were extremely happy with our decision. The location is just north of downtown Phoenix and is located in a beautiful historic neighborhood. Upon entry, Patty’s book with all instructions as well as recommendations was helpful. We loved our stay in Phoenix and would be more than happy to stay at this Airbnb again if we’re ever in Phoenix."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolute gem of a place! The studio was very quiet and private which was exactly what I needed. Consider staying here on your next trip to Phoenix!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay. The studio is tucked away in the yard with tons of plants and a nice patio. Great location and easy parking. Would definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We ended up checking in after 8pm and leaving the next morning by 4am to catch a flight so we didn’t get utilize the space much. This was a bummer because it was a really cool space and it would have been fun to utilize it better. With that said it provided us everything we needed for our one night stay. The house is near by a few very large freeways and because of that you could hear the traffic from inside all night long. But otherwise, it was a really fantastic place to stay! Really really cool vibes inside 🙌🏻"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I were in town for our friend’s wedding. It was a nice little studio oasis not too far from the venue and airport. Be careful of bugs and mosquitos since there’s a lot of plants! We arrived really late due to delays and airport closures, so it was quite dark. Appreciated the automatic light sensors on the pathway to the back house. Main house was quiet, never saw anyone, so it was a fairly peaceful and quiet neighborhood. It had all the basic amenities. That portable steamer came very handy for our wedding attire! The shower concept threw me off. Water splashed everywhere and definitely not what I’m use to. Hosts lived down the street and Ron came by to say hi :) Hosts were very friendly and gave clear instructions."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was a great stay! Very nice and comfortable :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were only at Patty’s place for a couple hours to sleep but it was clean and comfortable. It was easy to access and felt private.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patty and Ron were great hosts and went out of their way to accommodate us. We were able to drop bikes early before checking in and also leave some luggage past check out and pick it up before a late flight.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and homey yet unique—beautifully and efficiently constructed and landscaped. Had the perfect amount of privacy yet in a vibrant beautiful neighborhood. Perfect for my wife and I on a spring training weekend, we hope to get back."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little guest house was so cute and comfortable. Everything needed in a very efficient space. The grounds were lovely and the hot outdoor show was a real treat on a cool, crisp morning! Parking was easy and the neighborhood was good for getting around."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay at Patty's! Beautiful neighborhood and comfy airbnb. I appreciated the personal extras in the house.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this place was nice and unique. There was a dead fly in the windowsill and some stains on the comforter that were a bit off-putting, but the overall place is nice and nothing was worth truly complaining about. Plenty of street parking and it was easy to find and super close to I-10 which is nice."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute cottage. Very good value extremely friendly hosts!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Has everything you need for a short term stay and provides lots privacy even though it is a guest house. Bed is very firm but it didn’t bother us! Still very comfy.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay with Patty and Ron. The room was spacious and modern and in close driving distance to all you’d want from Phoenix. They were kind and communicative hosts.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute hideaway in the Phoenix area. Enjoyed our stay and Patty & Ron were great hosts.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space is gorgeous
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Patty was very responsive and an excellent communicator. The grounds were beautiful with gorgeous plants. Her place was good for our one night stay before heading to the airport in the morning. We felt it could have been cleaner & a little more homey, but I’m obsessively clean. Overall, it served the purpose we needed it for and we felt safe."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti thank you so much for having us! The stay was beautiful, quaint but still right near downtown Phoenix! So many ideas for food nearby and plenty of parking on the street. The outdoor shower was peaceful, clean and amazing - even in January! We appreciate the snacks, plenty of amenities, and recommendations!! If I could picky and make a suggestion to add brighter lighting in the bathroom for makeup purposes! Other than that everything was perfect 🥰"
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Was pretty dirty. Found dead bugs and bathroom rugs didn’t seem cleaned. There was also a lot of food leftover from other guests. Patio spaces were nice and loved all the plants.
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This space was in a good location near restaurants and other things. They offered drinks and snacks, which was nice. Fair price for the stay with a very comfortable bed. Just wish it was a bit cleaner."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Patty's guest studio is well-appointed, clean, cozy, and an architectural marvel. I loved the concrete and number of windows, as well as a fully stocked kitchen. The kitchen had goodies like granola bars, Cheezits, half and half, and gratefully, almond milk. Great lighting and aesthetics, as well as a nice hot shower and well-appointed bathroom with plush towels, shampoo, conditioner, salt scrub, blow-dryer. I didn't watch TV or use wi-fi, but it's all there. The bed was firm but not too firm and the linens clean and crisp. The only downsides, and this probably only applies to me and a few would-be guests, is that the pillows were too soft and the heater wasn't really strong enough to heat up the place. I was there during a rare cold and rainy day, but I can see the place being the perfect pad during the warmer months. I'm sure that in summer, the outdoor shower is a must-use!

Upon arrival, check in was very simple. I enjoyed the privacy of my stay and enjoyed the lovely outdoor shower. Room was clean, comfortable and inviting. I loved all the natural light and having my own patio to enjoy. Bed was a little firm to my liking, but overall I loved staying here. This is a couples retreat. 10/10 I would recommend everyone to stay here and would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Patty for having such a lovely place to stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We booked this after doing a week of hiking in Grand Canyon and Sedona and this was the perfect little oasis our last night! Very close to the airport but in a tucked-away in quiet neighborhood so you don't hear a ton of traffic and noise. The access to the laundry machine was very useful and the outdoor shower was a nice treat after a busy week.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patty & Ron have thought of everything you’d need for your stay. I especially enjoyed being able to use the washer and dryer. This is a hiker/ back packers paradise! From the outdoor shower, the privacy, the natural elements and the plants…you feel comforted and connected to the outdoors. I had enough space to lay out all my gear, pack accordingly, and wash up some dirty clothes after trekking through Aravaipa Canyon for 3.5 days. The bed does sit a little low to the ground, and it’s a little stiff. There is also some road noise that can be heard (cars passing, train horns, sirens etc.) but it didn’t bother me too much. Just thought it was worth the mention. I would definitely stay here again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Could not recommend this place more! It's such a unique studio with all of the basics.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We, my girlfriend and I, had a wonderful stay. The casita is beautiful with a modern feel that made you feel at home from the moment you walked in.
All the amenities and extra touches you'd want were right there for you to use and enjoy. There was a great coffee maker (with plenty of coffee), a good size fridge, and a microwave. In the closet was extras like disposable plates, paper towels, and forks! The bathroom was great! Plenty of space for toiletries and the shower was nice and big! Water pressure was great and we had no problems getting hot water. There's even a hairdryer in the magic closet if you need it!
Lastly, there is a ceiling fan and a/c if you need air flow or to cool things down and again in the magic closet, a small space heater if you need warming up on those unexpected chilly days.
Our only suggestion is to upgrade the mattress to make the stay that much more perfect. Don't get us wrong, we'd happily stay here again in the future and would recommend to everyone!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a place to stay for 1 night because we were booked for an early balloon ride in the AM. Ride was canceled but the casita was perfect! Just right for an overnight or a home base while visiting Phoenix.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly I have absolutely zero bad things to say. It was more than clean, organized and peaceful. I am hoping to frequent more often for work and will always have this place on the first on of my list!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was clean clean CLEAN. Nice bathroom/shower, roomy closet, and comfy bed. Several different types of bed pillows, so my fiancé and I each had one we liked. It's in a great location in north Phoenix, close to Lookout Mountain for hiking and plenty of restaurants. The hosts were easy to communicate with and seemed to genuinely care that we had everything we needed and that everything was up to par. The room is attached to the house but is totally separate. We had zero issues during our 4 night stay and would definitely recommend this rental."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita was exactly what I needed for a couple of nights before embarking on a backpacking trip into the Superstition Mountains with REI. It’s easy to catch ride-share from here, so not having a car was no problem.
The place was very tidy and clean. It’s a charming little place with enough open floor space to do some yoga and spread out my gear before I loaded my pack for my backpacking adventure. Also, lots of towels available.
Tasha and Brandon responded quickly to my questions and messages. They were so quiet it felt like I was completely alone. If you’re looking for a private, cozy place to stay, this is the place. I’d definitely stay here again.
CAUTION: I took 2 Uber rides to the Casita and both times their drivers stopped a block over from the actual spot. I’m not sure what the error is in Uber’s system, but the pin gets dropped a street behind the actual home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tasha & Brandon were excellent! I would highly recommend to others and would gladly stay here again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha and Brandon have created a really wonderful space for guests! They thought of every detail and made their casita welcoming, warm and cozy. When I arrived they had an essential oil diffuser running which smelled lovely! Plenty of towels and supplies, popcorn and coffee. The bed was comfortable and though it was chilly during my visit, I didn’t really need to use the heater much. The water in the bathroom gets very hot and shower has decent water pressure. I also appreciated the lighting options inside. I didn’t use the smart TV but it looked easy enough to navigate. Having a desk was great for some remote work during my stay, and the internet was reliable and easy to connect to. I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs over the years and really rank this one high on the top of my list. If I’m back in Phoenix I would happily book again! If you need a cozy spot not far from resort conference centers, I highly recommend Tasha and Brandon’s delightful casita! Thanks for a great stay."

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice. The host were ok. The problem I had while staying there was the ac. It seemed to be in some kind of timer.

Check in was very simple, as was locating the casita. They kindly had a supply of coffee with creamer available, oatmeal, and water bottles in the fridge.
The only thing I wish they had was a spot to sit outside to enjoy the weather and drink coffee! This is simply personal preference as I love drinking my morning coffee outside!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at Donna's Airbnb for a couple of nights. While the early check-in process was smooth and the place itself is great, well-stocked, and has comfortable beds and furniture, plus a fantastic backyard and pool, I had an unfortunate experience with the grilling amenities.
There were two propane grills, and neither one was operable. I messaged the host to notify her about my findings, and this is when she mentioned that it was stated in the listing to ""BBQ GRILL provided, just bring the propane"" along with a story as to why. This was a first for me, as I've never been told to bring my own propane for a grill at an Airbnb, not in all my years and hundreds of rentals. For this reason, I won’t choose this property next time I’m in the area.
Despite this hiccup, the rest of the stay was enjoyable, and the property is well-maintained. The home is beautiful and well-furnished, and the pool is wonderful and warm."

The heated pool was fantastic and we really liked the layout of the house with the primary suite on one side of the house and the two smaller bedrooms with shared bath on the other side of the house. Outside furniture was also updated and not dog eared as many airbnbs are. Donna was attentive and friendly."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly as advertised and very clean. Donna and David were super responsive and attentive.
Although no fault of the hosts, the (apparently) very popular nearby haunted house and pumpkin patch were a bit noisy after dark. It wasn't horrible and I'm sure it only happens a few weekends out of the year. By no means a deal-breaker.
The pool area is very nice, and the living area is a great space to hang out and enjoy each other's company. Huge televisions in every bedroom.
All in all, we had a lovely stay, and I would recommend this property. Thank you for helping to make my daughter's graduation a special and memorable experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt right at home here. Pristine, I am a clean freak and the house was spotless. Host provided shampoo, garbage bags, linens, dishwasher pods etc. Cute area and outdoor space sells the place.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was at the Zen Retreat was excellent and perfect for our family of 4. Dohl is very easy to communicate with and very responsive to any questions we had during our stay. Check-in was seamless and easy and we loved the friendly and peaceful neighbourhood. The area is great with many restaurants, coffee shops, a great park nearby and the Altitude trampoline park that the kids loved. The house is furnished with all the necessities and we swam daily in the pool, and soaked in the hot tub. The kids also loved the arcade games and ping pong, and the TV's in each bedroom. We would definitely stay at this home again."

We spent a full day lounging in the pool while cooking a few meals on the grill and having a ping pong tournament in the evening. The location is good with easy access to most anything you could need or want in the area. This may be one of the nicest AirBnB places we've stayed. The only downside we had was that the bed in the master suite was very soft, too soft for our liking, but opinions may vary. We are already talking about coming back for another stay and bringing more family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay for our girls weekend was fantastic. This place is spotless and stocked with some great basics. The house was as described and matched the pictures. The location is also fantastic. So close to so many great restaurants and bars. Loved it!

Could use a few more towels and such, but did the job. Beds were very soft which wasn’t ideal. Location was easy to get to different spots in Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe. Overall enjoyed our stay."

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dohl’s house was a great find! It is well equipped but free of clutter. The heated pool, hot tub were a hit with the family and so was the ping pong table. It is a quiet neighborhood and yet, has easy access to 2 major arteries within minutes. It is also just 10 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from the Dreamy Draw hiking trails. We would stay here again!"

Our only dislike (and this is personal preference) the beds are EXTREMELY soft. Other than that, great overall experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly HIGHLY recommend this beautiful home! Probably one of the top, if not THE top, Airbnb I've ever stayed at. It had everything our group of 5 needed, and could definitely accommodate a larger group per what the listing describes.
The house was clean, very spacious, beautifully decorated, and well equipped with everything needed in the kitchen. The pool was super clean and very refreshing. We spent peaceful mornings outside having coffee, and the patio area was great for hanging out. On top of a beautiful home, Dohl was amazing, super friendly, and quick to reply to messages.
Extra kudos for all the special touches. There were towels for the pool, a fresh bag of ice in the freezer, fully stocked coffee area with coffee pods/syrup, and the individually packaged condiments in the fridge.
We feel SO grateful to have spent our time in Phoenix at this beauty, and hope to stay again! Thank you Dohl for being an outstanding host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while in town on business and it was soooo peaceful and relaxing to come home and have a drink by the pool under the lights. Dolh was responsive and kind, and the house is beautiful and clean and cute. I would definitely stay here again!"

Dolh was very responsive when we had questions which was fantastic!
The ONLY negative for us was the beds were VERY soft which is just a preference and does not change the fact that we would absolutely stay there again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent, excellent, excellent! Dohl (the host) was amazing, accommodating, and responsive.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The whole house looks even better in person than the photos! Plenty off space for my family event and had a garage and large backyard. Beautiful home and well worth the price for location and size. Couldn’t be happier with the stay!!!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was great! A group of us came out for the Morgan Wallen concert and wanted to book a house instead of hotel. We found Dohl’s house and it was just as beautiful as the pictures! Very clean and bright. The kitchen was stocked with Keurig coffees and syrups, condiment packets and all of the kitchen utensils, plates, cups, etc that we could need! Only a quick 15 minute Uber ride to both the airport and downtown Phoenix. We went when it was 115 degrees everyday and the house stayed nice and cool which we needed!
Dohl was very responsive and very easy to work with. Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house. Great for family and kids. Backyard was relaxing and inviting.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The actual house was amazing! Enjoyed the pool & jacuzzi.
the only significant drawbacks were that the beds ware extremely SOFT and uncomfortable. we lost 3 nights of sleep and rest. It felt like we ware sleeping on a HAMMOCK!!! and there are no window darkener in the master bedroom so light will filter in."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"I recently stayed at this Airbnb and found it to be very clean and minimalist in its design. Pool and hot tub was great. The beds could have been a little more firmer, but overall it was a pleasant stay. One suggestion for improvement would be to provide some extra amenities like paper towels for guests. Overall, I would recommend this listing to others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. We booked for a business show we had at the JW Marriot at Camelback. But we spent the weekend with the kids for a mini getaway. The hot tub, pool, video games, ping pong and mini golf were huge hits. The space is open and very zen. We loved it. Quick to airport and all around Phoenix."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Phenomenal outdoor space makes this stay especially awesome. The kitchen is stocked really well. Would absolutely stay again.
Only significant drawbacks were the mattresses which are *extremely* squishy (essentially foam pads) and resulted in almost my entire party struggling to have a complete rest.
Would highly recommend otherwise!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Due to a family medical emergency, I personally was not able to stay in the beautiful home. However the rest of my family shared that they loved the place, it was spaceous, clean and very nicely decorated. The only concerns that they shared was that the WiFi information was not clearly posted in the house and that much to their displeasure, they could not find and iron and ironing board, a must if you are unpacking wrinkled clothing."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was amazing! Enjoyed the pool & jacuzzi. We absolutely loved the house and Dohl was responsive and helpful.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place! Stop scrolling, you won’t find a cleaner or more thoughtfully appointed home. It’s like your own private 5 star hotel"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is exactly as advertised and more. Highlights for our family included:
Well equipped kitchen (including spices and individual serving sized condiments)
Indoor gaming space
Pool and accompanying patio furniture
VERY clean & bright
Close to great grocery stores and restaurants
We highly recommend for a family get-away or a group gathering."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked a trip to Phoenix for baseball spring training boys reunion. Dohl’s place was perfect for us. The description and photos were spot on. It was very comfortable and modern. The only thing to note is that the beds are very soft. But location is ideal. It is close to the Camelback area and a short drive to Scottsdale. There are lots of great restaurants and bars around. We look forward to staying at Dohl’s place again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome! Helpful host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Really nice renovation and the pool and hot tub were excellent.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This house was just as it was advertised and looked like in the pics. Very clean and modern. Dohl was very responsive within minutes of when I had contacted him. One of the best Airbnb’s we stayed at.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a fabulous experience and perfectly met our needs.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was FANTASTIC. EXACTLY like the pictures, probably better. Comfortable, inviting, lots to do with mini golf, a heated pool, hot tub and a game room!
Fresh clean linen and towels. Even shampoo and body wash were provided.
This felt like a hotel suite honestly. The backyard had great touches with beautiful trees and a gazebo and loungers.
Dohl was very responsive and helpful.
This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and I was shocked at how GREAT it went. I read the review before mine and my brother said it was a fake review. Now leaving this review I understand why.
Take this place if it's available, you 100% will be happy you did."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing property and amazing host. This place rocks!! I would definitely recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot, loved the outdoor set up!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely studio in a wonderful location. We enjoyed mornings in the spacious outdoor area, and walks around the neighborhood."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd stay with Nate and Steven, but in one of the studios instead of the house. It was great to be back! The Butterfly Studio was a perfect size and as usual had everything we needed and even the things we didn't know we needed like snacks and a huge coffee variety! Beds and linens are so comfortable! We lucked out with mild weather for late April and were able to play cards and have wine outside. The shared yard/resort area makes this a little get away even if it was move out week for college. There are other people in the house and Garden Studio, but there is plenty of privacy and the outdoor spaces have enough room where we can do our own thing--like a hotel patio. We love it here, it is always the first place we check when we come to visit GCU--but they book fast! Thanks for a great visit."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space in a neat area. The place has everything you need for a weekend stay!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Butterfly Cottage was warm and comfortable. Upon entering the space, we felt that the listing did not convey how lovely and well thought out it was from order to art. Even the welcome/guest guide was, not only concise and informative , but artful.
Steven & Nate were responsive to all communication, which was especially essential to our one night stay.
We would love to try the Garden & Monarch options on the same site and enjoy the outdoor common spaces. It is now our #1 choice to stay when we return to Phoenix."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The studio was great! Very clean, cozy and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"An amazing, dog friendly stay in a wonderful location. Would definitely stay here again."

Thanks Nate and Steve!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay here. It's very spacious for a studio and clean as well. I could definitely tell a lot of thought and creativity was present when decorating the interior as well and the outdoors area. Steven and Nate were nice enough to send local places to visit. The house was equipped with all we needed. Neighborhood was peaceful and beautiful. Definitely has a great vibe! I would absolutely stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful place! The studio was very clean and decorated immaculately! The outdoor area was like a little retreat. Lots of extras in the studio and games and things for you to use. The outdoor area is communal for the other guests who rent the other studio and the house area. It would be an amazing place for groups to rent to all be together but have separate places to stay but all gather in the afternoons and evenings.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Butterfly cottage is just lovely! I love what Nate and Steven have done with the space— very creative, both indoors and outdoors. A lot of care went into this space. Bed was super comfortable, really appreciated the flexibility with check out time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this home was wonderful!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay at Nate and Steven’s place. It was better than described! We enjoyed sitting outside around the fire pit and playing corn hole. We’ll definitely be back! Thanks Nate and Steven!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at Nate and Steven’s place. Last year was the main house, this year the Butterfly Studio. It was great. Very big studio and we loved the furnishings. This is a great neighborhood and we love walking to Uptown Plaza and Newton for meals and drinks."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time there. Always a pleasure.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! The location was perfect and it’s just a short walk to the light rail and we appreciate all the restaurant recommendations.

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place that we have stayed in several times now. Kitchen and bathroom plumbing fixtures are loose. Bathroom sink is so small that you will bump your head trying to use it. ￼ Best to use the kitchenette sink for brushing your teeth. Floor was a bit sticky and dirty to walk on barefoot. Heater and air conditioner make noise that will keep you awake unless you bring earplugs.￼ Otherwise, a nice convenient place to stay."

The interior is beautifully appointed with a distinct style and panache. The hosts are terribly kind and helpful whenever the need arises. Convenient to everything you would want to be in easy distance of. The Toasted Owl was particularly fun(MidMod goodies for sale!). We bought a glass owl cookie jar and ate scrumptious vegan tamales.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic Stay!
I needed a place to stay after our AC went out and had spent the day overheated & stressed ( me and my two dogs). I booked the Airbnb in a hurry and was disheveled … to be honest didn’t read the instructions super thoroughly. When I arrived, after 10 pm, the hosts were super responsive and helpful in helping me get in.
There was a slight issue during check in and they immediately upgraded me to a larger Airbnb on property. That was really kind and impressive.
The neighborhood is really nice & quiet. Central Phoenix can be hit or miss on the areas in some pockets, but this spot is very quiet and safe. You’ll be very close to plenty of local favorite dining options like Joyride Taco, First draft book bar and our personal fave, Clever Koi. The house is eclectic, artistic and well designed with lots of amenities like surround sound, outdoor seating, super soft sheets & a spa like shower & soaking tub.
10/10 and can’t wait to return under better circumstances!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is becoming our regular camp for our frequent Phoenix trips. Comfortable, puppy friendly, great outdoor area, great location."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The grounds were very comfortable and great for our morning pet duties. The studio was big and comfortable if showing a bit of wear.

This little hideaway invites you in with a vibrant, cheerful, and peaceful mood of color and ambiance created through pictures, furniture and comfort. It acheives zen. I wished we could have stayed longer or just moved in! The second you enter the yard it's like a luxury private villa hidden in a local neighborhood.

Good location for activities in the city
Cute aesthetics with cool antiques
Cozy living space in open floorplan
Very comfy bed
Quick, easy laundry access
Spacious minifridge
Cons:
Kitchen and bathroom not very functional – best for only a short stay
Water was always lukewarm, never hot or cold
Some very loud music nearby all day the first day of our stay (could have been a one-time thing!)"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Phoenix is a huge city and I don't claim to know much about its various districts and suburbs but we did enjoy our time in the area surrounding this Airbnb. Within walking distance is a gourmet grocery store and a few restaurants, I was surprised to find a reasonable sushi experience that didn't involve driving across town! We didn't take the public transit but I did notice that it would be super easy to do so from Nate & Steven's house. The space itself is great, these guys really put a lot of effort into the communal areas and we enjoyed relaxing out there under the ample shade. Laundry machines were modern and cleaned/dried without issue.
The studio space was fine, the key elements were great: comfy king bed, well-functioning air conditioning, and a fancy shower experience. Bathroom and kitchen areas were clean, kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. The only downside to mention was that the floors were sticky and dirty in spots but this has to be the fault of the cleaners (I've messaged the hosts to make sure they address this) -- easily rectifiable. Other than that we had a restful time here and feel recharged to continue our adventures!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location to local food and highways. Walkable. Spacious living indoors and out. Safe neighborhood.

The bed is amazingly comfortable and huge, AC is perfection, and it is beautifully designed. I’d love to style my own home as they do. Any time we are in Phoenix and need a little private retreat from the heat (or family haha), our first thought is to see if Nate & Steven have availability. Thanks again, Nate & Steven! A+++"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and very clean!! We really enjoyed our stay here. Thanks Nate and Steven for a great experience!

We felt at home immediately and will absolutely be recommending this place to friends/family and returning in the future!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nate & Steven's place was easily by far the most comfortable and cleanest AB&B we've stayed in ""in the phx area"" .. the location was perfect, it was minutes away from our favorite restaurants and coffee shops. OMG , and the bed !! was extremely comfortable and the sheets are soooo soft .. And the outside lounge area is set up so cute .. Definitely recommend it and we'll be staying here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. We arrived at 2 AM due to airport delays, etc. and it was very easy to follow written instructions to unlock the gate and use the code to get in the unit. The bed was so comfortable that I had to remove the sheets before leaving so that I can consider buying this brand. The backyard was shared by three units but we were out there alone when using it. Beautiful, sunny Phoenix made is a pleasure to catch a little outside relaxation. The only complaint we had is that the water pressure is very low and so it was a little inconvenient for washing the dishes in the sink and bathroom needs. Otherwise, just perfect little stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, large studio guest house with a shared stylish outdoor area. Wonderful lighting, comfortable furniture, and thoughtful details!! I will definitely look into booking with Nate & Steven again."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful space! And I just loved the butterfly theme, which extended to the other airbnb's also on the property. They were super accommodating w/ my emotional support animal. They were easy to reach when I had a few tech issues, and they were incredibly prompt and helpful in resolving them. The bed was quite comfortable and they had nearly every amenity you could need in the kitchen area. Nate and Steven also have really outdone themselves with the outdoor, shared common area space. They had a beautiful BBQ, so many areas to sit and chill, maybe a firepit, and all kind of lawn games, including cornhole and 'yard-zhee.' My only regret is that I didn't book 1-2 more nights after my conference so I could really chill and enjoy the outdoor area more. I can't wait to stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the good fortune of booking this Airbnb last minute for our big family gathering, and we couldn’t be more pleased with our experience. First off, we’d like to extend our deepest gratitude to our hosts for accommodating us on such short notice, especially considering our large group and pets. Their flexibility and hospitality truly saved our trip.
Upon arrival, we were immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the house. It’s not often you find a place that looks just as pristine in person as it does in photos, but this house did not disappoint. Every room was spotlessly clean, which made for a very comfortable and welcoming stay.
The kitchen deserves a special mention. It was fully stocked with all the essentials we could possibly need — and then some. Cooking for a large family can be a daunting task, but the availability of various utensils, pots, pans, and appliances made meal preparation not only easy but enjoyable. It felt like a home away from home!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect spot for my wife mom 3 kids and I to rest our heads as we traveled home. Suzette thought of everything that a traveling family would need. Even had a high chair and pack n play making it easy for us to use for our baby.
The live plants were a nice touch. My wife kept talking about how typically people use fake plants. She’s a green thumb and it just made her night.
She had snacks in the fridge for the kiddos. Milk & juice too.
We were able to pull right up into the garage and unload the car. Which made for a perfect load up and go the next morning as it was raining and we didn’t have to worry about getting wet. That was convenient.
If we are ever back traveling through we will check to see if her place is available again. Thanks for a cozy nights stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzette was a great host. The airbnb was cozy, very well equipped for a family stay. If we could have stayed longer if we could have. Beds were comfortable and in a peaceful neighborhood. Would stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the place- just a short comment - not being a plant person -I didn't know exactly which ones needed to be watered or taken outside for sunlight. There were just a few too many for me to take care of. MY daughter said she did her best to keep them alive.
TV was easy to operate, house had everything that the family needed.
All was good. Thank you, Suzette for being a great host."

That is not the case with other Airbnb’s we have stayed at in the past and it was such a welcome addition to our stay. Her home was spotless and so cozy too.

House was well maintained with a beautiful backyard with plenty of seating, plenty for the kids and pets to do! host had plenty of coffee and snacks available, as well as different games and books to read. of you would rather watch TV than you have the option of a TV in every room. highly recommended and would say again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I booked last minute… and I wasn’t disappointed. Suzette was great to deal with; cordial and responsive. Check in was a breeze. The house is very nice and is located in a very nice neighborhood. In addition to a great supply of snacks and beverages - there are lots of towels and linens in case you should need them. The patio/backyard is amazing. It’s always a plus having the luxury of a garage and washer/dryer. It’s a small thing too, but handwritten notes are a great touch. My dog and I had a great stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give Suzette and her wonderful Windchime House 10 stars I would! First of all, she is hands down the most thoughtful AirBnb host I've ever encountered. Not only was the house spotless (and absolutely adorable), but there were SO many sweet personal touches that she added. From a handwritten card welcoming us to her home, to a fruit bowl on the dining table, a bowl of snacks on the counter, a bowl of candies on the side board, to travel size toothpaste and shampoo/conditioner in the bathrooms. The home is PERFECT for dog owners. There was a super comfy dog bed in the living space, and even a dog bowl set for food and water. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The A/C was on point. The kitchen was nicely appointed for anyone who wants to cook a full meal. The house is set up with a multitude of free streaming apps. They have a built-in bookcase full of (good) books and an even better selection of games. The outdoor space offers multiple choices to sit and relax. 10 STARS!"

Suzette accommodated early check in and was quick to respond to all the questions. The amenities stacked were helpful as I was hungry when I reached and did not have to step out to find a restaurant immediately. Suzette had some snacks, milk and fruits set u before the arrival. It allowed me to relax after a long drive. I did not need to use the restaurants but there were a lot of food places and fuel stations near by. Overall great experience . I wished I could have stayed longer and will definitely book this place if I come back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzette was amazing! She was able to accommodate my family and I with a very early check in time. She was very accommodating with our schedule and the price we paid was very reasonable. We really appreciate how sweet and understanding she has been. The only thing is we had a little trouble closing the garage door, but that’s probably because I’ve never used a garage before. 😅 other than that, we really appreciated all the amenities. She had a bunch of snacks made available and coffee bar with to-go cups. There were games and activities in the back yard. Our pup had a large yard to run around and play too! Loved it and will stay again!"

The beds were very comfortable, the backyard was beautiful, and the location was perfect for our needs. We had a medical emergency while visiting, and thankfully, Suzette was able and willing to let us extend our stay. When we left we felt like we were leaving home. If possible, we will definitely stay here the next time we are in Phoenix."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzette’s place was exactly as pictured. A nice home in a quiet subdivision in North Phoenix. Beds were comfy, plenty of towels, the place was spotless, great backyard, tons of nice plants and cute photos of their dogs on the walls, nice toiletries/soap/shampoo. Best AirBnB experience I’ve had in a long time. Will definitely stay again"

We loved the special touches as well (personal note, snacks, fruit, drinks, coffee). The washer and dryer was a plus. Also being able to park in the garage was awesome. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly, felt right at home. The house it self was very homely. Full of plants and board games. spacious back yard and clean."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Suzette was a great host, very responsive with great communication and friendly attitude. Truly felt more like a friend letting you stay at their place than a host. In addition to the cordiality and professionalism of the host, the home was perfectly comfortable. Ac ran strong, beds were deluxe, showers were easy to use. All in all, we had a great experience and will book again next time we’re in the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough great things about about the wind chime house and Suzette!!! The place was so cute and we loved sitting out back watching the birds. She supplied so many extra things such as coffee, snacks, shampoo, toothpaste, fruit, water, etc. It was the best supplied Airbnb I’ve stayed in. She goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable. It’s also nice to park your car in a garage out of the heat and street traffic. We will definitely stay here again!!!! Thanks Suzette!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Very convenient location!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean, nicely decorated with live beautiful plants throughout which we loved. Home has more to offer than advertised.
Welcome note with a bottle of wine was a really nice touch, made us feel appreciated, cold bottled water and juice in the fridge was also very thoughtful after a long trip. Chips, snacks, and coffee is just a few of many amenities this wonderful place has to offer. The house was easy to get to and safe. I highly recommend it and hope to be back in the near future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just a great place to stay, comfortable, well-equipped, with an awesome host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my second time staying at Suzette’s place and it was just as great as the first time we definitely would stay a 3rd time house was clean and comfortable the neighbor is nice and safe definitely worth every penny and she is a great host quick to respond and is there if you need her
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I couldn’t 5 star this place fast enough!!! There was a beautiful warmth that made you immediately feel at home and I’ve never wanted to move into an Airbnb like we have this one! The place was perfect - I hated having to leave! The backyard is amazing, Suzette has thought of everything, it’s family friendly (pack and play and high chair in main bedroom), and I could go on! If you’re looking to stay in north Phoenix and this place comes up as an option, just hit “book it”!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suzette’s place is top notch. The Wind Chime House is one of the best Airbnb’s in which we have stayed. The kitchen was well-stocked with water, coffee, and snacks. The house and outdoor patio very comfortable. We felt welcomed and at home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very good place to stay. Clean and convenient. Only thing we think owner can improve is the check in instruction. 1) earlier release so we can have more time to read 2) easy to find out the key information: lock code and location of the lock.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were only staying for the night since our flight landed late. Suzette was super sweet and left snacks out for us as she knew we were getting in late. Amazing host. We definitely wish her home was closer to where we were having to be because we would of stayed there our whole visit.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Suzette was accommodating and even though you could tell the house was lived in, it was surprisingly clean. This also gave us access to a lot more little things like food in the fridge, cooking utensils in cupboards, etc (which was nice!). Very spacious and a dog friendly yard is what sold it for us! My only complaint was that even though it was advertised as being in Phoenix it is about 30ish mins from. Not too bad at all, just think the description should say otherwise. Thanks Suzette!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay, in a good location."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were just passing through the area for a night en route to San Diego. Suzette's house was easy to get to, and she was always easy to reach.
The house was super clean and well stocked. I travel with pretty much everything, but if you forgot anything, I'm sure this house had it. Suzette even put items in the refrigerator for guests. The beds were very comfortable, and everything we used worked well.
It's a spacious house, and there is a nice backyard to enjoy. It was a bonus to have a garage to pull into.
We would stay again and would definitely recommend."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Suzette was a lovely host that provided the coziest and cleanest home! This has been the best Airbnb that I have ever stayed at and would highly recommend it!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Suzette has thought of everything!! You just show and start vacation! The house was immaculately clean and well stocked to keep you in snacks for the week. I would stay here and recommend this unit!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay for us while attending Spring Training! Stocked with everything you would need and such a nice welcome with a sweet note! Lots of extras that I wouldn’t expect. You won’t have any regrets staying here!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suzette’s place was amazing. Easy check in, east check out. Very responsive. Suzette went above and beyond with amenities. Felt right at home. Beds were very comfortable. Home was very clean. Kitchen had everything we need and more. Personalized, thoughtful note left by the host made us feel like she really cared. Backyard was very nice. Cornhole, patio furniture, string lights, mature trees made us want to hang out in the backyard the whole time. Although we didn’t bring our furbabies the home was set up with conveniences for traveling with your dogs. Neighbors were friendly as well. Great location. Close to stores and restaurants. Felt safe."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean cozy and perfect for family and our fur baby!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! The vibe was zen and peaceful! Great home away from home! Really felt like staying at our own mini resort!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed an affordable place for a few days between nomad places. Suzette’s place was just what my dog Murphy and I needed. I was very happy with the accommodation and the security of the garage. I was concerned that my Toyota tundra with a lift wouldn’t fit but it did.
Anything you need is in the place, probably bring some meat and be able to whip a whole meal with the stocked kitchen.
The fenced yard was nice when traveling with a dog. Easy to get in with a code. Thanks Suzette!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredibly equipped with everything you could think of. Provided plenty of bottled water and coffee for our stay. Provided above and beyond hotel toiletries, toothpaste, make up remover, floss etc. Responds in minutes. I stay in AirBnB’s frequently and this is a 10 out of 10. Ample garage. We came in for a lacrosse tournament and there was plenty of space for all our goalie gear and our rental van."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Just a great place to stay

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot. This place was so very kid and dog friendly! Kids plates and silverware as well as extra dog bowls and a dog bed. Perfect for our family with our toddler and two dogs’
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved staying at Suzette’s airbnb. It is impeccably clean, the sheets and towels are so soft and plush, and we had plenty of space to make ourselves at home. We were traveling with our two large dogs, and with them comes a lot of stuff, and we had plenty of space for all of it. But most importantly, our dogs felt at home with a great yard with shade and shrubs and smells, a basket of dog toys and dog bowls, and nice cool tile floors inside. Suzette goes above and beyond to make you feel at home with a welcome note and snacks and drinks in the fridge, including fresh fruit. All these touches make such a difference. I got sick on our last day and was able to book an extra day to rest before hitting the road - it helped that I was in a place as comfortable as Suzette’s. We are very grateful for her hospitality, and look forward to staying here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always a great place to stay when I am in town for business or pleasure
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was short but Suzette has really thought of it all! So many thought touches trickled across the house to really make the stay more comfortable.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a very comfortable stay here and was a great value! Very easy check in. The back yard was great for a small gathering. There is a fire pit and corn hole game. Also, nice accommodations are provided if you bring your dog such as a dog bed and box full of dog toys!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I consider myself an Airbnb connoisseur (as a former Airbnb host and frequent user) and I think that this is among the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. There were many thoughtful touches, high quality linens, beverages, fruit, and snacks, fully stocked kitchen, outlets on the nightstands for charging, an empty two car garage, and a note from the host upon our arrival. Although we didn't have kids or dogs with us, we noted that the listing had a dog bed, bowls, bags, and a pack n play with mattress and fitted sheet, high chair, and a variety of books and games. I was also impressed by the different products in the house, and the information sheets/QR codes about them. Essentially, it has everything that you would want in a place you are traveling, but also many personal touches, including plants. Communication with Suzette was easy. This place would be great for a long term stay. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in this part of Phoenix in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just a perfect place to stay. Good location, great amenities, clean and quiet. Nice neighbors, too."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful home tucked into a quiet neighborhood. It is close to the highway and shopping and a nice park for walking or jogging. Suzette had EVERYTHING my tired kids and I could have possibly wanted. We booked at the last minute when a baseball tournament went too long for us to return home the same day. Suzette had the house ready for us to check into in under an hour, had snacks for the teens and refreshments for all! Teens had board games and each had a TV in their rooms. I had all the amenities I needed to cook a quick, healthy supper for an exhausted group of kids. If we need a house in this neighborhood again for a tournament we will absolutely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I appreciated everything about our stay… The home was welcoming and comfortable…. The home was clean, clean ,clean,… The bed was super comfortable the towels were super fluffy and the sheets smelled freshly washed!If you’re ever passing through Phoenix and needed an Airbnb she gets a place to stay , the wind chime 5stars ! Suzette goes the extra mile with her hospitality!

She also left us many snacks, drinks and fruit as well as a greeting card, which let us felt very welcomed. We wish we could stay longer. Plus if you want to take the hot air balloon, the house is only within 10 min drive to the gathering place for hot air balloon, which is very convenient if you need to take the sunrise ride. highly recommend."

The place is wonderful! It’s a very beautiful house, clean and spotless, spacious, comfy and great vibes. The beds are very comfortable, towels and linens are top quality, the shower is great, overall a great experience staying at Suzette’s home! I seriously recommend that you book this place, you won’t regret it! It’s a million times better than a hotel! Snacks provided are such a nice touch! And on top of that, access to the garage (2 car) is great, especially if you’re on a road trip and want to store your car safely and away from the heat.
Do yourself a favor, and book this place. I will for sure come back some day, and will tell my friends and family about it!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house is great it has everything you may need for your stay. Its is very spacious and has a great yard for your pups.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Suzette was a dream to work with! Her home had all the right touches and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were definitely lucky to have booked this home on the start of our vacation. Home was just like described in the photos but the little touches were what made it a great stay. Garage parking was nice to have and keep the car out of the heat. Home was very clean and had many personal touches from the host that made us feel welcome. Very close to water park and restaurants. Home cooled very well and we slept great on the beds and pillows. We would definitely stay here on any future trip to the area. Well worth the price. By far the best of the 6 homes we stayed in on our family vacation!!

The plants located throughout the home gave the home a warm, inviting touch. She left snacks and drinks for us, which were great to snack on, while we figured out groceries. The backyard was peaceful and we spent a lot of time back there! OH MY GOODNESS and the bed in the primary suite…if I could’ve stayed there ALL day I would’ve! Definitely will be purchasing some of those pillows!! This will forever be our Airbnb when we visit Phoenix!!
