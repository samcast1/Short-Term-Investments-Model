2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a quiet few days with our kiddos here. It was everything we had hoped for! The views are unbeatable, the stars at night were so gorgeous, and we were so comfortable. Loved the hot tub and spa pool! And the kitchen had everything we needed to cook!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall great location and hosts. Will be returning.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's always so nice when the place you're visiting is even nicer than the pictures can capture. We arrived after sunset so we didn't get a chance to take in all the amazing nature around us until the next morning, but as we entered the home we both let out a sigh or relief and relaxation. We loved the layout of the home and it was the perfect size for our little weekend getaway. Once the sun came up the next morning we were treated to some of the best views through the large windows that span the living room area. This one is going on the list of favorites for sure."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful house with great views and privacy. The hot tub and swim spa were fantastic and relaxing. The house was spotless and host communication was great. This is a fabulous place to stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home had everything we needed and was clean and just as described... We felt right at home immediately.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite Airbnbs that we have stayed in! We loved the mountain view from the beautiful back deck. It was very clean, organized, and cozy. Would love to stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Went here for our honeymoon and Place was out of this world will be recommending to anyone and everyone.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay! The swim spa and hot tub, the horseshoes and firepit, the walking trails and beautiful view from the deck all made this a peaceful and relaxing place to stay. The architecture and decor were well done and made it feel luxurious."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful peaceful place to get away, soaking in the heated pool or spa and watching the night go by. Take a day trip to Chattanooga to visit the Aquarium, See Rock City, and Ruby Falls. Great. If you want great BBQ, travel to LaFayette and see the Wardlaw family at Lucky Eye Q, you won't be disappointed, leave room for some homemade Banna Pudding. The house has all the amenities needed for a restful stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay at Pinhoti for us. Always have enjoyed this location. The place was as described, very clean and very private. Enjoyed the deck, especially late at night to watch the Perseids meteor shower this year. This was a perfect setting for it, away from light pollution."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had such a wonderful time staying at Pinhoti! It is exactly what we were looking for when searching for a place to celebrate our anniversary. It was private, peaceful, and had all the accommodations of home. Alisa is a fantastic host as well! We have zero complaints!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Will be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! We booked this home for our 15th anniversary, and we wanted something secluded but nice. This place for the bill!
We were a little worried about how far away restaurants would be, but LaFayette was about 15 minutes away, so that wasn’t a bad drive at all.
The beds are modern and low, and might be difficult for older people to get out of. The early morning sun also comes in the large windows, so if you’re looking to sleep in, that might be difficult.
Over all, this house made for a great trip, and we would definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this beautiful home with great views and tons of privacy!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin if you're looking to be close to Jarrod's Place.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is nice but i found that wasn’t as clean as suppose to be considering the extremely high fees from evolve managing the property
The outside grill was very dirty and imposible to use
Pots and pans were old and some cutlery found in dishwasher were dirty, not big deal but again evolve charge very high managing fees plus the airbnb fees so i was expecting a sparkle house
The location is secluded if you looking for a peaceful lonely time this is the place to be
But bring food , and all u need to spend your days here
Restaurants are not near by and the closest supermarket is 15/20 min away
If you don’t like dogs, just be careful w the neighbor friendly big dog because he will jump on you and get into the house w no problem
Wifi is good, house is ample and the outside is green and peaceful , we loved to seat under the outside cabana and rest in the hammock"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay for our group .
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay was perfect!

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very comfy, clean and comforting! Great location, really beautiful surroundings! Definitely planning on staying again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely wonderful time at this gem we found. We were looking for a place to stay while our kids were at Berry College for a camp. We loved the quiet, peaceful location where we could relax, grill, walk near the stream, and have a glass of wine while watching the fireflies. We were close enough to Rome to get a good bite to eat and took two day trips to Chattanooga to go to Rock City and Ruby Falls. The inside was very clean with many pieces of furniture and decor and with hand crafted wood. We would stay here again for sure if in the area!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place! Friendly and helpful contact person!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped here for 2 days on our way to Florida and were glad for the relaxing setting to unwind. The space was beautiful and roomy enough for 2 teens, 2 tweens in the loft, and mom and dad in the master. Being able to bring our 2 small dogs was a bonus, and we made friends with the dog next door who was super friendly. The front porch was peaceful in the morning for coffee, and the fire pit was perfect for smores with gathered sticks we found on the grounds. We ordered door dash one night and went to eat at The Willow Tree the second night where we had great service and food. We had everything we needed and definitely recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came up from Atlanta spending a few days in Rome with friends and family. This spot was awesome! 22 ish min drive from Rome, but secluded and had everything you need for a fun night in. Bon fire, corn hole, seats with a view for morning coffee.
The 2 twin beds are up a ladder that leads to the loft. Super cute.
Loved that it was dog friendly.
It was perfect for us. Thanks!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honeymoon weekend before we leave to go on our actual honeymoon, we will visit again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great secluded and clean place that is a nice getaway from the city. It was relaxing to use the fire pit at night and hear the water from the stream nearby.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Just what we needed. Rented for my husband, myself, and my parents to celebrate a family wedding at Burke Farm. Great location, clean and modern stay. Easy check in. We REALLY enjoyed the covered porch. Thanks again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family had a great stay here! This beautiful cabin is tucked away and not in the middle of town but still within driving distance to local attractions. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a cute place and perfect for our group. We really enjoyed our stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"place was great, very chill and quaint. thanks for a great stay!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Our stay was wonderful. The space was exactly as described. The only thing that could have been better was the check-out time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cutest little house in the most tranquil area. Perfect for a family or friends trip. An escape away from everything and the house has everything you need. Will definitely be back!!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is beautiful, peaceful, and clean! We loved every minute of our stay. There are also so many beautiful sights to see nearby."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The property was nice and very clean. we slept 5 very comfortably. The parking is on gravel up a hill so we did have to maneuver our cars a bit to get in and out. But we enjoyed our stay and had no issues. A few questions were answered very quickly. We would stay here again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,If you are looking for a great home away from home this is the place. This is not my first experience in an AirBNB this my first time in a cabin. We honestly enjoyed the peace and Serenity. Thank you again for such a beautiful home
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful and relaxing quiet stay. The property is very clean and has everything you need! We will definitely visit again.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated, cute place. We had suv & could maneuver driveway ok but small car might have problems, very washed out.
We recommend bringing paper plates, since only 4 plates & 4 bowls are stocked there currently.
Loved the outdoor covered deck & pictures don’t show but there is comfortable seating (couch & chairs) out on it as well which was nice along with a little table & 2 chairs.
(Only down was neighbors close & one has a dog that yelps all day long, can’t hear inside but if you want to enjoy outside area bring ear plugs or music to drown out the yelping)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot rave about this place enough. Everything was so thought out amenity wise. This place is the PERFECT spot for a little getaway. We cannot wait to come back.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,If you are visiting students at Berry College it is a much better place to stay and only 13 miles from the school.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place to have a getaway if you want to relax and enjoy some peace and tranquility. The host is amazing and the property is spectacular. I will definitely return to this property.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for your kindness! We enjoyed our beautiful stay! Melissa, Emily, & Lisa"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quaint and comfortable little house with a “little house on the prairie” vibe. Modern amenities without modern distractions, (i.e. tv’s). Beds were comfortable. House was fully stocked with necessities in bathrooms and kitchens. Farm was enjoyable and peaceful with several farm animals that were safely contained in enclosures for viewing and petting. Property also has a sizable play yard for youth ages toddler to pre teen including wooden structures. All in all is was a perfect stay! Would recommend 100%!! It is a short drive to the city but that is to be expected with the country charm of the home and its location."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The farm is fun and relaxed and interactive and calm and everything you could want or expect from a mountain farm. It is child-friendly - including the animals - and is a great place for families to explore and roam. The location is wonderful, nestled nicely between several mountain communities. It’s a rural location and a rural atmosphere at the farm. We loved it."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joseph's place actually looked better than the photos(!) and was more beautiful, serene, and ""homey"" than I expected. I brought three older family members who'd never been at an Airbnb before and they were blown away by the home, the animals, the entire property. Their standards are quite high now! :)
Yummy, family-owned restaurants are nearby. Finster's Paradise Gardens and Little River Canyon National Park - must sees! - are also close. And the locals, including Joseph, are so helpful, friendly, and easy-going. All around great experience!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! The farm was beautiful and the animals were the sweetest. Our kids loved playing on the playground and fishing. We would definitely recommend staying here!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the most amazing weekend get away we could have asked for. From the friendly host, the most relaxing surroundings, the ability to move about freely, and the accessibility to local stores was feasible. We enjoyed the attractions that were close at hand. And the views were so amazing!
Joseph was friendly and accommodating. He gave us the ground rules for access to his animals (i.e. close gates behind us) and gave us free reign of move on his property to enjoy our visit and explore at our leisure. He offered to let our girls help him feed his animals and let them fish from his pond until their hearts were content.
We would love to visit again, just to enjoy another vacation and visit the places we didn't get to see before."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family of 4 loved this place. Our East coast teens fell in love with all of the farm animals. The animals are so cute and friendly. The rental is so unique and was such a fun farm experience. The beds are really comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. We did bring our own coffee grounds and creamer, so I am not sure if that is stocked. Bathroom/Shower was great. The weather was cold and gloomy, but the scenery was beautiful and the rental was plenty warm enough. We hope to come back again."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed the weekend using the Orchard as our landing spot. The kitchen is wonderfully stocked--which we value when we traveling so we can still have quiet, home cooked meals. What is also really great, and unlike most other Air BnBs, is that I didn't have to worry about sending the kids out to play since this is not in a city/neighborhood/ etc and so therefore you are not restricted to just the house space. There is a double play structure, space to play ball, animals to observe. We would consider coming again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly place and fun
Joseph farm is a great place for a family"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful experience! Me and a group of buddies came down to ride at Jarrod’s place and having a spot that was super peaceful and only 35 minutes away was wonderful. The animals were an added bonus for the group of us. Joseph was awesome, kind, and super helpful throughout the whole process. The WiFi could be better but being out in the middle of nowhere it’s expected! The shower was also always hot even with 6 of us staying there. 10/10 would stay again!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and quiet!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Felt right at home. Cozy place with beautiful setting.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay !!! Sneaky was a family favorite as well as the dog that hung out with us during our stay ! Will definitely stay again as well as recommend to others ! All around amazing stay !
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute place, cottage feel. The grandkids loved the playground area and animals. Very quiet and relaxing. Joseph was always very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The farm was very entertaining for the kids. Lots of animals for them to pet and feed. I liked that we had no T.Vs so we got a chance to unplug. Host left us dinner which we loved. This is a definite working farm with old farm charm.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I had a wonderful weekend. It was peaceful and quiet. Getting to pet the alpacas, the sheep, the goat, and the dogs was a bonus! The space was very private and serene. We were celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary and this place was perfect. Lazy days of laying about reading and wandering around the farm.
We also drove into Summerville and visited Howard Finster's Paradise Garden. We also bought several EXCELLENT ribeye steaks at Lucky's Grocery in Menlo."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the hospitality.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at Joseph's place. It is out in the country but less than 20 minutes from the attractions of Little River Canyon National Preserve, Mentone, and Desoto State Park. The house is really tastefully done, the kitchen is great, and the added fun of the alpacas was so great! Joseph was responsive and helpful. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at several Airbnbs during our cross-country move, and Orchard Farms was far and away our favorite. The kids loved the animals, and the house was beautiful. Joseph even messaged us to offer an earlier check-in and made sure the temperature was comfortable before we got there. We would definitely stay again. Thanks again for a fantastic stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. We felt very welcomed. It was so beautiful, peaceful, and quiet. Joseph was so nice to talk with us about the farm. We loved visiting with the animals."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in a lot of places, and Joseph was by far the kindest, most responsive host we have ever had. He went above and beyond to make my family feel at home from tips and help with fishing to letting my children help feed the new baby alpaca. The house was super cute, and we adored the feel of the old farm house style. We would recommend this stay to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was awesome and I certainly want to come back for a longer stay. The baby alpaca on the property was the cutest thing I've ever seen and we got free range to walk around and see and pet the animals. The house is so cute and clean. The ac worked great even in 100 degree heat. Would 100% recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was just what my family needed. Our girls loved the alpacas, the goats, the dogs, the trails, everything. If you are looking for a farm experience, this is the place for you. Make sure you know what you are asking for, because this was genuinely country. We appreciated the local knowledge, the homemade jams and sauces, the friendliness of Joseph and Angie. We would definitely visit again if the chance presents itself."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of my favorite stays. Great for families
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Stayed for one night while traveling, wish we had a chance to stay longer. The cabin was wonderful, and the farm with the cutest friendly animals was just so charming!
We got in later than we expected, and the key was exactly where Joseph said we would find it. It was easy to get into the cabin, and he had left several lights on for us.
Between the master bedroom downstairs, and the huge upstairs sleeping area with three different comfy beds, you could sleep seven people here easily. If you have mobility issues, it’s steep narrow stairs to the 2nd floor. Bathroom had modern fixtures.
Downstairs there’s a cute sitting area and a great kitchen - the double oven was impressive! There’s a coffee maker.
The area is very private, just us and the sweet dog, goats and alpacas who wanted pets.
If you are a barefoot family like us, we did find a few dead bugs that snuck in - a wasp on the floor upstairs and a couple sharp staples in the wood so you might want to wear shoes."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend. Thank you so much Joseph. We will definitely be back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely place to stay! The kids were totally taken in by the friendly animals are thrilled to spend time with them. The setting is a farm, so by nature it's not completely 'clean'. However, for an old farmhouse, it felt fine. We would happily stay here again!
Oh, and for these Westerners, the fireflies were a great attraction. :)"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The interior was done in very nice farm decor and the beds were comfortable. The setting was outstanding. ..so beautiful and rural. But, we were taken aback by an old stained toilet setting outside on the deck, popped dangerous nails on the deck and rusted table and chairs. The place was so nice and so peaceful. Seeing the horse, goats and dogs proved delightful, but sitting on an unkempt deck with our coffee was disappointing. Once he gives some attention to the deck and removes the toilet, I would happily give the stay a 5 star. Please also remove the metal farm implement on the floor. Someone can trip going to the bathroom during the night and be seriously hurt."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the best time and look forward to visiting again! Joseph was very welcoming, very responsive, and included our son in feeding the animals. We enjoyed visiting the precious animals and their personalities. The pond was fun to fish in the mornings and evenings. We loved getting to disconnect and live the farm life for a few days and my son is already asking when we can visit again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed at the Orchard House while in Georgia for a wedding. We arrived VERY late in the evening and the host was very accommodating. There were plenty of kitchen amenities and the spaces were clean. We all loved walking around the farm and seeing the animals right out the window. The host took our 8 and 9 year olds to ride through so mud puddles and they had a blast. Definitely lots to do if you’re looking for a place to just hang out and enjoy the space.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow. This place is an absolute GEM. It’s so much better than the description! It’s a entire farmhouse nestled into the most incredible hobby farm. My kids absolutely loved all the animals and the full Playground. I wish we had been able to stay longer. 10/10 recommend
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If your desire is to disconnect and spend time in nature this is the place! The hosts were so kind and welcoming! The animals I fell in love with. It was wonderful to come out on the deck each morning and be greeted by the sweet baby goats and the Great Pyrenees! I heard whippoorwills for the first time in many years! The house is rustic but the bathrooms were roomy, clean, and well-appointed! The double ovens were the bomb! I got to spend time with many in my big family and will look forward to visiting again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Joseph was so kind- I had mentioned I’d be traveling late and when I had not arrived by the initial time I thought I would he actually took the time to reach out and be sure I was okay. With self check in he did not have to do that but he did. I appreciated that. The farm house is exactly what a farm house should be- it’s like going back in time. Cozy, comfy, and lots of farm animals - pond for fishing, and a big playground if someone has little ones. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at the farm. Joseph was a wonderful host and always willing to include the kids in whatever was going on with the animals. It was a nice, relaxing stay that our children loved."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little country home on a wonderful farm with lots of sweet animals to love on and admire. No TV so it’s perfect for a family getaway and time to reconnect. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Orchard Farms with our family. It is a working farm and exactly what we wanted. Peaceful and private, yet easy to access. The views, animals, and authenticity of the house and farm were all great. While we didn’t get a chance to meet Joseph in person, he was a great host and very responsive."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful, unplugged getaway at Orchard farms! Recommend if you would enjoy some beautiful surroundings and peaceful unplugged time. Charming house .. fire pit, animals to visit with. Our family loved our time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was great! Exactly as pictured! We had fresh farm eggs and herbs waiting for us! Shannon was gracious and responded quickly! My family wanted to stay longer! Thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an absolutely fabulous experience. Steers Place has everything going for it and the host (Shannon) could not be more gracious, very pleasant and extremely accommodating.
Steers was immaculately clean and neat, lacking for nothing.
I have stayed in many many 5 star hotels and or resorts. There is not a single one as great as Steers.
Additionally I was especially delighted with the bed and its linens. Extraordinary!!!!’
I will return again and again!!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this place and Shannon!!!! It was very peaceful and just an amazing environment!! We will definitely come back and stay! Even through the hard times of family passing away, I woke up with a smile on my face and being able to go outside and love on some animals made it even better❤️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved the cottage. What a wonderful place- very peaceful and easy to get in and out of. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friends and I loved this cute little space. Definitely will be back!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was fantastic! I was driving in after a long 10-hour drive and got in very late. The place can be difficult to find at night as the address provided sent me to an empty lot. No matter, though, because Shannon had sent me directions and pictures of the area at night so I could easily find my way! She was very communicative even late at night. The place was very comfortable and my dog enjoyed his morning walk saying hi to the cows and other animals on property. Luke, their ranch-hand, was also very welcoming and helpful. Very safe area in North Georgia."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was absolutely stunning in every way. Shannon did an amazing job and you can tell the heart and soul that was put into designing it and putting it together. The cottage has everything you need for cooking meals on the farm. You can also look outside the window and see bulls, donkeys and cows. I mean how often does one get to do that? I am very appreciative of Shannon letting me and Wednesday stay here. Shannon was very friendly, responsive and let me feed a calf! I only booked one night originally but Shannon was very flexible with adding another night. Thanks for such a wonderful experience, Shannon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very pleased with everything about this place, it was perfect! Shannon had fresh farm eggs on the counter and a little note to welcome us. She was a great hostess, I would recommend this to everyone! She made us feel welcome, we truly felt like we were at home."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing cabin and Shannon was an amazing host, Will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ready to get away from it all? GO HERE! This is the perfect place to unwind, enjoy nature, and soak up peace and tranquility. Also, you can bottle feed baby cows - how amazing is that?! We were also able to bring our dog with us and she loved the outdoors as much as we did. Finally, Shannon was absolutely the best! She was incredibly flexible with the check in time, responsive to our messages, and she even provided us with delicious farm fresh eggs (which we enjoyed on the porch in the morning). I can't recommend this place enough and I can't thank Shannon enough for her wonderful hospitality!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing little place, all the animals are so sweet and Shannon is a really great person and easy to get in touch with and really helpful. I would definitely come back"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful time. Thank you Shannon.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t say enough wonderful things about this listing!! Shannon is an amazing hostess and so easy to get in contact with. She opened up not only this adorable home to us but also her farm. We were able to meet the animals, and our son had the BEST time getting to feed the calves and look for eggs, which we got to take back with us! Farm fresh eggs are so good. Such a wholesome environment! The property was easy to find and access. There is a Dollar General just down the road so even though you are enjoying the country, you have quick access to essentials. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my very favorite airbnbs! Shannon was very welcoming and there were so many personal and thoughtful touches, like farm fresh eggs and she provided a dog bed for our pup. The kitchen was fully furnished and had everything we needed. It was such a peaceful and serene area. We went on several gorgeous hikes on trails nearby. I would happily stay again next time I’m in the area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start by saying that this was THE CLEANEST AirBNB that I have ever stayed in. Shannon has an eye for detail and everything was there that I needed. Farm fresh eggs greeted me along with cows, donkeys and geese! The surroundings were amazing…less than 2 miles from multiple waterfalls and crystal clear creeks. The sun setting over the mountain was beautiful and the 5 minute drive to the top of the mountain looking out over “The Pocket” was breathtaking. I never locked my doors. I just felt very safe here. I had no fear that my work equipment would get stolen. I can’t wait to bring my wife and kids back here. This is going to become a routine stay when I need to “get away”."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot in NGA farm country. Super close and convenient to Jarrod’s Place MTn Bike Park.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jafer and Chanel were super friendly and were really fast at responding messages!! The tiny house was beautiful and clean. Thank you guys for coming to check on us after an early morning thunderstorm!! We lost power for a few hours but we weren’t upset at all. The windows are very easy friendly, and we enjoyed the breeze! They even offered us coffee from a local coffee shop!! We checked out a day early just to spend extra time with family and the very unexpected happened!! They refunded us the last night!!! Never requested/or thought of it but that just shows how kind hearted they are !!! Thank you guys for everything !! We enjoyed the peaceful, quiet, no cellular device family time!! And thank you for the board games and movies, that kept us entertained!! The 10hr drive was worth the experience!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always great staying with you.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jafer and Chanel are the best hosts I have ever had! So kind, friendly, welcoming.

I took daily walks around the pond with my cats, they loved it and so did I!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely peaceful, cozy, accessible location. My friend and I had a wonderful time enjoying the simplicity and abundance of nature. Highly recommend ;) No Wi-fi was definitely a perk."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming tiny home, great for two or three people depending on sleeping arrangements. All the notes around the place, the communication, the lovely setting and clean lodging made it a great stay. It’s dark, quiet and rural, unplug and enjoy.
Being so close to Jarrod’s Place, a mountain bike park, it’s super convenient for our needs.
Thank you so much, we hope to come back again soon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Please was nice and convenient for a weekend away

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A TINY HOME full of peace and contentment. I throughly enjoyed my coffee time with the birds and squirrels and the sounds of nature.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Everything is beautiful, clean, and we enjoyed getting away from the busy city for a while."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely love this place! Yes, it's out in the middle of nowhere but that was the point! To get away from the noise, distractions, etc and be able to relax in a beautiful, peaceful, and quiet environment. Being isolated from everything was a very nice break! No signal, wifi, etc was surprisingly one of the best things for us during our stay....no worries at all. Just us. We can't wait to go back! Th owners were so nice and gave us our space. Yet they made sure to let us know if we needed help,, they would be there to help. We definitely will be back as long as they will have us!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just the right size for holiday trip.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this place, especially if you're seeking an escape from your hectic daily routine. With no wifi or phone service, it's the perfect spot to unwind and recharge. Plus, they offer all the essential amenities and more!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 would recommend this place, especially if you’re wanting to get away from your busy day to day life. There is no wifi or phone service which makes it a perfect place to disconnect and reset.
They have all the amenities you would need and then some!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jeff and Chanel were very helpful and professional and the tiny home was lovely.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was fantastic. The host was extremely accommodating and the cabin was so cute. We loved being off the grid and it was super close to our favorite bike park. We will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"OMG!!! This was the best weekend off the grid literally! My husband and I needed a quick quiet getaway. This was more than we expected. The host were extremely helpful and responsive. The tiny home was simply amazing, beautiful ambiance and scenery. Everything we needed was right there in the tiny home. We did venture into the city for dinner at the Jerusalem Grill, which was a great recommendation by the host. We enjoyed ourselves distraction free of social media, phone calls and other people. 10 out of 10 ‼️ We’ll come back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Jafer’s. It was the small get away from the city we needed. Tucked away in the back of the property we had privacy and there was plenty of space outside for us to appreciate nature’s frequency. Wish we stayed an extra day. Everything was very clean and decorated well.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and felt brand new! Didn’t have any issues without having wifi as they provided their personal home’s network for emergencies. They provided extra snacks and goodies in the fridge too which was a nice touch after a long day of hiking. Definitely book your stay here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, serene and beautiful setting for this tiny home! Hosts were very responsive and kind and flexible. Easy to get to and felt like a retreat. Would absolutely recommend this house to anyone looking for time away in the country."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is a perfect country getaway for someone looking to loose service and time out in nature. Perfect location to go off-roading at Dunaway GAP OHV which was right around the corner. The property itself was beautiful, quiet, and far enough from the main house to feel secluded, but close enough to ask for anything if need be. Keep in mind there isn’t service for about 7 miles when you pull on to the road, but sometimes that what you need in life is to disconnect. We will absolutely be coming back and highly recommend the property, owners, and location for those looking to slip off into the mountains!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect lodgings for experiencing Paradise Garden. Wonderful hosts, thoughtful and responsive."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The rental was perfect. It was completely grannycore chic with original art I appreciated. The bed was super comfy. Nice touches with water and biscotti waiting for us. We would recommend this spot for any southern contemporary folk art lover.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing place. The people of P.G. truly know how to treat you well!! They were right on top of anything we needed, gift shop was the same! I loved being in Paradise Garden every day we were there. Great art to see! Howard's Garden is a place not to miss! I cannot describe the feeling of being there....
Make a plan to go, It blow you're mind. You feel Howard's spirit. You will not be disappointed!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Paradise Garden was such a wonderful experience. The opportunity to walk the garden at night felt like such a rare privilege. Not only was the garden spectacular but the cottage itself is absolutely lovely! I especially like knowing that my stay helped contribute to sustaining this magical environment.
Calvin and Hobbes were a real treat too!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage with after-hours access to the gardens. Always a treat to stay here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t have been any more pleasantly surprised in finding, booking, and staying at the suite at Paradise Garden. Lovely, quirky place with so much charm and interesting history. Perfect for artists, lovers of art, and anyone just looking for a unique experience. The staff were all lovely as well. We will certainly be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A magical stay at a charming Airbnb! Loved the folk art decor. Very cozy, with comfy bed. The cats were fun to see on the porch and so friendly, with Calvin accompanying us to the garden after dark. Paradise Garden was amazing!! We had rain on our visit and would love to come back in better weather. A wonderful spot and the charming little airbnb was one of my favorite stays ever!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The staff at Howard Finster’s were great hosts as well as the BnB hosts. I appreciate everything you did to make my stay enjoyable. A BIG shout out to Cameron for taking the time out and calling me over an issue with my neighbor. I can’t wait to visit again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,SO INCREDIBLE. I recommend staying here if you are visiting Paradise Garden. It allowed us to have ample time in the garden (24/7 access!) so we were able to really soak it all in. Great amenities and super cozy. The person taking care of the shop was queer and created safe space for queer and trans people in rural Georgia - loved this vibe.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic! Easy to check in and get around the Garden. Staff was super friendly, as were the cats."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place for a quick and safe stay to sleep on a long trip
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay! The house was amazing and we felt at home. The best part was the fact we could see the whole garden with no one else around. Our tour guide hobbs the cat was there to show us around he was really helpful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to Paradise Garden and we had another delightful stay. The home was clean and comfortable, and we enjoyed exploring the gardens after hours. Thank you for sharing this magical place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay; Unit 1 is comfortable and fairly spacious, with many decorating touches drawn from or inspired by Howard Finster's Paradise Garden. The area is quite quiet, with only occasional noise from the highway a few blocks away. The special attraction is the Garden itself, which is directly across the road and accessible at all hours for folks staying at the AirBnb."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was my first time visiting Paradise Gardens and I'm so glad we decided to stay at the airbnb! It's very reasonably priced especially because it includes admission to the gardens. The airbnb was cute inside and out. We especially loved the artwork in the house and all the books about Howard Finster and other artists. The kitchen was well appointed (my boyfriend made a 4-course dinner while we were there). Loved that both the airbnb and the gardens are dog-friendly. But my favorite part was having access to the gardens after hours. Loved having the whole place to ourselves! It was magical to visit after dark and in the early morning.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There’s a reason why Paradise Garden is so highly rated on AirBNB: the combination of cute bungalow and unlimited access to Howard Finster’s visions is a unique experience. Highly recommended to anyone interested in folk art and Southern culture. Also, Donnie and the Garden crew were unfailingly friendly and welcoming, willing to chat with us and share the projects they’re working on. Stay in Suite #1 if you’re a cat lover—Calvin and Hobbes will visit you, so bring treats."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paradise Gardens is such a gem! We loved staying here and getting access to the gardens at night, reading the collection of art books in the cozy cottage and immersing ourselves in Howard Finster’s world."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, the gardens are amazing, the cottage was cozy and had what we needed!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical from beginning to end. So glad I stayed the night here- what a perfect, inspiring and cozy birthday weekend for me! I’d recommend to anyone who appreciates art and purposeful living.
The accommodation was very comfy and we had all we needed. Extra special to have access to Paradise Garden outside of official visitor hours. Thank you so much 💐"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve dreamt of coming to paradise gardens since I was a kid, born and raised in GA with family history in Summerville, and Howard Finster is one of my favorite artists. I came here with my wife to celebrate my 30th birthday and it was wonderful! Very peaceful, the staff were very hands off and just let us do our thing. The decor at the Airbnb made us feel right at home - it was amazing. We’re already planning on coming back!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Me and my family greatly enjoyed our stay! Exploring the gardens on our own time was a real treat! Safe and clean accommodations with an artist’s flair. Loved introducing my son to Finster’s art!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and Cozy. Loved the art and style, a mixture of vintage and modern. Hope to get back there soon to enjoy the museum."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our Paradise Garden stay! Lovely place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It exceeded my expectations. Perfect, peaceful retreat that reinvigorated my creativity, just as I needed. Super hosts!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magical place with great hosts. We had the best time. Can't wait to come back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great! Exactly what we expected. Access to the Garden is fantastic and the place is really cute and decorated nicely. The shower is quite small, so if you’re tall, it might be an issue. But it more than makes up for it with water pressure and heat! Also love that it’s pet friendly!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had so much fun. Cool to go in gardens at night. Hosts were very welcoming and helpful!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place! Comfortable and cozy and relaxing stay over Christmas. Our 4 nights was wonderful and we were also able to have our 2 dogs with us in Suite #1. Paradise Garden was magical and beautiful and we are so glad to have experienced it. The people who worked there were so kind and hospitable and lovely. I never wanted to leave! Loved the whole experience very much! I highly recommend the Airbnb and Paradise Garden
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came for Paradise Garden, but were very impressed by the guest house. It was homey, extremely cosy, and felt like a natural extension of the garden. Being able to walk the garden at night was a huge plus and added another dimension to our stay. As if that weren’t enough, everyone involved was friendly and responsive. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Paradise Gardens, and it did not disappoint! As always a great place to stay, quiet, and very clean. An added park is staying at the cottage gives you 24 access to the gardens! The caretakers are especially helpful and willing to go above and beyond to make sure you were satisfied. Looking forward to visit number three in the future."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a very unique experience. Loved the cottage and the garden…we explored both by day and night. Only problem was the heater could not keep up with the cold temperatures in the area while we were there. Never reached the higher setting we tried in the early morning. In the whole, though, what we were expecting of Paradise Garden."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A really wonderful stay--everything was clear and the space felt good to be in.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Do not hesitate to book at this wonderful property. The airbnb was cozy and had all the amenities you could want. The Gardens were amazing and inspiring and I learned so much about the life of Howard Finster. A major plus that they allow dogs. Great stay, would come back anytime and recommend to anyone looking for a dose of creative inspiration."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paradise cottage #1 is delightful. When I visited, the front porch glowed with holiday lights. The interior is decorated with Finster-inspired art work.
Your stay helps fund the Paradise Garden Foundation. Paradise Garden is amazing – spiritual, contemplative, colorful, peaceful. Be sure to watch the video inside the white handicap walk way.
The cottages are directly across the street from Paradise Garden on a quiet, rural, residential street. At night it is so quiet you can hear the owls. The 1940’s cottage is spotlessly clean. Comfortable bed. Wood floors. The shower is small, but the water pressure is strong. Easy check in and check out.
Communication with the hosts was excellent.
Gorgeous hiking at nearby Floyd State Park and Cloudland Canyon State Park.
The photos and description accurately describe this charming cottage. Everything is comfortable, and welcoming. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is like Heaven. The house perfectly fits the “vibe” of the gardens while being a cozy and homey place to stay. I’ll always recommend this place, and these hosts, and I’ll always come back as often as I can!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is fantastic. We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend. We felt welcome at home the whole time. This is a sincerely special getaway.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. The bed and pillows were so comfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"How can you adequately describe how amazing something is when there’s no other place on earth like it? This was absolutely by far one of the best places we’ve ever stayed!
The bungalow could not have been more comfortable or appropriately decorated for the location. The beds were amazingly comfortable and everything was super clean. We felt at home the minute we opened the door! The fact that it is directly in front of the gardens makes it even more special. The hosts were full of super helpful information, and they were always quick to respond to any of our questions. You could easily spend two or three days, just walking through the gardens, and you would discover something new every time. We will absolutely positively be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great quiet clean place next to Paradise Garden. Loved sitting on the front porch after dark
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place came highly recommended by my good friend. Everything was as described and the hosts were absolutely great. My only difficulty was the strong smell of mold. I am sensitive to mold but this was another level. Also the place seemed to need a lot of dusting. Maybe air filter and repainting the walls may help. It was a great stay other than the mold and dust. My husband described the smell as something you would expect in an older home basement. I think it was more than that. However, as I said earlier, hosts were great and everything was as advertised . Also the access to garden after hours was spectacular."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a truly unique and special place! Very much enjoyed my stay (super comfy bed!) and Paradise Gardens is magical.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Found this adorable rental when we decided to drive from Fort Myers , Florida to Illinois!
The house is so cute and is filled with interesting books in each room ! We loved learning about Henry Finster and his art! Walking Paradise Gardens at night was pretty neat! I wish we would have stayed longer to really look at everything! Our hosts were amazing and communication was superb . The cottage is pet friendly and our two fur babies loved the home . Rock City Gardens is one hour away and is pet friendly and we highly recommend going there if you stay at this Airbnb. Thank you so much !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is far and above the most extraordinary Airbnb experience I've ever had. Spending the weekend at Paradise Garden was inspiring, eye-opening, and awe-striking. Getting to explore and appreciate the gardens at night was one of the most magical experiences of my adult life and I'm leaving more spiritually in touch and ready to turn my trash into treasure. If you're reading this review and thinking ""this chick seems over the top"", think again and book PRONTO! I'm willing to bet you'll feel the same.
Special thanks to Ace and Donnie for their hospitality. The staff is just as special as the grounds. <3"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paradise Gardens is a very unique place. everything was clean and the hosts were easy to communicate with. I will definitely be going back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd visit and we really enjoyed it. Only complaint is that there aren’t a lot of restaurant choices nearby, but that has nothing to do with Paradise Gardens. The cottage was very comfortable and cozy, the staff was very friendly and the Gardens are just beautiful. We will be back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Paradise Garden! We booked both the bungalow and suite 1 since we had a large group, and both were wonderful! The decor was folksy, artsy, and so fun, the beds were incredibly comfortable, and having the gardens all to ourselves in the evening was such a fun bonus to staying on the property. We also enjoyed the company of Calvin and Hobbes, the resident orange kitties, who were the friendliest furry tour guides. We hope to come back again soon!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was amazing! We loved staying right across from Paradise garden, and having all hours access to it. This is a must for folk art enthusiasts!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderfully whimsical and cozy spot. Many surprises and treasures inside and amazing nighttime access to Paradise Garden. Heavenly!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had no idea that this place existed! What a great learning and growing experience. We were looking for dog friendly spots and this came up as we were in the area on business. So glad we found it.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our third or fourth time staying here, and always refreshing, inspiring, and peaceful. Tickled by the ice cream sandwiches in the fridge and the cleanliness and peacefulness of our stay. Can't wait to return to this special place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to visit Paradise Gardens this is the way to do it! We had such a lovely, peaceful stay and it was nothing short of magical to explore Howard’s work after hours. We loved it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay in a very eccentric Airbnb. Very close and easy access to the garden, and we loved the lived in feel. Definitely check out the guest book(s) while you’re there!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's such a pleasure to stay in the home at Paradise Gardens. The suite was quirky, comfortable and felt like home. The ability to walk the gardens after hours is enchanting. Such a lovely place to rest and relax."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't go to Paradise Garden Airbnb for splendor and opulence. The shower is tiny in Suite 1 (if you have a generous build, you may want to consider a sponge bath), kitchen chairs not that comfy. BUT I love the after-hours access to the garden and the wonderful front porch where you might entertain the resident cats, Calvin & Hobbes while reading Tom Patterson's book ""Stranger From Another World"" which is provided in both suites and I think is the best written about Howard.
Excellent communication with hosts if I needed anything."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the all access pass to Paradise Garden. I came to see Finster's work and it was such a unique experience to be able to have the key to get in. We arrived on Sunday in time to check out the gift shop and the inside exhibitions. Monday is closed to the public and nobody was in the other side of the duplex so we had the entire grounds to ourselves. Such a cool way to experience the artists' work. The airbnb itself was clean, cozy, and plenty of space for the two of us to relax a bit. We are both pretty allergic to cats, but with an allergy pill the first night we were totally fine. Had a good time checking out Sloppy Floyd park and the Summerville trade post, and playing bocce ball in the big yard next to the Airbnb."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, peaceful and romantic.❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a unique property! A very comfortable stay in a quirky bungalow filled with art and inspiration. It was so cool to have after hours access to Paradise Garden. We will def be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’ve visited Paradise Gardens before, but this was our first time staying at one of the properties. It didn’t disappoint! There was a slight snafu with check in due to another guest arriving early, but the staff was quick to react and solve the issue. The apartment itself was cute and comfortable, and had all of the amenities listed. If you plan to do a lot of cooking, it would be helpful to bring your own pots, seasonings, and knives, but there was enough there to make do for just a couple of meals. The TV is also not very big, so if you have sight issues or need to read subtitles, you might not be able to take advantage of it. I’m fairly picky about beds, but found this one to be soft and comfortable. We also loved getting visits from the friendly cats!
Of course the main draw is access to the gardens, and that aspect was wonderful. Definitely recommend checking out the gift shop and walking around while the sun is out, but you’ll also want to visit again after dark!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,it was a wonderful unique stay . Will be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing. Very unique experience—we loved everything about it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a treat to enjoy a sweet lodging experience that checks all the boxes especially those in the category of unique, whimsical and well appointed. Have to mention the magical evening wandering Paradise Gardens with the orange cats. Much gratitude for making this available."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Enjoyed exploring the garden. Would love to come back for a longer stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love staying here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pure magic! Charming, cozy, eclectic in all the right ways...just what you want when staying directly across from Paradise Garden. A thoroughly enjoyable place to stay, with 24 hour access to the garden included too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the living spaces inside and out! The bed was extremely comfy, the furnishings eclectic and fun, lots of open outdoor space to walk our dog, and very quiet! The shower is a tight fit but great water pressure and temperature. Would definitely return for another stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cottage right at the front entrance to the Garden. Cottage is full of great folk art. There are 2 cats and a dog that roam the property and visit. We bought treats and looked forward to their visits. The Garden is amazing. Summerville is a sweet town - not much else to see or do. We enjoyed being able to contribute to their economy. A memorable 45th wedding anniversary surrounded by amazing art!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an absolutely amazing stay! It was a little outside our normal AirBnB budget, but when I read that we’d have 24-hour access to Paradise Garden, we immediately booked!!!! The home itself exceeded our expectations, with the ART, the amenities, the books, the games….being able to be alone in the Garden at sunset was a stellar opportunity. Hosts were extremely communicative, and even refunded the pet fee without me asking after we decided not to bring our dog. Thanks for the much needed, relaxing stay. Highly recommended."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great stay! If you love art, enjoy the outdoors and need a peaceful retreat... this is the place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed staying at Paradise Garden! The house was very clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood was very peaceful and quiet -- beautiful birdsong was all that I heard! A great place to ponder afterwards all the beautiful profound messages that decorate the Paradise Garden grounds. It was very easy to find the place, especially with the hosts' excellent instructions. The parking was also conveniently close to the house. A great alternative to a hotel, to support the preservation of a good man's inspiring Vision!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay for our Honeybee Festival weekend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Delightful!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an unbelievable experience. The cottage itself was beautiful, so comfortable--they thought of everything. Even if it was just the cottage, this would have been a wonderful place to stay. But staying at Paradise Garden was absolutely magical."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donnie and the folks at Paradise Garden made our stay so easy and pleasant. The duplex is charming, on a dead end street right across from the PG. And we had a key to explore at night or before opening. It was a once in a lifetime experience, and it was so pleasant. Easy, beautiful drives in the NW GA mountains. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have visited Paradise Garden previously, and always thought of staying there, so we were happy our travel plans coincided with an overnight stay. Having the Garden to ourselves was wonderful & magical! So happy with our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy cottage at Paradise Gardens, Howard Finster's masterpiece. If you stay there, you get evening access to the gardens and the night-time lighting of the gardens. Reasonable dining a short drive away."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really peaceful and Paradise Garden is a national treasure. Fifth stay there suite one with kitchen is everything for the perfect stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here! Very responsive hosts and such a cool art retreat. Visiting paradise gardens at night was the peak of our visit, it was inspiring and a little spooky which is exactly what we were hoping for. We definitely will be returning!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a magical little duplex on the grounds of folk artist Howard Finster's Paradise Gardens. We walked into this adorable space and felt we were in a fairy house! The decor is pure Finster with eye-candy everywhere you look. Super comfortable easy chairs and sofas, the bed is divine, good lighting by the bed, fascinating book collection and folk art magazines, everything you need in the kitchen—and steps away from the enchanting spiritual sacred ground of Finster's life-work. We arrived in the late afternoon and had several hours to wander in the gardens and it's a good thing: the rain moved in overnight and our plan to see the rest of the property was thwarted. But the hosts helped us see some highlights (the documentary video of Finster is a must-see), and we consoled ourselves with merch at the darling gift shop. We are already planning to return for a multi-day stay. HIghly recommended. You will always remember your visit here with great affection."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos gave an accurate account of the furnishings, which was good. It is eclectic and folk art deco. It was very clean! The Paradise Garden admission was a plus! It is actually on the National Register and very unique. I would definitely recommend Paradise Garden to anyone that enjoys something unique, cozy and private."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"the Paradise Garden was absolutely wonderful and inspiring. the suite was perfect, loved being able to visit the Garden after hours. Great art, comfy spaces, highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very kind and communicative hosts! I had a peaceful stay. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! I've stayed in quite a few air b&b homes, and this one just had a charm about it different from any other. It was so cozy and I felt right at home. I loved both of the porches and absolutely adored the garden at night. It was so peaceful and secluded and I would most definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,enjoyed stay over all
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great peaceful getaway with a fun vibe. the bed was comfortable and the bedding soft. I loved the added touches like the games, a lantern to see the garden at night and a bocce ball set. Would stay again and definitely recommend."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a really special experience! Having access to the gardens is as magical as it sounds. The Airbnb is super cute, comfortable and clean. So many fun touches!
When I visit next, I will definitely bring my own food. Restaurants in town are pretty mediocre, at least the couple we tried! But this is not criticism of the Airbnb. That was perfect!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the small Airbnb at Paradise Garden. It was just as advertised. Felt like a little travel back in time. Enjoyed the visit of the gardens. The employees were very nice and helpful. LOVED THE ORANG TABBY CATS!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were not expecting to be surrounded by so much Finster artwork. The bed was very comfortable. The back porch was a welcome surprise with 2 chairs when the sun was hitting the front porch. By far, the absolute best amenity was the ability to walk in Paradise Gardens whenever we wanted. Seeing it after the sun goes down was magical. And we had it all to ourselves! We will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovey stay. Great staff, solid communication. We had a ball roaming Paradise Gardens at night. Cats Calvin and Hobbes were excellent hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super nice place right across from Paradise Garden which is why we were in the area. Private after hours access to the Garden is really special. The cottage itself was cozy, clean and comfortable with everything we needed. Would highly recommend it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place! The house was spotless and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had been wanting to visit Paradise Gardens for years and this was the year to do it! Once I found out you could stay here too - this was a no-brainer. To have this kind of experience is wonderful- you have access to the gardens after hours! Such a remarkable experience. The hosts were great, the vibe was great. I loved it! Plus, they have two very friendly cats that roam around - they slept on the porch of the bungalow and I felt like they were taking care of me, too! Five stars all around!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Suite #1 was exactly as described, very clean, and had plenty of room. Everything we needed was there. I loved the Finster artwork that was displayed throughout the Airbnb. Our five year old daughter was, at first, a little frightened by Loretta Lynn.☺️
The hosts kept in constant communication with us and were very sweet. There were two adorable kitty brothers that hung around and would come inside for treats and pets. Our daughter absolutely loved them! Although this area is our hometown, we had not walked through the entire Gardens. The fact that we had access to the Gardens, day or night, was an awesome addition to our stay! I understand that hosts have to conserve space, where they can, in their places. The shower in Suite #1 is very small. If you have claustrophobia issues (like myself), the shower is a challenge. The size of the shower is the only thing I would change about this Airbnb. Check in, and out, was a breeze. Thank you, so much, for a wonderful stay! We will be back!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed visiting Paradise Garden and were pleased we stayed onsite. The suite was comfortable and met our needs.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely and quite cozy. Will stay again when in the area.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little artsy cottage !
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the Airbnb at paradise gardens is cozy, clean, and beautifully decorated with REAL ART! The hosts were responsive, flexible, and generous and having access to the gardens at night was really cool!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This has been a bucket list trip for a long time and expectations were absolutely exceeded. A beautifully kept Airbnb with charming decor and such a homey vibe. We had no problems checking in and the opportunity to explore Paradise Garden on your own is unparalleled. Will be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at Paradise Gardens! Can’t wait to return again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a local attraction for our family and my daughter wanted to explore the gardens at night. It was everything she wanted and more. We had a wonderful trip.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Of all the unique vacation rentals my husband and I have visited over the years, this was one of our absolute favorites! Magical, inspiring, quirky, wonderful and just overflowing with good vibes.....a perfect complement to Howard Finster's Paradise Garden next door, which we were so delighted to experience for the first time and amazingly be able to explore after hours! The cottage is clean, charming and comfortable, in a beautiful peaceful setting with a nice yard for doggies and an awesome front porch. I just wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful Stay!
If you are reading this, you already know about Howard Finster and his art. Staying so close to his homestead and his grand vision is ideal. The suite is just like Finster's art, full of books and art on the walls - a controlled and pleasant chaos. And with the immediate access to Paradise Gardens, especially at night, was magical. Plus the staff were exceptional.
I would stay here again in a heart-beat.
And if you are an artist, there is no better place to feel inspired. Don't hesitate to book!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you like to discover charming, unique, off the beaten path types of places, this is definitely the place! It's just bursting at the seams with eccentricity, both inside and out. The history of the place and it's creator are everywhere, told in books & pamphlets, paintings, sculptures, collections & oddities and that's just the Airbnb cottage! The stay includes access to the grounds where the much larger collection is displayed. The cottage itself is old but well maintained, has everything needed for a comfortable stay, and is very easy to find and access. The hosts were friendly and accessible also, although we had no issues."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best Airbnb experience. So easy and relaxing. It was cold while I was there. Inside was warm, cozy and having lap cats was the best. Hobbs was my constant companion and Calvin was my snuggle buddy overnight.
I had a lot of changes with this trip. The hosts were always available and accommodating. Clean! No notes. It’s a peeve of mine, that some Airbnb’s have notes telling you to shut the lights off, lock the doors, flush the… seriously. I felt at home as soon as I stepped on the porch.
Same goes for the staff at Paradise Gardens. Very helpful and engaging. I learned so much and really appreciated it.
I really hope I get to come back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good place to stay for chill art people, probably for little romantic getaways or even group things with all the nearby stays including the other duplex suite"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little get away.
My husband went to the Garden 3 times.
Our artist hearts are full!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Truly unique experience. The access to Paradise Gardens made this stay memorable. Such an inspiration. We already want to go back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best ways to experience the iconic Paradise Gardens is to stay here! Your money will go towards the nonprofit foundation that restores and maintains Paradise Gardens and you can have exclusive after-hours access to the site. The airbnb is also a lovely and well maintained place to stay. We loved our experience here and would gladly rent again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Paradise Gardens was lovely and peaceful. We loved walking the gardens both during the day and in the evening. There was always something new that caught our attention. During the night I would sit on the couch at the bungalow and look across the street at the folk art church all lit up. It was so quiet and peaceful. The host were very friendly and responsive to our questions. The bungalow was quaint, comfortable and charming. We look forward to returning again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this is such a cool spot to stay. staying at & visiting paradise garden is such a treat!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great visit. The location and facilities were perfect. But I wish we had brought our own food to cook.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was an incredible, unique experience. Our suite was comfortable and clean, and we fell in love with the cats. Being able to walk through Paradise Garden in the quiet evening hours is something I’ll never forget. We will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is incredible! By far more personality than any place I’ve ever stayed! Exceeded expectations. Exactly as advertised. Clean. Safe.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of my very favorite places to stay. Everyone at Paradise Garden is so nice. The mattress at the AirBnB is like sleeping on clouds. I always feel so rested, rejuvenated and inspired by my visits here."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Access to the garden at night was wonderful! The place is very comfortable and has interesting art and decor.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent value, excellent art."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Paradise Garden is a wonderful place to visit and Suites 1 and 2 are fantastic to rent if you have multiple couples coming to enjoy Howard Finster's Paradise! It is awesome to have a shared porch and both of the Suites are creatively decorated with lots of special touches! Stay here! You'll be glad you did!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hidden gem
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good location - good host - would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Folk art, up-cycling and the Bible. Paradise Gardens is filled with awe- inspiring work in all medias. The staff are gracious knowledgeable & helpful. The cottage we stayed in was comfy and full of glorious art - what a lovely surprise. For a slice of life outside the box, this is the place to experience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical and secluded this place is like the home you go to in your dreams. The details and immaculate service pair splendidly with the beautiful environment. Will be returning!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Very unique place and great communication from hosts.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Paradise Garden is so amazing, and this place is very charming and decorated with lovely art."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place! Everything was clean, as described, and easy to access. The suite was comfortable and had great amenities. I especially enjoyed the books in the suite. Exploring the Gardens after hours was a special treat! Staff were welcoming and helpful."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cool place! It's clean and well appointed, and it has so much character. Getting to explore the Garden in the evening/early morning was really nice, and hanging out with Calvin and Hobbes was the best. We had a really nice getaway at Paradise Garden, and we look forward to visiting again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Delightful stay! The cottage was cute and the bed super comfortable. I enjoyed having Paradise Garden to myself to explore. My tour guides, the cats Calvin and Hobbes, made sure I saw everything and kept me company on the porch afterwards. Great for a weekend getaway from Atlanta. I’ll be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paradise Garden is a magical place! Suite #1 was neat and clean with a funky decor. Hosts were great, along with two friendly cats. We had a great time exploring!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time to stay at Paradise Garden this year. We loved it the first time around and the second time was no less delightful. This time we were here to attend a geocaching event in Rome, so we were not at the house as much. Still, everything worked out very well. The owners responded promptly to our messages (of which there were few) and everything was laid-on as expected.
The accommodation is ""just right"" for the two of us. It's clean, comfortable, and fairly well equipped in the kitchen. We had more of our meals ""at home"" than we did at restaurants.
We also appreciate the added nod to Howard Finster's artistic talents in the way this unit features his art with various decorations as well as several books about him. The special benefit of full access to Paradise Garden is just great.
All in all, we slept well, ate well, and in the midst of our planned activities we still managed to take the time to enjoy the ambience of this historic site. Our thanks to the owners for everything they did to make us feel so much at home. We hope to return this time next year."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are a folk art or Howard Finster fan, or if you want to get to know a little more about this folk art icon, this is just the place for you. The duplex/suite/cottage I stayed in was lovely and decorated with assorted Finster pieces. And you've got the opportunity to wander the grounds after hours, and take it all in at your own pace. The lights in the evening are rather cool. My host was quite responsive on the question front."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful art respite for the soul!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The duplex is decorated so nice! Having night access to the garden was amazing!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The accommodations were lovely and having access to the gardens at night were the icing on the cake! I would highly recommend any Howard Finster fans to stay here and spend as much time soaking up his work as possible.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little cottage on a beautiful, peaceful property. Comfortable bed, spic and span clean."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cozy, comfortable place to stay. It was perfect for the two of us. And it is full of such fun surprises throughout."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend!!!!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A very quaint little cottage right across from the office/exhibition hall/gift shop offering access to the gardens any time we wanted to go for a stroll. They provided all the little things like extra blankets, coffee & creamer, brochures, local menus, smart tv, etc. to make us welcome. We stayed in the pet friendly suite and there was a great side yard for our dog to walk and play. Truly wonderful place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a true treasure. I’ve stayed here twice and will definitely be back. I highly recommend staying here if you can!! I’d give it 10 stars if I could.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect night in a clean, well appointed facility..."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. The after hours access to the gardens is priceless to just enjoy at your pace and if like us got in later then expected. Super friendly.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Paradise Garden! It was our first visit and everything was exactly as described. I learned so much about Howard Finster through the books left in our living room and from Donnie, our on-site host. The place itself was older, but very clean, uniquely decorated, and so comfortable. The neighborhood is very quiet and there were even baby birds living in a gourd right on the back porch area. Paradise Garden had so many visual splendors and each time we walked the grounds, we found something new to see. Like everyone else, we especially loved the kitties, Calvin and Hobbes! They both slept with us but Mr. Hobbes definitely let us know when he was ready for some treats or a trip outside in the wee hours of the morning. Luckily, the beds were so cozy we went right back to sleep. If you’re a cat lover, I suggest you stay in Suite #1 and bring plenty of cat treats! Overall, this was a cool and unique stay and I would highly recommend a visit!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely lovely place. We particularly enjoyed the feline welcoming committee when we arrived. Decorations were great, bed was very comfortable, and the cottage was very clean. Would absolutely stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a wonderful, inspirational stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough good about this place. Such a great place to experience. And I don't use the word lightly, this place is an experience from the place you'll be staying to the time you spend touring Paradise Gardens. It is a worth your time to look at every item this one of a kind artis created. It's not you fancy indoor climate controlled musem; in this place were ALL THINGS go and spend time after they have been used up and thrown away. Here they are honored and frozen in time to be pondered and remembered. My prayer is that this place will continue on an be preserved so no one may forget!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful hidden gem that is a must-see for all
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the garden was fantastic. The cabin was great for two people and we were able to enjoy the garden at multiple times of the day- each one being a totally different experience. All the staff is always so friendly (even letting us know we left a package there and mailing to us). I can’t say enough good things about our trip. There are several things to do in the area, but we stayed close to home base except for meals. Will definitely return in the Fall."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The kitties and Lucy, the dog, were very friendly and definitely were a value add to our stay. Thanks for hosting us!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Paradise Garden suite was a wonderful place for us to stay while visiting family. The gardens were fun to walk through and Calvin and Hobbes were such sweet cats and your guides! Will definitely stay again and recommend to family when in the area.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best Host we have ever been associated with, An incredible venue!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an eclectic and cool experience! Being so close (literally across the street) from a major art installation and National Landmark, has a certain vibe and energy to it. We were so relaxed and became very focused on art and reading. Plus, everyone is so nice. We met the director of Howard Finster’s Paradise Gardens and were invited to an art show in Rome. We loved our stay - clean, quirky, relaxing. It was such a highlight of our weekend. We look forward to staying again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, wish I had a week to spend with Calvin and Hobbes. One overnight is not enough! Caretaker was very friendly too."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic experience!!!! We’re coming back in the fall! It couldn’t have been more perfect!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! We look forward to coming back .
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a whimsical property that is decorated in the spirit of Paradise Gardens. The rooms are comfortable and roomy, excepting the bathroom which is SMALL indeed. It indeed is right next to Paradise Gardens. The property is private and quiet and includes after hours access to Paradise Gardens."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our time at Paradise Garden was so wonderful. The Airbnb was so clean, well-designed, and well-stocked with cookware. The porch was also so nice to sit out on! Hobbes the cat was so sweet and hung out with us most of the evening. The garden was also just so lovely - the work of Rev Finster is inspiring and being in the space was truly transformative!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quirky, cozy place that’s clean, has great hosts, and everything I needed and wanted for a weekend stay. Recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! The museum was very interesting and lots to see there. The space was very comfortable and private. Really enjoyed my stay and wish I could have stayed an extra night!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location of the cottage couldn't have been better. We especially enjoyed being able to visit the garden during the evening. Calvin and Hobbes were especially welcoming and great additions to the visit. The humans were too!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything it’s promised to be. The two cats were a very nice addition to our stay. Super sweet.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely stay!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this lodging because it was in near to family we were visiting, and because it had a king size bed. We knew nothing about Howard Finster or his work. The unit is in a small historic house that has been divided into two side by side units. The online description of the unit is accurate. The house is located next to an attraction called Howard Finster’s Paradise Garden. Visitors can park near the house to visit the attraction. We will never forget this place because of its unique-ness."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interact with this incredible environmental artwork overnight! The team was super kind and flexible.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely incredible adventure. you definitely want to pick up the walking guide to experience and understand the stories behind the art. I would encourage you to first experience the garden without taking pictures to capture the essence, then go back and take pictures of those items that stood out, then finally find a couple places to sit and absorb the spirit."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun and unique artistic house. Beautifully decorated, fun animals... what is not to love? The 24 hour access to the garden is quite peaceful. Usually for us AirBnb is a great place to stay, but rarely is it like this where the AirBnB is mostly the draw for going. Well worth it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank You 💕 This was our first AirBnb ever. Definitely new to the experience but it went very smoothly and we loved everything about our stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a delightful adventure! A friend and I stayed in Suite 1 and Suite 2. Both units were adorable and very comfortable. We were even greeted with cookies and waters in the unit. The two cats kept us company on the front porch. Paradise Garden is truly incredible and exploring at night was, oh, so magical! The museum is very cool and gift shop is very well equipped and the staff were very helpful. We very much appreciate all of the efforts that are being made to maintain this treasure."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,An interesting place to visit. In the process of renovation
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Howard Finster would be so proud of all the people who pitch-in to make this place such a pleasure.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a treasure. The garden can be overwhelming if you do not have enough time to really explore. Being able to stay there and enjoy the grounds in your own time is a luxury.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay at the Finster Gardens. The accomadations were cute and we aprreciated the funky decor. Loved seeing Howards art in the cottage. The bed was very comfortable. Having access to the gardens after hours was very special.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very special place to stay at a very special site. Anyone who’s a folk art enthusiast will truly feel as if they are in Paradise!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We went to Paradise Garden on a whim and had the most magical time. The garden calls to you and staying on the premises allowed us to take our time and really explore. Next time I'm bringing binoculars for all the birds. Thank you to all beings celestial and earthly that keep Finster's Paradise alive!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just right for us. We really enjoyed it. Our hosts communicated well with us and were ready to assist with any issues - of which there were none, whatsoever. We hope to return in the future!
Paradise Garden is a true local treasure which we very much enjoyed visiting. Having full access to it enhanced our time. During the week, we were also able to visit Chattanooga, eastern Alabama, and the Cloudland Canyon State Park. All within easy reach. We are pleased to recommend this location."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You can’t pick a better get away place!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of my favorite places I’ve ever stayed!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing and intimate way to commune with Howard Finster's incredible work. It was an absolute privilege to tour the garden on our own after hours and again early in the morning, to really sit with the work and stew with Finster's beautiful message."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Having private access to the garden was delightful. And the cottage was convenient, comfortable and cozy."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You couldn't ask for a more peaceful and welcoming place to stay when you're visiting Howard Finster's Paradise Garden! This house has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on, and it's great to have after-hours access to the Garden included with the airbnb. And so much of Howard's art, all in the same place... wow! Thanks so much for making these 3 airbnb's available."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful way to spend time with Howard Finster's Paradise Garden. All tenants get 24-hour access and that alone was well worth it. The bungalow we stayed in was very nicely decorated and clean and it was pretty cool to be living amongst some of Finster's art work. Quiet tucked-away location, which made for a peaceful visit."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A fantastic, charming, comfortable and clean place to stay! Fascinating surroundings and super friendly cats added to the experience. Also happily surprised by the variety of gluten-free products at the nearby Ingles grocery store! Wish that we could have stayed longer, it was such a welcoming and comfortable place."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was lovely! The communication, decorum and historical attributes were excellent and fascinating! We only wish we had more time to spend here and fully explore Paradise Gardens! Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to share in this experience! Best! Audrey & Kevin"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Delightful, everything you need. Artsy decor, comfortable furniture, king bed! Adorable kitchen, bathroom and porch. We are planning our next visit!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay when visiting Paradise Gardens. Suite 1 definitely continued the funky vibe from the garden, while being nicely appointed."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little shotgun double, being from nola I felt right at home here! The gardens were mystical and being able to walk around at night was magic! The flea market down the road was a blast and the whole stay was so peaceful"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Paradise Garden. It was a lovely little duplex that felt very comfortable and the Garden itself is an inspiration.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying. I ended up having some difficulty with the dates, but they were very flexible and very helpful. As always a beautiful visit and a once in a lifetime experience."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a dream of mine to see the Garden and our travel plans aligned perfectly for us to stop for a night. The space was beautifully appointed with really everything we needed. Obviously it was a huge bonus to get to visit the garden alone at night and spend so long looking at all the sculptures and art pieces. Personally deeply enjoyed the cats on site. Will come back in the warmer days to see the garden in bloom. Highly recommended
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"what a special and spiritual place. the suite was perfect for our needs, everything was communicated perfectly. the magic that is this place!! i am so glad we could come and support the gardens. not many vegan options in the town nearby, but definitely go to trade day if you can! a flea market every tuesday and saturday year round. thanks again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You get a key to Paradise Gardens. WTF. I couldn’t have been happier.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We feel so fortunate to have spent the night at Paradise Garden. What a great experience. Everything that we could have hoped for and so much more. The place was clean and cozy and easy. And it just happens to be connected to a folk art Mecca that was created by the amazing Howard Finster. (BTW…. your key gives you access to the garden at night…. The whole place is lit up and it’s all yours and it is magical). You don’t have to know anything about Finster or art, to enjoy this place. You just need to be hunting for an experience that you’ll never forget. Enjoy!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Paradise Garden! The unit was clean, cozy, comfortable and beautifully decorated with Howard’s art. Plus a huge bonus was that the entrance to the gardens is included in the rental so we were able to see the art and gardens when we arrived before sunset, late at night when it was lit up with lights which was magical and then again in the morning before we checked out. Each time noticing something new. The staff was all helpful and friendly. We’re hoping to return again with our adult kids, it’s such a special place that leaves you feeling hopeful and restored!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There are few things more magical than having Paradise Garden to yourself under the moonlight and star shine. We had an amazing time exploring under the cover of darkness, which added a little bit of a creepy vibe (one that was welcome, by the way). The Garden itself is gorgeous, with a discovery around every corner and in every little pocket. We could have easily spent the entire night exploring and admiring the environment. It's very inspiring. The lodging itself is warm and cozy; it feels like home very quickly."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything as it says. Cabins are large with central heat/air. Decorated with Howard's own works and inspiring southern cultural affects and nic knacks. Stocked with excellent books on Paradise Gardens, art history, surrealism and MOREEEE. Games, coffee machine (with tea and hot coco if that's your thing), GOOD water pressure in the shower.
The real gem is that if you stay at a cabin, there's a key that allows you to access the gardens anytime during your stay. We had shown up around six after slowly moseying around Atlanta and had a blast exploring the Gardens all to ourselves during the golden hour!
Bonus: adorable cats; Calvin and Hobbes 🐈"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place with lots of thoughtful touches. Wonderful to stay in a place surrounded by Howard Finster's visionary art. Easy check-in and communication with both the hosts and the cats, Calvin and Hobbes."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"another magical stay at Paradise Gardens. Super clean, super cozy, can't wait to come back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely house! The bed was SO COMFORTABLE. I didn’t realize we would get to see the gardens at night but it was a magical experience. 10/10 would recommend

Bethany was a spectacular host and we will definitely be staying here again if we make it back to Rome.

If you are looking for a place to stay and this is available, book it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and tucked away, but at the same time very close to lots of shopping and restaurants. Only minutes from Berry College and Tennis venue which was ideal.

Extra towels is one of my favorite features of an Airbnb and I got it. The only snag we hit was that neither of us have an Amazon account and you had to have one to sign in to the tv to use the tv. A guest Netflix or something would have been lovely."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My husband is staying here while working about 20 mins away. He is a night superintendent so he sleeps during the day. This place has been amazing for him!

If ever back in the area he will stay here again.

The beds are really comfortable, and it's just a great, clean space with everything you need. The property is beautiful, and the hosts are super kind and thoughtful. They let us know about a craft festival in town over the weekend, which is something we love to do. We wouldn't have known about it otherwise. Highly recommend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, wonderful! This studio is better than the pictures. This home is perfect from the private entrance, the luxury bed linens and the country view. I would highly recommend this listing. Close to Rome and the activities but quiet country charm. Bethany’s instructions for parking, accessing the suite , and guest expectations are clear and concise. After a day of traveling, the cold water in the refrigerator was a pleasant surprise…there were snacks as well. This studio is wonderful for families or couples. We had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying again in the future."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place wonderful wonderful beds. Would stay here again no hesitation.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bethany was great and the suite was excellent!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bethany's place was beautiful. We stayed here for a wedding that was right around the corner. There were thoughtful touches like snacks and ideas for where to dine out. Bethany was super communicative and helpful. Their cat, Gus, was the sweetest! Definitely stay here if you want to stay close to Rome."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay in Rome, GA. The home is gorgeous, spacious, inviting, and clean. My kids didn't want to leave. Bethany is so sweet and considerate. Will definitely come back."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place.
It was the perfect place for us to visit our daughter at Berry College.
Very quite and safe place.
Hosts were super nice and great attention given to details.
Comfortable beds.
Very clean."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bethany's place was so gorgeous and comfortable. The beds were as soft as a dream and the comforters were pillowy but not too hot. The room is furnished as if you are family staying there. We loved the tree swing! Definitely book this place, you won't regret it!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome!! Just a few minutes to everything, clean, and private!! The hosts are awesome and we will definitely be staying here again!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars does not do this place justice. The property is beautiful and Bethany and her husband are wonderful hosts. We came in town for a tennis tournament and the place was perfect for our group of four.
The hosts were easy to communicate with, left us with everything we needed (and some post-match snacks!), and even let us celebrate our wins outside at their beautiful fire pit area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb is such a gem!! Everything was just as expected, and honestly even more beautiful in person. The property is gorgeous. My family enjoyed the basketball goal, cornhole, and the swing was a huge hit. We took several walks down the street and just enjoyed the beauty of the area. Check-in was easy. I loved that we knew exactly where to park and the entrance to our room was private and made it very easy to come and go. The room itself was absolutely perfect for our family of 4. It's such a nice, open space with everything you need and plenty of room. The beds were super comfortable, and we all slept great. Bethany (and her family) were amazing hosts and really just good, kind people. They are there if you need anything, and I mean anything!! We had an unfortunate situation with our car battery being dead, and they were so kind to give us a jump. We also had some rain that delayed the tennis tournament we were there for. Bethany was so thoughtful to offer board games for entertainment while we were waiting. This was hands down an amazing place to stay, and there is no question that we will be staying here again when we are in town for some more tennis."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a very peaceful & relaxing stay.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bethany's place is exactly as advertised. We had a wonderful stay. Place was quiet and we experienced some well needed sleep and rest.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking for a place that is quiet, spacious, and looks better than the pictures this definitely the place to stay. I had such a wonderful experience here and I believe you will as well! Give Bethany’s place a shot you will not be disappointed!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bethany’s space is just perfect. The property her home sits on is beautiful and well maintained just as the unit is. The space was clean and the beds and linens were so comfortable! Bethany was very communicative and her family made us feel welcome every time we encountered them. 10/10 would recommend this space if you’re traveling in or near Rome!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in Bethany's place! It is a beautiful home and the Airbnb feels very separate to their living space so that wasn't an issue at all. We had our own parking area and entry and check in was smooth. The suite itself is adorable, very clean, and had everything we could need, including snacks, water, coffee, towels, and a great shower. The bed was also super comfy. We needed a place to rest overnight while driving I75 cross country and this was the perfect spot to get away from the traffic and get some sleep. We felt very safe and comfortable. I would definitely use this rental again in the future. Thanks!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BLESSING! If I was only able to choose one word to describe Bethany’s place, it would be blessing. The location was awesome. Checking in was super easy. The room was clean, organized, well stocked, and everythingeverything is super comfortable. There is no other place I would stay if I go back to Rome. I was in Rome for my youngest son’s soccer camp at Berry college. My older son and I stayed at Bethany’s place. We were able to come and go with no issues and enjoyed both Bethany’s place and the city of Rome. Bethany was quick to reply with the very few questions that I had. I felt safe, comfortable, and at home during my stay at Bethany’s place. Don’t think twice about booking an opening. It is a very short distance to the downtown area and Berry college. Even during rush hour it didn’t take more than 15 minutes to get to either place. There are so many great things about Bethany’s place that cannot be described until you’ve stayed there. Once my youngest son finished soccer camp we drove to the Ocoee and took a river rafting trip. It was not more than an hour and 45 minute drive to the outpost and about the same time back to Bethany’s place. I hope this review helps anyone looking to stay in Rome."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful space that is even bigger then it appears in photos. Bethany does a great job of communicating and making sure her guests have what they need.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a find. We booked Bethany’s place last minute as a midway stop between Florida and Ohio. My husband was a little hesitant since the rental is over their garage, but after he saw the place, he was impressed. The entrance is private and the unit is very up to date. The bed was so comfortable, my husband checked to see if it was a Puffy (it was a Purple). Our 18 and 20 year olds both commented how comfortable the pillows were on their beds. (Running commentary in our family how hotels and rentals have the worst pillows ever.) We didn’t have time to explore the area, but there was a binder with restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay again!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place over all
Only problem I had which is out of evolves hands was that I have big dogs that aren’t that dog friendly and the neighbors have their dogs roaming free into the property so it was hard for me to take my dogs out to pee and into the house"

Other than that we definitely will be booking this place again! ♥️"

Wifi signal was great and we loved the board games available. When we arrived the place was so clean which made us feel safe during these times.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you to Donnie and Mary especially at Paradise Garden for hosting our dream wedding on 4.4.24 and welcoming us and our children. We have three boys in diapers, one a severely disabled nearly five year old, and our sons were treated with such kindness. Our strollers, a double and a single, were easily accommodated by sidewalks and ramps. We are so thankful that God lead us here. We are so grateful for Johnathan marrying us 🫶 he also cleans the Airbnb and did a wonderful job! I have ADHD/OCD/PTSD and do not always communicate/interact well (I have anxiety) and as I was talking to Donnie and Mary I squatted down in the floor, pouring my heart out to them and crying about personal life things aka ""emotional dumping"", and I realized they had quietly mimicked my body language and were squatting in a circle with me there in the floor, just listening. Thank you both. I can't always speak without getting distracted but I can write, I thank God for each of you. Thank you for being kind 💛"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at the Paradise Garden. It was absolutely amazing to wander alone after hours, taking our time. Thanks for this experience."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for immersing you in the entire Paradise Garden experience. The host was very thoughtful and knowledgeable about the gardens. Take time to view the video in the gift shop which includes a visit by Kieth Harrington shortly before he died.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Paradise Garden. The cottage was just as described. A big bonus is the key to Finster's Paradise Garden after hours. There was a beautiful full moon while we were experiencing his Garden.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I've been going to Paradise Garden's Airbnb for years with friends and it's always such a magical experience. Something about that place feels spiritual—and the accommodations are really clean, comfortable, and welcoming. Obviously, I will be back (again and again and again, haha)."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As all the other reviews have stated this is a wonderful experience. The unit was well kept and stocked, the access to the garden is amazing. Can’t wait to stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite place,"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I needed a quick getaway weekend to reset and refresh and this did the trick! My friends were able to book the other half of the duplex and we all enjoyed spending time in the garden, the museum and gift shop. It was lovely exploring the garden as a group at night and we had the place to ourselves. The house had everything we needed with a nice green space out back with a view of the garden in front. I’m glad we came and I am especially grateful to the Finster foundation for all the work they are doing to preserve the gardens and art. Calvin and Hobbs watched over us and were our personal escorts everywhere. We ate a great meal in town at the Crushed Tomato which I also highly recommend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here while visiting Paradise Garden and couldn’t have had a better time. Donnie and the other hosts/staff were welcoming, helpful, and just super nice to my brother and me during our stay. Visiting the garden at night was an especially cool experience. The airbnb itself was clean, comfortable, and also decorated with Howard Finster’s and others folk art. Overall was a one of a kind experience! Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have wanted to visit Paradise Gardens for a very long time. My husband and I stayed in Building #2 and it was fantastic. As an Artist myself, I loved the decor of the apartment where we stayed and the property was fantastic. I highly recommend staying on the actual property , specifically Building #2."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay if you are on a road trip and/or visiting paradise gardens!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paradise Garden is everything that you hope it to be. Loved it! Will definitely return. Very clean. As pictured.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The staff and gardens are lovely, and it was so interesting walking through the gardens and getting a glimpse inside the mind of Mr. Howard. The facility is simple, the grounds are very genuine, and as they have been over the years, that is part of what makes the journey unique; it is not a spit and polished venue; it is what it is and what he was.
The bungalows around the garden are all very comfortable, and it was exceptional to have the key to the gate to go into the gardens after dark and walk them. It was a different view of the gardens, which was fantastic.
We enjoyed the cats, Calvin and Hobs, and Lucy, the dog; it was an enjoyable experience and highly recommended if you want to learn about the legacy of Howard Fintzer and his art just by walking across the street from your bungalow.
The space was clean, eclectic inside, and extremely comfortable, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paradise Garden is such an incredible place! Always love my stays here.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paradise Garden. Our arrival time was two hours before usual check-in, we didn't expect early access to the house, but were really thankful that our hosts already had everything ready for an early check-in. Spring would be the best time to visit the garden, and get the full view of Howard's creations and natural plant life merging, but we had no complaints around our tour around the premises."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our third stay at the garden--and we'll be back!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s fortunate that this lovely place is up for lodging. We used it as a stop on the way to get married and it was perfect! Even if you don’t stay, the gardens are well worth the trip. I’ll be looking for an excuse to stay again."

Well maintained, spotless, and well stocked. We loved all of the Finster touches/art and found the grounds and front porch peaceful. Additionally, we absolutely adored the two furry friends, Calvin and Hobbes. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little comfortable quirky duplex. The after-hours access to the garden is the best part. And the cats.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a unique opportunity to stay at a super inspiring historical site and have after hours access to let it all soak in. I can’t recommend this enough.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a nice stay before going into the mountains. The access to the gardens after hours was really pleasant.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paradise Garden is a hidden gem in the middle of ""nowhere."" Our duplex was literally on the site with after hours access. Donny was an amazing host and guide to the gardens. He took a lot of time to answer our incessant questions. We had a very enjoyable time even though it rained throughout."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A rare opportunity to stay at a historic art environment! I returned here after 30 years and found it just as magical. Seeing the garden at dusk is an experience I’ll cherish. The suite was a peaceful retreat with character and cats, we felt right at home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little artsy room. Great hosts!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is okay if you want a quiet and peaceful getaway, it is small, and in the middle of nowhere not much things to do. But the little town is nice the people are friendly and an okay place. It was definitely a different and unique experience."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best airbnb ever!
Rev. Finster's Paradise Garden was my destination, so I was thrilled not only that it had it's own airbnb right across from the Garden, but that the furnishing resonated so well with it.
Best part was having free access to the garden at night. A whole different way of looking at it compared to the following day. Was glad I got to do both!
And Calvin and Hobbes were perfect gentlemen and affectionate companions."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very pleasant staff and super cute cottage.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The directions to the location were excellent. It was very easy to find the key and enter the house. The location was off the main road and was very private and quiet. The house was set up really nice and was very comfortable. The note about the two (2) cats was great, especially the warning that they WANT to get in the house. One of the cats ran in the house, but I got him out without much problem. I am a cat person and really enjoyed their companionship. At night, they would sleep on the porch in the two (2) chairs with cushions and wait to greet us in the morning. It was really cool having a key to the gate to the Paradise Garden. We arrived at sunset and enjoyed entering the Garden and walking around by ourselves at night when the lights came on automatically. It was like having a private personal tour with Howard Finster as our guide. The Paradise Garden was unique and beautiful with a spiritual background. It was well worth the trip to visit this special place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful! Comfortable and fun! The porch swing was delightful and having after hours access to Paradise Garden was the best.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique place to stay in north west GA, plenty of places to eat nearby and close to many outdoor attractions and parks. The two orange Tabbys on the welcoming committee were very friendly and a nice touch."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely way to spend the night near Paradise Garden! I booked a Monday night not realizing the garden is closed on Mondays. However, the rental includes a key to the gate, so I had the place to myself! What an unexpected treat! Very easy to find, super clear instructions and great communication from the host team. ❤️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay! We accidentally locked ourselves out and our hosts were so gracious and helpful and we got back in quick. Loved the cats presence and ability to access the gardens after hours- absolutely memorable and special visit!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was such a a nice stay and really neat to be able to walk around Paradise Gardens after hours! We loves being surrounded by Howard Finster's work and it was a very relaxing time.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! We enjoyed getting to go to the garden at any hour of the day or night. We walked through a total of 3 times, and felt like we had a fresh experience each time. We liked how this Suite was pet-free since some of our group has allergies, but we still enjoyed Calvin and Hobbes' (the cats) company as we sat on the porch and walked through the garden. Sloppy Floyd State Park and Little River Canyon are nearby for plenty of outdoor recreation opportunities. All of the staff were friendly and responsive. We spoke with Donnie the most, and he answered any questions we had. Overall, we had a good time!
P.S. We ate at Henry's BBQ for dinner, and I would honestly recommend somewhere else. The BBQ was alright, but none of the sides were very good. Just an FYI!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely time and what a fun and quirky house! It reminded me of staying at my grandmother's as a child. Fond memories! Directions and check-in were easy breezy. The house and neighborhood were charming. And the kitties were super friendly. We loved sitting on the porch, drinking coffee, and petting Calvin and Hobbs! We are already planning our return trip!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a fun stay! We had a great time.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donnie and Olivia were so gracious and welcoming to me when I arrived and visited the studio/shop. I had wanted to visit for years and finally was in Georgia and able to do so. The 2 cats were great company as I toured the garden in the evening. A wonderful place to experience. Thank you, Howard, for your wisdom, art, and legacy. We all could use a Paradise Garden now!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a magical place to stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at Paradise Garden and enjoyed 'living' in the art. The best gift was the night access to the garden. It was magical under a clear sky!
The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved this! Being able to access Paradise Gardens at night was such a perk. The sparkly mosaic tiles were just magical. The Suite was so clean and comfortable and filled with personal touches and art. My son adored our weekend here too!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable bungalow across the street from Paradise Garden--couldn't be more convenient! Very comfortable bed, funky/artsy decor, unique and memorable overall experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to stay in this one-of-a-kind, cozy, magical location."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just a lovely place to stay. So Special to get to enjoy the gardens all to yourself. An unforgettable experience.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The garden is fabulous, and there is no better way to see it than to stay there as a guest. The house is cozy, and the hosts are great. I really enjoyed it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paradise Gardens was a wonderful place. Loved learning about Howard Finster!! Very relaxing and welcoming! Hobbes, the orange short tail kitty was very affectionate and a delightful pleasure. We needed a shower chair or stool for our stay, and one was provided and waiting for us when we arrived. Thanks to the Host for such a pleasant experience."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The duplex is very cozy and peaceful with Folk Art decor. The hosts were very accommodating.
The cats, Calvin and Hobbs, were a welcome addition to our visit.
The introductory video about Howard Finster was great and the mirror house area was particularly reflective.
The Folk America Gallery, just 5 minutes away, was interesting and also exhibited some Howard Finster art."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paradise Gardens is a place that turns the ordinary and simple into something extraordinarily eccentric and beautiful. The duplex is an extension of that beauty, as it is filled with Finster’s art, his mission, and his stories. Be sure to read some of his stories, in his own voice, before heading into the gardens. His stories really make his art come alive. The accommodations are comfortable enough and the hosts are fantastic! Don’t miss this one."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an amazing place! We could not have asked for a better experience. Calvin and Hobbes were a fan favorite. Exploring the garden on our own and at night was both magical and creepy in the best way possible. We will definitely be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We rented both units 1 and 2 for a night in December. The weather had been very cold before we arrived and was still chilly the night we were there, but the units were cozy and warm. We loved touring the gardens in twilight, visiting with the kitties, Calvin & Hobbes, and just basking in the comfort and folk-art decor of the units. We picked up dinner in Summerville at Thatcher's and enjoyed having dinner in our cottage. (The cats enjoyed some of it, too!)
One pointer for future visitors: both units have Keurig coffee makers and a Mr Coffee-type drip coffee maker hidden away. We were glad we brought filters and some good coffee so we could use the drip coffee maker and enjoy our morning brew. The selection of coffee for the Keurig was uninspiring.
Overall, this was a magical experience. Don't miss it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is a unique treasure! Clean, comfortable, accommodating space and staff with the opportunity to be a part of a magical, immersive art project. Must see and do for anyone passing through this part of the country. 5 stars!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,An awesome and unique place ! I would definitely recommend .
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts at the Paradise Garden AirBnB are friendly and responsive, and they are passionate about upholding Finster's legacy. Book here and help them support their mission! The place is adorable and comfy, the resident outdoor cats (Calvin and Hobbes) are a delightful bonus, and you even get after-hours access to the Garden."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When you want something different, this is the place.. So much history here that’s not just art. Music history too. From REM videos to talking heads album covers. Really cool to checkout and learn more about Howard Finster and his legacy in the art community."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful! It has been a dream to visit Paradise Gardens and it was so wonderful to be able to visit after hours so I could really take it all in. The bungalow is so sweet and there were plenty of thoughtful touches. Definitely recommend!

Quick and easy communication with the management. Make sure to go the Paradise Gardens!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paradise Garden is a magical place and the cozy suites right outside of the gates make it one of the best places to visit! If you are considering going at all, do it! You will be glad you did! Surrounded by art in a clean, colorful space makes Howard Finster's legacy live on and gives you a sense of wonder and joy at every turn!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Return visit, will come again. Such a fantastic, comforting space in Summerville Ga."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Howard Finster’s Paradise Garden! 🪴🌈☁️🪨
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely magical! The little cabin I stayed in was so cute and the decorations were adorable. I was really sad to leave and just wanted to stay there forever. Being able to have access to the garden whenever I wanted was also such a special experience. I went out there at nighttime and got to just enjoy the peacefulness of the place. Then early in the morning I went back into the garden for one last look and the two cats who live there, Calvin and Hobbes, kindly took me on a tour of the place, showing me all of their favorite spots. It was absolutely adorable. The hosts were very responsive and kind, the check-in was super easy, and the price was incredibly affordable. If you go to Paradise Garden be sure to stay there. You won’t regret it! It was one of the coolest travel experiences I’ve ever had! Thank you so much to the host and of course to the incredible legacy of Howard Finster!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very close to where I was teaching classes. I got there late after dark, I was glad that lights were on for me. I had to leave very early the next morning, so I wasn't able to visit the gardens. It was very clean and had everything that I needed for my stay. I do plan to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful, as always! Can’t wait for our next stay at Paradise Gardens. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little gem of a place.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The universe worked against our visit to Paradise Gardens, from booking the completely wrong dates to family emergencies and national weather concerns. But the property managers were completely understanding all the way through. They did everything to make our trip a success. We are so happy we were able to visit and share this experience with our children. When we arrived we were greeted by the property cats, Calvin and Hobbs. The cats gave us personal tours of the garden and made us feel at home. If they could talk, they would share so many stories. These two seemed so happy to have us visiting. In the morning it was raining, when they heard us on the porch they came running... through the rain! These two were a definite highlight for us. The garden at night was spectacular. So much to explore and bask in. If you stay overnight, make sure to explore the garden at night. Suite #2 is small and clean. The suite has a small dorm fridge and microwave only. If you are unable to eat at the local restaurants and bringing your own food, this may be an issue. The king sized bed is comfortable and the pull out bed is firm. The AC works great. And the front porch is great for drinking coffee or a night time cocktail. The suite has many books about Finster and a tour pamphlet. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend you staying here too."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here every chance you can! Paradise Garden is magical anytime you visit, but when you stay the night, nighttime strolls in the Garden take you to the moon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This last weekend, I had a very unique experience at the AirBnb in Summerville, GA - the Howard Finsters Paradise Garden Suite #2. Loved having access to Paradise Gardens as well that houses the art of Howard Finsters known at the “grandfather of folk art”. Everything was well organized and special. I’ve already referred other friends to enjoy this fun location! Where else can you go to stay and have entertainment too?"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a true hidden gem! Less than an hour outside Chattanooga. There is so much to enjoy just on the property itself. Exploring during the day and night was truly a unique experience. If you are looking for a getaway in the area you should definitely stay at the paradise garden🪴 we will be back often!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I stayed here with my mom and my 3 year old son. We absolutely loved it! What a magical place! The room was perfect and beautiful decorated. We felt right at home. The garden was spectacular and we are so grateful for this place. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a great size. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be visiting again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My third stay, it's become a birthday gift to myself. Small quarters, but efficient and well-stocked with books about Howard Finster. Love the porch swing and visits from Calvin & Hobbes (just happened to have cat treats in my pocket). Having after-hours access to the garden is great, especially in the summer. Great communication, love this place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a sweet and charming little cottage! Loved the colorful decor and books on Howard Finster that allowed us to gain more insight on his works. The porch swing was perfect for a morning cup of coffee. I even got the pleasure of having both Calvin and Hobbes come sit in my lap-- very friendly cats! If you're planning to stay for more than one night and don't intend to eat out too much, there's a Walmart super close down the street for microwavable dinners and snacks. There's not much else to do around Summerville aside from the Garden, but that's not too big of an issue if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing getaway. Maybe bring an instrument or a book ;) Would definitely come back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a perfect location if you like the eclectic and just to relax and unwind love this location
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Your Air bnb is comfortable, clean, and perfectly described in your listing. I love all the artwork in the suite and it adds to the experience. It’s ideally located across from the museum and garden. This was my second visit and I’m sure I’ll be back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Their Suite #2 is invitingly comfortable with carefully selected appointments. This is a wonderful opportunity for a private visit in the garden (sans tourist) at dusk. Don’t miss it!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Totally different, unique art display. Whole visit very reasonably priced. Be aware, many restaurants closed on Monday."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what an amazing experience. making plans to come back soon. after hours access was the best part! and the garden cats :)

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great spot!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Low key and friendly stay with private access to the eclectic garden compound of Howard Finster. Our two year old was convinced fairies lived around every corner. Well equipped, adorable cottage only missing a hot plate. Easy contactless check in, great instructions, comfortable stay. Would recommend!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Paradise Gardens B&Bs are right on site. They are well designed and very clean. It was easy to check in and out and the staff are professional and helpful. We very much enjoyed our stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying here was wonderful especially if you are a big fan of Howard Finsters artwork/world. Having the place all to ourselves after it closes was such a special perk and for art lovers was super fun to be able to give ourselves our own selfguided tour with the booklet they provided. We took a million pictures and are already telling all of our friends that it is a fun and artsy place to experience. :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for an amazing stay!! The house was immaculate and very cozy! Even has a box fan in the bedroom which I can’t sleep without! They have thought of everything!
Having access to Paradise Garden and the Art Fest was my main reason for booking this. The garden at night is the most magical place!
And I can’t forget Calvin and Hobbs! Resident fur babies that had the best manners! I have 9 kitties at home and they helped me with this. The nearby city of Rome Georgia is an amazing place to visit during your stay. Awesome restaurants and wineries and a beautiful downtown area with everything you can possibly think of. You can just park your car and walk the whole downtown area. We did not make it to Fifth Ave. which is supposed to be the arts area but will definitely next time!
Everyone affiliated with the Garden that we met are amazing people trying to keep this going forward.
Will definitely return!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is what Airbnb was made for - a completely unique experience in a charming, eclectic, and funky home that still provides for all the comforts. And being able to wander through the garden alone late at night is something I’ll remember always."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! A wonderfully maintained place and excellent group of staff and managers. Love the history and accuracy of Howard Finster's life. Thank you for your Airbnb accommodations.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is great. Paradise Gardens is wonderful to stroll through, and we enjoyed seeing Howard Finster’s art incorporated throughout our stay.
The nature is fun to experience while just relaxing. And if you’re a cat lover, you may have a couple friendly companions."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The suite is clean and comfortable with great décor, but the best part is definitely getting to go explore Paradise Garden. It's such a magical, peaceful place to visit."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, artsy place to spend the night. Everything was perfect and it was just as described. Literally 10 yards to the entrance of the gardens. Well worth the price and the staff at Paradise Gardens were so polite and helpful."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical place! I loved it!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! We try to stay here every time we come to town. It’s affordable (costs as much or less than a night in a decent hotel) and located close to family.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Filled with art and fun! It was great to have access to paradise gardens as we wished. Highly recommend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place-the cottage at Paradise Gardens!! We walked around in the afternoon—and loved it at night with the lights on!!! The cottage is artsy decorated ❤️. Everything you need—plenty of towels-coffee-snacks!
Delightful experience!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very charming place to stay. Hosts were very accessible and responded very quickly to all questions. Would highly recommend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun place to stay! The perk of being able to visit the gardens after hours is so worth it. My two teens loved the cats... they spent a lot of time outside enjoying just petting the cats. In town pizza, a nighttime garden walk and still time to sit on the couch and relax. A great stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great garden of art, and wonderful place to stay."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very unusual, unique experience. The night time tour was led by the cat, who also wanted into our room at 5 am . I would not recommend the night time tour except for the photo of the main building that could be photographed from outside the fence."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience — great way to support art and enjoy a vacation.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a great place to stay and gain some wisdom and inspiration, search no more! This place is very eclectic and motivational. Highly recommended 👌 Clean, friendly and fun! We love Calvin and Hobbs! Sweet cats that do try to come in, so beware."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it! Cozy, great art inside the cabin, and you have access to the garden at night."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cottage. Very cozy. Interesting place to stay. The gardens were great.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It may not seem like a likely destination for a getaway…but it is a welcome respite. To wander through the gardens during the day is fascinating. To wander the gardens privately as a guest at night is magical. The lights cast such a warm and inviting glow. If you are creative, you cannot help but be inspired by the enormity of Howard’s body of work and his devotion to his calling by God. I have been several times and always notice something new and interesting. The homes rented by the foundation are quaint and pay full homage to simpler southern roots. The town of Summerville is charming and the people are friendly. A wonderful place to unplug and recharge."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Garden Suite #2 was eclectic, comfortable, clean and well-appointed ... and we enjoyed exploring Howard Finster's Paradise Garden just across the street. (private evening entry to Paradise Garden was magical!) The hosts were communicative and very helpful. We look forward to returning!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a unique place with fun colors and artwork. It was clean and welcoming albeit a little rustic.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I felt intimately connected to the artist, Howard Finster because his art (or art similar to his) was throughout the cottage. The hosts stayed in communication, asking if we needed anything. Plenty of towels. My husband would have liked a bigger TV, but I didn't care about that at all. I have family near to the Airbnb and I know we will be back. Travelers will be able to look across the street and see Finster's homestead and the art surrounding it. What a view!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very cute place literally across the street from the entrance to Paradise Garden. The suite is decorated with several Finster works of art and other artists also, and having after-hours access to the Garden is incredible, especially at night. The hosts were very helpful and were very fast in responding to my questions."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simply fabulous!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful stay. Very clean and felt secure and safe. Would stay again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique experience to be able to stay in close proximity to Paradise Garden, to be surrounded by Howard Finster’s art, and to explore the gardens after hours. A very nice option for a safe, contactless getaway during the COVID pandemic."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love staying at paradise garden’s Airbnb’s! Authentic and comfortable. Recommend for anyone that wants a unique experience.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic place to stay. Beautiful garden. Hands down best follow up and communication. Highly recommend!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We always love staying at the garden. This was our third time staying at one of the properties. We’ve stayed at every property now and we love them all for different reasons. Suite 2 is cozy and comfortable. Decent, firm bed. Suite 1 has my favorite bed by far, but I like a softer mattress. Small kitchenette area was also perfect for us and our short stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suite 2 was so nice and cozy. Bed was very comfortable. We will definitely be back!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Quaint and simple. Hosts are communicative and pleasant. Won't lie.. the wooden-cut-out-art of the man in the living room scared me twice as I was walking into the room in the dark! 🤣. Bed felt like memory foam so was firm which is good for those needing more support. Pillows perfect.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. We arrived later than originally planned, so being able to wander the gardens after-hours was perfect. Calvin & Hobbes were friendly and adorable. The suite was clean and we loved having the cozy blankets since it was a little chilly outside. Loved the art everywhere and the books in the living room. We plan to stay here again next time we make it back this way."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place and awesome hosts. Wandering the garden after hours during sunset was wonderful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a must stay. The cabin was So comfy and inspiring we were actually planning on just living there! Access to the gardens at night is the most intimate and inspiring way of experiencing Finsters magic.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a nice place to stay, but the best part is definitely the private access to the Paradise Gardens. Amazing!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An artist’s dream. This place is cool, cozy, and clean. Would def stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"201 Suite 2 is delightful! Very relaxing, enjoyable and the Garden is a treasure."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very unique spot. we were comfortable
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was as expected. Clean and located in a quiet area.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magical and how wonderful to have it all to yourself at night! We spent Halloween night in the garden! The cottage was clean, comfortable, and as cute as it could be. We will definitely be back!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Viasiting Paradise Garden and staying in their Air B&B was a totally delightful experience.
I have been a fan of Howard Finster's art work for years so I was thrilled to see his work up close. The cottage was cozy and very comfortabl;e and very clean. Loved the entire visit!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, boho chic! Great visit with super nice hosts."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is truly one of the most distinctive and special Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. Highly recommend!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is great and the garden is incredible. We biked from Atlanta to Summerville and the home was a wonderful spot to recharge. Very comfortable bed. Hosts were very communicative.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Expect a clean, interestingly decorated unit! We enjoyed being there."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, friendly hosts, great access to Paradise Garden and beautiful views at night. Fun place to stay and great art!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our overnight stay was great! Clean, quiet, enjoyable, great books to read and just across the street from Paradise Garden!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The garden is a wonderful place to explore, especially at night. What a gem!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,just a fun quirky place to stay..highly recommend it
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super cute and comfy. The mattress was AMAZING, which is super important to me. My kid loved the place too! Good games for the rain we encountered. And awesome books! The actual space “Paradise Gardens” were so well preserved and we feel so fortunate that it is still around to be experienced. I’ve always wanted to visit Paradise Gardens, and getting to stay on the property and have night access made it that much more unique and enjoyable. We will definitely be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As a previous resident of Summerville, and was there during the acquisition of the property and all that entailed - THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO VISIT THE GARDENS hands down. You quite literally get the keys to the castle! Best time to visit is at dusk - when the weather is calmed and it all feels hushed - it is truly magical. Great for kids, romantic partners, friend trip, everyone.
The lodging is great too. I packed pasta salad and picnic supplies so we could still have all our meals on site. Everything we needed was there. Neat and tidy. I liked meeting the guests in the suite next to us. I liked that the B and B had a lot of fitting art in the space.
Wonderful."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a tucked away jewel! Paradise Garden is a special place and these accommodations just add to the experience. We ate at a great BBQ restaurant downtown and then took a drive to Cloudland Canyon State Park. We will definitely be back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful furnishings
Perfect for kids!
Kids had so much fun with porch swing and front and back porches!!
Sparkling clean.
We rented both suite 1 and 2 for our kids and my brothers family and his kids. They al had a blast!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an incredible experience! The space was filled with Finster art, as well as being clean, comfortable, and above all cool in the Georgia heat. We especially enjoyed being able to let ourselves into the garden early (and for free!)—a huge perk. Hosts were communicative before and during the stay; we wanted for nothing."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations are nice and humble and exactly as described. Very comfortable for two people. Paradise Garden is a place for both surprised wonder and quiet contemplation.
There is no substitute for being able to spend hours and hours wandering, reading, and thinking. Staying here makes that type of immersive experience possible. Highly recommended."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The keys to walk the garden at night beyond inspiring , magical , different perspectives from day and night but always magical , that’s the most fantastic stay I’ve come away with great vibes ! So happy !"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're considering a stay here, do it!! The suite itself is perfectly comfy and cozy, and the access to the Garden is out of this world. I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to stay here and I look forward to doing it again soon."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Paradise Garden! Suite 2 is super cute and the decor is on point kitsch and you feel immersed the Howard Finster experience.
If you didn’t bring your own cat, a cat will be provided for you. Although Calvin and Hobbes weren’t permitted in Suite 2. Sad for me but nice for folks with allergies."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little airbnb! Beautifully decorated, cozy and quiet."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think I could spend endless amounts of time at Paradise Gardens. It is gorgeous, relaxing, & profoundly thought-provoking. Donnie, Calvin & Hobbs are ALWAYS amazing hosts. We arrived fully stocked with everything we would need for the weekend and never left until check-out time two days later. None of us wanted to go home yet. Thank you! Thank you, for providing a much-needed respite from the whirled. We WILL be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Your passage through this planet should include a stop here! Best part is the after-hours private access to the Gardens, it makes for a wonderful dusk-time stroll (although our stroll wasn't totally private, we were joined by two very friendly neighborhood dogs who snuck under the fence). Accommodations were as promised and very comfortable. For dinner we went to the Crushed Tomato, excellent wood-fired brick oven pizza and homemade cheesecake."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suite #2 was exactly as described with amazing artwork and detailed amenities. Very clean and quiet. It was a pleasure to be able to visit the gift shop and a joy to be in Paradise Garden at night. I took tons of photographs and it was special since I was escorted around the grounds by Hobbes, one of the ginger kitties. I hope to stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb experience is just that, an experience. It was truly one of the most magical, incredible experiences of my life. Howard Finster’s Paradise Garden is breathtaking, and it’s even more magical at night. As a guest of the Airbnb you have access to the Garden at night, which normally is not available for anyone except guests, and that means you can explore this magical place basically alone. It’s beyond incredible, especially for folk art lovers. HIGHLY recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun and quirky place to stay. We loved the accommodations and Paradise Gardens was both interesting and inspirational. Summerville is a funny little town, though. One of the highest rated local restaurants (Jim's) only accepts cash payments (30 years behind the times) and few businesses kept their posted hours making it difficult to find other things to do. Hand written signs indicated they were on vacation , or that they'd altered their opening time for that day, or they were just weren't open, and it was a Saturday when you'd think business would be best. The flea market was fun, though, and we really enjoyed visiting ""Sloppy"" Floyd State Park. It was beautiful and serene, and not crowded at all. The hike to the Marble mine wasn't too difficult and we enjoyed the pool and waterfall at the top."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic, peaceful, and inspiring little nook in the Southeast! We thoroughly enjoyed our quick visit and slept like babies in suite #2. It is exactly what we wanted and needed. It feels like home — if home were super funky and cool! Thank you for sharing the space with us … and sharing in the spirit of Mr. Finster."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You can expect exactly what the photos show. It was clean and comfy! We enjoyed the porch and swing with an added bonus of hanging out with Calvin and Hobbes for our morning coffee. We would thrilling stay again if we come back to the area!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite #2 is very cute, communication with staff is excellent. This was a great experience!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was in Summerville for a court hearing and only had a short amount of time to experience this place, but it was terrific. Wonderfully unique, comfortable, and convenient to downtown. The snacks were a nice touch. Would definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome!! Loved the after hours access to Paradise Gardens. The bungalow was well appointed and clean.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very special place, and it was a great idea to stay at suite #2 to be able to explore the paradise garden. The place is clean, adorned with Howard Finster's art, and it had everything we needed. The checking was very easy, we got to walk the paradise garden a couple of times, and Donnie was really nice to talk to. Highly recommended and a great idea to stay to support this magical place."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off: Paradise Garden is once again a work in progress. By the time Howard Finster passed about 20 years ago, the grounds had started to fall into disrepair, a process which accelerated for about a decade or so before folks came in to restore it back to something resembling his original vision. Some places are off limits to the public for safety purposes, and there's construction equipment on site to further the work.
There's also a relative paucity of the famous Finster art on the grounds for reasons that are pretty complicated, but there's a representative display in the visitor's center.
The actual site represents decades of work by Finster and various family, friends, helpers, and etc. to convert a piece of soggy marshy land into a wonderland of plant life, color, and texture. Even without the big paintings of Elvis it's a remarkable place to visit, and I couldn't help but think how it would have been just the coolest place in the world to play as a little kid. It's wonderful, it's whimsical, and it's steeped in a specific kind of Southern charm.
Which brings us to the actual AirBNB space, which is half of a shotgun-style duplex. First things first - it's definitely cozy. There's a front room with a bar sink, a mini fridge, and a microwave, plus some armchairs and a comfy sofa. The bedroom is in back and has a large and very pleasant bed and a few more armchairs. There's a bathroom in between.
It's decorated in an eclectic and charming style, with bright colors on the walls, folk art (including some Finster replicas) everywhere, and some lovely older furniture that calls back to when this was someone's actual home. The neighborhood is still very much a working-class one, and the homes reflect that. This was a simple home for common folks, and that energy permeates the space. It felt like the kind of house my parents or grandparents might have lived in, once.
There are two lovely cats that roam the grounds and hang out on the porch. They're your buddies and would love nothing more than to slink around your ankles as you sit in the porch swing.
There is one caveat - it's an older house, it's a duplex, and you do share a wall with the other unit. You can hear them if they get a little loud, and they can hear you. That being said, we didn't care and thankfully, neither did our neighbors!
It's worth the trek, but be advised that Summerville really is ""out there"" insofar as the comforts and amenities of the city. There are some mom and pop restaurants and some national fast food chains, but don't come here expecting to find, say, boutique shopping or exotic restaurants or hip nightclubs or whatever - just a slice of a vanishing South that's worth enjoying on its own merits."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All I can say is AWESOME!! I made a mistake with my booking and the staff worked it all out for me and kept me from having to change my travel plans. The place was quirky and fun. Very clean and comfortable. The Garden was a spectacular sight to see. 10/10 all the way around!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paradise Garden is a delightful fantasy, and the cottage is a perfect place to spend the night, and be able to visit the garden at night, and in the early morning."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. We loved the views and the peace. We really enjoyed watching and feeding the animals. After the first day my wife and I both wished we would have booked a longer stay. We will be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at this beautiful farm property!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was lovely! a well needed, quiet getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an absolutely wonderful stay! We got lucky with beautiful weather. The house and property was absolutely stunning! Probably the nicest airbnb we have stayed! The owners were so friendly and communicative! There was even a baby goat that was born while we were on our stay. Absolutely wonderful stay and can’t wait to be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, very peaceful and enjoyable. It’s a great place to get away from the city with a great Mountain View. Chris and Lauren were great hosts and were easy to get in touch with. The animals and the pond made our experience way better."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This location was honestly a dream! Even though it was forecasted to rain our entire visit, it’s like the rain just skipped right over us for the most part! Waking up to a misty, lush mountain was amazing. Campfires with precut wood was very convenient and we enjoyed soaking in the preheated hot tub. On our last night, we got to really see the stars! Petting, watching, and feeding the animals was a ton of fun too.
This place deserves 5 stars! Lauren and Chris have a great way of being very accommodating without being intrusive. This was our first Airbnb experience and overall, way better than any hotel! We will definitely book again in the future :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place. The farm animals were a fun and interesting twist to the property. The location was also great for a peaceful and private getaway. The place was very clean on arrival. The hot tub and patio with fireplace also made for some great relaxing nights.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at Lauren and Chris's place for 3 nights and had a wonderful time! The property is absolutely stunning - really enjoyed simply walking the property and admiring the natural beauty. We especially loved feeding and petting the animals, and there were several nice touches, such as fresh eggs for us and food provided to feed the animals. The place was overall very clean and a great place to relax. We would definitely be willing to stay here again. Thank you Lauren and Chris for being great hosts!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing property, it looks exactly like it's pictured. I've stayed at a few cool Airbnb's in North Georgia but I think this one is number one. I picked this property because my daughter was on her first Girl Scout camping trip and I wanted to be nearby just in case. But the property and natural landscape is beautiful! The air was fresh and the amount of greenery is beautiful. I knew I was starving for fresh air and greenery in general from being around Atlanta for so long, but I didn't realize how much. It was cool being around the animals, especially watching the little baby pigs walking around❤️. The whole experience was peaceful and relaxing. The host were extremely responsive. I showed my daughter the pictures and now she's begging to come. So I will definitely be coming back with her : )"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an AMAZING time staying at Sunny Hill! It was so peaceful and our kids loved the animals! We enjoyed the outdoor hot tub while looking out at the beautiful scenery. We loved walking to the hammocks that overlooked the water. The home itself was gorgeous and felt like it was designed by an interior decorator. We had a couple bonfires while also playing bags. We would love to come back sometime!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful getaway that’s so close to Atlanta and also Tennessee if you like to hike mountains! I enjoyed every bit of my stay, being able to be in peace and quiet and the hot tub was a win even though I didn’t have time to get in; I will forsure try it out during my next visit. All of the animals are living in harmony together, to me that means a lot about how they are cared for. I also appreciated how secluded the home was from the street. Very clean inside, and the cutest box of fresh eggs were such a kind statement!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay. The place was so peaceful and private. I loved feeding the animals and bought more eggs. I really enjoyed the property. Definitely recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 had such a great time at the Sunny Hill Farm! Lauren + Chris are both super kind and friendly. Beautiful farm fresh eggs were provided upon check in. Our kiddos loved feeding the animals, petting the barn kitties, and visiting the chickens. We picniced in the pasture a few times and enjoyed the view, and also loved the hammocks at the front of the property. Communication was super great and helpful! The view is BEAUTIFUL.
On one of the days we drove in to Chattanooga and went to the aquarium, which was fun. Thanks for an amazing experience, Lauren + Chris!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris and Lauren's place was perfect! My husband fell in love with the farm setting and we loved being outside in this space. Feeding the animals was icing on the cake! If you need a peaceful getaway, book this place now!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"unfortunately my stay was not long enough, definitely one if the vest airbnb that I've been"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow this is such a great place to stay. So very nice. We loved all the animals there too. Great accommodations we will definitely stay here again. Close to everything and the house was perfect. The best air Bnb we have ever stayed at. Great hosts wish them the best.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My buddy and I recently retired from the Marines and we’re on a roadtrip around the south. We were looking for a peaceful retreat to rest up before the next big leg of our adventure and we definitely found it!
The house was located atop a hill overlooking some gorgeous N. Georgia scenery. The animals were also a huge plus for us to connect with. It’s always a pleasure for us to be connected with nature and this place was great.
We were late to check out (totally our fault; we overslept) but that should indicate to you just how relaxing our stay was here. Neither of us sleep well because of PTSD but this place put us both at ease and we slept amazingly well on the comfiest beds we’ve had in a long time.
The hot tub was a huge plus, as well!
Thanks to Lauren and Chris for the awesome work they’ve done to make their property super inviting and relaxing!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Sunny Hill Farm! The view was amazing, I loved to watch the sunrise over the mountains every morning! The animals were fun and friendly and we were able to feed them carrots and apples. The house was well decorated, clean, and cozy with comfortable furniture. Loved the large walk in shower! Hot tub was clean and relaxing. Lauren and Chris were quick to respond, helpful, and friendly!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best airbnb stay EVER. We are already talking about going back. The animals were so friendly and were the highlight of our visit. We were so excited to see the fresh eggs and tulips on the counter when we arrived and overall just had a magical stay. 10/10 recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful time escaping from the city at this little farm house. Chris & Lauren were great hosts and even brought us fresh farm eggs upon arrival! The animals were the highlight of the stay, although the whole experience was great. The house was cozy, and they had all of the kitchen supplies needed to cook. I recommend using the telescope to look at the stars on a clear night, and taking a dip in the hot top. Truly a great experience all around."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I went for our anniversary and had the best time. Chris and Lauren were greats hosts and quick to respond. They left us flowers, a basket of sweet treats, and a sweet card on the counter when we arrived! Cozy house and bed—felt like home! We brought carrots and apples to feed the animals and enjoyed a bonfire with s’mores and the hot tub. We can’t wait to come back!
Highly recommend eating at Crushed Tomato Pizza, Lucky Eye BBQ, and Station House!"

It’s a dream for anyone who would want peace, serenity and the most beautiful mountain/farm surroundings. We loved every second and can’t wait to come back. I miss it already!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the place very much. We loved the upgraded amenities such as the oven, main shower, countertops, and jacuzzi. It was wonderful having company by multiple cats every night. We truly got attached to them. The animals on the farm were great. The host/hostess were very sweet and hospitable. We were making dinner and I ran out of butter , the hostess, brought us a brand new butter tub. They went above and beyond with everything. Truly Exceptional!!!! We will stay here again in the upcoming future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing experience staying at the farmhouse. Lauren and Chris were phenomenal hosts. They were very attentive and responsive. We asked about farm fresh eggs and Lauren went out of her way, picked up farm fresh eggs and even brought us homemade bread from the same farm. She brought them down to us the night we checked in and said Merry Christmas, no charge. We greatly appreciated! We loved all the animals. They were all sweet and nice. The kids loved JJ, Leo and well all of the animals really. Lol. Our family needed this trip to reconnect with nature and slow down. Thank you so much for sharing your slice of heaven and tranquility with us. We hope Daisy is getting better. ❤️ Have a blessed Merry Christmas!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a small getaway from the hustle of life and this place was perfect. Waking up to coffee and a gorgeous sunrise (right outside the primary bedroom). We were even visited by Leo ( the most gorgeous cat), and they brought some friends including other cats, chickens, and goats. We feed the donkeys, hung out by the lake, and I got some much needed work as well as relaxation done. The Wifi and Hot Tub was perfect and the kitchen is fully stocked with all the utensils you need. Definitely would book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this charming Airbnb surrounded by breathtaking scenery. The location provided the perfect getaway for a peaceful and relaxing retreat. The host went above and beyond to ensure a memorable experience, showing remarkable responsiveness and genuine helpfulness. The highlight for me was the delightful presence of adorable animals on the property, adding an extra layer of warmth to the overall atmosphere. If you're seeking a tranquil escape with attentive hosts and a touch of nature, this Airbnb is an ideal choice."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place owned by great people. The hosts helped out so much whenever we needed anything. The house is amazing with a lot of activities to do. Feeding the animas was definitely the highlight of the trip along with the hot tub and smores at night time. Would definitely be booking again in the future!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely enjoyed our place. Exceeded my expectations for a farmhouse. We will definitely be booking with them again and bringing our kid's next time. If you decide to stay here don't forget to bring apples & carrots for all the farm animals.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for a girls’ getaway! The hosts were so accommodating in every way (we even had to bump our trip up because of work stuff). The hot tub and hammocks by the serene pond were highlights. The WiFi was a tad spotty, but Lauren & Chris were able to fix it quickly each time we had an issue. If you love animals, this is the place for you! Feeding the pigs, donkeys, goats, and chickens was so fun… but our favorite critters were the sweet barn cats that let us love on them. We’ll definitely be back one day!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was really nice and the view was great! Mountain View, lots of animals to see, nice property to walk around. It rained most of the weekend and was still enjoyable. Comfortable and clean house. We cooked most meals at the house and they had plenty of dishes and all necessary items for cooking. We did have trouble getting into the house due to the lock not working. We waited for about an hour but we were eventually able to get in with their help. They have a lot of cute cats around the property, but a couple got in the house and it was pretty tricky to get them out. Overall it was a nice place and a good stay (comfy bed!), and we would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful scenery with a gorgeous place. Animals are super friendly!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris and Lauren’s homestead was beautiful. We visited with another couple and the cottage was perfect for four people. We enjoyed cooking in the cottage and appreciated Lauren’s expertise in making sure we had everything we needed. The property was so peaceful and we enjoyed watching sunsets from the porch, petting the farm animals (also, giving them treats!) and relaxing in the hot tub each night. We would love to come back and visit again! Thank you Matt’s family for a beautiful experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic Airbnb experience! Cool setting, host went above and beyond"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a great time here. We really loved the view, animals, and hot tub. Great place to getaway and unwind a little."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had a wonderful time staying at Sunny Hill Farm's Air B&B. We loved being up close with farm animals and our hosts recommended Cloundland Canyon State Park for hiking. It was fantastic. We have three young children and there were many trials that were great for them too.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Sunny Hill for our anniversary and it was just what we needed. The views were relaxing and definitely worth waking up early to see the sunrise. Honestly best part were the farm animals and looking forward to feeding them little snacks. I would definitely recommend this place if your trying to chill, disconnect or just have a cozy staycation watching TV. Chris and Lauren were great hosts. We would definitely come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great farm life experience. Enjoyed feeding all the animals. Beautiful view and peaceful atmosphere. Will be coming back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our little anniversary get away! The farmhouse was very nice and clean, looks exactly like the pictures. The backyard was great for a little romance and family time. It’s so cute and spacious for a small family. My 2 year old had the best time running around the farm and feeding the friendly animals. We were able to relax in the hammocks near the lake, while also exploring the huge farmland on my son’s 4wheeler. Chris and Lauren were very friendly and helpful with great communication. They responded quickly and also made recommendations before we even checked in! They also have a garden where we were able to purchase peppers and tomatoes! I can’t say enough about this place. I certainly will be considering returning, as the farm was the best part for my son!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute farm house with beautiful scenery. Our kids loved seeing the animals and feeding them carrots. Inside of the home was very clean and kid friendly.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED this place! One of the coolest Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. Unique, peaceful, and truly unforgettable. A perfect getaway close to Atlanta and Chattanooga, but not too close.
My highlights were petting the donkeys and sitting under the stars in the hot tub. I also loved the views, the clean air, the outdoor fire pit (actually there are two), and the great places to get out and walk. This is a working farm, and there's a farm stand where you can buy produce to enjoy during your stay.
Place was clean. Lots of thoughtful touches. Chris and Lauren were great hosts. They have a true gem, and you won't regret staying here. Hope to return again soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was looking for a place in a quiet place away from the city and people and this was perfect. Gorgeous views and gorgeous guest house. Chris was very responsive when internet went out suddenly. And the farm animals were a nice, cute addition!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway! Extremely quick to respond and was helpful with local recommendations. Pictures were perfect representation of the house. Enjoyed the animals and outdoors.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went here for my honeymoon and it was an amazing stay. The pictures didn’t do justice for just how beautiful this place is. The house was very clean, pretty, and easy to find. We enjoyed our stay so much, that we hope to make it a yearly trip. Lauren and Chris are incredible hosts, they made sure we had everything we needed for our weeklong visit, they even made sure to check in a few days into our stay to ensure we had all we needed for the week."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris and Lauren were amazing hosts and went up and above with the small details they added to our experience! My family stopped here on our way to Florida and we are so glad that we did! Checking in and finding the place was a breeze! We were welcomed by the many animals that were on the farm and had the opportunity to feed them! Their place overlooks an amazing view of the mountains and stunning views of the sunrises! We felt right at home and cannot wait to come back soon! I would give our experience here more than 5 stars if I could! This is an experience my family will remember for a long time.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is great! Would go back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I so enjoyed staying at the property for our anniversary. It is so relaxing and beautiful! We were able to watch the sunset, meet some amazing animals and relax by the fire. We enjoyed s’mores under the stars and relaxed in the hot tub. Their space is cozy, clean and comfortable inside and they are close to several small towns and Chattanooga for more of a city feel. There is no better place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a long, detailed honeymoon itinerary, found this listing on a whim, immediately canceled our plans and came here instead. Beyond getting married, that was THE best decision we’ve made. The property is stunning, the value is incredible, and Chris & Lauren are the perfect hosts. We hardly knew they were next door until the second we had a question, when they were immediately responsive and friendly as could be. Bring plenty of apples and carrots for the animals – they’re endlessly entertaining and eager to make friends. We intended to explore the town and have a few meals out, but the house was so well-appointed (awesome appliances!) that we stayed in, cooked and enjoyed the space for our entire stay. Between the telescope, the ready-made picnic & s’mores supplies, and the most comfortable hammocks/swings set up perfectly around the property to take in the gorgeous views, we couldn’t have designed a better experience ourselves. We’ll be back as many times as they’ll have us!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! Can't recommend this home enough. We've stayed at several rental homes and this one exceeds them all. We felt at home - had everything we would need -- truly could not have asked for more!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home and area. We will be coming back!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cottage on a hill overlooking the property. Spent 3 days there for a mother daughter getaway. We truly enjoyed the farm animals on the property! The barn (with donkeys, goats, a few pigs and kitties ) as well as the chicken coop were about 25 feet away. You could hear the animals in the morning and evening but they weren’t loud enough to bother us at all. The backyard area was very quiet with only the occasional sound of the animals. We love the hot tub, fire pit and star gazing at night! Beds were very comfortable and the master shower was spacious. We would highly recommend this cottage!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was as beautiful as described. The atmosphere was amazing. Such a great place to go and just unwind and get back in touch with nature. So many adorable animals to feed & the pond/hammocks were the best place to relax in the evening. The morning sunrise is breathtaking from the front porch & the back patio gives views to beautiful sunsets. Chris and Lauren were so incredibly helpful and super fast to respond to anything that I needed. I never waited more than 5 minutes for a response from them! I can't imagine changing anything about this place/experience. Would absolutely book with them again!!! Thank you guys for a great week!!
A few notes to prepare for: It is a farm setting so there will be lots of ""critter noises"" outside. The WiFi/internet isn't super fast but I can't imagine anyone spending a lot of time on their phones/tv with everything there is to do! Bring towels for the hot tub as there are only bath towels for each person staying! (prevents doing laundry)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful cozy place to relax and enjoy peaceful time away from the city. Our stay was very enjoyable. The hosts were responsive and provided good instructions.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ll be blunt, cancel whatever you have planned and book here.
This was absolutely sensational. I could write a million words describing how alluring this property was.
Chris & Lauren are absolute masters of their crafts and it shows. The land is gorgeous, spacious, so very active with growing vegetables, fruits, flowers, even pumpkins!
The animals…my goodness I could sit and chat with them all day every day. Our daughter (3) did not want to do ANYTHING in town or out of town when we adventured out. All she wanted to do was “feed animals!!”. The goats, chickens, donkeys, & little pigs we’re all so inviting and friendly. Greeting you excitingly. What a dream.
My wife and I are obsessed with farms & the workings of such. So it was such a treat to get to see Chris & Lauren tending to the farm throughout the day (don’t worry you have the utmost privacy).
They brought us home grown flowers for our anniversary too! Absolute gems they are, as is their land. Thank you so much!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, is the one word to describe this stay. The inside was stylish and clean and the back yard is perfect for a couples getaway. The host are so welcoming and will help with anything you may need they also have Fresh Vegetables daily. We did a day trip to Cloudland Canyon from Chris’s guide and it was breathtaking. Me and my family will be back for sure10/10"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful location with lots to do! Chris and Lauren were super helpful/ responsive with any questions l had. I highly recommend the stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my partner and I came here for a little weekend getaway, and felt right at home. It was so nice being able to go on city day adventure and then come home to the house and be able to relax and unwind, we really loved getting able to watch the stars and getting in the hot tub. We got some breathtaking sunsets and some awesome star nights as well as getting to feed all the sweet animals. We’ll always remember this place and the memories we got to make!! We will definitely be back for another trip again!!
- also Lauren and Chris were some of the sweetest host we’ve ever had and are more than accommodating if you need anything!! Can’t wait to come back here :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough about this beautiful property!! The location was wonderful! The house itself was so cute and perfect for our little family! The little backyard was nice but the main events are all the land out front and the animals. Do yourself a favor and grab multiple bags of carrots and apples because you’ll have so much feeding the animals! We made so many fun memories here and would love to stay again! And I don’t know if it was the elevation, the little bug trap they have, or if the chickens eat them but I did not get bit once by a mosquito!! I don’t even know how that’s possible but it is true (and I’m the kind of person that attracts them and gets the giant whelps)! The restaurants in town that they recommend were wonderful as well! Only thing that could have made it better is if I could have taken home one of the baby pigs! Hahaha! Just push the book it now button!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for somewhere peaceful and quiet which is exactly what we got! The internet was spotty but we didn't mind at all because we weren't there to work or watch tv. We enjoyed feeding the animals and stopping by the stand for fresh produce each day. The views are absolutely incredible and the property is so nice!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a delightful stay at the property. The farm's fresh eggs and wildflowers were a heartwarming touch, and the surroundings were truly serene. Future guests should note there were more than a few bugs in the house. Additionally, the main bed setup is two twin beds pushed together, rather than a true king. Despite these minor issues, the hospitality was wonderful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location (them views), nice and clean place to stay and enjoy the time in. Both host were kind and responsive, it’s marked as a must stay for us every time we visit north Georgia. Felt like home and was honestly so enjoyable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sunny Hill Farm is a marvel! We spent our days feeding the farm animals, taking long walks around the property, picking wildflowers, swinging by the pond and visiting the farm stand everyday to pick up fresh produce. We’re leaving full of memories we will never forget. Our little ones are already looking forward to another next stay. Thank you Lauren and Chris - you are wonderful hosts!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town celebrating the 4th of July with family and friends at my parents house nearby. Her home was full of guests (and of course our 4 children 💕),
so she rented this home for us to enjoy solitude and rest at night.
We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful accommodations and the scenery and sunsets were astonishing.
We enjoyed meeting many of the farm animals here, and overall it was a very delightful experience.
I only wish we could have had more time to hang out and enjoy the accommodations and visit with the hosts. We highly recommend this place for your next getaway.
Thanks again Chris and Lauren!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my husband went on a getaway. We wanted a quiet, peaceful place to just focus on us and this was perfect!!! Chris and Lauren were very helpful when we needed anything, but the property felt very private and secluded. I couldn’t get over the view and the house itself was gorgeous too. Definitely will be coming back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cool a neat place to stay! I’ll definitely come back. Host were excellent!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to be near nature and diconnect. My kids loves the animals and fire pit for nightly smores. We made a home cooked meal every night and had quality time with the family. Town nearby is small/limited and not as diverse as we are accustomed to , so we ventured out to Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain. The home was the perfect escape!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful spot, and gorgeous, clean accommodations. The kitchen, rooms and hot tub are all perfect!!..Just be aware that it is a farm, and the rooster doesn’t start at sunrise! We heard it 4-5x, between 1-6 am. Other than that , a great lace to stay in a beautiful area of Georgia ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cutest place ever, and absolutely spotless! Loved the backyard and saying good morning to the goats, chickens, and pigs! Pond was beautiful. Just wished we'd had more time to stay!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful place. It's peaceful and very relaxing. Getting greeted by the farm animals each morning was great too!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The property and house were exactly as advertised… beautiful, private, and peaceful. Would 100% stay again! Couldn’t have asked for a better place to get away for a few days!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We couldn’t say enough about how wonderful our stay was. The venue was beautiful, the host was responsive to any questions, it was exactly what we had hoped for. From the breathtaking scenery to the farmhouse aesthetic, I would recommend this spot over and over."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the absolute best, most peaceful time at SunnyHill Farm. The space was kept so clean, the view is out of a movie, and it was the perfect spot to take a few days away from regular life hustle. The donkeys were such characters, and we enjoyed feeding all of the animals their apples and carrots. The Matts family are amazing hosts!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Both the home and the property were absolutely gorgeous. We thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the farm animals and took full advantage of the hot tub outside. We would book again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a pretty good and privacy
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whatta beautiful place! And in a beautiful setting to boot. We were doing a long drive on the interstate and intentionally booked it, despite its distance off the highway. As soon as we got off the highway, we were surrounded by scenic views. That was an extra delight. We would love to return and stay longer. We’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and this is one of our favorites."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great relaxing getaway with quiet & dark nights perfect for stargazing next to the fire-pit, in the hot tub or both :) It's only a short drive to Chattanooga where we spent most of the day exploring the city and dining. We had our 15 m/o toddler w/ and felt he absolutely loved petting & feeding all the animals that are right next to the cottage. Large beautiful property that also has a small pond w/ hammock swings and a picnicking area as well. Would recommend for anyone looking to unplug for a couple days. The house was great w/ all the amenities of being back home along with fantastic hosts who ensure you have all you need."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sunny Hill Farms is a gem tucked onto a hillside with stunning sunrises, but easily accessible with plenty to find and explore in the surrounding areas. The place seems straight out of a magazine. This is a working farm, yet we found it extremely peaceful. The goats were fun to watch play and the outdoor space with hot tub was very relaxing after a fun filled day. I highly recommend staying here.
Things to note...
-the driveway is steep and stone but maintained fairly well. Our rental Sonata had no issues.
.-you will encounter critters....this is a country farm so that should be expected"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,you have a beautiful place and our stay was a great experience. we were able to relax and slow down and go at a slower place. would definitely cone back again. We would very much recommend your place to anyone for a great stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay here! The host was very responsive to anything we needed. One of our favorite things was feeding the animals carrots and apples in the mornings.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great stay here! Lauren and Chris were so kind and accommodating. We had a minor issue with the bed and they were very quick to have it fixed. The house was very comfortable and had plenty of room. We would definitely come back!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay on the farm. The property was beautiful, quiet, and a great change of pace from city life. Meeting and feeding the animals was a highlight. We will be back for another visit."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful places I’ve been to. I enjoyed how peaceful it was and away from the city and lots of traffic. Lauren & Chris were super nice and helpful. Throughout our stay we were so close to the animals we got to feed them every morning which was very nice. We went fishing frequently at their pond and I luckily caught some Bass & some sunfishes. Fortunately, one of the does gave birth during our stay and we witnessed a special bond between kid & doe. It was truly a pleasure to stay and I wish I booked for our stay to be longer."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I felt like I was at a spa, it's was so relaxing. Me and my kids enjoyed the view and the experience."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Chris’s place was one of the best getaways that I’ve had in awhile! Chris and Lauren were both incredibly helpful and friendly! It was amazing to learn about their property and help feed the animals. The property is packed full of places to sit back and relax (and the beds are incredibly comfortable)! This is the perfect place to find some peace, but isn’t too far from stores and restaurants. Chris and Lauren also left us the cutest picnic set which added to the tranquil experience. We will definitely be back to pick blackberries once it warms up more!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,wish we could have stayed longer.What a relaxing and beautiful place.Seeing all the animals was icing on the cake.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice getaway. Away from the hustle of work to a small farm with various animals. Location was great, you were with 30min of multiple exciting adventures."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved feeding the animals and spending time outside enjoying the views. The hot tub was perfect and so peaceful. The hosts respond very quick and provide everything you would need. Keep in mind the driveway is long and gravel which can be hard to get up so don’t plan on leaving often.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing. My family and I enjoyed everything about it!! The beautiful scenery, the animals, the peacefulness, EVERYTHING!!!! It was never a dull moment. The host were awesome. :) I highly recommend booking, you will not be disappointed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came with our 3 year old and 5 year old. I cannot express enough how delighted they were with all of the animals. 3 donkeys, countless goats and chickens, 7 cats. All so friendly and eager to be fed! Bring lots of carrots and apples. So fun. It was such a beautiful property to just explore. The swings by the pond were so peaceful. The hot tub so relaxing. The hosts provided a s’mores kit which we used on the fire pit in the backyard. Lauren and Chris were extremely helpful and responsive. The beds were comfy. It all felt just so peaceful. Will definitely visit again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this home for our vacation! It was a beautiful home that was so comfortable and well kept. We loved having the animals outside and spoiled them with many apples and carrots! Chattanooga wasn’t too far of a drive and neither were parks and trails for hiking.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the most beautiful experience ever! Check in was super easy. I would come again and again. Thank you
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome weekend getaway. Close enough to all the attractions that it's a reasonable drive but far enough that you aren't in a tourist trap. The only problem we had is that we didn't book more days. The house was extremely clean and well stocked with dishes and cooking utensils for people who enjoy cooking. The view is amazing both day and night. Low light pollution for stargazers. There wasn't a single time that we tried to contact the host that they didn't respond within 5-10 minutes. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable about surrounding attractions. Do yourself a favor and book it. it was worth every penny we paid!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place with beautiful scenery! Private yard with hot tub, with a peaceful vibe! Nice front porch with beautiful view of the mountains! It's definitely worth checking out!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVELY place!
Lauren was so helpful & quickly responsive. Excellent host!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Nicely appointed guest cottage with everything needed for our 4 night visit. Chris and Lauren were excellent communicators and great hosts. Plenty of animals to pet/feed/enjoy, amazing star-filled sky, a hot tub and hammock all combined for a relaxing and enjoyable time. Of special note: This is one of the cleanest/newest properties we've stayed in. It puts many top notch hotels to shame in terms of decor, comfort, and cleanliness. Well done and we'll see you again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts, and a wonderful place to stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fell in love with this place. I drove 5 hours and 30 minutes to spend one night and it was worth it. Ordered door dash from crushed tomatoe and it was delicious. Watched some movies while we ate. We laid in the hammock and watched the sun set and tried out the hot tub when it got dark. We looked at the animals for a little bit. They was super friendly and adorable. This place was so peaceful and serene. First time in a long time that I actually seen stars . Only thing I regret is not bringing apples and carrots for the animals and not booking longer. I will most definitely be back and booking longer. It was the perfect date night for Valentine’s Day.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Part of me wants to tell you to never book this place so that we can book it anytime we want, but that wouldn’t be giving this wonderful place the words it deserves! We had a WONDERFUL time staying at SunnyHill Farms! The environment was peaceful, inviting, and everything we could have dreamed of. We enjoyed petting and feeding the animals, walking the property, and using the fire pit and hot tub on the back patio. The nighttime view of the stars was perfect as well. We also enjoyed the short drive to Chattanooga and a late night trip to Brasstown Bald!
Chris and Lauren did a fantastic job answering all the questions we threw their way. They were also able to help with things we forgot. Lauren welcomed us with a lovely anniversary gift. As a young couple with a long-term goal of having a homestead of our own, we could not have asked for a better getaway. We will be booking again ASAP!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little comfy barn house with lots of great jokes around. Loved our time here

Chris and Lauren were very responsive and welcoming. We had one tiny issue and they were quick to find a solution, and Lauren even picked flowers off their property and brought them over in a vase for our anniversary. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris and Lauren's little farmhouse was a phenomenal stay. A friend and I decided to stay there to find peace, rest, and quiet from our busy lives. We didn't just receive what we were hoping for, but so much more. It was a lovely home, and more so, a lovely property with the perfect getaway from responsibility. Chris and Lauren did a wonderful job with communication and made us feel right at home. of course, the hot tub was one of the best parts. it funtioned perfectly well and was up to temperature. We have already discussed coming back and bringing our husbands with us. We are so thankful for this opportunity. Thank you, Chris and Lauren, for sharing your home with us. You've done a lovely job."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a delightful place and/or experience I should say.
My husband and I spent a few days here celebrating our anniversary. We needed to get away and chill with some quiet time and we were excited about enjoying the hot tub and beautiful views. And let me tell you that will not be disappointed staying here!
Chris and Lauren were exceptional hosts and the home is beautifully decorated and equipped with everything one needs on a getaway.
The farm is such a beautiful place and farm animals were so cute and friendly. Plus during our time here, we were blessed to be some of the first witnesses to a mama goat who had given birth to two beautiful little babies. Adorable experience 💜…
We highly recommend this serene setting for your next getaway!
And thank you Lauren for the beautiful arrangement of fresh flowers you brought me for our anniversary. You guys are the best!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Chris and Lauren's was so lovely. They put so much care and time into making the space cozy. The light was beautiful in the house, and the backyard with the hot tub and lights was our favorite place to be after it got dark. The animals are adorable and so funny. There are many walks and beautiful woods, water, or views to see just on the property. They built a perfect space to feel present with the people you're with and so grateful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris & Lauren were the most amazing hosts! They were so welcoming! They gave us farm fresh eggs and their goats, donkeys and chickens were so friendly ! The house was comfy cozy and i felt right at home.. Thank you Chris and Lauren!!"

Low cars be warned of their beautiful but rocky driveway, lol!!
I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is looking for a quiet mountain retreat with a taste of both farmland and luxury!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris and his wife were awesome host!! The house was amazing, super nice looking and clean. The animals and scenery were worth it alone. I had a couple questions and they were quick to respond and help us out."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chris’s place was great! I would highly recommend staying, and I’d stay again myself. The Airbnb was stunning and well apportioned and a few steps into the backyard you’re greeted with a lovely view of the Milky Way. The only downside was the hot tub never came to temp. — a small thing, but I’d chosen an Airbnb specifically to enjoy one."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here, the home is gorgeous with modern appliances. Absolutely loved getting to see and feed the goats and chickens! Would come back"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely amazing! They thought of everything and left household items like soap, dishwasher tablets, and tide pods to make our stay easier. My husband was in love with talking to all his new friends (goats, donkeys, and chickens). It was was fun to wake up to goats and chickens at out back door. Chris was available for any issues and answered whatever questions I had. He even recommended some things to do and places to eat while we were there. Check in and check out was super easy. We will definitely stay again another time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,BEAUTIFUL place with a gorgeous view ! Was very clean and neat !! Chris answered all our questions in a timely manner and was very kind . The location is private and beautiful ! Will definitely be visiting again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this stay so much! The hosts, Chris and Lauren, are super sweet and quick to respond when you need anything. The home is located on a beautiful farm with lots of animals to see! We enjoyed walking around and “talking” to the animals! The donkeys were hilarious, as they were actually talking to us lol! The house is updated and very well kept up. We also got to travel to Chattanooga, Tn which was only about a 40 minute drive, to enjoy our anniversary! We highly recommend this stay to anyone who wants a peaceful, beautiful place to stay! (:"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The scenery was absolutely beautiful . The cute little goats roaming the property gave it such a unique farm feel. The jacuzzi was very clean and so was the beautiful up to date farm house. Everything you needed was right there.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect young family stopover on a long road trip. Our little ones were excited beyond words - the animals, the swings at the pond, the hot tub. Beautiful place. A few more flys in the house than one might like, but it’s a farm, and to be expected. Great place, look forward to staying again on our next trip this direction."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One word: amazing!
If you are looking for a clean, serene, and beautiful getaway, book Chris's guesthouse! Chilling in the hot tub at night was one of the main reasons we booked this airbnb (and it did not disappoint!) but their property has so much to offer - walking scenic trails, reading a book on the porch, or having a romantic picnic at sunset. We enjoyed it all, getting to feed their cute animals was just a bonus. The hosts are lovely and kind people, we will definitely book again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cutey lil house! We were there in time to help feed the goats.
We attended a festival in Chickamauga and this was a bout a 35 min ride from the festival location. Cute lil town about 10 min away for some good dinner/breakfast options"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and great views. Farm animals right outside the door make it extra fun if you're an animal and nature lover. Enjoyed our stay while in the area for a wedding. Huge bathroom with a full size mirror and fabric steamer was a great addition to get ready. Hot tub and fire pit were great as well.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little house. Very pretty view
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed a week and would have stayed longer if I could. It is situated perfectly for a beautiful sunrise over the mountains to a wonderful sunset over the ridge. House is new & clean with whatever you need. Great view all around, able to walk and explore. View down the front hill with rolls of hay in the field with the pond in the background was fantastic. Loved the chairs from the tree by the pond. Just a great place to stay that is quiet & peaceful. Owners are hospitable and down to earth people. Thanks Chris & Lauren, had a great time."

From the scenery to the perfect home our stay was all we hoped!
Chris was great in answering messages and helping us navigate the area.
The house is immaculate, has all you need and is so well put together!
Having morning coffee on the porch and watching the sun rise over the mountains was a dose of heaven!
We traveled there to mountain bike at Jarrod’s Place at it was only 25-30 min from the park!
We will definitely be regular’s!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for time away from hustle and bustle, then this place is perfect for you. It's a quaint and peaceful place and offers a place to hear yourself think. The two ponds make for good times fishing and the small dipping pool is big enough for kids to play or adults to cool off as well. The house is updated/well maintained and had everything we needed. Chris & Lauren live on the property and are readily accessible. Check in and out process was simple. No surprises. Better than pictures portray. Can't wait to go back and watch the sunrise over the mountain from the front porch."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the place inside and out! Loved the comfort, decor, and the surroundings. Kitchen was awesome, bathrooms were great, and the living area was very comfortable. The view with morning coffee was beautiful. A bucolic treasure!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience during our stay when we were in the area visiting family. Hosts were kind enough to a work with us when we left a personal item behind and we were able to get it back after check in! The beds were comfortable, large shower, and beautifully decorated inside. But the best part is the view! You cannot beat the view of the mountains. I was able to watch the sunrise over the mountains on Saturday morning and it was so peaceful. It was a grounding experience that I haven’t had in awhile living in flat South GA! We will be staying again soon."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a breathtaking farmhouse!!! The house itself is new, clean and adorably decorated. The views are spectacular! You have the sunset out back and we were sure to wake up early to view the incredible sunrise from the front porch. Our family loved exploring the property! Our kids got to pick blueberries and blackberries on the property and we enjoyed swinging in the hammocks by one of the ponds. It was nice to enjoy a bonfire and s’mores at dusk. The hosts were wonderful and quick to respond. We hope to return and make this our new halfway stopping place as we travel from Florida to Michigan and back. Grateful we discovered this gem!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous house with great view. Owner very friendly and polite. Recommend 10/10.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the farmhouse was amazing! The views, the sunrises, sunsets, the peacefulness that encompasses you is beyond what we expected, but what we were needing while on vacation. Hosts Chris and Lauren were very thoughtful and the house felt like a home away from home. My husband that usually takes a few nights to get used to a new place when sleeping, slept like a baby and was able to get such good rest. We are excited to visit again and recommend this location. Even more so when you need to get away from busyness of life and recharge a little bit."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this restful, beautiful place as the first stop on a 16 day Retreat into the mountains of NC. Kay and Roger were very kind and warm and showed me about a bit and introduced me to their resident lovelies, Nadia and Dually, two fine equines that charmed my heart and soul. The personal touch of a hand written welcome, a suggestion of a local place to eat some good Georgia home-style cooking was perfect for this country girl. This peaceful place set the tone for the rest of my journey and I am deeply grateful for the wonderful memory of basking in warm horse noses, the smell of hay, the comfort of safety and a bonus of getting to see a Mama deer and a tiny spotted fawn grazing and gamboling in the pasture! I highly recommend and hope to return and stay a while."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kay and Roger are amazing host!! They have thought of everything we could possibly need. We loved our stay so much!! I can’t wait to go back.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly don`t know where to begin, I will just say this - it was the best airbnb experience ever. Spectacular location, beautiful home and most important - our hosts, that made us feel like we are family. Kay and Roger were right there for us every step of the way, from the moment we arrived until our departure. We came to Summerville to ride our bikes at Jarrod`s place, but in all honesty i am not sure, what me and my son enjoyed the most.. Bike park or our stay at Kay`s place. Hanging out with horses, cat and the dog, long conversations with Kay and Roger - all that was a major part of the experience. Will we come back? Most definitely and not once! Already thinking about booking next trip, having Kay`s place in mind :)))"

The property is picturesque, & their delightful horses, charming cat, and adorable dog added to the charm of it all. Our room was incredibly cozy, with everything we needed thoughtfully provided. It’s evident Kay and Roger put a lot of care into ensuring their guests have everything they need for a comfortable stay.
Our time here was too short!! While i do not visit the area often, I’m already looking forward to planning another trip just to stay here again!"

We chose it because of its proximity to our event, the affordable price, and the unique opportunity of being near the horses. It couldn't have been better! Kay was very responsive and helpful prior to arriving, and both she and Roger were on hand to welcome us and orient us on arrival. Everything about the room and bathroom was beautiful and just right for what we wanted. Super clean, pretty decor, nice to have two sinks and plentiful hooks in the bathroom.

I needed a one-night stay to break up a long drive. I thought this would be a nice place (based on previous reviews) but it absolutely exceeded even my high expectations. Kay and Roger are SO friendly, without being intrusive. The room is immaculate and beautiful. The bathroom is spacious and the shower is wonderful. The beds are comfortable. There's a fridge available, along with microwave and toaster. The horses are a sweet plus - they're just around the corner yet you wouldn't know it while you're in the room. The land around this room is exceptionally peaceful and beautiful. I was alone for this trip and the area feels absolutely safe. I'm already trying to plan a trip for my daughter and I to go back and explore the area. Even the drive out to the highway was beautiful. I highly recommend this listing - hoping to get back there soon."

The property views are spectacular. Not one sound of traffic. This tucked away airbnb is so quiet and serene you will not want to leave.
The room is spacious; awesomely decorated. Makes me want to redo my space at home and copy Kay's ideas. The two beautiful horses are close and personal just steps away from the tackroom sleeping quarters.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little piece of HEAVEN I found in Summerville, Ga. I really really don’t want to write this review because I know when I Do EVERYONE will be reserving and there might NOT be a vacancy for me anymore!!
There are NO words in the dictionary that I can FIND to describe exactly what I felt while staying here and not to mention the GREAT Hospitality given by Kay and Roger. Being a Germaphobic and a cleaning fanatic I have given this place a A+++
The pictures you see in their Airbnb advertisement is EXACTLY what I saw. The location is great. We went into a little town called Cave Springs that was about 30 min where found a GREAT steak house FOLLOWED BY visiting all the little shops and discovering the best place to buy fudge yummy yummy😀. After a pleasant evening at Cave Springs then back home to Kay and Kay and Roger where our most comfortable beds were waiting for us. Everything you need was right there for us with the 2 beds, 2 sinks in the bathroom, shower, plenty of towels and wash clothes. Coffee Maker, full size fridge, microwave and toaster. Then when I realized my clothes needed to be ironed all it took was a text message and within a blink of a eye there was a iron and ironing board outside my door. Kay and Roger were so attentive of our needs. Whenever we wanted to sit down and chat Kay was there BUT at the same time if you wanted your space, your quiet time to enjoy the beauty and soak up FRESH AIR away from the city where we live permanently we had our ALONE TIME! The next evening we drove about 25 min to Rome Ga where we enjoyed the BEST BBQ EVER. Rome Ga has anything there that u might want. Also, from Kay and Roger u can drive About an hour into Chattanooga Tennessee or from Kay and Rogers you can drive about 20 minutes into a very very small town called Mentone, Alabama where you will find yourself driving and driving around and around taking you into a fairytale of beautiful mountains and gorgeous leaves as they were beginning to turn their many many colors. Whoever is reading my review I can guarantee you with my entire heart and soul you will NOT, will NOT, WILL NOT be dissatisfied with this little piece of heaven that Kay and Roger have provided for each and everyone of us to enjoy and again I have to say THANK YOU again for your hospitality and for providing the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. I slept so good so hard so peaceful and I even took a nap in the middle of the day which I have never ever done in my entire life but I guess those most comfortable beds were just calling for me Lol.
Kay and Roger thank you so very much from the bottom of my heart for allowing me and my BFF to have a wonderful mini vacation last weekend. 🥰❤️🥰"
