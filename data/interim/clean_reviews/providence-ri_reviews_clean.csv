2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at the apartment for two days while helping my daughter who is in college move out of her dorm. The location is perfect. Many restaurants within walking distance. Off street parking was ideal. And the overall layout of the apartment was wonderful. The second story loft was very cute. And when I return in the fall, I will definitely be staying there once again.
Photos are accurate and the apartment was spotless.
The perfect place to stay."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jennifer's loft was a very nice experience. She communicated well and was quick to respond to our questions. The entire place was very clean and smelled of bleach upon entry.
Although the description noted the ceiling was short, the Loft area was smaller than expected as the camera angles don't show well that you can't stand up in the space. Great for kids, maybe, but not the best for adults.
The location is beautiful and very easy to walk around or grab an uber to another area. We were happy to have off-street parking for the night, too.
All in all, it served our purposes well, and we enjoyed our stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Such a beautiful apartment; the pictures really don‚Äôt do the place justice. Stayed here for my son to attend accepted students day at Brown University, and the apartment was very walkable to Brown and all the action on Thayer St. The apartment has cool views of the tennis and ball fields across the street. There was also a perfect little desk overlooking a scenic street, where I was able to work, and the WiFi was great so I could host a 2-hour Zoom meeting with a cool view of that spiral staircase behind me). Note: there are several stairs to the apartment (which I appreciated for the forced exercise lol), but it‚Äôs not for those with mobility problems. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again over the next 4 years!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Jennifer‚Äôs place for 1 month. It was a great experience, I felt right at home. The area is very safe and very walkable to cute shops and restaurants nearby, as well as, Brown‚Äôs campus. The place looks exactly like the photos, and has a lot of extra touches that typical airbnbs don‚Äôt (ie most of the needed cooking utensils/supplies). Definitely recommend!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner from out of town came to stay with me for New Year's Eve. This was a perfect little home away from home to celebrate. We stayed a few days, enjoyed the quiet atmosphere in the house and walked around the beautiful Providence neighborhood to all the restaurants and shops. This home is so cute with its spiral staircase, the kitchen is clean, with all the amenities to cook. Thank you, Jennifer, for leaving us waters and snacks! We slept so well, those beds are super comfy. I definitely recommend you check this place out for your stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to stay in a wonderfully located spot in East Providence in College Hill, this is the place to stay.

She was responsive and very kind to me and my guest. Thank you Jennifer and looking forward to coming back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was spotless & very, very nice! Especially loved the cozy loft, high ceilings and spiral staircase.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer's place is darling and it is a 10 minute walk to Thayer St. The place is airy, clean and beautifully decorated. My bed was very comfortable and I slept better than I do at home. Hmmmmmm. No surprises and great communication. I would not hesitate to stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre visiting the area to attend a Patriots game in Foxboro. We were pleased with how close this cute and comfortable place was to the stadium. It was also fully equipped with everything that we needed for a cozy night in! Will definitely be back!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was wonderful! So clean and the host was awesome with check in and check out directions!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing apartment in a great area. Super clean too. I highly recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was a gem! Great location, clean and new with great amenities. The loft space was adorable. The owners were very responsive, sending us recommendations for where we could grab a bite to eat. Tandem parking in the back was super convenient. Wonderful stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's house was fantastic. Everything was new in her house and beautiful.
It was a newly renovated apartment unit with lots of amenities.
The apartment was located in a very convenient location (walking distance to Brown University and many good restaurants). She prepared more than anyone else could. Her house is the best place to stay around Brown university. We will love to revisit her house if we come to Providence again. Thank you, Jennifer!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. The location makes anything you might want to do in Providence just a short walk away. The location itself was really cool, especially if you enjoy architecture with character."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect spot to stay while exploring Rhode Island!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is cozy and super cute at an amazing location! Much better than the expensive hotels in the area. Staying at an historical place like the Arcade felt very special, especially since I‚Äôm an urban sociologist. My only problem was with the light at night because I‚Äôm a very light sleeper and it was a bit too bright for me but I managed. Kevin was also very responsive, friendly and flexible. Totally recommend and would stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the Nook for 5 nights, attending a conference at at RICC and RISD, so the location was convenient for me. Kevin was responsive and quick to answer my questions before and during my trip and greeted me in the morning to show me the way to the apartment. The small space is well utilized and organized, stocked with many basics in the kitchenette and bathroom- the only thing I needed and couldn‚Äôt find was a pair of scissors. It would be a cozy fit for two people, especially as the bed is only accessible from one side and the bathroom has a sliding door without a handle, or one I could find. I love the reading nook, fresh flowers and plants throughout that made it feel homey. As someone sensitive to noise and light a sleep mask, earplugs and a mini sound machine was helpful to block out street noise and the lights that are always on inside the Arcade. Other than a fire alarm my first day when I was trying to nap, my stay was pleasant and it felt like a tiny home away from home"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nook was lovely, a comfortable and clean environment. Our kind host Kevin was very helpful and communicative throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Providence!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Totally recommend Kevin's place! The apartment was perfectly located in downtown, historic and charming, and perfectly designed with all amenities provided. Kevin was friendly and responsive!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin‚Äôs place was great! My wife and I highly recommend to others. If we ever are back in Providence we would definitely consider coming back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Arcade. The apartment was safe, cosy, peaceful and comfortable - it is perfectly located for all the walkable places to see in and around Providence. It‚Äôs 10 mins walk from the train station, and the bus depot‚Äôs even closer. Kevin was a fab host - communicative and flexible with check-in/out arrangements. We would highly recommend a stay here."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my second time staying at Kevin‚Äôs place and once again it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Great host and a perfect spot with many restaurants within walking distance. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin was a friendly host, chill, accommodating, and the spot was fantastic. No complaints! Nice quaint little space. Showed up right on time which was perfect, showed us around, suggested spots and activities.
For watching movies you may want to have a laptop since the couch and TV aren't the most comfortable things in the world, but enjoyed the amount of activities hidden away, utensils for use, very flexible check-in time, bathroom sink having a decent/comfortable amount of space, and probably some other things I could note which were nice."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a fantastic stay here at Kevin's place.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a delightful stay. The space is a micro-apartment - but smartly laid out and organized. Perfect for 1-2 people visiting Providence for a few days. I recommend it to others and will stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay -- the place had a lot of character.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kevin's place is fantastic. Kevin is a very kind and responsive host. The place is very comfy and has everything you need for a week stay if traveling for work. Place is very tidy with great wi-fi and HDMI cable in the most logic place possible. Location is perfect, walk distance from most of Brown's facilities, with lot's of good restaurants 2-5min from the arcade. Cons would be related to downtown area noises that woke me up at night, and unfortunately a lot of people in situation of street near Kennedy plaza. Kevin did mention this beforehand, and it is safe, but it is still somewhat bothersome. Overall the pros definitely surpassed the cons, I had very good memories from my week here and will never forget how that cozy little place made me feel at home while working from it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at the arcade. Kevin was flexible with both my check in and check out, which I appreciated. The nook was very comfy and had everything I needed to make me feel right at home. I was traveling solo and always felt safe. I also appreciated all the storage even though is a small place. Will definitely book again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room is exactly where you'd want to stay in Providence and Kevin was as responsive and flexible a host as one could hope for!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin and Hui were incredibly welcoming and responsive. Parking can be tricky in downtown Providence and they provided an amazing list of overnight parking options which we deeply appreciated. Location is unique and very cozy, we had a wonderful time!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful long weekend here! Very cute and clean space in a great location. Thank you to our hosts for being so accommodating!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin is an excellent communicator. He was willing to meet me at 1 am to let me in The Nook. The apartment was creatively laid out. It was very comfortable being in a very small space. It was a fun environment with everything you would need. Thanks Kevin!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was very excited to stay in this micro apartment and it didn't dissappoint! Staying in the oldest mall in the country is a unique event. Kevin was an excellent host. He met me at the location even though my plane didn't arrive until after midnight.
Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome location and a super cozy place to stay!
Kevin showed me around and made sure I knew where everything was when giving me the key.
I hope I have the chance to come back and would highly recommend anyone to check this place out!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kevin‚Äôs place was perfect! It was clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities one would need. Great location and easy walking distance restaurants and Brown University. Kevin is accommodating and quick to respond to any inquiries. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice tiny apartment right in downtown Providence. Easy walking to Brown University Campus (and Rhode School of Design). There are many nice restaurants around and interesting shops. Had a great time there and loved walking along the river.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kevin‚Äôs place is wonderful. It is a small but comfy place that worked perfectly for me. The Arcade building is wonderfully charming! The location is walkable to EVERYTHING in Providence.
Next time I am in town I will definitely stay in Kevin‚Äôs place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The building is nearly 200 years old, so it's a little humid even with the A/C on, but it truly is in the perfect location. Mostly quiet (nothing to be done about pedestrians on the street shouting, as in any city), but no noise from within the building itself. There are nice shops and places to eat right downstairs, as well as many good restaurants, bars, and shops within a few short blocks. The description and photos are accurate: this place is small. Don't get me wrong, it is a great home-base for a short stay in Providence, but it is a microapartment. That said, the hosts were very courteous and hospitable, and responded with lots of help every time I reached out!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, intimate lodging in a cool historic building. The Nook had a ton of storage for a micro apartment, with everything you need in stock. It's private, very cute, and in a nice, walkable location. Kevin is communicative, and was very flexible and understanding when all of our transportation ran late. We would not hesitant to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was such a wonderful host! he greeted us in person and talked to us about the area! The space itself was very beautiful and incredibly peaceful. This is definitely a place I plan to visit again in the future!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"cute studio in the center of Providence. Amazing location, awesome host. Highly recommended to stay here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely new apartment that has everything like a good five star hotel, a 5-minute walk from brown university. There is air conditioning, microwave oven. Would like to come back here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique living experience in a great location! I enjoyed my stay at Kevin's arcade microapartment. After we were able to get on the wifi, it was lightning fast and worked really well for some meetings I had to take. There's a dishwasher but no stove/oven in the unit other than a toaster oven because of building codes. Even though this place is tiny, the layout made it feel much larger. Shower was great, and we enjoyed the coffee in the apartment each morning!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value, well located in downtown Providence, pleasant walk from the east side if you are visiting brown"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a great time staying here. It was a perfect ‚Äúhome base‚Äù while I was traveling for work and was very walkable to some nice shops and restaurants.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Second time staying in Kevin‚Äôs place and it was just as great as the first. Just the right amount of space and perfect location to get just about anywhere. Recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall would recommend. lots to do in the area/withing walking distance. The amtrak train station is a 10 min walk away.
Pros:
- Phenomenal location.
- Easy access to train station, cafes, and restaurants.
- Located above several small cafes.
- Quiet ambiance for most of the day./not loud at night.
- Elevator access.
Cons:
- Matress is very firm and depending on preferences may be difficult to sleep on.
- No parking for building. There is a parking lot across the street that charges $22/day and is flexible (i.e., you can go in and out of garage and pay for the day). The garage only provides 2 day passes so you will need to renew the parking pass every 2 days. It would be more budget friendly to use public transportation than rent/bring a car."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space to land while exploring Providence. Easy access to public transit allows you to get to Newport quickly as well. Very centralized location.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kevin's home is clean, quiet, and full of sunlight. Very convenient downtown location. I booked last minute and he provided all the info I needed for a great week in Providence!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Kevin‚Äôs place while visiting Providence for work and had the best experience imaginable. The apartments layout makes it feel much larger than it actually is. The apartment is located just 8 minutes from the train station and within a few minutes to some of the best restaurants in town including the many located on the first floor of the Arcade. There is a nice communal lounge with laundry downstairs and great coffee place.
The apartment is located on a fairly quiet side street, but it‚Äôs possible to walk to the center of town with shops and more restaurants in less than 10 minutes. The iconic Superman Building towers the Arcade on Westminster Street and was truly cool to see in person. The architecture of the Arcade and surrounding buildings was a great experience.
I will be back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you very much to Hui and Kevin for hosting us. Everything was as advertised. We enjoyed the stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with Kevin. He was super flexible with our check-in time and very responsive to all messages. Although there is no free parking, Kevin provided a very detailed list of options for parking nearby. We would recommend Kevin‚Äôs place and look forward to potentially staying there again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once you know the place, easy to find. Whether ordering online or finding restaurants, everything was within walking distance. Good for 1-2 people not for more. Private, clean, and quiet, if you need to work or focus. The train station and public bus service are within walking distance."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good, very convenient"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a hockey writer who travels a lot, I was very pleased with Kevin's rental at the Arcade in downtown Providence. Close enough to get to the Amica Bank Pavillion and close enough to get back to get some work done in a quiet environment.
I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of the rental and the location to unwind with so many excellent bars and restaurants within walking distance.
Kevin was a fantastic host and explained everything I needed to know about the rental, the easiest way to get around the massive building, and emergency evacuation details.
I hope Kevin's rental is available the next time I travel to Rhode Island to cover the Providence Bruins as a media member.
I highly recommend staying here if you're traveling to this great area of New England.
Mark A."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Living in this cute, cozy micro-apartment in the unique, historic Arcade was like a fairy tale. Plus, it‚Äôs right in the center of Providence! Lot‚Äôs of shops, restaurants, and theaters nearby. It‚Äôs a tiny place, but it‚Äôs got everything you need (including a great library and plenty of storage space)! Kevin was a great host. Friendly and responsive. All-in-all a pleasant stay! My only complaint is that it can get noisy in the evenings (especially over the weekend) due to street noise and fridge sounds. Also, despite the blinds, there‚Äôs always a bit of light in the apartment at night. But this is something you have to expect, living in a small apartment in the center!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the arcade. Perfect location and accommodations for two.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had to change my arrival date and time more than once and Kevin was very responsive and helpful.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in a hotel near by Kevin‚Äôs place before. And I do prefer his place than the hotel. It‚Äôs ideal for solo travelers. Right in the middle of the downtown, historical and quiet building, and a spotless space. Kevin was so kind to give me a quick tour of the building and quick to response."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location. Good communication with Kevin.

Great communication, great location. Walkable neighborhood & easy walk to other desirable areas. Perfect spot for two of us for a few days, the good size apartment fridge & toaster oven helped keep expenditures down. We also appreciated the good size bathroom & little extras‚Ä¶fresh flowers, coffee, tea, etc. We felt very secure with key fob access, the building was quiet, this unit is on the top floor with no one above, and little shops on ground floor were closed early in the evening. We were able to avoid heavy parking fees with street parking in the evening & free Sunday parking. Great stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin was a great host! We would come back and recommend to anyone wishing to stay in a cool place perfect for visiting Providence.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What an amazing stay! I was in Providence for 2 weeks and Kevin‚Äôs place was perfect for me. Just enough space to feel at home and go to/from classes. Major win on location as it‚Äôs right in downtown, close to everything! I pretty much walked everywhere for the duration of my stay.
Kevin is super flexible and allowed me to check-in/ out according to my schedule. The place is super clean and comfortable and I love the extra touches like bud vases in the dining and bathroom areas. Kevin also provided a bag of coffee (with a French press) and brought me extra hangers.
Beyond the apartment itself, it was so convenient to go downstairs at the Arcade shops to get my hair done during the week. I also took a moment to check out the eclectic bookstore. If I had the opportunity, I would have tried one of the restaurants as well.
Highly recommend Kevin‚Äôs place"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nook at the Arcade will be on our list of favorites! The Arcade itself is an impressive piece of history with great restaurants and shops. It's also right in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of everything. The condo is small and cozy with great decor. We felt right at home immediately and enjoyed every bit of the Nook and the Arcade. Most impressive though, was our experience with Kevin. We had several flight disruptions and he was understanding and flexible every time. I highly recommend!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a superb location for anything you'd want to do in Providence, and the historic character is unique.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location without being in one of those large hotel conglomerates. Kevin has made a space that maybe just the same size (or smaller) feel perfect. The room has a way that makes you feel welcome but still has that comfort space when needed. The room has everything a person could need. It was great for 1 person would be ok for 2.
The location is quiet. For being in a ""mall"" I heard no one else. I had music playing that couldn't be heard outside the door and except NYE nothing too bad from outside the windows. When looking out the Windows it is primarily a parking lot which gives you space to see around you. You look at the buildings that make up the Providence skyline.
When you step out of the building you are in the heart of Providence. Steps away from plenty of places to eat, including the ones inside the place. Perfect for exploring the architecture of this great town. I felt safe walking everywhere I went.
Kevin's pregame help really helped make the important decisions but leave time to read a book in the nook especially page 85 in the architecture book."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Clean and comfy, perfect location! Home has everything you need and surprisingly spacious! Only tip I have is, if your a warm person and go in the winter turn the heat down low. You won‚Äôt need it, it‚Äôs not too hot but I enjoy sleeping in the cool and travel with a small fan so I opened the window. The history in this place is amazing!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! Super clean and a great location, and Kevin was super accommodating and great at communicating with us. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to providence!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and beautiful place to stay. Definitely not the norm which is awesome. Only thing that kinda stinks is the no parking but there are multiple lots in the area for overnight parking at a good price. Overall great location and will definitely be back.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect little place
This is an ideal place for a couple or a single traveler to Providence. The ""Nook"" is perfectly organized with everything you may need for a long weekend, even a small library and reading corner. Kevin is a superb and helpful host, easy to contact and communicate with. The ""Nook"" is situated in the charming atmosphere of the Arcade which itself is right in the middle of downtown Providence, and very quiet. We are sure future guests will love it as much as we did."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin responds to messages quickly. This place is exactly as described. It included toiletries and linen, and was very clean. It's walking distance to RISD, restaurants and the metro. A perfect fit for 2 people."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I appreciate the flexible check in (we were running behind). The historic building is very cool and it provided a unique experience. The unit is small (as described) but laid out in a way that is still comfortable for two people. The unit was very clean and located in a great area to explore Providence by foot. I highly recommended!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin‚Äôs place is one of the most unique places we‚Äôve stayed in the world! The arcade is a cozy and comfortable place with a historic vibe. Kevin was kind and met us and for easy check in. The location has to be one of the most convenient spots to explore providence.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What you can expect is an immaculate, tasteful, and very comfortable condo in the heart of Providence‚Äôs best shopping, services, and nightlife.
Kevin is an impeccable and generous host who seems quite experienced at that role.
If there is one thing I would want a potential guest to know, that there is no range in the kitchen, but there is a toaster oven, microwave, and electric kettle in an otherwise well appointed kitchen."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin is a great host. His place is clean, neat and organized. Great location, and very responsive to questions and tending to his guest off they reach out. I would recommend Kevin‚Äôs place to anyone coming into the city and needs a place in the heart of the city."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Generally excellent. One suggestion‚Äîthe bright upstairs hall light stays on all night and penetrates guest rooms, which are not completely dark as a result‚Äîthis light should be on a motion detector"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This location is a great place to stay for quick visits to Providence! You can easily walk downtown and can take advantage of all the shops and restaurants near the house.

Room was very clean and neat, you can breathe in air without worrying about dust flying around, just amazing."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I have been to. Everything was cute, clean, easy to understand, and felt thoughtful. I liked the no shoes policy, and signs to encourage being a considerate roommate. There were kitchen appliances and utensils and other things provided that one might need for a short stay. The place was within walking distance of many awesome places. My room maybe got colder than the other rooms or our temperature preferences were just way different. When a roommate kept freezing me out, I asked the host for an extra blanket and was able to get one which helped a lot."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs cozy, the location is perfect, and it was everything I needed after 30 hours in transit. Very sweet responsive hosts. Just overall so lovely to get to stay here!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don‚Äôt usually book at shared Airbnb houses when the host does not live on the property, but I booked here for a last minute trip. We loved our stay! There were other guests staying in the house at the same time as us and we ran into one, but they were all quiet, respectful, and kept shared spaces clean. We felt as though we had plenty of privacy and we were very comfortable. The location is great too. It‚Äôs on a quiet residential street, yet just a couple of blocks to amazing restaurants. Would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beds are comfortable & location is close to the main street in the Federal Hill neighborhood. All of the explanations given via message were very detailed and helpful, and overall the place was very clean.
Sound does travel through the walls so your experience depends a little bit on how considerate other guests are, but the hosts also provide earplugs for people who are moe sensitive to noise."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for what my partner and I needed. The room was large and spacious, the bed was comfy, and we loved the lighting. The parking was so easy, and this Airbnb was so centrally located in Federal Hill. If you are looking to get to college hill or downtown, you definitely need to drive, if you do not want to walk for more than 20 minutes. The only thing we can say is that the bathroom had a slightly bad smell to it‚Äî perhaps the shower curtain could be replaced. Other guests were respectful and we had a lovely stay."

Definitely worth the stay!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A has a great apartment which is beautifully decorated. Room is neat and the bed is really soft. Great location where is it walking distance to the Main Street (Atwells St). However if u like the privacy of your bedroom, this might not be ideal as the rooms are close to each other, and shared bathroom. Overall is good for short stay"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I chose Anya's and Alex's place as our 3 nights stay in Providence and we don't regret it. The location was quite convenient. It takes 15 min walk to get to the bus stops to/from the airport, as well as the train station. *By the way, a little tip - if you want to get to Boston by MBTA train, it costs only $10 on the weekends and the rides are unlimited, means you can ride there and back as many times as you want*. Self check-in/check out were very smooth. The room itself was nice, well decorated and clean. My husband said the mattress was good (it matters to him). We lived on the 2nd floor and it was warm enough there (it matters to me). Common areas as kitchen and 2 bathrooms were always clean and well equipped. However, the bathroom on the 1st floor was a bit too cold for me (month of March). There were not many people living there at the same time, so it felt private. The street was quiet even on Friday and Saturday evening. Shortly say,I recommend this place!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing to complain about! Nice quiet room, friendly hosts but not invasive. 10/10 would recommend."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a clean, quiet, and comfortable stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The internet was a bit spotty. I contacted Alex and he got right on it by contacting Verizon. It seemed to be running fine when I left. Great spot. Great location. My only problem is that it is so close to the great restaurants of Atwells Ave that any money I save on their wonderful Air BnB is spent at the restaurants during my stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extremely short walk to little Italy. The place was comfortable and the instructions for check in/out were very clear. Would stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A's place was incredibly clean and a great value. It was exactly what we were looking for.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice and clean room that is a 20-minute walk away from the train station. The room is rather large with a desk and a very comfy bed. I did not use the shared area during my short stay, but it looked very inviting and clean. There are other AirBnB tenants around but quiet night hours were perfectly followed in my case (and clearly communicated by the hosts). The communication with the hosts was fast and clear. I would definitely stay here again!"

We will make sure to stay there again if we ever come back to Providence."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anya and Alex were great hosts with great communication, bedroom was nice and spacious and shared bathrooms had all supplies, had a great breakfast nearby in nitro bar!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place very much and would like to give this place the award of 'best place we stayed at (out of 12) during our 3 week trip in New England'.
It deserves all the 5 stars because of these 5 criteria we think are important: great deal/price, good mattress, super location, clean, personal touches of the hosts. Anya and Alex really nailed it on those 5 criteria. After so many overpriced, not worth it Airbnb stays, we were happy some people do Airbnb the way it should be. Thanks a lot. We will definitely come back."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I recommend staying at Anya and Alex. It‚Äôs super easy to check in on your own. You share the house with other guests but there‚Äôs plenty of room for everybody and everything is super clean. The rooms are big too. The location is great near the Italian neighbourhood (federal hill) but it‚Äôs very residential and you need to go downtown if you want some nightlife. It‚Äôs not too far with a car.
Overall great stay and the hosts are extra nice and quick to answer. Thank you!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Accurate description and clean
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"While I only stayed for one night I was absolutely impressed and pleased with my experience. Checking in was super easy, the location was prime, and the room was absolutely amazing. As soon as I walked in there were towels prepped and everything organized. I felt absolutely secure leaving my laptop in the room, which was crucial. I am a photographer and making sure my equipment is safe is always a priority. Anya & Alex went above and beyond to make sure there would be no kinks in communication and even recommended several local places to eat. Next time I am in Providence for a show I will certainly go out of my way to try and book with Anya & Alex both."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location!! Perfect sized room, suitable for simply getting ready and sleeping. The shared bathroom is directly outside the room and basically yours to use if no one else is staying there. Would definitely recommend!!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location when staying in Providence - the area has a great vibe but you're off the Main Street in the airbnb so it isn't noisy, and is also walking difference to downtown and other areas of note. The house itself was very clean, well kept and lots of small details to make the stay more enjoyable"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anya and Alex were great hosts for this trip. They were swift in their communication. The house was neat, tidy, and amenities were just as described. It was lovely to have off-street parking and a large private room with a huge walk-in closet. Easy walking to downtown and the Convention Center."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first time staying in an Airbnb that is just a private room. But let me tell you, they did not disappoint! We felt so comfortable and safe at this place! I was a little concerned about the shared bathroom situation but everything was so clean. There are 3 bedrooms upstairs and 1 downstairs. We were lucky enough to have the upstairs to ourselves since the other 2 rooms weren‚Äôt rented out so that was nice. A group of girls rented the downstairs room so we had our own levels of the house to ourselves! Made it so much easier and covid free friendly! Every room has their own lock and key, Anya and Alex left plenty of notes around the house making our stay THAT MUCH EASIER! Federal hill is just walking distance to so many cute and unique bars with the best authentic Italian grocery stores. There‚Äôs plenty of parking available as well! I appreciate how well they paid attention to details with this Airbnb and we definitely plan to come back in the future. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean & easy. Location was great and very easy to get to everything in providence .

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nice house, quiet neighborhood."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great! Nice place to land in Providence!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and fast response from them when I had questions!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was super clean and in a very convenient location. No complaints.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Pisa room is awesome and well decorated to match the name. There is so much space in the room! The bed is super comfortable too. It is soooo close to so many restaurants. We were able to walk there in less than 10 mins. We had everything we could‚Äôve possibly needed for our stay. The kitchen area is well stocked and there‚Äôs an area to eat in as well. We wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer because we loved the house and room. The hosts communicated well with us and the check in process was simple. Would definitely recommend staying here.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Accurate description of the space. Very clean and plentiful amenities. I appreciated the opportunity to leave our bags in the mudroom outside of the check in/out time. It's a very short walk away from the Little Italy part of town with a lot to eat and do. Will definitely stay here if I ever find myself in the area again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect and as described! Couldn‚Äôt beat the price! I was only in town for the night (less than 12 hrs) and just needed a place to rest my head. The room was super cozy and comfortable! The shared bathroom was never an issue and there was minimal noise throughout the house as it is shared with other guests. I liked that this room wasn‚Äôt facing the street so the noise wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. I did have a bit of a hard time with check in since I arrived past dark and felt unsure about the area. Anya answered my call quickly when I had a question and was super sweet and patient with me as I found the house. I was traveling by myself and wouldn‚Äôt recommend walking around at night by yourself but during the day the area was lovely and convenient to other places. I did feel safe in the house and it was super clean and beautifully decorated. Would stay here again! Thank you Anya and Alex!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Anya & Alex's place. I would highly recommend this place and come back again. Here is our nutshell:
Positives:
- Cleanliness. It was really well maintained, kudos to the cleaning staff.
- Coffee machine. I was working for 3 of the days and having a coffee machine at home was a lifesaver
- Wifi is ample quick
- Communication from the host
- Fantastic location
Bad:
There isn't really any but if I have to be nit-picky, I would say the squeaky noise wood makes when you walk. It is particularly noticeable in the upstair bedrooms (like the one we stayed)
Shared bathroom wasn't really a problem as there are 2 units in the house. This isn't necessarily a fancy BnB but they got all the basics right and that's what I look for when I travel."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was within a house with a couple of other rooms being rented out and a shared kitchen. The whole place was gorgeous and extremely clean and organized. There was a coffee machine in the kitchen that I took full advantage of in the morning! The surrounding area probably isn‚Äôt somewhere I‚Äôd want to wonder around alone at night, but I would definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value stay! Spacious, clean, and pretty. Walking distance from plenty of restaurants and within 5 minutes of downtown. Would recommend!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great stay, minutes away from an abundance of restaurants! Anya & Alex‚Äôs place was very clean and thoughtfully stocked with tea/coffee, toothbrush/toothpaste kits, etc., Check-in and check-out was easy, and the bed was quite comfortable. We were the only ppl there, too. Definitely recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my fav providence stays, though the snacks used to be better.. The terra chips were my favorite, but they‚Äôve been replaced by Lays :("
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and good for a quick visit!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed here and it‚Äôs just a wonderful experience! The place is so clean and welcoming and pretty! and the location is amazing!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really clean house with great location in Federal Hill. I also loved the fact that they gave us key to our rooms, which allowed locking them when we leave the house in case anyone is worried about privacy in a private room setting."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What wonderful hosts! The location was perfect; a 5 minute drive across the river to Brown University and great restaurants. Also a 5 minute walk to an area with shops and food. The home is clean and bright. Lots of tea and coffee and a stocked shared kitchen for any cooking/reheating needs. Highly recommend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check-in, great location in a quiet neighborhood next to some cool bars/ Italian restaurants, would definitely stay again"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous house with everything you could want and more! One of the best AirBnbs that I have stayed at. My only feedback is that I think it would be nice if the check out time was at 12pm, but they still allow guests to hold bags downstairs until 3pm in case you want to explore the city more."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the heart of federal hill! Super clean and bright as advertised. Check in was easy and everything worked just fine. The place is only 1 block from Atwells Ave so super close to all the restaurants there. Downtown Providence is only a 10-15 minute walk away so it‚Äôs a very convenient location overall.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall pretty good. Wifi password didn‚Äôt work. But really good value, clean otherwise, good communication and no hassle."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an excellent stay. I enjoyed and thank you!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was so clean and beautiful! The common area was so spacious and pretty, and the bedroom was so big with a huge wall in closet! The airbnb is so crazy close, walking distance, to both Fed Hill and Broadway - both of which have amazing food options so it‚Äôs a huge bonus! It‚Äôs such a wonderful place and I highly suggest!!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of Air bnbs in Rhode Island and this is my favorite so far. The space was comfortable and stylish. My room (PISA) had a walk in closet which would be great for an extended stay. Everything was clean and exactly as described.

Yesi"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this room and spent a lot of time in it! If you need natural light like me, this is the room for you! It‚Äôs big and sunny just as described. The bathrooms are nice, as are all the common areas. House temperature was really comfortable and the location couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect. I went for a jog each day and had ample options for cafes and food. My recommendation is ‚ÄòShastea‚Äô which is only a 5min walk from the house!"
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was really nicely appointed and the location excellent. The mattress was so comfy that I‚Äôm considering getting the same one for my new apartment!
The one drawback was the attention to cleanliness during a pandemic. The shared upstairs bathroom didn‚Äôt get cleaned until the last day we were there and all the rooms were booked at the same time making me feel a little worried about my exposure.
That being said, I found this little bnb super charming and had it not been for my concern over the pandemic, I think this type of boarding house is perfect for travelers like myself and would definitely stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place near downtown, just an easy walk to get to places I want to go. The place was clean and cozy. i love the block out curtains and the bed, it made it easier for me to sleep. The patio was nice, I am sad that I wasnt able to enjoy it as much since it was raining hard most of the time when I was there. Jennifer was responsive as a host. Will definitely be back. I highly recommend her place"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay. Will be back!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. No fault of Jen‚Äôs but the road noise is terrible. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and just struggled sleeping the entire time.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful accommodation. Walking distance to many fine restaurants. Could not have asked for a nicer experience. We will be sure to contract Jennifer again if we get back to Providence.
Thank you Jennifer!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice space, walking distance to Federal Hill area. Host was responsive. Street noise is audible from bedroom, host does provide a white noise machine. Nice deck and view of the city. We spent minimal time in the apartment as there is so much to do in the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a very responsive host and all instructions were very clear.
The place was better than the pictures and I was able to have work calls with no disturbances.
Felt very safe walking and did not have any negative interactions my entire stay; I walked every day and evening and all restaurant recommendations by Jennifer will very helpful.
Will definitely book this or another property with them again in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was fantastic in terms of being able to walk pretty much anywhere within 20 minutes. there were some outstanding food venues within a 5 to 10 minute walk and the convention center was about 15 minutes away. The apartment itself was simply decorated but had just about everything you could need. The one item I do wish it had was a washer dryer setup, but there was a laundromat within a 2-minute walk of the apartment. One thing to keep in mind is that it's a slightly older building so it's pretty easy to hear people walking around in the other apartments, especially at night when it's quiet. It wasn't a big deal and a noise maker is provided to help with the problem, but if it's something you're sensitive to then it might be a bigger deal. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay while in Providence, will definitely stay here again! Very clean and peaceful!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, sleek apartment with a view of Providence‚Äôs downtown from the rear balcony. Jennifer was very communicative ahead of check-in, which was seamless (including thorough parking instructions). Apartment is well set up for remote working with fast wifi and an office with lots of plugs/USB chargers and bright lamps for video conferencing/meetings. It‚Äôs a second floor walk-up."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was in a perfect location, close to College Hill, surrounded by things to do and places to eat. Place felt safe and very clean. Everything was set up for us. The building carries a lot of sound (Could hear every time someone used the stairs) but wasn‚Äôt much of a bother. Little pricey but is mainly reflected in the convenience of the area. Great host, and will definitely be my first pick when I come back to Providence."

The parking space was very convenient. The unit was clean and well-appointed. The deck was a nice bonus. The location is in a city, so you will hear city noises, such as traffic, people, trash trucks, etc. Overall, a great location and a great unit. We would stay here again.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, spacious apartment and responsive hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer‚Äôs place was beautiful and in pristine condition. I primarily chose it for the outdoor space, but it was too cold to spend quality time out there during our time there. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. While we didn‚Äôt cook, she did have plenty of items needed - pots, pans, dishes, drink ware, and silverware. She also had a coffee pot with coffee ready to go. (Dishwasher, too!)
We really also loved that there was a parking spot for our one vehicle. Jennifer was EXTREMELY clear in providing us directions to the lot and overall checkin.
Some things to keep in mind, depending on why you are visiting:
- it‚Äôs about a .4-.5 mile walk to Atwells, a great strip with wonderful restaurant
- you can‚Äôt have more than two people inside the apartment at any time - this turned out fine because we were able to meet with our friend for dinner instead, but keep that in mind.
- pick up some water, as the tap is unfiltered
- there‚Äôs an iron and bath towels
- the WFH room is huge!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was nice, simple, spacious and a nice little back patio. We enjoyed our selves overall. The only thing I‚Äôd be conscious of when staying here, it‚Äôs located next to the main police precinct so sirens are inevitably the last things you hear before sleep and first things you‚Äôre hearing waking."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay & the weather was amazing so we took advantage of the beautiful cozy deck! The apartment itself was beautifully furnished, and the furniture was super comfortable too, and had the best sleep on the bed. Everything you need is in walking distance too, perfect place & location. Thank you for the stay, will def be booking again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cozy apartment, GREAT location in Fed Hill next to all the restaurants and a HUGE plus is the parking!! This area has little to no parking unless you live in the area and Jennifer secured a safe parking area just one block from the police station and across the street from the unit, bravo!! The place has a great AC too for those hot summer days, clean as a whistle and Jennifer is very responsive and proactive! Would highly recommend and would stay here again, thank you very much!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in Providence for the marathon and this was a great place to stay- in a nice neighborhood but within walking distance of the downtown. The neighborhood has lots of dining options and we met friends for a good meal at Massimo Ristorante. The apartment living area is on the small side but comfortable for our short stay and the outdoor sitting area was very nice. We enjoyed our time in Providence and hope to be back soon!

Very friendly and proactive‚Ä¶the location is immaculate, a lot to do around and very walkable. Unfortunately there‚Äôs a disaster neighbor upstairs with a big dog, so isn‚Äôt easy to rest as they‚Äôre very loud and get up daily at 6am, apart of this everything is very nice, worth it, clean and cozy."

2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good basic spot near downtown. Was in town to review RISD portfolios at the convention center. Check in was super easy with key code for building and apartment. Patio would‚Äôve been great (but it rained boo). Lots of clean towels, basic amenities and coffee provided (even cream in the fridge). The Grange across the street was an amazing restaurant!"

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five star is not enough!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"New and clean, just as the pictures show. Easy to get to the restaurants on Atwells Ave. Was able to find parking during the day and early evening close by on the street. Overnight parking is a 10 minute walk but there is a Brewpub along the way so no an issue for me!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer‚Äôs place is in a great location, with a very short walk to the plenty of restaurants and shops in Federal Hill and about a 10 min walk to downtown Providence.

We‚Äôd definitely stay here again and highly recommend Jennifer‚Äôs place!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it!!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer‚Äôs place was very clean and was close to a lot of great restaurants (my main reason for visiting).
One of my only complaints (and she makes this clear) is that there‚Äôs no parking overnight, so you have to park in a garage ($25/night) that‚Äôs about one mile away.
Other than the parking, it‚Äôs a nice spot."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean space, great for a quick trip"
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the stay in Federal Hill! You're minutes from downtown as well. The apartment itself is exactly as advertised. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the parking. That's the only issue. There was no parking on site, the closest parking garage was a 10 minute walk and $25 a night! I wouldn't have minded the walk if it were not for it being in the middle of a snow storm! Obviously that is out of the owners control. Regardless the apartment itself was beautiful and I would certainly recommend it!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great location! Will definitely stay here again."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations for the price were great, well styled, minimalistic, and organized. However it was so loud, the walls were like paper and it is a busy street. They did have earbuds which were a nice touch but didn‚Äôt really fix the issue for me."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,it worth my money.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I regularly go to Alex's airbnb because I feel right at home when I m there, I have to travel for work and I would recommend everyone to try their place, but since I will be the most regular visitor I m not sure others will get a chance to experience the amazing airbnb"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to get to, clean, no frills ... I was there for a convention and had quite a few bags to take up, which the narrow staircases to the apartment did not make easy. There was an AC in the window ( in November ) which had the room freezing, and the directions for controlling the heat did not match the control unit on the wall :/ ... those gripes aside, bed & pillows were comfy & eventually I managed to get the temp situation under control."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room and apartment was well appointed and comfortable. Perfect for a short stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Due to the electronic locks, very simple, convenient and quick access to the property. Everything was available, from towels, to shower gel, even toothbrush sets with toothpaste. The room on the street was correspondingly noisy due to the cars, but with ear protection (which was also there on site), it was no problem for me personally. Would choose this place again next time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice room, very clean.
Communication with host perfect"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very comfortable stay at Alexey's place from a Friday evening to a Sunday morning (2 nights). The apartment was very comfortable and clean with plenty of space. The bed was comfortable and it was great having access to a full kitchen.
I did not meet Alexey in person, but he was friendly and responsive electronically, and checkin was very straightforward. The location had good bus service via RIPTA and I was able to get to downtown (and to the Brown University campus) by Lyft in under 10 minutes. There were a couple adequate food and grocery options in a less than 10 minute walk that Alexey suggested, and his suggestions were on the mark.
The bathroom was shared with 2 other guest rooms but this was fine for my stay since the other guests were considerate.
And my stay was a great value. I would stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Alex was a great host.! Very easy to communicate with and the room was exactly as I thought it would be and was great. I would definitely stay here again on any return trip to Providence.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay! Big bedroom, clean and tidy, close to downtown. The host is considerate and they prepared everything you need for the stay The only issue was the quilt had a very strong odor and I could not use it, but then Alexey directed me to change it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alexey's Airbnb is as pictured. Clean and well appointed. Spacious and bright room. Alexey offers earplugs which is not a refusal because outside noises can be disturbing for people sensitive to noise like me.
Supermarket 5 minutes by walking which is convenient because I don't have a vehicle. Two buses nearby allow you to go downtown.
I had a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was good.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I enjoyed the stay. Alex is kind and a good host. He responded my messages quickly. I definitely recommend the place!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a comfortable stay here. I was slightly familiar with the area from previously living in providence. Everything was clearly listed with the room numbers password and where items were in cabinets. Only thing not labeled was the fridge shelves like description said or I didn't see them because there was a bunch of food there that could have been from the other people. Kitchen was a little messy when I arrived but that was cleaned up once I returned. Like warned it can be noisy with traffic thru the street along with a lounge being down the street.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Alexey was super polite and quick to respond. Clean space. A lot of locks to go through but I appreciate the safety
2023-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My stay here was 10/10. Everything from the room to the kitchen and bathroom were very clean and organized! I felt very safe in the building and the accommodations were above and beyond. If I need another airbnb I‚Äôll be sure to look for another if Alexey‚Äôs rooms!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for the business professional on the go. A peaceful haven in the middle of the city.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, private parking and he gave snacks"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The airbnb looks exactly like in the pictures. It‚Äôs clean and the bed is so comfortable! It comes with little extras like a coffee machine, a shave and dental kit and snacks in the room!
Nevertheless, it was pretty noisy at night. Two men were yelling at each other on the street and a dog from a neighbor was barking until after 1am.
I would still recommend the place, for one night and for more than one night. It‚Äôs probably one of the cleanest and most comfortable airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at so far. The little kitchenette is definitely a huge plus."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great room, quiet, clean and extremely comfortable."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,(Refer to previous review)
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable stay, the bed literally feels like a cloud! I was so comfortable there that I extended my stay. Only downside is walls are super thin. Could hear upstairs neighbors (it was before quiet hours though so not a complaint just an observation) and people could hear me (watching Netflix on my phone) but everyone respected quiet hours. Loved that there were snacks in the bedroom, and the bathroom had shaving kits and dental hygiene kits. A really nice touch as those are things people tend to forget or lose during their travel."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Alexey's place for over two months, my stay was mainly from Monday to Friday I didn't stay over the weekends. Alexey gave me the same room every week. I noticed that anytime I went back to the room on Monday there was evidence that the room had been thoroughly clean with fresh supplies. Great job !
Another thing I have to mention is that I didn't find parking one night when I returned from work because another guest had taken two spots. I ended up parking on the street and the next morning there was parking violation ticket on my door. I brought this to Alexey's attention and he apologized and also took care of the ticket as well. I greatly appreciate this kind gesture. Thank you"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, very easy check-in -- there's a combination lock on the outer door and on the door to your room and everyone gets their own code for that visit. There's wifi, naturally, and it's a quiet neighborhood.
Be sure to read the listing carefully. There are several rooms listed here, one (some?) of which have off-street parking and some of which do not. There's no street parking or garages in the area, so if you don't get the off-street parking one(s) then you'll need to park a ways off and hike / Uber / mass transit in."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alexey‚Äôs space was clean and ready to check into the moment of my arrival. I really appreciated it.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place,Nice and neat.
Very comfortable bed .The price is veryAffordable compared to other places. Parking is available and is a big plus. I will definitely stay again"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was as described:
-Good value for the room
-The sheets were crazy soft
-Had some pots, pans, etc. which was nice
-Building was clean
Random Comments:
-The building is next to a relatively noisy street, but Alexey provided earplugs though, so no big deal.
-The neighborhood isn't phenomenal, but having off-street driveway parking makes it not a big deal.
-Alexey didn't lie, the driveway is tight, so make sure your car is small otherwise you're parking on the street.
-Never met Alexey. Condo is ran like a hostel, which is no big deal if you're not interested in the host/guest experience. You just kind of show-up, go inside, go to your locked room."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, easy, clean stay! We loved our time here. Will stay again"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, homey, private feel even though sharing bathroom. Fast communication with Alexey. Can‚Äôt beat the price."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stumbled upon this College Hill gem trying to secure lodging for a field hockey event at Brown. Apartment was perfect for the three of us (2 adults and a 16yo). Great location, close and safe off-street parking, clean, quiet and stocked apartment with everything needed for a stay away from home. Loved being able to ditch car and walk pretty much everywhere. Jennifer is responsive and detailed with her communication which made everything efficient and care-free. Definitely recommend for a stay in Providence area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything when good
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect. The apartment was impeccable and with everything you need. Jose was extremely friendly and always attentive to anything. Something very useful was the fact that the apartment had a private garage. I felt right at home. There was a bus stop a 3-minute walk away and from there I was in the center in 15-20 minutes. I highly recommend anything I'm thinking about this home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jose was such a great host with such an a nice cozy space! Felt right at home! Very quick with responses and so accommodating with everything. We loved our stay and would definitely stay again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely enjoyed this stay. Great hosts & the space is more spacious in person. It was clean, comfortably quaint, & I loved the personal touches like the decor, the snacks, water, a lavender face mask, coffee, tea, and the list goes on. They thought of all the little things. As a note, if you have a bigger car just be mindful that getting into the parking spot is a bit tight. Other than that, I had absolutely no issues. The hosts were friendly, responsive, & the place was so cute! I will return again :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jose and Eddily‚Äôs place was fantastic. The room had more walking space than expected. Very nice and clean bathroom and bedroom area. The parking was a little tight for larger cars, but could still fit SUV. Overall, could not have picked a better place to stay for my first visit to Rhode Island!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great ! Very clean and very nice set up . Easy access and Jose was very responsive. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone and would stay here again on our next visit to providence !

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice cozy stay. I expected the loud music coming from the club next door but the ear plugs provided helped me sleep great üëçüèª
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came for a show at The Vet and had a great stay! As mentioned in the post, you can hear the music from the bar downstairs pretty late. If you‚Äôre a light sleeper or early to bed, this may be a challenge but we weren‚Äôt too bothered by it and were expecting it. The apartment had just about anything we needed for our stay. The place was very centrally located with lots of shops and dining choices within walking distance. We would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Norah‚Äôs place was spacious and very comfortable. Everything was as described and the apt was very clean. Would recommend!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Hidden in fine print at the end of the listing it is noted that the unit is directly above a dance club playing - LOUD - music until 1/2 am weekends. The booming club music bass vibrating the walls and cabinets at 12 am made me think I was being prepared for interrogation at Guantanamo. It thankfully ended at 2 am and Saturday was 1/2 as loud as Friday.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The noisy bar below the unit, was as expected. Bearable but loud."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Close to everything!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable apartment in a great location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah‚Äôs Place was great both Norah and Charles are super accommodating and sweet. The venue across the street can get loud but Norah has a laundry machine, Tea, utensils, all the little extra things that make the place cozy. A big plus was everything looked clean and washed so I wasn‚Äôt afraid to sleep on anything."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was a great stay! The apartment was very clean, kitchen was stocked with all the necessities for cooking, and it's located in the heart of everything in the city! Would definitely book again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Norah‚Äôs place was very quiet - it is next to a concert venue but the weekend I was there they didn't have any shows so it was very quiey. Very quick walk to coffee/convention center but I did have an uncomfortable incident my first night where someone almost followed me into the building so be aware of your surroundings. I shared this with Norah who then shared it with the building manager. Very clean space with a well stocked kitchen if you are planning to cook.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing host!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment located in downtown Providence. Loved the location, there were so many great restaurants and cafes within a 3-5minute walk radius! Only a short 15minute walk to RISD museum and a longer stroll to the college hill area. Read reviews about the apartment being located above a music venue. We stayed for the whole weekend and had no problems with that, it was super quiet through the whole stay! Hosts were also very responsive and kind. Overall, would recommend for those wanting to stay in the downtown area and want to be at a walkable distance to most places!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Norah's place was the perfect stay for our work trip to Providence. Safe, clean, walkable, and everything we needed to feel right at home. Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Was extremely friendly and had clear instructions. The place was clean and looked exactly like the photos in a great area
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's place is exactly as described. It is a beautiful place and centrally located. The kitchen is lovely and well equipped. She has put a lot of thought into making it comfortable. For example, there is a charging station on the bedside table, a nice coffee maker, and signs around that explain everything. There was music at the Strand on Friday night, as stated in the listing, but it was quiet on Saturday night. The heating system was very loud, but worked well. I would stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and walkable to restaurants, bars, & shopping all right in the heart of downtown Providence. Norah was very responsive and helpful as well. Definitely recommend for couples traveling into the city."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I really enjoyed my stay! Tons to walk around to do. Lots of cute boutiques and restaurants. Definitely would stay again. Very Comfy bed
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredibly centrally located and easy to find as the description states. The noise that is listed from the club downstairs is rarely ever bad unless you are an incredibly light sleeper, and there are earbuds provided for you in the space anyways! Hosts are incredibly responsive, and the place is cozy and works well for any situation! Lots of love to this little space!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My start was great! Thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our first trip to Rhode Island! The apt was perfect; everything as listed and very comfortable. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location; we tried a different coffee shop each morning. Walked all over the city and then rented a car and went to Newport and surrounds. Would def recommend the apt.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Except for a few hairs found in tub and in the bed ..the whole experience was outstanding
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great day at Norah‚Äôs place for our first time in Providence. The apartment was a good size and was close to so many cute shops and restaurants downtown. I‚Äôd definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious for a one bedroom. Easy to find. Parking right there. Cozy is accurate description. Central to downtown. Clean!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient for the business traveler. Great space. Big, very clean, with lots of amenities. Fast wifi. Hosts are super responsive which is greatly appreciated. I‚Äôd definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very clean and cozy apartment. Although the entrance to the building itself is sandwiched between a Dunkin Donuts shop and the Strand, a live music venue, it‚Äôs quiet once you get into the apartment building. You will find all the essentials well stocked. The water pressure was good for the shower, and can get pretty hot - I do love taking shower with high water temperature and still I had to turn it down a bit- very good. There is a nice desk for work in the bedroom- very convenient. The location is great, can easily walk to many shops and to Brown University. Definitely a great place to stay while visiting my son at BU."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,nice location in downtown Providence!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay and Norah was incredibly helpful in addressing all of our inquiries. The location was perfect, especially for us as non-drivers, as it was situated right in the heart of the city center, making everything easily accessible on foot."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect for us. Clean, comfy, great location. Everything was perfect."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place I have stayed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay in downtown Providence. The unit was pristine and so convenient to restaurants and an easy walk to JWU. The listing prepared us for possible city noise and the owner provides earplugs, but the noise was not bad at all. We had a minor issue with bedding for the sofa and the Norah was very responsive and understanding. Parking in the Biltmore garage was easy and street parking was sometimes available. The one minor downside was the common areas of the building--hallway had an odor and is in need of carpet cleaning. We hope to be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed this stay in the city. Almost everything was within walking distance. The Apt was spacious and comfortable. Try the Korean place nearby, MokBun (<5 min walk)!!!"
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"the actual place was fine, as good as it could be considering the complex as a whole was dirty and reeked like cigarettes constantly. but it‚Äôs the city so what are ya gonna do. it‚Äôs the bare minimum which is what we needed for this short stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Norah is super friendly and helpful. Her response is always swift. My son and I enjoyed staying in Norah' place. Norah got everything we can think of and could possibly need and much more than that. if you are looking for some place which make you feel homey, this is it. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the heart of downtown Providence within walking distance of great restaurants and public transportation. Norah and Charles‚Äô home was the perfect landing point for my partner and I while visiting town for a wedding. They were flexible with check in and communicative. The condo felt very safe with double entry, and was extremely clean inside. Large kitchen that was fully decked out- we didn‚Äôt need to use it this weekend, but would have had everything we‚Äôd need if we did. (This is always appreciated as someone who typically cooks while on vacation) Would absolutely recommend for a couple or small family while exploring Rhode Island."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is my most perfect rental experience. This apartment is in the best location in Providence, and you can walk to the railway station, shopping center, RISD and Brown University. There are restaurants, supermarkets and car rental companies near the apartment. This is the apartment with the most complete Household goods I have rented, which shows that the landlord is very careful. The room is very clean. I really appreciate the landlord!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Norah was a great host and the place was nice and clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was smooth and communication was clear and timely. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was easy to get to from the train station and located in the center of the city making everything walkable and accessible. Norah was very descriptive and provided easy instructions. We had a great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nora's home was perfection for our trip and needs. It was a lovely, urban oasis that offered the walkability for coffee, restaurants/bars and groceries yet spacious and peaceful. It was easy to find & a seamless check in process as outlined clearly in her instructions. The surround streets are very cute with a variety of shops, bars & restaurants.
The apartment looks exactly like the photos and is impeccably well appointed, clean and thoughtful. I really appreciated the kitchen which was fully equipped with things like a rice cooker, measuring cups, good quality pots & pans for meals during our stay. There were ample plugs strategically placed throughout the home, well placed lighting, wifi, extra linens, cleaning supplies, stain remover near the washer/dryer unit, instructions throughout and even ear plugs (which we didn't need). Nora and her family thought of everything!
I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and highly reccomend her location to anyone visiting the Providence area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nora‚Äôs place is in a great location, very walkable to the train station, restaurants and shops. The apartment was nice and well furnished, I loved the Nespresso machine. The noise from the bar downstairs was noticeable but I had no problem falling asleep, the bed was super comfy."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Nora‚Äôs place! There was lots to do close by, and the loft was very spacious."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for almost a full week. Norah‚Äôs place was great. Exactly what we needed! Norah is super responsive too.
LOCATION: We wanted to be downtown near everything, it was a perfect location. Providence is super walkable and has tons of restaurants and cafes.
AMENITIES: The place had everything we needed; backup lines, a washer/dryer, kitchen necessities, etc. Bed was SO comfortable. I slept so well.
NOISE: The noise from downstairs is true‚Äî you can hear the deep bass from the music. It kept me up a little bit but my partner was fine. It helped to put in earplugs (provided) and turn on one of the box fans (also provided). Also, it only played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. Every other night it was quiet.
* One downside is that right out the windows is a parking garage; so not much of a view. But other than that, exactly as described.
* I‚Äôd also recommend that they put some more ‚Äúhomey‚Äù touches on the place, like rugs, maybe some more art. It didn‚Äôt feel super cozy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's place was excellent. It is very centrally located in downtown Providence and was an easy walk to a number of great restaurants, bars, and the train station. The apartment was clean and check-in was a breeze. It had everything we needed for our stay - utensils, towels (tons of extra), iron, and a great selection of coffee and tea. There were also a number of board games available and a large desk in the bedroom that would be a great work-from-home setup. We ended up leaving our car in the Biltmore garage for 2 days, which cost $70. A little pricier than I would have liked, but worth it for the convenience! We would definitely stay here again"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Norah‚Äôs place was wonderful! The apartment was clean and located in a great area downtown close to a handful of restaurants and cafes. Norah herself was also very accommodating and communicative.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! Clean, open space with everything you could need. Close to a lot of good bars, restaurants and the colleges. On our last night, we were out late and we got locked out (we extended our stay last minute) but Norah answered quickly and solved the issue within minutes. Would definitely stay here again!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was awesome for visiting downtown Providence and Federal Hill. Room was very clean. Amenities have clearly written instructions. Worth a stay. Thank you Norah for answering my questions proactively!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment, totally as advertised. Great space and all notes were easily laid out. My only small critique is the HVAC is a little loud when it kicks on, but not enough to deter from a 5 star review. Great location downtown, and easy to walk or catch Ubers. Would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay!! We practically walked everywhere - so many different bars and restaurants within blocks of the apartment. As stated in the listing it did get loud one night because of the concert hall type place next door, but I really appreciated already being made aware of that. I really loved the layout of the apartment, and the decor. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's condo is fantastic! I came here over a long weekend for a writer's retreat, and got a week's worth of work done in a day. The unit is spacious, clean, and within easy walking distance of great restaurants and several corner stores. The perfect place to hole up with a cup of tea and get stuff done. Highly recommended, would love to stay here again next time I'm in Providence. Thanks Norah!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah‚Äôs condo was perfect for our weekend trip to Providence. Parking garage right next to the building made it super convenient if you‚Äôre arriving by car. $25/night but that‚Äôs about the norm for the area. The unit was clean and fully stocked with everything you need. Nespresso coffee in the morning was awesome to have! Very comfortable towels and bedding. You can‚Äôt get a better location downtown than this, walkable to everything. Very safe area. Norah was also very responsive and was a great host. Highly recommend! I would stay here again if I‚Äôm ever back in town."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment feels safe and in a great location! Heart of downtown and only a 5 min. Uber from the Amtrak station. Everything was clean and straightforward to use. The neighborhood was a little noisy at night with the bars around being that it was a weekend and there was heavy bass/music until 2am from the club downstairs but we expected it from the reviews. Knowing these things, would definitely recommend to stay!"

Thanks so much"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's place was immaculate - exactly as pictured in the photos. Super clean and the instructions were very clear for finding the loft and checking in. It's a great space right in the downtown area, so close to many restaurants within walking distance and also to Providence Place (the mall). Parking at the Biltmore Garage was close by. Definitely a perfect spot if you want to stay in downtown Providence."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's place is situated where you can access many restaurants, shops etc; it was very convenient for me that a 7-11 was within walking distance for late night runs. Everything in her place was very accommodating and I enjoyed watching movies on the plasma tv. I especially loved sleeping in that comfortable bed, which is very important for me wherever I'm traveling away from home. I also forgot my soap and it was very pleasing that body wash was provided as an essential. I reccomend anyone to stay at Norah's place if you are visiting Rhode Island, you will be pleasantly happy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in a central location for my long weekend trip to Providence! As other reviews note, there‚Äôs a club under the unit that plays loud music at night on the weekend until 2 AM, but I knew to expect that and slept with earbuds in. The apartment was well-furnished and stocked for my stay, and a short walk from the train station (MBTA/Amtrak), the river (for WaterFire), and plenty of nearby restaurants. I ended up finding street parking fairly easily though the Biltmore Garage was also a block away. I‚Äôd stay here again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, but the bar below does play loud music until late and parking was not ideal. But the condo was very nice and clean."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah‚Äôs place is lovely, comfortable, well furnished and right downtown. And value was strong compared to other priced places to stay. Only issue is that there is a club on the first floor which means you will hear the bass of loud music while in bed until 2 am on weekends. There are earplugs but be aware that the bass specifically you will hear regardless."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's was everything we were looking for, cute, cozy, and within walking distance to the mall and numerous downtown restaurants. The bed is comfy, sheets and blankets are soft, and the loft is extremely clean. I couldn't ask for more."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the flat for a 5-night Christmas visit from my daughter and her partner; they thought it perfect (her note: One of the best-equipped AirB&Bs we have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Bed was comfortable, WiFi was fast, and everything was lovely. Strongly recommend.). Sadly, an unfortunate event demanded their return home two days after their arrival, and upon my informing Norah of the early departure, she replied with a totally unanticipated gift: she refunded two nights of the booking. Familiar with the rental policy as I was, it hadn't entered my mind to ask whether she might consider any refund or credit; this was entirely her idea. Norah's kindness and generosity brightened the derailed holiday!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my time in Rhode Island this airbnb was great!! It‚Äôs in a prime location the only possible complaint is the noise level on the weekend due to being right above the club but Im a heavy sleeper so it didn‚Äôt bother me! The bed was extremely comfortable which I loved!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, extremely clean room. The host responded when needed and gave excellent instructions. Will definitely book again if in the area!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and spacious place at a great location with restaurants, a mall, and the Amtrak all 5-10 minutes away."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really is a great stay, perfect location in the heart of providence with great places around it. Bed was very comfortable. There‚Äôs a loud bar underneath the building that‚Äôs the only downside. But it stops around 1am."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfy bed, lots of space, and the location downtown was perfect! If youre planning on a seeing Providence (especially for a Waterfire event), THIS is the location you want!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is so nice! It‚Äôs located near quite a few things and makes providence very walkable. You can hear the nightclub downstairs at night, but I live in a city so it didn‚Äôt bother me. There were clear instructions on how to use the coffee maker and tips for making the stay successful. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great downtown location.
Plenty of good restaurants and shopping nearby.
Neighborhood has a college vibe."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well equipped, downtowm location, parking a challenge."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah's home was lovely, clean and spacious for two, had a bunch of amenities and good wifi for working, and was in a great location (walking distance from all the main areas). Free parking was possible (we got lucky with street parking that didn't have meters, and there are several streets that don't have signs), but otherwise there's a parking structure around the block and metered street parking everywhere. For laundry, there's an in-unit washer/dryer combo machine, but the dryer part wasn't the best. However, there is a laundry room (that uses quarters) on the same floor that is available 24hours -- worked well for us. Overall, would recommend Norah's home!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a great and clean place for a couple! It was my first time in providence and the location was perfect! Only down fall was the elevator had such a bad smell but other then that everything about this place was great!
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect - very central. Well equipped with everything you need for a short stay.
The only downside (which we were notified of before, and only happens in the summer apparently) was that on Saturday night, the bar downstairs played music that was very loud in the flat. Norah provided earplugs to help block the noise, which is very thoughtful."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and beautiful apartment right in the heart of downtown Providence. Amazing location for our stay and walkable to almost everything we wanted to do. The music downstairs is no joke though so if you are a light sleeper who doesn't plan on staying up late this might not be the right spot for you. Norah and Charles responded quickly when we needed them.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The apartment is in a very central location, which made it easy to get out during the day. The apartment was super cozy and clean. Perfect for a trip to Providence!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apt was as expected - clean and bright. The location is awesome for a Providence visit and the hosts were very responsive and accommodating. We will be back!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cute and so conveniently located near everything! Best part was Dunkin located right outside the entrance! The instructions left around the house were really helpful and I didn‚Äôt even know a washer + dryer in one machine existed!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, high ceilings in the apartment are a plus. Great time!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charles & Nora‚Äôs place was the perfect spot for a long weekend getaway in the city.

We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and have already talked about staying here the next time we come back to Providence!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and very convenient to everything. There was a party near by one of the nights we stayed that was pretty loud but otherwise great place to stay.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! Spacious, great location, and very comfortable! It includes lots of nice little touches that make it feel like home, such as a garment iron\steamer, a Nespresso with Coffee, a full kitchen, and a washer in the unit. Check-in is super easy too!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place overall, very clean and easy check in process‚Ä¶ centrally located only issue that should be known it is located above a popular night club which on weekends plays music till 2am and can be heard loudly in the loft."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place! Amazingly clean and well stocked. Comfortable and close to everything, love being able to walk to whatever we needed. Norah and Charles provided more than accurate detailing and we loved being able to have a later check out time which worked in our benefit with our plans and continually weather delays. It was like a home away from home for us!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norah and Charles's place is beautiful, spacious and clean. We really enjoyed our stay and were very comfortable. We had a flight change and Norah graciously allowed us to have a late checkout. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the amazing stay!"

Thanks Nora and Charles for an amazing stay! If you‚Äôre coming to providence, I definitely recommend staying here."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charles and Nora provide a tasteful and clean apartment space. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking equipment. The living area and bedroom are spacious and comfortable. The location is very convenient and centrally located. My only gripe is that a club or beer garden was directly underneath the apartment, and they played loud music until 2 a.m. each of the nights I stayed. The music was loud enough that I found it impossible to sleep until it was turned off for the night."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is as described, clean, in the heart of downtown, great property and location."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit is clean and very nicely stocked (especially the kitchen). It's comfortable with a nice comfortable bed. We had the unfortunate luck to be there on a Saturday when the bar downstairs was having live outdoor music til 2am, but the Friday night was quiet so clearly not an every day event. We luckily had a sound machine for our baby to partially drown it out. Despite that, we had a lovely stay and would recommend this place, especially if you are not early birds like us and would be down at the bar enjoying the music anyway."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Norah and Charles‚Äô place. The condo is exactly like the photos on the listing. Clean, comfortable, great amenities and excellent location. Communication is great and Norah absolutely made sure that we have a pleasant stay."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a delightful experience for us. The condo was spacious, tastefully furnished, quiet, very well situated in the heart of
downtown Providence and we greatly appreciated the fully equipped kitchen and the Japanese influence with rice cooker and shoe tray. Don't be put off by the musty lobby smell and cigarette odor in the hall. None of it intrudes upon the comfortable apartment."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charles and Norah‚Äôs apartment is great! It‚Äôs clean, spacious, and features all the amenities you‚Äôll need for your stay. The location is awesome too, with a parking garage, food spots, and entertainment close by. It‚Äôs also off of major highways so it‚Äôs really easy to get to. Checking in and out was also seamless."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just WOW! This place is very cozy and comfortable. Great location in downtown. There‚Äôs is a lot of space in this loft. Everything is as described.

Parking was right behind the apartment and could be accessed from a back door which made unloading your vehicle about 10 steps away. Coffee shop was right across the street and had great coffee and sandwiches. There is a pizza place next store called hotline pizza, which only takes orders online at set up time slots (I highly recommend). Julians is a block away with a great breakfast and lunch special. Also, about 3 blocks behind the building is Atwells Ave. with about 20 different restaurants. In sum, great location, apartment, host and experience.
Thank you Aref"

A few missing items in kitchen for week-long stay but Aref was happy to take suggestions and was able to accommodate right away. Can‚Äôt beat location! Minutes walk away from convention centre (we walked it a few times daily!) and great restaurants- and surrounded by fantastic coffee shops & bakeries. Shopping mall attached to convention centre.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfy cozy!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is exactly as the pictures show! Clean and very neat, bathroom was clean and well stocked with plenty of towels but it was a very small space. Great stay, the only thing that was a little off putting is that an hour before we were suppose to check out someone came to the door and we heard them put the code in and the lock turn. No one came in but we were already packed up and about to leave so we did just that."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was an absolute pleasure at walk in. It was clean and organized. The beds were so comfy and we felt right at home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs a really cute apartment to stay! Furniture and decorations are perfect. Big rooms. And the kitchen is also very nice for cooking

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unfortunately the power went out in the neighborhood and Aref was communicative on the situation and offered a full refund. He was very kind and helpful and I would happily book again with him. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Took my family last minute. Very nice place kids loved it. Close to Mall and walking distance to Fed Hill.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed a mid-week stay at this lovely space on the west side of Providence. It was the perfect getaway, cozy enough for inside time while near enough to good food, sites, and parks. Aref was pleasant and responsive. We would enjoy visiting again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The airbnb was beautifully renovated. Only stayed for 1 night so it was just what we needed. Extra lofted bed was a great use of space. Aref sent pre-arrival emails which made our stay easy. The only feedback I would have is instructions on how to use the thermostat as it was quite warm in the home when we arrived. Thank you for a great stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host is super friendly! When there was a minor problem, he stopped by immediately to fix the issue! House is really pretty, cozy, and overall amazing!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Area‚Äôs place was great for a quick one night visit to Providence. It was close to downtown and an easy 25 minute walk to the train station. The building was quiet and the apartment was beautifully decorated. We‚Äôd stay here again if in the area.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was lovely and clean with a coffee shop right across the road. My only problem was that it was almost winter and the outside temperature went down to 32 at the night. I figured out how to turn the thermostat on, but maybe others may not. This heated up the main room very quickly and well. However, the bedrooms remained icy even though I found the floor vents. My friend ended up sleeping on the sofa in the front room to a) stay warm and b) get away from an extremely noisy and annoying generator or something right outside. I was annoyed by it as well but had brought earplugs. There was a vibration associated with whatever the thing was. I imagine that in the Spring and Summer, none of this would be a problem.
It's a really beautiful space and a fascinating walkable neighbourhood with terrific and interesting architectural bits and pieces on the houses. The Nitro coffee shop (and bicycle shop) is right across the road and everyone there was incredibly friendly"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fabulous stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Aref was great! Very communicative and had no issues during our time in the accomodations.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a cute place. My friends and I had a birthday dinner/sleepover here and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with how the stay went. The place is stunning, I want to give whoever designed this place a hug like it was too cute! The beds and couches were sooooo comfy. My friend even made a comment that whoever cleans that place needs a raise because everything she inspected from the bathroom towels to the cups in the kitchen was immaculate. There‚Äôs only 1 parking spot in the driveway but the extra cars parked on the street just fine, we didn‚Äôt get any tickets. I don‚Äôt think I have anything bad to say, the host was super helpful and friendly and the location was cute and quiet. I even met some of the neighbors and they were delightful too. Such a cute place, 10/10 id stay here again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The flat is very beautiful and organized, love the design! It was a bit cold in the rooms but it‚Äôs manageable. Got everything we needed and would definitely recommend."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,CleanÔºågood- lookingÔºåbut heater not well. Bedroom too cold ( already turned on for hours but not working). Host is nice and friendly

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"A group of us caught a show at the Providence Performing Arts Center and absolutely loved our stay here. We felt like there was plenty of space for the seven of us, with more than enough sleeping options too! The unit was extremely clean, and modern, it gave us everything we needed. It was only a short walk to the downtown area and across the street from an amazing coffee shop. Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fabulous stay! The location is perfect - a 10 minute walk and you are downtown - in 3 mins you're on Atwell Ave. The apartment is more stunning than in the photos. It is beautifully decorated in a minimalist style, yet is super comfy and welcoming. The extra touches like superb quality bedlinens, mattresses and pillows as well as the shampoo, conditioner and hand soaps - make it even better. Communication with Aref was perfect as well. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"YOU NEED TO STAY HERE. This is not our first time staying at one of Aref‚Äôs places and it definitely will not be the last. He has such a special talent of making his Airbnb‚Äôs feel like full houses! This place receives a 10 from aesthetic to functionality. My only wish is that we could‚Äôve stayed longer. It can get a little cold in the bedroom if the doors are kept closed but it didn‚Äôt bother us much. The apartment accommodates one parking spot but there is free parking from 6pm - 8am on street. During day it‚Äôs 2 hour parking. 5 min drive to center of providence. 8 min to art district. 3 min walk to ‚Äúlittle Italy‚Äù and 3 min walk to the best breakfast spot on the market, Julian‚Äôs. Planet fitness less than 5 min walk away. Restaurants all around. This is the place to be. **If you‚Äôre set on this apartment but the dates you want are booked, check out Aref‚Äôs other listings in the same building! They all share the same type of vibe so you won‚Äôt be disappointed.** Safe travels!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an awesome well thought out space to stay in Providence. The beds are comfortable and everything is very clean. The unit is designed nicely and the building is fairly quiet as well. It‚Äôs located nicely next to a few good places to get coffee and breakfast. Short walk to downtown as well. Aref is a great host who ensures a great experience. We‚Äôll stay here when in town again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful old building was charming! The apartment feels like it is completely new inside and we had a lovely stay. The beds are extremely comfortable and we had everything we needed. The location was great! We were able to walk across the street for coffee and over to Federal Hill for great Italian food. Appreciated the designated parking space behind the building, although there was usually ample parking out front on the street as well. Loved the provided toiletries! We even came home and ordered the same hand soap after enjoying the scent during our stay. Highly recommend if you will be in Providence and are looking for a location in Federal Hill!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As others have stated, this property is excellent. Great communication and killer location."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"really nice apartment downtown providence. stylish, clean and close to attractions. would definitely stay there in the future!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I LOVED this apartment. Aref is an amazing host and gave very clear and precise instructions so it was super easy to follow the check in as well as the house rules! It truly felt homey and everything was a walking distance
We loved that there is a coffee shop right across which was amazing for breakfast and a nice village a couple blocks upwards that had a wide selection of food, lounge and everything you can imagine! Overall, great stay for the location, price and experience for a first timer in Providence. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. Aref is definitly a 5* host !

Only drawback was that there was no microwave.
Thanks, Aref!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time during our stay
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The listing is accurate, but Aref is hard to communicate with. Actually, Aref didn't respond to any of my messages, which made for a massive miscommunication and led us to have to vacate the unit earlier than we had requested and scramble to find alternative accommodations. Would be interested in staying here again, but only if the communication was improved."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aref's place is beautiful. Love the decor, easy to find, off street parking. Beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable. Ample number of towels provided. Kitchen was well appointed. Will definitely stay there again when I return to the Providence area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We found the place to be very inviting and comfortable and across the road is a cool bike, biscuit and coffee bar which made you realize how close you are to the city such that you can easily walk in."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location for our intended stay! The place was as described and suited us well‚Ä¶even with our 1 year old. Also, Aref's communication was terrific. We look forward to visiting again and certainly will be seeking out Aref to see what properties are available."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay in a great location. The listing photos are accurate and the place was very clean. Nice to be so close to Nitro Bar, Julian's and other businesses along Broadway. The beds were super comfortable, in particular."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really neat apartment in a great location in Providence. Would definitely stay again
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. But I think the owners stay next door.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in this beautiful place! Aref was easy to reach when needed but it was never necessary because everything was perfectly accommodated. There was many fun bars to go to at night as well and the staff there were all kind
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was my mothers birthday and we went to her first NFL game patriots vs giants. We stayed in this air bnb and we were NOT disappointed. THE PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. My mother walked in and cried! We had a amazing time. The coffee/bike shop has the most amazing coffee and the food was amazing too! Parking was easy and right on the property. The beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was amazing. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU RENT THIS PLACE! Absolutely amazing!!!! And extremely clean!
We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a really a comfortable place to stay. I enjoyed my stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a clean and charming place with lots of excellent art works by the host. It is just around the corner from Seven Stars Bakery, which is a very good place to start your morning."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Colin‚Äôs Place was really nice and relaxing
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good stay in Colin's charming house. It is accommodating and is available if necessary.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I came for only one night but it was a very nice and comfortable stay in a lovely area of Providence.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, the room and house was very decorative and clean. Definitely great value and cool surrounding areas!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very reasonably-priced and comfortable place to stay for a night. It was a short night due to a delayed flight/late arrival, but thankfully the instructions were clear and self check-in was easy. Our room was comfortable, but there were a couple issues with the shared bathroom. The toilet was clogged, so we needed to plunge it in order to get it to flush, and the faucet fixture was loose. The bathroom just needs some attention. Still, we were able to sleep well, shower, and get out the door easily enough. The artwork in the house was beautiful."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Colin was a great host, the location was a dream and so close to all of our local stops!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Very great place and hosts. beautiful art work all over the house and space is comfortable.
Would not recommend for light sleepers. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything everywhere."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful! Colin is a great host, helpful and agile when my plans changed a bit. The home and the art is beautiful. Location in is great too!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Colin's place is an excellent value. It was my second time staying there and I had another great experience. Thank you.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming place to stay at. Beautiful locations with multiple coffee shops and cafes nearby. About 30 min way to downtown. Colin is quick to respond and gave great detail upon checking in.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great option for a couples or individuals staying in Providence, especially if you're looking to check out the Federal Hill area or walk into the city centre. The property has multiple rooms that share well-provisioned amenities, but my room was large and private and had plenty of natural light. If you're happy to stay in a historical building, this is a great option for a Providence getaway!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place, however little annoyances were present. The coffee service was was minimal. Would it be so much to ask to put facial tissue in the unit? The plumbing in the kitchen and bathroom as functional but seemingly was not installed properly, which made it awkward to use. It was never clear to me if there were other guests in the unit and no information along these lines was communicated. Someone showed up to do housekeeping well before checkout time."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything went smoothly. happy to have stayed here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed Colin‚Äôs responsiveness and the cleanliness of his place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this place. A very nice neighborhood and remarkable photography by the host around the apartment. Very beautiful furniture and Colin was very nice.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Colin and his wife are very friendly and readily available. The bedroom is clean and simple and the kitchen bathroom and common area are really cozy and nice‚Äî would be great to rent the whole place out with a family or larger group. Any creaky floors are more than made up for by the local charm and friendly care. The location is stellar. A really great deal and I would definitely book again!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Close to a lot of bars and restaurants. I was able to walk to 3 bars in less than a mile walk from the house. Also the people in the neighborhood are super friendly.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Beautiful house. Close to lots of restaurants
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay at Colin's place. Great location in Federal Hill -- lots of restaurants nearby & walkable to/from downtown. Beautiful home & comfortable room. House looks like a gallery with Colin's beautiful photography all over the walls!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall good, just some minor noise from the wooden floor walking."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Colin‚Äôs space was quiet and easy to get to from downtown. I think there was another guest staying with me, but I never saw or heard them! I‚Äôd stay again if I‚Äôm in town."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place checks off all the boxes for a solo traveler. Old house, well appointed, felt like a hostel vibe in the best way possible. I forgot to write down the code when I got back late and had to call Colin (felt so guilty) and he was chipper and accommodating, made me feel better.
The heating system was really hot when I got back so I just took off a blanket. The Federal Hill nabe always has great airbnbs. Would stay there again."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient overnight stay in this 3 bedroom walkup apartment close to Brown campus. Accommodating and responsive host. Minimalist bedroom with very comfortable mattress, ample closet and shelving. Spacious common area including living room, dining area and full kitchen (with large refrigerator, microwave and Keurig machine). Many colorful photos provided a lot of visual interest. Shared bathroom fortunately was fine even with a full house. Off street parking a huge plus as long as the other guests are mindful of the tight space constraints."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Colin‚Äôs was short but sweet. He offered complimentary coffee, full use of a kitchen and bathroom, and a television! The location was fantastic as well and very walkable"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Colin's place was better than advertised. It was very spacious and very well-decorated. Another guest was staying, but besides the occasional hello, I hardly knew she was there. There was plenty of room to get work done, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the bathroom was pristine. 100% recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Colin's place. It was a comfortable space with clean, well decorated common living/kitchen spaces (his own photography is on the walls, which was very cool!)
The neighborhood was fun to walk around. A few cool looking bars and restaurants. Seven Stars Bakery is right around the corner and made for a delicious breakfast/coffee!"

Would recommend and stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin, I stayed with Collin and Jen in one of the rooms on the second floor of their beautiful home! Their home is absolutely stunning! They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable during my stay. The house was exactly as it described in the listing! It was actually more beautiful in person; you just have to experience it for yourself! It has everything you may need for a comfortable stay. Washer/dryer, full kitchen and living area and a great bathroom with a SPA TUB that works amazing! The apartment feels like a large home even though it is an apartment. The attention to details in the design of the home are incredible! It is set up to make you feel right at ""home"".
Collin and Jen were beyond amazing and kind! Anything that was needed was done immediately! They respond quickly to your needs. I was able to experience a wonderful social event that was held and the apartment! Food, drinks and good vibes! There is beautiful art and photos all over the home! 10/10!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very last minute booking for Xmas Eve as I was traveling to the Providence area to celebrate the holiday with extended family. I felt very lucky to find Colin's place, which is in a beautiful old Victorian house that also has plenty of modern touches, including a very nice kitchen. Colin met me personally when I arrived and provided me all of the helpful directions about the house. I had a nice, peaceful stay and will definitely be looking for this neighborhood and Colin's listings when I am next in PVD."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My only regret was not having enough time to enjoy this beautiful space, made special by Colin and Jeniffer's outstanding and unbelievable photography that graces the apartment."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Colin has a beautiful, clean, and comfortable home. The bed was wonderful, the shower was a dream, and we immediately felt at home staying there. Colin was a friendly and gracious host. Wifi worked well. It's well located - you can walk to many locations, or take the bus or a short Uber ride. The room is not big, but it's certainly big enough and, combined with the common areas, I believe we could have comfortable stayed for a while. We both wished we had more time, and would happily stay with Colin again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emergency stay when my roof was leaking, second time I‚Äôve stayed in a week and a very pleasant stay once again."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Colin's place for 2 nights in Providence, apartment was kept very clean with many amenities. our room was on a shared floor with 2 other apartments. the room was a little dusty and needed updating, but otherwise serviceable. Bathroom is nice, but shared between all the guests and in need of a plumber to secure some of the fixtures. All in all not terrible for the price point for a couple of days if you can handle sacrificing a bit of privacy."

Colin was a fantastic host. He was friendly and easy to reach. Something I really appreciated when my bus got delayed and I had to check in later than expected.
The check in and check out processes were also very quick and easy which is always a perk.
I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything fancy, just a place to sleep between stops on my trip. I feel I got more than my money‚Äôs worth!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Colin and Jeniffer were great hosts. Colin welcomed us and gave us a tour of the house. A great spot to spend the night and rest. The house was cozy, quiet, and colorful. Additionally, I had asked Colin in advance if an additional guest could join us, Colin agreed and made exceptions to the rules which I am so grateful for. This may not be the case for everyone so please inform your hosts in advance. Thank you Colin and Jeniffer, we hope to be your guests again."

Very secure and nearby to incredible restaurants and drinks with super easy (on a Saturday eve no less!) available street parking! Would stay again. Cool photos around the apartment too, Colin!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was good location for us, close to relatives we were visiting. also the Seven Star bakery around the corner was great for breakfast. My only complaint was that the photos showed a different room than what we stayed in. We ended up with a double bed when the listing indicated a queen bed. Also photos of place we booked it was obvious that it was not the same apartment we stayed in. since we were only staying 1 night, it was alright. if we were staying another night we might have complained- mostly about the smaller bed. Otherwise a nice place at a reasonable price. Clean and quiet."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Colin's and Jeniffer's place was great--I loved the shared apartment space with all the comforts of home. Colin was super clear about the check-in procedure in advance, available when I arrived to show me around, and pleasant. I loved this clean, safe home in a great location and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The places was clean and in a great location, easy to walk to many restaurants, a brewery, coffee shops, etc. The description is accurate. You will be sharing a bathroom, which was cleaned regularly. With only one bathroom per four or so guests, expect to wait to use it, especially in the mornings.
The one issue I had is that the walls/floors are very thin, and you can hear everything ‚Äî people walking/talking in the hallway, going up/down the stairs, in the room above us, and in the commons area. I am light sleeper so it was difficult for me.
Otherwise , it was a great bargain in a great area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great night at Colin's place. My flight wound up being delayed several hours but Colin helped give me the instructions to check in myself which gave me one less thing to worry about.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All of the homes in this area are beautiful and spacious from the outside looking in but I feel this one was even better within. Truly felt like home and I now will always select this particular home anytime I‚Äôm ever near Providence. The art collection that was displayed was also ver inspiring to me for what I would desire in my future home down the road.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy room in a spacious home. Nothing fancy but great value, would stay again. Each room and floor has it‚Äôs own lock (in addition to the front door), so felt safe living in the shared space. Loved seeing all of Colin's photographs on the walls. At first, I was looking for somewhere that was more walkable to downtown Providence, but this location proved to be excellent. It's a 10 min walk to Atwells Ave which has plenty of restaurants, and a 5 min walk to some great bars (The Avery, Ogie's Trailer Park). You MUST try Tricycle Ice Cream which was also less than a 5 min walk from here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, and a good comfy place. Checking-in was a hassle because the host wasn't there at our agreed time and wasn't responsive by text. Had to call, but after that, it was smooth sailing.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Easy check-in and out. Love that there was free off-street parking available. The driveway is a little tight for SUVs. Colin was kind.

Look forward to staying there again.

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and eccentric apartment in a convenient part of town. Great communication, easy check in, and great value. I took one star off for two kind of minor annoyances‚Äîfirst, there was no soap in the bathroom. Kind of gross, but we just washed our hands in the kitchen. Also the thermostat is kept in a lock box that guests don‚Äôt have access to. Our room (only our room for some reason‚Äîrest of the apartment was fine) was super hot. We didn‚Äôt notice this until like 11pm, when it felt inappropriate to text the host. So instead of asking to turn the heat down we closed the heat vent and opened windows. It was still hot but manageable. Overall good experience, would stay here again."

Our flat mates were up at 5am and banging around a little as they left but we went back to sleep quickly after. It was to be expected with an apartment share - kind of fun to be in sort of a hostel.
