2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was awesome very cozy n pieceful beautiful view of the lake awesome neighborhood
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Went on an impromptu aurora viewing trip & thankfully found this wonderful, clean home to stay the weekend! Having two bathrooms and a full laundry area was a huge plus. The home is absolutely lovely, it is obvious a lot of thought went into the decor and the design of the spaces. It was so peaceful there.
The bedding is some of the softest and coziest I've experienced. The bath towels were super thick & absorbent. The bathrooms were very clean & had ample counter space & hooks. The furniture was all in very good shape and comfortable. It was nice to have so many reclining chairs available.
The best feature is the lake view. You can see it from the living room, enclosed porch, and the main bedroom. The view is spectacular!
If you end up staying here, know that you will be walking through uneven grass to get to the property. It was slippery after the rain, and I could see it being an issue for anyone with mobility problems. Otherwise, it's overall a perfect location!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had such a peaceful time here! The main bedroom has a sliding door that opens up and you get to see the beautiful lake in the morning. The house has everything we needed and more, I would love to stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed for a girls trip to wineries. Beautiful view. Convenient location. House was very clean cozy. Thank you for the wonderful accommodations. We will be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Picturesque location and view on Lake Erie! My wife and I were impressed from moment one. We have 10 nightly rentals in another state and love finding places are like ours, unique, well thought out and well take care of. We have a team of folks that maintenance and clean ours so when we find a unit of quality we know it. No one will have regrets staying in this little adorable home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lakeside cottage was perfect for a weekend away. At the end of the street, we were feet from the cliff edge of Lake Erie.
The home was clean and well stocked. The hosts were very fast to respond when needed."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved staying here! The place had plenty of space for us, was cozy, and had a beautiful view of the lake. It was quiet and so relaxing. Also a short drive to all of the restaurants and shops! We would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this cottage. Well appointed. Lovely enclosed porch with a wonderful view. Gas fireplace was a great addition. I plan to add one to my lakeside home now. (I have a wood fireplace). Response to questions very quick. Would absolutely recommend.

Nice view of Lake Erie, and all the main comforts of home. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in this vacation retreat on Lake Erie was a perfect pre-Christmas get-away for my wife and I. She wondered if we would be warm enough with the winds on the shoreline, but we were very comfortable with adjustable heating and cozy quilts on our roomy and comfy bed. And the unobstructed view of Lake Erie was magnificent. As we looked out there were no houses, parked cars, or traffic going by as we enjoyed seeing the ever-changing waters. The bright kitchen had every convenience including an excellent washer and dryer to the side. The neighborhood location was also ideal for us. Quiet side streets and an easy drive to both a large grocery store and the quaint shops and variety of restaurants in historic Ashtabula Harbor. This rental is not part of any resort, but we sure felt as if we were at one!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing cabin! Cathy was quick to respond and helpful. We had a great stay. The pictures do not do the cabin justice. It is truly a beautiful spot with great views and a private setting. This cabin is within minutes of everything you could need, but you feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. The inside is tastefully decorated and the craftsmanship shows in all of the details. We can’t wait to return to Cathy’s cabin for another weekend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful cabin stay we had! This property is so stunning in the fall with the leaves turning and the chipmunks and squirrels chasing nuts as they fall. The cabin was gorgeous inside and out - just like the photos and even cozier than I could imagine. There are plenty of heaters to keep the space warm and such a comfy bed and couch. Highly recommend planning your next stay at this gorgeous cabin. The host is kind, helpful, and leaves clear, concise instructions so check in and out are a breeze."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin in the woods was everything my husband and I were looking and then some! Cathy had it decorated and cleaned so well we felt like we were right at home. So much so that we barely left the cabin the entire time we were there.

Such nice hosts and a very cute dog as well!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just left from a great 3 night getaway. The cabin is perfect for 2 and Cathy truly thinks of everything. There was wine and chocolates waiting to enjoy that evening while sitting on the porch swing enjoying the sounds of nature… She had muffins in the freezer if we wanted to have them breakfast. Multiple types of coffee and creamers… fire pit was ready to go with everything you need, including marshmallows. Bathroom was fully stocked with anything you may have forgotten. The town of Ashtabula has some really good, quaint restaurants. The longest covered bridge in the US is really close. There are 23 (I think) wineries in the area and are great places to spend the day with live music at most all weekend. We truly enjoyed visiting and will definitely return. Highly recommend"

Great porch with swing and view!!! Fire pit out back was wonderful as well with everything you need to make fire easily! Would definitely stay again. Also Bascule restaurant didn't disappoint either 3 nights in a row."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful time staying at the cabin! My wife and I chose this place for part of our honeymoon and it was a great place to unwind after months of planning. Cathy set up a great spot here. Great amenities included! Her little touches of providing chocolate and wine were delightful. It's a great location and so secluded, but with plenty of restaurants only a 5 minute drive away. Great place if you're a couple that wants to get away and unplug for a few days!"

Thank you Cathy for your hospitality!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked the cabin short term for a long weekend getaway. Very nice secluded location with close by shopping and restaurants.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet cabin nestled in the woods. Overlooking trees and a river. Cabin was cozy and relaxing. We loved the patio - perfect place to enjoy morning coffee or evening wine. The cabin had wood for camp fires, ample outdoor seating. Thoughtful plentiful toiletries. Simple cooking items (cooking spray, salt and pepper). Heating and AC both were great. We would love to return! The location was 5 min from grocery stores and 15-20 min from tons of wineries which we enjoyed visiting! To note, the cabin does not include a stove or hot plates at this time. There is a microwave, toaster oven, and grill outside. Just note this in meal planning!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is very clean and it isnt thrown together with random stuff that you might see in other cabins. Cathy did a great job decorating and preparing it for guests. Plan on going back in the future.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time at Alexa’s place and we will be back. It is everything you could want in for a weekend or longer getaway. The place is spotless and it has more dishes to use than I have at home. Great restaurants are a short walk away and wineries are a short drive.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location just down the street from restaurants, coffee shop, ice cream, etc. Easy parking, very nice home."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place in Ashtabula or the nearby area, Alexa's place is perfect. It is walkable to some of the areas best restaurants. It is a short drive to the beach. (I would recommend driving there since the beach is down a steep road and wouldn't be fun to walk back up.) The townhouse is on the main road in town but I wasn't bothered by traffic noises. The townhouse itself is brand new and the furnishings are top of the line. The beds were comfortable and there is enough furniture in the living room for everyone to spread out. My visit was during the winter, so we didn't get to take advantage of the two outside areas. Alexa provides a great house manual that includes restaurant recommendations. I loved Fitzgerald's Wine bar and Rennick Meat Market."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Alexa's place was right near the main street in Ashtabula and walking distance to Lake Erie access as well as many fine restaurants and shops. We came in the winter and would like to try it again when the weather is warmer.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Look no further. If you’re wanting to experience all that Ashtabula has to offer in a great location, not to mention the fact that the townhome is gorgeous, then book this. As an Ashtabula native that visits family often, I know where I’m staying going forward! Alexa is a perfect host as well!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great trip.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is just immaculate! We have stayed in many nice AB&Bs, this one tops them. Perfect for a long weekend to explore culinary downtown Ashtebula by foot.
5 minutes walk to downtown Ashtebula, Felix Pizza, Rennick meat market (both with great food) and several other options and bars. Also 5 min walking to Fire Chicken (also good)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was SO beautiful and clean. Such a great and safe location with so much to do around it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Host was so responsive and extremely helpful. Townhouse was clean and a great location for easily getting to every place we needed to go. Would highly recommend and stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location- a historic small town harbor- was exactly what we were looking for for a couples getaway. There are so many nice, fine dining restaurants to choose from- 2 days was not enough time to try them all. The historic harbor and downtown is so charming, even in a colder month where temps were in the 40s, we absolutely loved it!! We always felt safe and the location was perfect, you seriously can't get a better stay than these townhouses.
In regards to the actual airBNB- quite possibly the cleanest one we've stayed in and for sure the most cozy and attentive. The townhouse was so clean when we arrived with added touches: STOCKED tea&coffee bar, snacks, beach wagon, things to do recommendations, fully stocked kitchen, enough bath towels and wash cloths, pillows and blankets...etc.). The host also provides a lot of friends and couples games to pass time. The host was so quick to answer questions and reply to messages. We look forward to future stays here."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing was perfect for us. The provided amenities were a nice touch. Included coffee and add-ins. A welcome snack basket was a nice surprise. There were even several books and assorted games in the unit for relaxation and entertainment. All cleaning products were provided for doing the dishes, trash bags, even a dust buster vac for small clean ups. Very spacious. They were responsive regarding the code to enter. It had changed from the one I was advised of in the original reservation. Would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here and it was just as we remembered it. The townhouse is beautiful and very clean. It's in the perfect location to walk to the restaurants in town. We can't wait to come back again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in a Ashtabula during Labor Day Weekend. First time at Lake Erie in Ohio and we had a great time. Our 3-year old loved watching the bascule bridge open and close, and watching the ships go through.
Ashtabula Harbor had a great selection of restaurants and stores. Less busy and touristy than Geneva on the Lake.
We enjoyed playing at Walnut Beach and strolling along Walnut Boulevard to see some of the historic homes in the town.
Short drive to both Geneva and Conneaut along Lake Rd for some great views of Lake Erie. We only stayed for a weekend but there seemed to be a lot to do if you stay a week.
Thanks Alexa, for hosting us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Alexa's was excellent. Communication with Alexa was swift and pleasant.
We have stayed in AirBnB rentals in a number of locations in the US and France and Alexa's is definitely 5 star. The space is beautiful and is exactly as shown in the photos. Entry into the house was very simple with explicit directions from Alexa prior to arrival.
The entire house was superbly clean, the amenities in the kitchen were very welcome, the beds were comfy, and there was plenty of hot water. The only thing we lacked in the kitchen was a tea kettle.
The house is excellently located, easy to find, with a lovely 2 car locked garage, and in walking distance to some very nice restaurants.
All in all, we had a brilliant time. We highly recommend Alexa's AirBnB and would happily book another stay here next year."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Extremely clean and spacious. Great location.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful,a little pricey for how late check in is and how early check out is.The location is good if you want to park and walk to shops and restaurants on Bridge Street.The Harbor is beautiful at night."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the condo was great!!! Neat, clean, we’ll stocked!!! And the little extras (like the snacks) were greatly appreciated!!! We loved our time there and would like to go again soon!!! Thanks"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a fun and relaxing stay! Loved the little town nearby and it was perfect for my sister and our partners. Excited to stay again next year!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute and perfect for a short getaway off the beaten path. The apartment is pristine and has updated amenities and a very nice kitchen. We spent time at the Cloven Hoof brewery down the street and the underground railroad museum up the hill, as well as the downtown area. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved everything about this Airbnb. From the decor to the amenities to the location. You won’t find a nicer place to stay in Ohio.
They’ve thought of everything that you would need to make your stay comfortable and fun. It’s all brand new and impeccably clean. I LOVED it. Alexa the host is without a doubt the most kind host I’ve ever had. I will only stay at her properties when I fly to Ohio. Her attention to detail is unsurpassed and her eye for style and decor can’t be beat. It’s located in a cute spot called the Harbor. The Rennick Meat Market restaurant is fantastic along with Briquettes BBQ’s brisket is quite possibly the best bbq I’ve ever had. This place is a must stay for a special weekend celebration. Lots to see and do."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the modern feel of this place and it was plenty big! My favorite was the kitchen /living room area . Nice place to sit, relax, and make coffee.
I also love the restaurants within walking distance. I used to live in Ashtabula and this was a trip to visit family.
The pictures matched the actual apartment!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful. I booked this as part of a bday weekend for my babe. We had a great stay. I cooked delicious meal and although I brought a few items, the kitchen had everything I needed and more. I felt right at home.
The place was spotless and smelled great. We had a great nights rest. We slept on the first floor and the sheets were sooooo soft and felt so good.
I forgot to bring some games, but there were a few provided which was nice and fun! We played a game for couples.
The area was nice and quiet, perfect for relaxing and quality time.
I would definitely book again."

Restaurants and breweries in walking distance! Our favorite was Nights and Weekends pizza place. Highly recommend staying here!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was brand new and beautiful. What I liked best was the little touches - a snack basket, plenty of toiletries for things we needed or forgot, the hammock to be hung on a stand on the back patio, a fully stocked kitchen and spice rack. We didn’t use them but there was even a wagon in the garage to easily pull beach stuff to the lake, books, games and a bluetooth speaker. The garage was really appreciated to tuck our car in over night.
It’s on a busy street, so some traffic noise in main living area, but both bedrooms are on the back side of the townhouse and quiet enough."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved staying here! The place is gorgeous. We were a last minute booking and Alexa was quick to respond and checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable. The place felt very homey and was so clean. It has my favorite coffee spot on the same street and some yummy food spots too! Definitely looking to book again in the summer since it's close to the beach. 11/10!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best AirBnB or VRBO rentals have we have stayed at. My husband and I have OCD on cleanliness and the place was spotless.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,I would highly recommend this condo. It is practically brand new and I've never seen an air bnb so clean. Hosts are very responsive. Kitchen has everything you could need. 3 huge tvs and a smart home. Note..the stairs are pretty steep but expected for a townhouse. Only 1 bed and bath on first floir.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend and return to this townhouse. It is very clean and right down where you can walk to amazing businesses in this cute little town. The kitchen is absolutely beautiful and has everything you need. The beds were comfortable. Alexa did quickly respond with any questions I had. We were absolutely impressed.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town to visit family over the holiday and found this gem. The townhome is brand new, with all the amenities needed, and sparkling clean.

Everything was clean and I appreciated all the board games to choose from for a family game night. My favorite amenity was the filtered ice water from the fridge door. We definitely want to come back some time!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Nice place close to the lake.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,We had a great time. The house was great. There was a book with different things to do and there was also a book that you could write a message which was really cute!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! It was the perfect place for our two families to spend a relaxing weekend. The outdoor area was great for the kids to play and for hanging out at the fire pit in the evening.
The home is just like the pictures and an excellent layout for hanging out with the family. The kitchen is fully equipped for meal prep and there is plenty of table space for everyone to enjoy a meal together.
This place is close enough to the beach to walk or bike ride (but also plenty of parking if you're driving). The beach is gorgeous and has a lovely playground too. We also tried out several of the recommended restaurants and they we excellent.
The hosts made everything easy from booking to check out. They were welcoming and informative. They supplied the house with so many extras - coffee and fire wood were our favorites - and made great recommendations.
This is a wonderful choice for a fun, relaxing weekend! Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stay and walkable to the water and the local town where there are bars and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Walnut Beach Inn. The best part was the proximity to not only the beach but also the harbor. We look forward to booking again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dave and Kate were excellent hosts! We came for a mini-family reunion and it was a perfect spot! The house was great and super clean! Dave and Kate left a detailed guidebook to recommend things to do and places to eat. They were super helpful and so kind! We are looking forward to coming back!!

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and great location.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Clean and spacious, this was a great space for us. It was within walking distance to the beach and great food and shops, but still in a quiet neighborhood. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Dave and Kate were the best hosts that I have dealt with on Airbnb thus far. Their communication is excellent and they get back to you immediately and they are very friendly! Their house was very comfortable, clean and spacious for our group of 8 women for a getaway weekend. We loved the huge kitchen table for gathering, beds were comfortable, and the location was great for walking to the beach and town to shops and restaurants. We planned on using the fire pit, but never got around to it. We cooked in the equipped kitchen. Dave and Kate even ordered a 13x9 pan to deliver before our arrival via Amazon, because they weren’t sure if the kitchen included one. That was so thoughtful and helpful for the breakfast bakes I made. If I am ever in the area again, I would stay at this house again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Dave and Kate were extremely helpful with any questions I had. This was in a great area, close to Geneva on the lake, and had the beach basically in the backyard!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was SPOTLESS. Unfortunately for us the weather was not so great during our stay but the house was so inviting and cozy that we were still able to make the best of our weekend getaway. Dave and Kate were very communicative and thorough during the entire process and excellent to deal with. Looking forward to dealing with them again in the future.

2023-03-01,4,Group trip,Loved this place! Super cute house! The stairs are a little scary cuz of how tight they turn going up
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"The home was lovely, easy to find, centrally located and Kate was very responsive and congenial. It’s an older home so there’s some creaking in the floorboards. From the description, I was expecting some beach access from the backyard. That isn’t the case. You have to walk down the street. We were there in the winter so that wasn’t an issue. It was close enough to the main street and I was able to walk to get a latte in the morning at the local coffee shop. Loved that! The lake can be seen from the top floors, but there is a water treatment facility (or something) directly behind the house. There was plenty of space for my family and would have fit many more people. We enjoyed hanging out in the front living room and the kitchen table was amazing! Washer and dryer came in handy. It was in the only bathroom on the first floor, off of the kitchen. All in all, the house was great. I would come back to it, if I ever get the opportunity."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Alexa’s place was amazing. We went for an overnight stay and it was the perfect location! Definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment had all the amenities needed. Even all the little extra things were taken care of and available. The pictures don’t do this place justice. The interior was very modern and pleasing but at the same time cozy. The location is perfect and close to everything we needed to relax a few days. The host communicated on a timely manner and had great recommendations. They also had lots of information tastefully placed throughout the house. All in all a great stay and will definitely be back there.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was immaculate. Everything was clean. It was a great location. Within a couple minutes of walking distance to downtown and very good restaurants and bakery. I am looking forward to going there again with my girlfriend. Thanks Alexa!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This truly is our home away from home. We always look forward to coming back here. Of all the places we've stayed during our travels, nothing compares to what Alexa and Audrey have created here at Harbor Haven.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay! It was the perfect location for the many wineries 🍷 we visited.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unfortunately our flight was canceled and we never made it. Alexa was more than generous to work with AirBNB for a full refund for us.

A really good getaway for our flyfishing adventure or for any family or couples who want to spend some time in Ashtabula."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place and great location. Very clean and all of the extra items to make the stay more comfortable were a plus. Including the coffee/tea drawer and snacks.

The accommodations were outstanding, a private bathroom for each bedroom an an open Livingroom/kitchen. The place was a couple blocks from a great coffee shop and restaurants in downtown Ashtabula. It was great to visit the wineries and come back to relax before a short walk to dinner. We went to the Rennick Meat Market and Bascule Bridge Grill for dinner and both had great food with excellent service. Thanks for making it a relaxing and stress free experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most beautiful place I’ve ever stayed. Everything was well thought out and had everything we needed
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the best AirBnB we have ever stayed in. It was like walking into a decor magazine. So beautiful, tidy and clean. Everything was organized and they thought of EVERYTHING we might have needed and supplied it in an easy-to-find spot. Above and beyond expectations. The best moment was when we decided to go to the beach and found not only beach towels and a beach mat, but bucket and spades to make sand castles! When I showed the kids, our daughter exclaimed, ""I love this lady!!"" We will DEFINITELY book here on our next trip to Ashtabula. Thank you for all the heart and thoughtfulness you put into the place - it really made our stay wonderful."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very beautiful inside….. very clean, clear instructions were given, the beds were very comfortable and it was stocked with an abundance of supplies ….. I did feel like for the price the views could have been a little better and a little disappointed you can hear the traffic but I would definitely come back ……maybe at a time of year when the rates are lower"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very satisfied!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this townhome! It was so comfortable and cozy but most of all the cleanest and most renter friendly I have been to! The decor is beautiful! Beds and linens are top notch, kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could want, bathrooms have amazingly wonderful smelling toiletries!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I am in Ashtabula a few times a year for work and we decided to try out this place for a change. It absolutely exceeded our expectations. I have stayed in several Air B&B’s and none have ever been this clean. The place has all the luxuries of home and more. They have really gone above and beyond to pay attention to all the details to make this place exceptional. I highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is nothing short of stunning. Beautiful space with two balconies and a patio. And it's within walking distance to everything in downtown Ashtabula.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievable attention to every little detail. This home is so beautifully decorated and well thought out. I couldn’t find anything that I would have done better. From the milk frother for your coffee in the morning sitting on the gorgeous deck to the mini Bluetooth speaker to the usb charging night stands, these girls have thought of everything. You won’t find a nicer place to stay anywhere. I feel like I just checked into the newest, nicest hotel in the entire state of Ohio. The welcome bottle of wine and snacks were so appreciated.
The see through refrigerator door lights up when you tap it to see what’s inside and the freezer makes those big cool round ice cubes for your cocktails. She even put a basket full of board games and bedtime stories for the little ones. There’s even separate beach towels and sunscreen in the closet for the short stroll to the beach.
Alexa is so kind and attentive and is a true professional!!!"

It was as if I were hosting friends at my residence, and the checklist of what my guests might need was thoroughly fulfilled. It was Beautifully appointed and well maintained. The guest manual provided was most precise.
The host was very responsive to me regarding my needs and concerns. The condo was in a very quaint part of Ashtabula, which is very old. A good walking area that felt quite safe. I would return in the future."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had another great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Ohio for a funeral. The last thing you want are problems. I received good instructions to get in and a welcome from the hosts. The place was beautiful, clean and spacious. I am very particular where I lay my head. I would definitely stay there again and recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Alexa was so helpful and kind in allowing me and my friends an early check in to her Airbnb, which allowed us more valuable time to enjoy together. The location of this stay is amazing for the small town as it’s right in the middle of local shops and restaurants and a short walk to the beach! I’d love to stay here again, it felt like home!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alexa was super friendly and responsive during our stay. The house was immaculate and matched the description and photos. The area was extremely walkable and close to many restaurants and the local coffee house was great. Walnut Beach was a 2 minute drive away. Overall a convenient location, ideal for a family to stay in. We used the kitchen at least twice a day, it had many basics included that made it easy to cook and prepare meals. The road can be a bit noisy as it is a main road and the only complaint the other guests had were curtains or blinds, especially in the front bedroom would have been nice to block out the streetlights at night. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"My girlfriends and I had an amazing weekend trip at Alexa’s. It was completely updated and super clean when we arrived. All items listed were included. We had zero problems.

Also, Alexa was so helpful in allowing my boyfriend and I to check in a little early to make sure we could be there before my family arrived. Everything you could need as well! If we are ever back in the area, we would definitely look to use one of Alexa’s Air BNBs again! Thank you so much!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay for a bachelorette party or a getaway. Our party of 5 loved how spacious and clean the place was. We walked to the bars at night and to brunch in the morning easily. 10/10 would recommend!!

The townhouse is very nice, newer and well designed/decorated, and very clean. Being able to use the garage was great, especially when the weather wasn't the best!

When our 2 day event was over it was so nice to come back, relax, make a meal in the well supplied kitchen, played games and cards. Loved the layout of the kitchen and living room area. Comfortable home, good neighborhood w/ nice neighbors. Beds very, comfortable. Highly recommend and would go back. If in the Willoughby area check out Chagrin River Diner. Really, good food and good atmosphere."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This town home was immaculately clean. Easy to find. Close to restaurants. Alexa was very nice. The weather was very bad so we were stuck inside most of the trip. Only problem is one TV. Husband likes sci fi, kid likes cartoons, and I like the news. Trying to share the only TV was not great. Everything else was good."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our staycation in the harbor! The place was beautiful with great amenities. Easily walkable in a great location. It was decorated with modern and attractive style. Check in was seamless and Alexa was above and beyond in communication. She was so accommodating when I made a mistake in my booking. We will 100% be back :)
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's a very nice place, a new building. It's close to a grocery store and has several restaurants nearby. The food was great at one a few blocks down the street. There's not much to say since we only stayed overnight. I would stay here again."

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The perfect little apartment for a girls weekend. Six of us came to stay in mid-September to do some winery tours in the area. The housing was about 20 minutes from Geneva wineries, but worth it for the ascetic and cleanliness. Felt safe and plenty of parking! Just down the street from coffee shops and restaurants in Ashtabula. Six of us had plenty of room in this house. The kitchen was also spacious with a comfortable couch for watching the smart TV. Definitely would stay again. Alexa was a wonderful host - easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Would recommend this apartment stay without hesitation!"

Definitely recommend if you're in need of a place in Ashtabula!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,The townhouse was lovely and in a great location.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"First and foremost, I want to say we had a fantastic experience in your home! It was beautiful and very clean. We really enjoyed the comfy blankets and being so close to downtown. We took advantage of the great restaurants and shops. So quaint and everyone we met was super friendly! I always give a few suggestions for improvement. I have included these below:
Bathrooms:
More towels and/or bigger towels provided
Kleenex boxes provided in all bathrooms
There was very little body wash left in each container and no shampoo/conditioner provided. I would suggest installing these units in each shower that have 3 compartments…1 for shower wash, 1 for shampoo, and 1 for conditioner. It would be easier to add to those rather than trying to keep up with replacing body wash containers.
Kitchen:
Personally, I suggest removing all candles from an Airbnb. As a fellow business person, having actual candles in an Airbnb seems like too much of a risk for potential issues…fires & burns. Not worth the risk.
Bedrooms:
Add TVs in each bedroom. These days TVs are cheap. Having large flatscreen TVs mounted on the walls is easy and very luxurious and desirable for families with children and teens.
Unit overall:
I would suggest providing Info either online or in unit itself on nearest grocery stores for essentials, as well as nearest pharmacy & hospitals/doc in the box for emergencies."
2022-08-01,4,Group trip,This place was perfect for a bachelorette weekend! Alexa was a great host to work with. The location was fantastic as well. Highly recommend this place!

Thank you Cindy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Cindy's place. This is our 2nd time staying here, and looking forward to our next trip to the harbor."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a great neighborhood! A quaint little town is literally just steps away from this lovely home. We walked to Rennick Meat Market for a delicious breakfast. We also walked to a Farmers market. Cindy's home is updated throughout, very clean and well stocked. There is a very private and quiet backyard, and also a covered front porch for your morning coffee. All 3 bedrooms are on the second floor. The double beds in each bedroom were very firm, if that matters to you. There is one full bath on the second floor with a shower/tub combo. The other full bath, with shower, is on the first floor. So it is somewhat of an inconvenience for whoever is using that bathroom. Not ideal, but we made it work with two couples. The home is 15 minutes from the GOTL strip, which was very important to us. Cindy was an exceptional host. She always responded quickly and she is very kind, friendly & flexible. We had no issues while staying at her home. We will definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy's place was perfect for our small family reunion. It's walkable to great restaurants and shops, and to nearby parks and Walnut Beach. The home is perfect for 5-6 people, and we had everything we needed to relax and prepare home cooked meals. She thought of everything! We have family in the area and will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy has thought of everything. Her place was the nicest place we've stayed in yet in Ashtabula county.
The kitchen was a highlight. She provided everything we needed to cook a nice brunch in. The decorations are absolutely fabulous and inspiring. The space is well broken up for everyone staying to have privacy, including a possible work/reading space on the upstairs landing.
We had been worried about phone chargers, but Cindy had 2 lamps with several USB ports. That was so thoughtful! I loved the mattresses in the bedrooms & there is ample storage & hanger space for clothing.
The bathrooms were also a highlight. Each has so much character. While the pictures are accurate, every unique touch is even more striking in person. Cindy also provided makeup wipes which was much appreciated.
The house was pristine & clean, with an unbeatable location. I couldn't be happier with our experience and hope we can return soon!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great stay - place was spotless and every necessity was in place. great location, too - right up the hill from the bridge street action. loved learning about the history of the house, too. THANKS!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the proximity to walnut beach and the bridge street shops. we felt that the drive to Geneva on the lake was easy and appreciated a more low key place to stay.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved Cindy's place. We had 5 adults staying for the weekend, and there was plenty of space. The decor is spot on for the location. The plaque with the history of the house was fascinating! The location to Bridge Street is ideal, especially for any event happening in the harbor. Cindy was very easy to communicate with, but we also had no issues. Everything was just as explained in the listing. We look forward to staying here again."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location! Walkable to the harbor bridge, shops, coffee, dining. The house is beautiful and rich in history!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is a gem right off of Bridge Street! It was a wonderful property in the perfect location.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is everything and more that you would want in a home away from home! Beautifully decorated, fully equipped and within walking distance to restaurants, pubs and shops. What more could you ask for! Big plus is the comfy beds and two full bathrooms! We enjoyed our stay immensely and will be back! Thanks again Cindy"

Robin went above and beyond in responding to my requests for info about the area before our arrival."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Would Rent Again
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house is beautiful. The pictures are 100% accurate, it really is that gorgeous. You are on top of the lake and you can hear it through the entire house with all the windows closed. The owners are also immaculate. They were super responsive the entire time & had no clean up restrictions which is super rare for AirB&B. Lots of gorgeous touches in the home. The only suggestions we could really give would be to add a projector to the downstairs bedroom & maybe another sliding door for bathroom privacy but otherwise perfect. Really exceptional."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice and clean
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was a great place to visit. There is lots to do in the area. Plenty of activities days such as boating, biking, walking, etc. A good many historical sites within an hours drive of the house.
The house itself is well-suited to families with three well accomodated bedrooms, board games for the children, a roomy kitchen and dining area, comfy living room, easily accessible smart TVs, functional washer and dryer, and a nice front porch. Thoroughly enjoyable. Would highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Place is a gem! Close to everything we wanted to do. Went up for the eclipse, and couldn’t have found a better spot. Right between the beach access and the maritime museum. A 5 min walk to main street and the harbor. The place was newly renovated and the decor was great! Loved the pictures of the local ore/coal ships on the walls. Every thing you need for stay is supplied from dishes, games to cleaning supplies. Tv in every room even the dining room . There is private parking for two cars in the back and more parking in front. Quiet , safe neighborhood. Everyone in my group was happy, and we will be recommending this place, and we plan to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time on our girls weekend in Ashtabula! John’s place was perfect. We felt right at home and the place was modern with comfortable beds, two full bathrooms and plenty of room! Walking distance or a short drive, if you wish, to the beautiful harbor and great restaurants. The little town was full of such friendly people. John was the perfect host and readily available. We had a blast!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We always love staying here. John’s a wonderful host, always available and accommodating. The home is exactly as described in the perfect location.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a repeat stay for me (my sister and I stayed with our children two summers ago), and it did not disappoint! We enjoy this property when coming to visit family because it is quite the value for all of us to stay comfortably. John's place is just the right size for six of us! Full kitchen, full dining table, three couches. We love the location, walking distance to Point Park, Walnut Beach, and all of the shops and restaurants on Bridge Street! But it's still off the beaten path so when we need to rest and retreat we have a quiet place! A winter stay is just as good as a summer stay! You will not be disappointed!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful updated home! Perfect place for a weekend stay. Highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and lots of room. Great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John’s place absolutely felt like a home away from home for our family. We came to town with our two kids (ages 1 and 5). The house was extremely clean and comfortable, and it was well appointed with everything we needed. We loved the open concept of the first floor because it helped keep an eye on our little ones. Having all of the bedrooms together upstairs with a nearby full bath was also a huge plus with two young kids. We visited over Thanksgiving and are excited to visit again when there’s warmer weather. This home is conveniently located within walking distance to Bridge Street attractions and Walnut Beach. Thank you for offering your home to us!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great house. We loved the location and walking to the shops. Very clean
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Great value. John gave good instructions.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything Excellent!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous time at John's place. It was perfect for our little guys (2 and 4) - no unnecessary clutter or things for them to get into, the place was clean and tidy, and it was SO close to a great park and the beach. (Not to mention being within walking distance of downtown, too!!). It did smell a little like dog, but I understand it's nice for families with furry friends to be able to bring them, too. There weren't any facial tissues, so I'd say to be sure to bring some with you if you would use them. Otherwise, everything was provided that we might need! The beds were SO comfortable!! We had a great, relaxing weekend. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home,very clean and spacious. Would stay again."

Communication with John has been excellent both time we've stayed and he was very accommodating with a change in our schedule. We'll definitely book again in the future!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice quiet getaway by the lake with my family in a historic town. We loved walking to town (it took less than 5 minutes ) ordering a pizza and then coffee in the am , reading all the historic signs of the area. The beach is walkable but we drove since we had a wagon full for our child . Private , not overcrowded . Almost the best kept secret. 🤫 loved the house , spacious and clean , felt relaxing . Geneva on the lake is less than 15 minutes away. John is super responsive to messages ! Very impressed. Didn’t know it was a duplex, but no one seemed home next door 😊"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccably clean! Lots of rooms with room! Soft rugs, mats, throws, bedding. The mattress was extremely comfortable to sleep on. I slept well! Living room furniture was plenty and quite cozy. When we initially arrived, we found the front door had accidentally been left hanging open. It was quite unnerving! John was immediately responsive and let us know he was reviewing the footage from the camera. All was well, and though it did take a good hour and a thorough check of the house for me to settle in and feel safe..it was fine. Im sure it was a one time occurrence, but I thought it was handled quickly and well. I’d happily stay again. Very good proximity to Walnut beach and we enjoyed a nice meal at the smokehouse right around the corner. Cute little town!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place. Gorgeous renovation that kept the best features of a historic house but with all the amenities. Comfy beds and lovely front porch. Easy access to Ashtabula main street. Easy parking and nice neighborhood.

Very clean and great place for some guy time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I rented John's place to house the jurors we brought in from out of for an art exhibition. I wanted a place that would be clean, in a nice neighborhood, and walkable. The guests said they we're comfortable and had everything they needed."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great location- walkable to restaurants, beach, and shops. House was clean and comfortable. It has everything that you need and nothing that you don’t. We enjoyed our stay at the lake!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I returned to Ashtabula for my 40th high school reunion (first reunion I've attended) and the entire experience from staying at John's place, experiencing the revitalization of Ashtabula Harbor, the Wine and Walleye Festival, seeing old classmates was wonderful! My daughter and I hope to be back next year!
John's place was a breath of fresh air and he was very helpful and prompt in communications! His place had many unexpected extras, like ziploc bags, aluminum foil, laundry detergent, etc. that were extremely thoughtful. We definitely plan to book here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean stay with many thoughtful amenities. Will be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for what we needed. It was clean, updated and very nice. I loved the neighborhood! Just a few blocks to the beach as well. Loved the town which was again just a few blocks away."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love this place! Exactly what it looks like on the website - clean, organized and we loved the decor! Historical pictures in the kitchen and extra blankets in a basket in the living room - linens and towels provided too! All those extra touches made the difference - We felt right at home!
Great location! Close to restaurants, shopping and the beach. Everything within walking distance!
The host provided instructions prior to our date of departure so we were ready for check in. Any communications we had with them, they were quick to respond. So friendly!
We highly recommend recommend them and we definitely plan to come back!!
Thank you!!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at John's place over Memorial Day weekend. The location is great - easy walking distance to the main street in Ashtabula with quite a few nice little restaurants, and a few blocks the other direction to the beach. The house itself is newly remodeled and comfortable with plenty of room."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Primo location for proximity to the harbor and the lake. Very clean with a warm inviting atmosphere. Would stay there again without hesitation.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Place was lovely. It was quiet and relaxing. The beach was within walking distance along with local restaurants and bars. Point Park is a few houses down, where you can watch the the lift bridge and all the boats pass by. Host was attentive to any needs, and super nice. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to visit. Thanks again for such a lovely stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spotless. Newly renovated. Easy check in. Easy parking. It’s about a 4 minute walk from the back door to Bridge st main block.
Cloven Hoof was great for the beer folk. Nights and Weekends had very good pizza, and the speakeasy upstairs was fun with a band. Good meal - terrible service at Halcyon. Quaint shops, the coffee shop is awesome.
Took a taxi to GOTL. $35 for 2 one way. Fun times in an area that looks like everything is 50+ years old in a good way."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’ve stayed in this location to visit family several times now and it’s always a joy to stay with John. Love the location, cleanliness and amenities!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s home is beautifully decorated, with a combined kitchen and dining area, a living room with plenty of seating, three large bedrooms, and the entire home was clean and inviting! We felt at home from the moment we arrived. Beds were so comfortable we got a great night’s sleep each night! We came to Ashtabula to visit wineries in Geneva and Madison. John’s house was the perfect place to stay! We used Sunset Transportation LLC to get to and from the wineries. We had a great time!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful home. The lake is across the street and park down the street. It was a great weekend 😁
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was exceptional. The location was exactly as advertised and pictured. It was easy to find and all instructions were correct. Our host John was proactive with instructions and wonderful at responding to questions. The Airbnb was very clean and comfortable. I would recommend to anyone and would love to stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy check in and check out. Instructions for check in were sent early! John was very responsive with any questions. Pictures were accurate in listing. Home was newly renovated, cozy, comfortable and very clean. Convenient walk from the home to the harbor town with great restaurants, awesome coffee shop and yummy chocolate store. Short drive to Geneva on the Lake and local wineries."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"100% would stay here again! John not only allowed check to be simple but check out as well.
The property we VERY well kept, clean and comfortable. Our family was able to enjoy a white Christmas here and can’t thank John enough!
The night life on the harbor was great and easy to walk to.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Will be booking again soon!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John was great and quick to respond. He even kept me updated on weather conditions prior to our arrival. They had gotten alot of snow before we got there and he was quick to take care of the driveway for us to be able to park. The place was just as cozy as the pictures looked. Great place to just sit back and relax. Cute neighborhood and close to many things to do if you feel like heading out.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was a wonderful host!
He accommodated us on short notice and made our stay amazing!
The home was so clean and inviting, perfect walking distance to the harbor and Coffee shop!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John is a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay in his impeccably clean home, and the ease of visiting the local wineries was a big plus. John also recommended some nice restaurants for us to eat and relax in after our busy days. Everything was great!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had a great stay at John’s place. The listing is comfortable, clean, and convenient to restaurants and local activities and attractions. As a previous guest mentioned, a super easy space to child-proof!
Check-in was easy. John was attentive and responded quickly to our questions. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John's place is awesome! Beautifully decorated. Clean, open and super easy to check-in. The location is perfect for anything in the Harbor."
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"The interior of John’s home is new and very pretty. Beds and sofas are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked with the usual amenities. If you have young children, it’s a good choice because there isn’t any clutter and can easily be baby proofed with a portable gate for the stairs. Unfortunately, the furnace was not working, so it was a bit chilly when the temperature dropped on our 2nd day there. However, John was very responsive and communication was good. He sent a technician over within a couple of hours of contacting him and they were able to get it fixed by the next afternoon. It was about 24 hours that we were without heat, which impacted family coming to visit with a baby.
John brought over space heaters which we personally weren’t comfortable using, but it was a nice gesture. We felt a small refund would have been appropriate for the trouble, but overall we enjoyed our stay and would consider this home again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was very new and clean, very spacious, and great if you like to cook. The dishwasher and nice collection of knives came in handy. I felt like a king in this house!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! The house was great. It had everything we needed and was in the perfect location . The owner, John, was awesome! He was very accommodating and responded very quickly. I would highly recommend this house and in future plan to stay again."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in John's house. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. It is in a great location. Loved being in walking distance to a nice beach, harbor, cute shops, and local restaurants. Also an easy drive to Geneva-on-the-Lake. I had to contact John a few times with questions and he responded quickly. I definitely plan on visiting this area again and would stay in this house again"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place, quite, walking distance to things to do in Ashtabula. Comfortable and lots of room. The Host was very responsive to any of our questions. We would stay again if we are ever in the area."

We LOVED that there were lots of built-in USB charger ports in extremely convenient places, like in the bedside tables. Excellent communication, well-stocked kitchen, spacious bedrooms. We had a wonderful stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This fully renovated duplex was the perfect location to enjoy Ashtabula. We were in town for the Wine and Walleye Festival. We were just a few doors down from the activities at Point Park (great view of the harbor and bridge) and about two blocks from all of the vendors and restaurants on Bridge Street. Three bedrooms with plenty of room to spread out. Everything was new and spotlessly clean. When we first checked in, we couldn't’ get the Wi-Fi to connect. Our host was there within minutes to remedy the problem. Would definitely recommend him and this property!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our week at Harborview. The location was perfect. Lots to do within walking distance. The home was immaculate & well furnished. It was roomy. Could have used more counter top space but we made it work. It was fun to sit on the front porch. John was very responsive to any question I had. Great vacation space.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Perfect for our family and a little mini vacay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully renovated place with lots of space for the family. Within walking distance to the park, beach and local shopping. Great off street parking right by the back entrance. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again!"

Fantastic place to stay, super clean, cozy, relaxing atmosphere and the host definitely created environment with little extras like toiletries if you forgot something, plenty of towels and wash clothes, plenty of coffee teas and sugar, kitchen items were all in great condition. We played scrabble and games too. I highly recommend."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We went for a girls weekend with mom and sisters. We enjoyed every minute! The place was so comfortable and so well stocked with everything we needed! I had forgotten my toothbrush and there were new ones waiting for us! I would recommend this place!!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great and exactly what we needed. The laundry machines and amenities were all new and worked great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely beautiful! Our hosts were very helpful and responsive to every question we had. We will definitely try to stay here every time we visit Ashtabula, Ohio!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for MAAC Swimming Championships at Spire. The home was a good distance to Spire. It was so clean and cozy. I highly recommend this property!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean. Plenty of space very accommodating. Would stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a lovely place to stay. Will definitely use again.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place! Exactly what we were looking for! They even had some many toys, coloring books, and activities for our little ones! I was even more happily surprised about the pack n play and high chair! This was perfect as we have a 1.5 and 2 year old!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house to stay in. Plenty of room and nice atmosphere. We only wish we could’ve stayed a little longer. We definitely would stay again if we were in the area. The only issue we came across was that the doors to the bedrooms and restrooms do not lock.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay here at this special Airbnb. We really love this home. It’s cosy and quiet even during bad weather. We enjoy all the sitting areas in the house including the island.
The kitchen has everything you need to cook with. The place is to Bridge St with nice restaurants and shops. Just across the street, is Martini’s Restaurant & Lounge. The BEST Martinis!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was our second time staying at this beautiful Air B&B! The home was so tastefully decorated with lovely fall accents! The kitchen is spacious and beautiful and properly stocked with pots, pans and utensils. The bed is so comfortable. And I loved having Roku tvs. It was so easy to log in and enjoy all of our favorite shows while unwinding in the evening.
My only negative experience and this has nothing to do with the hosts/house, mayflies (I think that’s what they are called) were horrendous!!! We were unable to enjoy the outdoor spaces at all because of the swarms. We found ourselves running in and out of the house to the car. Several even got into the car while packing up and took forever to get out.
All and all a wonderful stay at a beautiful home filled with so many thoughtful amenities! Would absolutely stay again - probably not around this time of year though!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was charming, warm and inviting. We had a lovely stay-great experience!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay in Ashtabula. We were in the Cleveland area to attend the cat show, and wanted a place near the lake. The house was very easy to find, and the host was very friendly and responded quickly to any questions that we had. Once inside, we were pleasantly surprised with how big the house was. The master bedroom was huge! There is plenty of room for six adults.
We loved enjoying the fireplace and I loved the sunroom. The Airbnb is just a few houses down from the lake, so you can see the lake from the kitchen.
Although it was too windy and chilly to enjoy the back porch, we look forward to coming back next summer."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful house!! Lots of space inside and charmingly decorated. We were in town to visit some of the wineries and they were in close proximity. The house was such a relaxing and cozy spot to come back to at the end of the day. The hosts quickly answered any questions that I had and were incredibly friendly as well. I wouldnt hesitate to book this spot again!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The house and neighborhood were charming! Very peaceful and relaxing! Enjoyed every moment!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home and the hosts are amazing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is absolutely beautiful - far beyond our expectations - warm, inviting and furnished with all anyone could need. We so appreciated being able to check in a little early since rain had prevented us from activities we had planned and the bottle of wine was very much enjoyed. We hope to return soon --and stay longer next time. Thanks again !!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay. My sister and I spent 3 nights there and it was perfect. The neighborhood was peaceful, quiet and very safe. A lovely walking trail just across the main road. It was a quick drive into the Historic District of Ashtabula and also quite convent to Geneva on the Lake. The house was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,if you are in the area and want something centrally located and beautiful this is the spot for you. all the amenities and extras are more than worth paying LESS than a local hotel. this is a must stay.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The photo of the water was very misleading. There is no possible view of the water from the home or even at the end of the street.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in this home. The thoughtful layout of the home made us feel right at home. I would definatley recommend this place to a friend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our rental was the perfect location and it was situated on walkable streets and ridable on the bikes too. We took a ride around Lake Erie. It was Memorial Weekend and we were able to have some family over (some were in wheel chairs) to have some good family time. Corn hole, propane fire pit, and very comfortable outside seating. Mornings were greeted by chirping birds and one morning a beautiful deer came walking through our yard. The place was very clean and mattresses for all of us were comfy and we all slept. There were little corners in the house that you could hide from others or come together for a card game or meal. I really enjoyed our time at this house."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very nice
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place just exudes peace! With many lovely, comfortable seating areas inside and outside, this is indeed a hidden gem of a place. This beautiful house is close to the Harbor District and few minutes to GOTL yet on a quiet, tree lined street.
The kitchen is very nice with all the necessary tools for cooking. The washer and dryer are easily accessible. I used one of the beds and it was very comfortable.
All of the rooms are very tastefully decorated.
When you walk in the door, take off your shoes and just relax and find peace."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,I would recommend this home to anyone looking in Ashtabula! The host were wonderful and truly think above and beyond for the guest.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful home in a quaint and charming neighborhood. The house was simply beautiful and so tastefully decorated. The extra little amenities were so thoughtful. We loved the back patio with the comfy couch and cozy fireplace. The bikes were in great shape. We enjoyed peaceful rides around the neighborhood. My only less than rave review would be the bed in main bedroom. Every time I rolled over or sat up it made a terrible creaking noise. But overall we had an amazing stay at this home and will certainly be a returning guest!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the nicest, most relaxing and spacious place I've stayed in Ashtabula. Two of my friends and I have stayed at several AirBnbs in Ashtabula for lab weekends at KSU Ashtabula and Kalyn's home was the perfect place. It was beautiful, functional, spacious, included all the little things to make it feel homey and welcoming, and the outdoor space was the cherry on top. We wished the weather would have been more accommodative to enjoy the luxuries of the lake and its surroundings but would highly recommended to stay here to anyone. Would definitely look into staying here again next time I'm in Ashtabula. LOVED it!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Even better than we had expected!
Tons of space! Perfectly clean! So close to the lake! Wish the weather was better, or we could have stayed longer! Would love to come back and stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Kalyn and Amy’s hospitality went above and beyond offering any health and beauty supply that you may need, but may have forgotten. All communication was very friendly, clear, and proactive. House was extremely clean with lots of room and great attention to detail. A wonderful place to call a home away from home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described and well appointed with lots of amenities. It served our purpose well and was a relaxing place to come back to.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here! The place was exactly like the pictures and was wonderful for our family. The host provided little extra items around the house that you may have forgotten in your packing, which was really helpful. There were a ton of amenities! I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about this home. Host was awesome and made sure our stay was wonderful. Beautiful, clean home in a very cute neighborhood. We had the best time and will definitely be back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us. We made some wonderful memories coming home to Ohio!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this house! The house was cozy, clean and had everything you could need.

Thank you for a great weekend getaway!"

The kitchen was well equipped and they had any toiletry you may have forgotten at home. Great outdoor seating on the porch and patio. We didn’t use the bikes but there are three beach cruisers and a cornhole set.
It was a quick walk to the water where there were beautiful sunsets. Just take the steps slow!
Great location to downtown Ashtabula and short rides to the surrounding wineries.
The communication with Amy, the manager, made everything smooth with check in and she made sure all our questions were answered."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated house with full loaded kitchen. Walking distance to beach and Main Street. We would visit again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By the far the best Airbnb we have ever been to. We are very picky when it comes to cleanliness and this home did not disappoint in any way. Samantha’s home was stocked with everything you need and more. The home is well organized and labels of where things belong and how to operate items within the home - definitely a nice touch!
We truly appreciated the impeccably organized, clean and design of this home! Best part of our visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in Samantha’s home. The decor is beautiful and also very cozy - a comfier bed than ours at home! Perfect size for us, our kids and my parents to enjoy. The downstairs area is lovely and very user-friendly - would be perfect for entertaining if we wanted to have our own big meal or drinks. Finally, Samantha was very friendly, communicative and flexible. We will be back!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were hoping for a perfect getaway with our family, and we sure got it! We simply loved being able to walk and bike to the beach. Pickleball was an extra special experience, and we're convinced we'll become pros! The beach was remarkable, and Sam had everything you needed to enjoy the day! The neighbors were sweet, and biking riding on a calm lake street was something we don't always get but simply loved. The sense of community was really felt as we embraced Bridge Street. The shops were perfect and the restaurants were so excellent! I picked up a beautiful bracelet from a local artist. Truly... it's exquisite! Sam created a home that detailed everything a family or couple would need. The bedding, swings, decor, and furniture were impeccable! Her attention to detail and design are superior. She truly thought of everything you could ever need. It made our stay so wonderful, we can't wait to plan our next trip. Thank you for thinking of everything and making our trip wonderful! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place to stay when visiting Ashtabula
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As beautiful as the pictures. Sam was a great host who went above and beyond to communicate and make us feel welcome. We loved being able to bring our dog, the fully equipped kitchen and being close to Bridge St. And while pet friendly the house was super clean. The lake is close but it still was about a 15-20 minute walk so it was a bit further than we thought it would be. It was a nice area, although some of the neighboring houses had a bit of a creepy vibe with their decorations (skulls, demon deer, hangman’s noose). Great stay overall and we would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Samantha's place!
The house was designed to details, very cozy and lovely!
The house had everything you will need on a trip, in case you forgot smthg, don't worry they have everything you'll need.

Close to the beach and to the town center!
We will definitely be back 😁"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is perfectly appointed with anything and everything you could want. It's all labeled and easy to find.

We were in town for work trip and loved walking in the door after a long day. This home offers comfort, peace and represents a coastal energy as the lake is a stones throw away. There is a gorgeous swing in the living room and spent time enjoying that pleasure and one I haven’t seen before. If we are back in the area, we look forward to staying again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sam’ s house was perfect in every way- and the attention to detail was spot on.

It's an older home with lots of character and we enjoyed it a lot. The area is nice and quiet (even this busy week with the eclipse). We brought our dogs too, and they felt right at home. Walking distance to the beach was super great, too!
We would definitely consider Point Breeze again!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The Point Break House was perfect for the sporting event at the Spire. What I love about owners like Meeghan is that the time was taken to make it a truly unique home. The beach-inspired decore was thoughtfully placed throughout the home. The one night it rained I felt as if I was the beach. Thank you for sharing your home with my family!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here with our 4 children over the holidays. The beds were very comfortable! Loved the preserved vintage style.
We walked to Harbor Perk and the Iroquois for the best coffee and pizza. My uncle has owned the Iroquois for many years and my cousin makes the pizza from scratch.
Also walked to the beach that’s a short distance from the house. Would be even better in the summer!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wondering time here!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed ourselves. It was nice to be by the lake and checking out the bridge at night. We also had a chance to check out the coffee shop and the brewery.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Meeghan’s place. It was so tastefully decorated and everything we needed for a relaxing weekend was right there. They had a pickleball set and beach items ready to go in the closet for us which was so thoughtful. It was a 15ish minute walk to some great coffee shops and even closer to a nice beach, a playground, tennis and pickleball courts and a nice museum. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We cannot say enough about our stay. The house was awesome! Walnut beach was amazing and so close to the house! The house was spotless and well stocked. The welcome binder was super helpful! We would love to visit again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Meghan’s place. It has lots of personality. Her instruction book was great. The beach is about a 20 minute walk unless there is a shortcut we missed. It is a lovely little beach. We just wish we had more time to enjoy the house. We LOVE the outdoor bathtub!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Point Break while in town visiting family, our second stay at this house and it is so comfortable!
This will definitely be our place to stay any time we come to Ashtabula. The house is incredibly clean, the beds are very comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need, and we especially liked using the beach equipment for a fun day at Walnut Beach."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at Point Break for our family vacation. We love being able to walk to the beach, library, marine museum, and Bridge St. with local eateries and shops. The house was spotless and perfect for a beach trip. The kids bathed in backyard tub and played in the game room/garage, which also helped to keep the place clean and free of sand. It’s a great place to get away and relax. We have created so many family memories staying here. We can’t wait to return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Meeghan was a great host. Check-in was very easy, the house was very clean and Meeghan included a notebook with easy to follow instructions about the house and information about the area.
I would recommend staying at Point Break. It is a short walk to Walnut Beach and a great area to ride bikes. We enjoyed going to the Wine and Walleye Festival and going to the restaurants in Ashtabula during our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Meeghan’s home was so cute and very cozy! We loved discovering all of the artistic, vintage, and repurposed items in the house. The board games and converted garage provided hours of fun for our kids on a stormy night. The house was well-stocked and very clean, and the description is accurate—it’s true that the basement bathroom is only for those comfortable with stairs and really just a stall and adjacent utility sink, but it was surprisingly immaculate and not a problem for us. We were also very close to the beach and to town. I’m so happy we found Meeghan’s place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family absolutely loved this home. The atmosphere was great, the decor/style was unique and so lovely. Meeghan and Ryan were great and very helpful with any questions or concerns. A definite return stay on our next trip to wine and covered bridge country."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay here visiting family for the Fourth of July weekend. Meeghan’s place was perfect. I don’t think the pictures do it justice! The home has great touches and the neighborhood is very pretty. Check in was easy and the house was very clean, and I really appreciated Meeghan’s binder of recommendations and house info. This is my third year staying in this area for the 4th and Meeghan’s spot is my favorite place we’ve stayed!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time staying at this AirB&B for 3 nights. Everything was perfect. Loved the decor and all the amenities. Of course our favorite room was the garage. We just loved it. Great location - close to the beach.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a girls weekend. The house was pristine. Love all the decor. Beds were comfortable. So close to Walnut Beach which was our desired spot. Would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a beautiful house with lots of whimsical art pieces and color. This place was spotless and had everything we needed for our long weekend. It was refreshing to sit on the front porch each morning and drink my coffee, and take in the lake breeze. Very peaceful and relaxing"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Meeghan’s place for several weeks this spring. I absolutely loved it. This is a wonderful little town on Lake Erie close to so many things - hiking at Erie Bluffs state park, covered bridges, sunrise walks on Walnut Beach just a few blocks away. There are lovely little shops close to the house that include a cafe with local coffee, farm to table provisions, chocolate and beer! The house itself was wonderful, so tastefully done and welcoming to a weary traveler. The beds were comfortable with hotel quality sheets and pillows. The kitchen has everything needed and I loved the dining table, it definitely took my morning oatmeal to the next level. Thank you so much Meeghan!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Point Break! As soon as we stepped inside, we felt right at home. The house is bright and cheerful, and has great character along with some cool art pieces throughout the house. All of the amenities we needed for a comfortable and cozy stay were provided, along with some treats from the host which were appreciated! We loved being able to walk to the beach and we enjoyed some great restaurants and shops which were also within walking distance. We will definitely be back when we return to the area!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Point Break! The decor was just beautiful. You could tell that there had been a lot of thought put into each piece of artwork and furniture that was there. We loved the grape Jelly made by our host! The house was spotlessly clean, which is something that we look for in an Air B & B. We would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Our stay was great. Meegan’s place was beautiful and squeaky clean. It is walking distance to the lake and great restaurants close by. Her place was well equipped for our month long stay. The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful. Meegan was very quick to respond to any questions. I highly recommend staying here.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Meghan’s place was great! The home was lovely and the neighborhood was very nice. We had a great time. Thanks Meeghan!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was lovely! Just as described- very clean and comfortable in a great location right by the lake.
We loved the fireplace and Meghan provided plenty of wood.
Meghan was so responsive and helpful. When there was an issue with the internet provider she went above and beyond to provide short-term and long-term fixed as soon as possible. She also made sure the driveway was cleared after the snow. A wonderful host and stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved every moment of it. From walking in the door to a beautiful home, decorated so well, they definitely put a lot of time and effort into that home. Paid close attention to detail!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Megan's place in Ashtabula was amazing and magical! Every corner hides another treasure making us wish for the weather turn to awful so that we might discover more. The kitchen, dining room, sitting room and bedrooms were perfectly sized, and the decorating style and amazing color combinations were just so, well, soothing and a feast to the spirit. I don't know if this area of our country has a ""style"" but this very well could be IT. I really need to come back to enjoy the game room and definitely need to enjoy the bath tub in the back garden which was also heartwarming
As the weather was gorgeous, we had to head to the shoppes on Bridge Street which were delightful as were the restaurants. The beach at Walnut /Park was perfect for a morning and evening stroll to see the sunset and just right waves. I was treated to a perfect Sunday morning sunrise when I went down to the harbor to see both the drawbridge rise just as the sun was rising. The beach, shoppes and restaurants are within bike or walking distance. The neighborhood was friendly and welcoming.
A dozen or so wineries are in the area. Geneva on the Lake was close to enough for a visit. Beach parks are located every couple of miles.
A truly wonderful place to stay. And as if all this isn't enough..... I truly felt that bringing our dogs with us was perfectly ok. Some of the AirBnb say its ok but don't really welcome pups. And the homemade grape jelly was a sweet treat! Thank you."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quirky, charming! The house is well appointed, and the hosts are very communicative and accommodating. Really enjoyed the inspired decorating touches, Meegan has done a great job of giving the house a unique vibe.
The house is set up perfectly for a small group of friends to visit and explore the Ashtabula Harbor area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The decor is awesome and everything is nicely stocked! Would stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures do NOT do the decor and furniture justice! Everything was so amazing, I wish I could stay forever! Everything was comfortable and we had everything we could possibly need for our stay!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the eclectic yet homey ""vibe"" of this home! We wanted to experience Lake Erie and and this was the absolute perfect location. Love love love Ashtulus!"
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,Thank you
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location is fantastic- easy walk or drive to a wonderful beach. Meeghan was quick to respond. We had a wonderful trip and enjoyed our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time staying at Meeghan's house! Very comfortable accommodations with everything we needed at our fingertips. Great location, peaceful and quiet and so close to the Walnut Beach and walking distance to little shops and restaurants.
Thank you Meeghan!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful! Meeghan was EXTREMELY attentive in communication, but also in the adorable and hospitable details around the home. Extremely homey and comfortable. The walk to the lake beach was quaint and easy access.
10/10 would recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect beautiful quaint home!! This was my first time using airBnb and I couldn’t of asked for a better experience. I brought my mom and daughter up for a little girls trip to celebrate my moms retirement. We were able to walk to the beach. All the places we ate at were within 5 minutes of the home. The street is very quite and not busy at all! In the evenings we enjoyed putting up the garage door up and playing games in the game room, and there was barely any traffic when we did that. The kitchen has seriously anything you would ever need for cooking and all the condiments. And we loved the fact that there were beach towels, beach bags, & sand toys for my daughter, and tubes to float on in the lake. That was so nice to have!!
We plan on making this a yearly trip now and highly recommend point break!!!!! ThAnk you for an amazing experience, and Sharing your home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our visit very much! We had everything we needed, plus extra stuff like games!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was incredibly cool! Colorful and artistic say it all. Comfortable bedding, the kitchen has everything you need (down to spices, oil and a brita water pitcher in the fridge!) for a family to enjoy their time.
The board games were a hit with my kids, the beach bags in the closet had everything you’d need, there were beach floats in the basement, the ability to do laundry was really helpful, etc.
My family will absolutely be renting this house again, when we come into town."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Point Break is a wonderful get away location. We come into town once a year for the Wine &Walleye Festival, and this house is perfectly located within walking distance of all the festival activities. Check-in was easy and we had everything provided that we would need for the weekend. Beds were very comfortable, and the house was impeccably clean!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great location! Near water and extra amenities, such as beach towels, tubes, tennis rackets, etc! Quaint house with an artistic flair! Nice place to unwind after a hard working day! Thank you very much!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Point break is a home away from home. House is perfect size, has everything you need. Its close to many attractions, by biking or walking. Short drive to local landmarks. Enjoyed finding covered bridges and the bike trails. Loved walnut beach and the free concert. Having sidewalks to walk our dogs were amazing. Downtown businesses were worth eating at and purchasing special gifts."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is our family's new favorite vacation spot. The house was incredibly clean, and the location was prefect. Our young children enjoyed wagon rides to the beach/playground, library, and town center. The outdoor tub (with a clothesline) was perfect for bringing the little ones back from the beach. And we used the converted garage for a play room during the day and game room when the kids were in bed.
The hospitality was great. Meeghan was very communicative and promptly answered our questions.
Not only is the house exactly as described, but it's essentially an art museum. Every furnishing is authentic, and it's clear that each piece of decor was chosen (or repurposed) with careful thought. I couldn't recommend this place enough."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Meghan’s place was wonderful! The house was spotlessly clean, and every room was truly a work of art. My family and I loved walking to Walnut Beach, and exploring the downtown/harbor Ashtabula area (both minutes away)! The area was peaceful, but there was plenty to do. I would definitely recommended Meeghan’s place to anyone who wants to a relaxing getaway in great little town!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our fourth summer randomly choosing an Airbnb and going on an adventure! Meghan’s place was by far (without a doubt ) the best and most accommodating Airbnb we’ve stayed in!
As a family of five, there were so many things we appreciated that we had not experienced in other homes. From cleaning supplies, an accessible washer and dryer, paper towels, dish soap, ice cubes and cold water, etc. Those necessary items made our trip so much easier and relaxing.
The area of Ashtabula is beautiful, clean, friendly, and accommodating! I grew up in southern, Florida and I found the beaches of Lake Erie to be WONDERFUL!
My husband and I personally loved the artistic beauty of how perfectly decorated this house was. Just sitting and enjoying the personalized pieces of art and furniture was so neat! We cannot wait to stay here again!
Andrea W."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the place you want to stay in Ashtabula. Our family loved our time at Point Break. We played games in the garage, ate takeout on the “swirly sunset” table, and walked to the beach every night for the sunset and to find beach glass. Meeghan is an excellent host, and the details of the place are so much fun. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Meeghan place was clean and well stock. We enjoyed the garage entertainment room. The place is walking distance to Walnut Beach, Hubbard House Underground Railroad Museum and Ashtabula Maritime Museum. We will be back!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well appointed adorable home. Loved the antique pieces in the house. Great location! Hosts were amazing and great communication.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Simple. Accurate. Easy. My former roommate and I got our small families together for a 1/2 way meet up. We spent the weekend at the park and utilized the game room. Meeghan truly makes this an effortless adventure. I would stay again if we return to Ashtabula.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming and unique home within a short walk to Walnut Beach. This home is full of eclectic decor and artwork. Large master bedroom with desk, second and third bedrooms are small yet cozy. Open dining room to living room for games, reading, etc. Our family had a wonderful time even though the weather was cold and snowy. Very responsive and accommodating hosts who have done an amazing job making Point Break a relaxing getaway. Our one regret is that the weather wasn’t warmer - we would have spent more time in the garage-turned-rec room, which is flawlessly decorated."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is one of my favorite homes in the area! I had stayed there once before and was again very pleased with everything!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Would highly recommend staying here and hope to return! Impeccably, artistically decorated with fun touches throughout the historic space that make it truly feel like a home. Very clean and in a fantastic location that is either a 1-3 minute drive or walkable to both the beach and dining/shopping downtown. Suspect Meeghan/Ryan may live next door, so appreciated their proximity to resolve issues if needed (we didn't have any!), but absolutely felt we had the home and outdoor space to ourselves for a birthday weekend getaway. Appreciated being able to bring our dog and will definitely be back!"
2022-02-01,3,Stayed over a week,House was as shown in pictures.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very lovely home. Accurate description which we appreciate. Overall great stay.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"This listing ticked boxes I didn't even know I had and, by far, is the most authentic home I've vacationed in. There's such love, care, and cozy comfort packed in it. Cleanliness was also on point and the little goodies in the kitchen were so sweet. The only possible regret I have is that we didn't first experience this home in the warmer months. But we'll definitely be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and very cute.
We wanted a quick, relaxing, get away over Thanksgiving break and that's what we got."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very prompt and it was a very nice place.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meeghan and Ryan were great hosts! The house was in a perfect location in the Harbor. I loved all the personal historical and artistic touches in the house. A huge wow was a shower that fit my 6’7 husband. Most older houses it’s in a small corner and he has to duck to take a shower and the shower head is at his chest. We will definitely be back next trip to Ashtabula, Ohio."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was great stay- everything is just as pictured and very clean. Kitchen is very well stocked. Just a short walk to the beach!
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,👍
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay and the house was adorable! We also appreciated being able to bring our dog, and it was so nice to have the beach just across the street and hiking/biking trails not far away. Meeghan was very helpful and responsive, and we would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Ashtabula area!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home possibly haunted. My housemates and I heard some ghost like sounds. However great house
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to enjoy Lake Erie in a quiet neighborhood. It is beautifully decorated. Meeghan keeps the place stocked with just the right amenities, even a beach umbrella, chairs and towels for a visit to the beach."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is nicely decorated and amazingly clean. The walk to the beach is short enough for a 5 year old and through a pleasant neighborhood. The beach is really nice, with dunes, wildlife, clear water and a sandy bottom (once you get beyond a few rocks). Everything necessary for cooking, cleaning, and other conveniences was available on site. It was a wonderful stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Meghan’s home was filled with artistic touches everywhere. The space was great for our family of four. It is very close to the beach, downtown Ashtabula, and only about 15-20 minutes to Geneva on the Lake. Meghan was very responsive. Our stay provided us with exactly what we needed…good quality family time."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house and great location.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay! About 10 minute drive to GOTL, 2 minute drive to the beach"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Highly recommend it! Would definitely stay again.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"We would absolutely recommend this place to anybody. Colorful, beautiful, artistic, clean and organized. You can tell a lot of effort and care was put in to make your stay a wonderful experience. It was literally a minute drive to a cozy beach where we saw the most beautiful sunset and rainbow across Lake Erie."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Quaint place! Located walking distance from the beach and only few minutes drive to area restaurants. Great communication with host. Overall a wonderful and hassle-free trip.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, clean, cozy, and meticulously decorated. The location is great, close enough to get to all the attractions but far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet and we are from a town with 1000 people so that's saying something. Walking distance from beach, couple and family friendly. Check it out!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! It was my first time in the area and Meeghan was a fantastic host. She was very friendly and informative if things to do in the areaThe house was very clean, organized and had everything we needed during our stay. 10/10 we will definitely be back!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay, the location is perfect and Bob and Reama are fantastic hosts!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at the cabin before and enjoy it every time. I can walk right down to the lake, so relaxing and beautiful. And the cabin is so cozy! The hosts are very responsive to any question or request. The fire pit is a nice added bonus!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Stayed in this area before and great location to the wineries…perfect for the one night!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin was so beautiful inside and out. I enjoyed the smell of wood inside and how homey it felt. You can see Lake Erie from the front windows, sunset too! You can walk down to the lake a few feet away. The cabin is right on a park so there is a paved walking path, playground for the kids and swings to sit and look at the lake. Very close to all of the attractions of Geneva on the Lake. All the basics were provided inside the cabin. I enjoyed making a fire in the outside fire pit under the full moon. Perfect get away."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet location right by the lake. Park next door. Cabin was very cozy. Short drive to dining and wineries.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very clean and cute. The perfect amount of space for a little get a way. The lake is within walking distance and the cabin is no more than 20 minutes away from the beach, great restaurants, and wineries."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing!! We rented three properties all at once all from Bob and Reama. They were so clean and perfect. They gave everyone in our family a private place to stay! Couldn’t say enough great things about the cabins!! You will not regret staying here we are planning our next trip back hopefully with a longer stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin, very clean."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for a family! The playground next door was fun for our small kids. And the cabin was super clean. The GOTL strip was about 10 minutes down the road and all the wineries about 20 minutes away.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this cute little cabin!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Bob and Reama’s place during our visit to Geneva and Ashtabula. It’s the perfect spot for a night away and we will be back again.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the most beautiful cabin, great location and wonderful hosts. Second time here and it’s our favorite place in Geneva to get away and relax! Sunsets are awesome!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice cozy place! Easy check in and check out! Amenities and quality was as said and great! Place is kind of small but it is more than good enough for a couple or a couple friends. Good view and access to lake and a nearby park.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location quiet and cozy place we loved it
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful getaway
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cottage. Very clean. Highly recommended.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful get away with a lake view right next to q play ground. Very clean, a really nice place to just unwind for a day!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great! It was easy to check in and out. Communication was quick and easy. The cabin smelled of beautiful cedar, was quaint, and very clean. The pictures don’t do the place justice! My only complaint is that it takes a while for the water to get back hot after a shower. Other than that, wonderful. We will be staying here again!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay at Bob and Reama's cabin. It was very clean, communication and check-in were easy, no hiccups at all, etc. This is a good choice if you are in the Ashtabula area and need a reliable place to stay. Many businesses were closed due to this being more of a seasonal destination, but we were easily able to find anything we needed within a 10-15 minute drive (if not less).
That said, the cabin didn't quite hit the mark for us. The location is a bit awkward - surrounded by gravel and overlooking a baseball diamond, with Lake Erie technically visible but certainly too far to be enjoyable from the porch. There was no kitchen table (TV trays were available), the sheets and blankets were very thin over an uneven mattress, we were unable to find any provided bath soap or shampoo, and the water heater was too small to take back-to-back warm showers.
None of these items are dealbreakers since the cleanliness and newness of the property offset some of the weak points. But hopefully this helps others know what to expect!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and clean place. Recommended.

2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean, convenient! Close to Geneva State Park and wineries. Only one a/c (in the bedroom), so the living area could get pretty warm on hot days. Still a great value and a charming cabin."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice cabin, nice big bed in the bedroom and a full size fold out sofa in the living room. Modern well-equiped kitchen. There is also a firepit but we didn't use it.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to town for a wedding, and stayed in this charming little cabin for the night. It was clean, well stocked with things we would have used if we stayed longer, and was right by the water! We would love to come and stay again when we can spend more time at the lake and enjoy the gorgeous view. Thanks again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful cabin and perfect location! It has great amenities and the hosts were so nice.

2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin with beautiful views of Lake Erie! It was an extremely comfortable stay with cozy accents in the whole place. The sunset views from the front porch can't be beat. While there are a row of other cabins right next to it, it was very quiet and most of them were vacant so it felt very peaceful. No direct access to the lake, but there are plenty of places to sit in the park right there to look at the water. Beaches very close by."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, stylish and cozy."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a getaway by Lake Erie near the Geneva-on-the-Lake area, I recommend staying at Bob & Reama’s cabin. My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this cute cabin with lovely views of Lake Erie."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute space. Loved it. Thanks for hosting our family!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place was in a great location! You get a beautiful lake view by walking down the lane, but there isn’t any way to actually hang out by the water there. You have to walk down a very steep gravel path to get to the water edge and then it is just a steep drop off. Plan to use it for BEAUTIFUL sunset views but head over to walnut beach or breakwater beach to hang out and rock hound at the water.
The decor here was so light and airy, and Amy had so many thoughtful touches around the house.
We did have an ant issue that she was super responsive to helping with, and really that’s my only complaint and that’s a random nature thing for this time of year. It just made it hard to use the cute little kitchen the way i had hoped to. She had traps dropped off within 30 mins of my message though, and that was awesome.
TLDR: great views, great decor, great location, close to local beaches, very responsive host with my issue!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy is always hospitable and the Hygge house is stunning. This was our second stay and it does not disappoint. We will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful place, very clean, with exceptional amenities, great kitchen, and great little touches that made it a special stay. We enjoyed seeing a beautiful sunset just down the street on Lake Eerie. We highly recommend this home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in this cute, comfortable, and peaceful home. Great location in a very quiet neighborhood. We had a great time and would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to start. Any thought if everything. Not only was the house super clean and comfortable in an amazing lake view location but she thought of everything! We walked in to a basket of s’mores supplies with a bottle of wine and popcorn. Started getting settled in and found a coffee bar with everything included, puzzles, games, headed back towards the rooms and found baskets with anything you could have forgotten. When I tell you she thought of everything I mean everything. All that was left to do was relax and enjoy our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cutest decor and quiet place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amy's place is exactly as pictured and described. The house is cute and cozy and stocked with everything you need. The lake is steps away. Very peaceful. My daughter and I had a wonderful time.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute house! Loved the decor! Amy was a wonderful host! Super friendly and responds quickly! Loved having a view of the water outside! Highly would recommend! Definitely would stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great location, great host. Amy’s house is well decorated and as a host, she has gone above and beyond with the details. We had a great stay and felt right at home. I wish the weather had been better and we could have used the fire pit for the provided s’mores. If we’re ever back in the area, we’d stay again as this host has the gift of hospitality!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive. The place was very clean and as described. Giving feedback , the house was very cold and some of the vents were stuck and could not be opened the whole way. Something that could easily be fixed. The location was amazing and during a summer time visit would awesome."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. Beautiful little house, great location, but a couple things: there was some dead bugs in the house, large mosquito looking ones. & the way the living room is set up with the tv is strange, we actually had to re arrange a bit to be able to comfortably watch tv.

The kitchen had anything you could possibly need and same for the bathroom. We also arrived to a little platter of ingredients for s’mores, a bottle of wine and a helpful welcome packet. The space was very clean and the house was a close distance to any of the wineries or Geneva on the lake."

Every detail in this little bungalow was not overlooked when it came to decorating. Thanks again for sharing your little bungalow with us 😊"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place, in a fantastic area near by so many things to do. Right between Geneva and Ashtabula.
We enjoyed parks that were good for walking and hiking, so many wineries and covered bridges, great restaurants and for summer there are many beach options.
Amy’s place is spacious, clean, on a quiet street with lake view, her decorations are lovely and makes it feel like home. The outside area in back and in front are great for relaxing and enjoying the outside.
Kitchen has everything anyone could need and there are many toiletries for anything you could think of needing. The beds were extremely comfortable and we got good sleep. There is a front room, living room and kitchen for sitting areas. Outside in back a fire pit and grill and nice grass backyard. We loved our time relaxing here."
