The windows in the attic have no blinds. 3. The third bed is a sofa bed, which needs to be pointed out in the introduction. 4. The sofa bed is extreme uncomfortable so one of my friends had to go out and stayed in hotel."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was everything my family needed and more. My only regret is we didn't get much time to hang out and enjoy it since we were on the go for thanksgiving with the in-laws. The only hiccup we ran into was the furnace wasn't heating but Paul quickly offered and brought a space heater and informed me he would get a technician out immediately. The space fit myself, wife, 2 kids and my mother all comfortably. I'm already looking to plan a return stay this upcoming year."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paul‚Äôs place! It Looked just like the pictures. The bed‚Äôs were super comfy, and the place had everything we needed. It was the perfect stop on our way from spending a day at Yosemite, then headed to San Francisco the next morning. My only recommendation would be to add more specific instructions on where to park. We arrived late and just pulled into the driveway - it caused a small ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù the next morning when we were blocked in by the other tenants car, But Paul was super responsive and helped remedy the situation quickly so we could leave on time. Great place though, and I would highly recommend it!"

We didn't use the kitchen much, but has everything you could possibly need. Washer and dryer if needed in the place. Parked on the street, and we were okay with that because it is a good area. Communication with Paul was great.
Keep in mind that it is upstairs, so if you have issues walking up stairs, that may be a problem... Other then that we would definitely recommend and stay there again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here ! This was also probably the cleanest Air BnB I‚Äôve ever stayed in and Rui was so responsive to my messages and questions. She even checked in with me to ask how my stay was going. The only downsides were some things out of our control, like the sound of the train at night is pretty loud and as a renter of one of the downstairs rooms, sometimes the sound of renters upstairs was loud, too. Otherwise, the room & house was in a really nice & safe area, there was plenty of parking, Rui was responsive, and the room felt very cosy and well taken care of. There was also an extra personal heater or fan in the room if needed, lots of closet & storage provided, and all the promised amenities on the advertised airbnb post were there too. I would definitely love to stay in one of Rui‚Äôs rooms again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home. Every need was accommodated without asking for anything. I only wish that I had booked my room for the week. The day I decides to extend was checkout and the room had already been booked up. I think anyone looking for some quiet time or in need of working from home with 0 interruptions this is definitely the perfect place.

I like having full access to use the kitchen. There are clear instructions of where we can put our food in the cupboard and/or fridge and which items you can use. There is coffee and an ice maker. The house is gorgeous, spacious, and clean. There is space in the closet to hang clothes. The washer and dryer available for use until 11 pm. The shower is a little narrow, so it wouldn't be a good fit for someone with a larger frame or for someone who has mobility issues. There is shampoo, body wash, toothpaste/brushes, and hand soap for use. 5 stars *****"

The house was spacious with a great kitchen, so we were able to host Christmas eve dinner and breakfast at the location. Backyard was cute, the bathrooms were well designed for a family. Overall just a great place."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacy was a very pleasant host. Very kind, very helpful, and responsive. She answered all my questions in a timely manner. Her home was very clean, cozy, and inviting. I will book Stacy‚Äôs home if I‚Äôm ever back in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We came from Oregon to visit family and this house was in a great location for us to easily travel back and forth to grandma‚Äôs house and accommodate everyone. The house met all of our needs and we loved staying here; it made our trip really comfortable and stress free! Stacy was a great host and she and her husband have a wonderful home. Thanks for having us!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacy‚Äôs home is very clean, well decorated and private. We needed a four bedroom to come to Modesto for our daughter‚Äôs wedding, and we were able to rent the whole house. There are door locks with codes, presumably to rent out on an individual basis as well. Everything that one would need is at your fingertips. The house has pleasant greenery surrounding the property, which gives the yard a feeling of privacy. There are even two outdoor seating areas.
Guests should read the site rules carefully and decide if the home fits their needs. Be sure to ask Stacy questions before renting the home. Stacy quickly responded to my messages clarifying any confusion regarding the rules. Although the site said she allowed pets, in fact, she does not allow pets, specifically dogs, for this property."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacys place made us feel right at home, the location was great and fit our family‚Äôs needs perfectly. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet which was lovely. Our host gave us clear instructions and was very responsive days leading up to our trip. Whenever we are visiting the area again, i will look forward to staying here next time!Thanks for everything!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't know what to say except that it was fantastic. The entire place was clean and had everything we needed and then some. The driveway was interesting to go into, kinda like your own little private road to get to your house lol. Everything about it was just 10 outta 10 for me and my gf. I'm trying to think of something that can be improved but I can't think of any, goes to show how nice it is :)"

Beautiful home, amazing area, conveniently so close to every day essentials (restaurants, gas stations, shopping areas). Host was extremely friendly and available when needed. Thank you for making our experience in California one my family and I will remember for years to comeüíïIf we are ever in the area again, and the dates are available (cause it does book up fastüòâ), we will undoubtedly be returning."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed in Modesto as a central location to visit Yosemite, San Francisco, and San Jose. Bit of driving each day but the location and the house were worth it.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a very good night in this huge house The house is located in a quiet area. Perfect for getting closer to San Francisco at the end of your trip. The rooms are large and comfortable. The kitchen is quite well equipped. Both bathrooms are nice when there are many of us. Too bad that the finishes of the house leave a little to be desired (we see that everything has been redone but quickly) because it could be fabulous. There is space to park. I would this property.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home is exactly as described and photographed in the listing. It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood and the inside is very spacious and comfortable.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here... comfortable bed with super soft sheets. Pristine condition, great communication and clear instructions for arriving and closing. Thank you for a great place to stay while we visited family."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, nice and new! Kitchen was very nice. Beds and bedrooms great. Maybe a bit of a downside would be the living room furniture, it is new and clean but pretty uncomfortable. Not bad for staying in a couple days but if I was chilling out there for a week, I may find the furniture a bit problematic. The hosts were great and communication was great. But overall, an absolutely great experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay, Shanes places was very clean, safe and I felt right at home. After a long day of traveling for work, the last think I wanted to do was drive around lookong for food, Shane gave me great recommendations of near by restaurants. Another great point was she had snacks! I love that. I would definitely book again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Calm and quiet place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Cozy stay in Modesto
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a cute space. It is on a seemingly busy street but we were not bothered by noise or neighbors. The house seems brand new and is spotless. The host responded immediately to our questions. Beds are quite comfy. We had a nice stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very clean and comfortable, just what we needed before hitting the road home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Shane‚Äôs place was very comfortable. We all had a good night sleep on both nights. The only thing we didn‚Äôt like was that the house was a bit cold despite using the heater . I would also recommend adding a full size mirror in a room or the hall way for a fit check lol. Overall I loved this place, I would stay here again, & I would recommend anyone to stay here during their stay in Modesto!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was in great shape, plenty of towels, kitchen was fully stocked and p-touch labeled.
The house location is on a main street so you will hear traffic while in the living room and the bedrooms, but calms down during the night hours."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"incredible home with an amazing host! Shane made everything so easy, from communication to check in/out! she was kind and her home was incredibly comfortable! honestly one of the cleanest Airbnb‚Äôs i‚Äôve ever stayed at! the beds were comfortable, all the appliances were great, and they even had a few toys my daughter thoroughly enjoyed! but truly, what was the most important to me was the cleanliness, it was truly appreciated! 10 out of 10 recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was spotless, newly remodeled with everything you would need for a stay. Very easy to find, comfortable beds, white fluffy towels and sheets, nice dishes. Loved the Keurig coffee machine with pods provided. Thank you for the early check-in for our family wedding. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very pleasant and comfortable. Shane was excellent at communicating.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a 3-4 people...it sleeps 6, but that might be a stretch with the 2 bathrooms. In fact, we were surprised to see 3 bedrooms; we thought it was 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It was very nice and clean, but lacked some small amenities that would have made it more comfortable--kleenex, luggage racks or a dresser, hand soap at the kitchen sink, enough toilet paper. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, cooking utensils and spices. It was pretty obvious, however, that a tall person either built or rehabbed it; I had to stand on my toes to reach the microwave and the second level shelves. I'm 5'4"". The TV was not easy to figure out and I couldn't find CNN until the last day we were there, but we may be less technologically oriented than some. The outside area was very nice with a working barbeque and a table and 4 chairs. Extra chairs were placed in another spot outside. Overall, a good value for the money."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely will recommend and book again when needed. House is just like the pictures, is clean and cozy! Shane was always responsive and helpful, one of the best Airbnbs I have stayed in!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very solid place to stay in Modesto. Clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. They accommodated our request for an early check-in as well. We would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was just like the photos. It was very easy to find, and easy to gain access at the door. The beds were very comfortable, and everything was very clean.
When we called with a concern re the air conditioner and the blinds, Bob came immediately to assist us. He even provided additional decaf coffee and herbal tea!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were comfortable and satisfied with the residence. The house was EXACTLY as pictured. We would have appreciated being notified that there was active building construction going on directly behind our bedroom windows starting at 7:30 am. The bedrooms were also bright with sunlight each morning. Overall, the host provided the necessities to make our stay enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed staying here for the night! Loved the entire place! I will be booking again in the future! I travel a lot to the Modesto area and have stayed at a few places here and this one is by far my favorite. Only thing I would say is I wish we could have used the garage. I would pay more just to be able to make sure my car was safe! Lived off of a very busy road too so it was hard to get in and of the driveway too. Very minor things though and will stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at this airbnb. Very nice place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Shane went above and beyond for our stay. My family and I booked the home to attend my cousin‚Äôs funeral services. She allowed us to check in earlier, which allowed us to take care of some errands prior to the funeral. Her gesture made a huge difference for us. Thank you. Moreover, Shane's kindness and understanding during a difficult time truly touched our hearts. Her exceptional hospitality turned a challenging trip into a more manageable and comforting experience for our family."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,5star rating! I wish i have stayed longer but it was booked out. The host Shane was so kind and extremely responsive no matter when I messaged her. I enjoyed my stay. Best place to stayüòä

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in several places and this one is hard to beat! I always check for super host and look for white bedding as I shop for places. NEW or like new, are a big draw for me. Then I read reviews! Every time I had a question- Shane responded promptly and wanted to be sure we were good! Modesto is a hot place in August- but not here! A/C kept us beyond comfortable. Also, houses can have a closed up smell- NOT HERE! It even smelled good naturally! It truly is like a brand new home- NOT WHAT I CALL-‚ÄúLIPSTICK ON A PIG!‚Äù Some of the areas around Modesto are questionable- but here you feel very safe with what appears to be a security system. This place doesn‚Äôt disappoint!
Thank you Shane! Well done!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very good time in this house! Thanks to the owner for the great care! All was perfect!üëç
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the kind of space that you wish there were 6 stars for.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If there were more than 5-stars, I'd give them. This space was an amazing place to arrive to, after hours of driving, and it had everything that our family needed. It was clean, stylish, close to amenities and was located in a nice neighborhood. After being disappointed by many places along our road trip, I was thrilled that this place lived up to expectations. Even the well-organized cupboards made my ""OCD"" self very happy! We would love to have stayed longer than one night."

From the moment I arrived until the day of my departure, I was thoroughly impressed with the outstanding level of service, the immaculate accommodations, and overall experience provided.
Shane was incredibly friendly and responsive, to ensure our stay was nothing short of great. Their attentiveness made me feel like a valued guest from the get-go.
As I stepped into the property, I was immediately taken aback by its pristine cleanliness and tasteful decor. Every corner was thoughtfully curated, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The attention to detail was evident in the well-appointed furnishings, stylish artwork, and comfortable amenities, all of which contributed to a delightful home-away-from home experience.

The property was easy to find, had a cute backyard with seating for 4-6 people, and plenty of parking space in front of the house. The kitchen had all the necessities you would need to cook meals during your stay.

There were three of us. For the third person, the sofa is not so ideal for sleeping as you can't make a bed out of it. Highly recommended for two people."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Where do I begin? This cute casita was more than suitable for my fianc√© and I‚Äôs staycation. We were here for about a week and upon arrival, everything was clean and it was very easy to check-in. There was plates, cups, and cutlery in the kitchen, as well as fresh towels in the bathroom. The shower water ran hot pretty fast and the washer and dryer ran more than perfectly for our needs. We couldn‚Äôt have hoped for a more welcoming stay. There was a few things I touched base on with our host, Isabel, and she was more than kind. Overall, the stay was great. We weren‚Äôt bothered nor disturbed. I‚Äôm familiar with Modesto and can agree that this location in which the house sits, isn‚Äôt the greatest. Although a little sketchy, we didn‚Äôt have any problems with anybody at all. Nobody tried opening the door, no noise, just trains here and there and maybe a dog barking. We very much enjoyed the onsite parking so we could easily see my car, as well as the self locking front door. Would recommend^^"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited the area from Denver and very much enjoyed having our own space rather than a hotel or family accommodation.
The Casita was perfect for our needs. I was able to cook full dinners and do our laundry which saved a ton of money and time. It was peaceful and comfortable. My husband happily fell asleep several times in the recliner even though the bed was good!
The hosts went above and beyond to make sure out stay was a good one.
We will definitely rent this place the next time we visit. ‚ù§"

2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I do not understand where all the great reviews are coming from. This home is located in a very unsafe neighborhood. On our first night someone tried opening the front door in the middle of the night. We felt extremely unsafe after that first night. I do not recommend this home, sketchy people who look like they are on drugs walk this neighborhood. There is a park a block away where you will find homeless people who look like they are on drugs. The home itself is nice and clean, but it‚Äôs not worth the dangerous neighborhood. Please take caution if you decide to stay here."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for what we needed. It was clean, convenient, and the hosts were very friendly and responsive. the bathtub looks a lot bigger in person which was a nice surprise. I also like how the bathroom connects to the living room and bedroom so that a person sleeping in the living area doesn't have to walk through the bedroom to use it (both doors lock). The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but it's Modesto - what can you do? my only real complaint is the bed. It's very thin and seems to be slightly too big for the bed frame. It was not a good night's sleep for me :("

Pros: The neighborhood was nice and quiet, the space is comfortable, we were happy to find water bottles in the fridge for us (much needed because of how busy we were on our trip), it's a cute place with the basic necessities. Cons: There was a slight smell of cigarette smoke which we didn't smell after being inside for a while. This con made our stay only almost perfect.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Angela is a great host. She communicates very well. The house was very clean and exactly as described. I appreciated that she included extra towels based on how many people would be there during our stay (we had 4 adults and 3 children). The kitchen is decently stocked with what you would expect from an Air BnB. There were plenty of mugs, plates, bowls, silverware, etc. Some of the pots and pans were in better shape than others, but at least she had some available. We were able to cook some of our meals during our stay to save some money. She had some spices available, which is always nice. The house is located in a neighborhood on a dead end street, so it was very quiet and there is quite a bit in the area. The grocery store is walkable from the house and it was very nice. There is also a sushi restaurant nearby that we also enjoyed. Overall, we would definitely stay at Angela‚Äôs place again"

She made sure everything went well and when I couldn't find coffee filters she offered to stop by with some. The home was immaculate, organized, and well-stocked. The unit was quiet and very roomy. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. I will definitely stay here again when in town it is by far the best value and for not much more than a hotel room."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The townhome is spacious and laid out well. The kitchen is really big and easy to work in. It is centrally located to the major highway and lots of retail.
There was one glaring problem. The smell of cigarette smoke permeated the entire property. We used three bottles of Fabreeze on the fabrics in the house and out clothing and it did little to help. We were forced to open all the windows whenever we were in the house. The owner told us that this was from the previous tenant, and she was contacting Air B&B about them. I did not and do not believe that. I was a smoker and grew up with smokers. The kind of saturation that we experienced does not happen over a week. It was disappointing that the owner would not waive the cleaning fee. It is my opinion that the house was not clean when we entered because of the heavy smoke smell
That is our only complaint."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Laurie was readily available and didn‚Äôt mind accommodating our needs.

There was plenty of room for 4 adults. The location is on the good side of Modesto. I grew up in Modesto and felt very comfortable staying here. Some places are iffy but not here. Very close to the mall and places you would want to visit. The host was very responsive and friendly. I would defiantly stay here again if I come back. I would stay here with my young children as well. This is a really good Airbnb."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When we walked into this trailer we were surprised by how spacious, comfortable and homey it was. It‚Äôs rare to find a trailer with the bed not tucked against a wall. We highly appreciated not having to crawl over each other to get out of bed. We also appreciated being able to walk to restaurants after a long day of driving. Others might consider the location too far to walk to downtown, but not us. The local traffic can get a bit loud sometimes, but the noise was not bad after it was time for us to settle down for the night. We enjoyed some peaceful sleep. We would definitely stay here again."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great Location! Definitely in a good quiet community. Has a really nice backyard to kind of relax or have a late meal. I found the home to be really spacious and it was stocked with all of our needs. We stayed a few weeks and I don‚Äôt think we ran out of anything so I appreciate that. I didn‚Äôt get to the pool but I know it was open. Very peaceful at night and I never heard any noise from anyone outside. Great value and excellent hosts.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed at in Modesto. It feels like a private cottage in a serene and peaceful environment. It‚Äôs a very intentional and well thought out floor plan and design. Convenient amenities, and touches of whimsical art deco on the wall to make the space more accommodating. Would definitely stay here again!"

Walking in the door, it smelled so clean and fresh which was such a pleasant thing in contrast to other stays in the area. Every surface and room felt clean and well thought out. I felt very private and was able to get sleep during the day as the bedroom was relatively dark. Bed was comfy! Shower and bathroom were super cute and everything functioned very well. Loved that there was a washing machine in the bathroom. I had a very short stay and didn‚Äôt need to use it, but it was great to have the option!

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The stay was wonderful. it was a smooth easy checkin to their place. The room was as described. I stayed there for 7 nights .Overall I feel it's a good place to stay for two to three nights. They communicated very well and were very courteous.
Just one feedback , the bed was too soft for my back and pillows were a little worn. So it's great for a short stay but maybe that's my personal experience.
And I guess it was mentioned that breakfast will be provided in the description while booking , however we did have some packed food made available by them on day 1 , however not for the rest of the week.
But again overall it was worth the money and stay at their place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable place in a quiet neighborhood.
I was in Modesto for several days on business and Ginger's place was perfect for my stay. I didn't spend a lot of time there, but I appreciated the quiet neighborhood, the comfortable bed and I always appreciate an iron and full size ironing board. Ginger was always responsive to my messages and I appreciated the willingness to work with me when I had to shorten my stay a little a couple of weeks out from the trip. Definitely would consider staying here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ginger‚Äôs place was perfect if you are in the Modesto area. The neighborhood was clean and peaceful with plenty of stores nearby.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jack and Ginger's place is lovely. It's a great little oasis in a good spot - right off the Virginia Corridor Trail and bike path that feeds into downtown Modesto and connects a few parks. That was the main reason we wanted to stay here. It's also just around the corner from a grocery store (O'Briens), frozen yogurt place, and some restaurants. The home is a 1 bedroom ADU with a spacious bathroom - there's a small seating area combined with the kitchenette right when you enter. Very tastefully decorated that manages to get a lot of natural light. But because it is south-facing, it also stays very cool. It felt very airy and comfortable, and it was also very quiet. The ADU sits behind a gate and has its own entrance. It was very easy to check in and a really quiet and cozy stay."

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many good things to say about this AirBnB location. The location is convenient for traveling. My wife and I attended a conference in a town approximately 20 minutes from this little oasis. We felt safe, warm, and welcome. They
Ginger, the host kept in good communication before, during, and after our stay. They provided a few snacks for us to enjoy and clean linens, towels, and the place was immaculate.
The only thing I recommend is a larger bed. The double bed is cute, but it's small. There is enough room for a queen or even a king. This would make their place a perfect spot to land while visiting the area.
Thank you, Ginger, for a lovely stay. There is an outdoor pool and cabana that looked very inviting, minus the cold temperatures outside. We didn't use it mainly due to our travel itinerary, but if we had more time I would have definitely enjoyed this nice little bonus."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely Grreat place and host.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very thoughtful rental experience. The attention to most details was apparent and the space was cohesive and efficient. The bed slept ‚Äòwarm,‚Äô I think due to the mattress protector that didn‚Äôt ‚Äòbreathe;‚Äô may just be our personal preference. The entrance is in the side/backyard of the attached house and secluded but not completely separate from the area where the dog can walk; a few times we were awoken by the dog barking but it wasn‚Äôt constant, just surprising. When we first arrived the AC/Heating unit did not turn on. We did not contact the host because the weather was nice at first but realized when it got cooler at night it would have been nice. It almost seemed like a breaker had been flipped because the next day it was working (could have easily been user error, and like I said we didn‚Äôt attempt to contact the host.) It was nice to have the washer and dryer, the rain-style shower head was fabulous, and there was certainly plenty of space to move around with two people, even when getting ready in the bathroom at the same time. Overall a positive experience."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, totally excellent. A great spot to stay and terrific hosts."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well equipped. Heater & all necessary amenities readily available. Nice that you have your own parking spot. Hosts messaged me with information ~1 hour before check in.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place. Very nicely decorated. Be aware you won‚Äôt be able to watch TV from bed but only in the entry room.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although our stay at Ginger‚Äôs was very short, we had everything we needed and more. The location was in a very nice residential area near the community college. They have provided you with many thoughtful amenities for your stay as well. I would recommend to anyone for their stay!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I travel often and this is now one of my top places to stay. The host thought of everything one could need. Great location, beautiful and comfortable home. Very clean and in a nice and quiet neighborhood."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay for a few night as a single or couple. The bed is small but SUPER soft and comfy, the rooms are all decorated beautifully in gold, blue, and marble. They have a waterfall shower, really good tasting tap water, and a K-cup machine. The space is really well used and feels open although it's small."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this place - always an oasis I look forwarrd to.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space! The heater was difficult to figure out so it was chilly. But very nice.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, love the butterfly design. They had a slightly unusual heating set-up, so might be good to ask in advance what the heater situation is, but thanks to Ginger's quick responses on the app we got it figured out. Would recommend!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I always love staying here. A wonderfully convenient and comfortable place. Great hosts.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gingers place was incredibly clean and easy to get to! Loved the selection of movies and my mother slept comfortably on the bed and The futon with the cozy blankets provided kept me warm and safe! Would defiantly stay here again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely located, thoughtful touches. Ginger‚Äôs easy check in and out was greatly appreciated. The space is clean and had everything (and more) that I needed!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was pretty much perfect. Highly reccomend. Location is very close to everything you need.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for the week while visiting to care for family, which because of the pandemic was a very stressful trip -- but thankfully, I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay in Ginger and Jack's place. The living room space was especially nice, because I could relax there with a family member (wearing masks, of course) to watch a movie in a quiet and comfortable space. We also made use of the outdoor table and chairs. You can tell that the owners put a lot of care into every detail, and the space looks just as pictured. I especially appreciated the complimentary kurig coffee maker and coffee pods! These little touches helped my stay feel more like a home away from home. The neighborhood is lovely and filled with beautiful homes and a walking path nearby, along with a local market, O'Brien's, a few blocks away that came in really handy for meals and coffee! The only thing I might mention is that if you are tall, the bed will be short -- I am 5'5 and it was okay for me, but my husband is 6' and if he had travelled with me I know he would have been uncomfortable. There is a couch that converts to a bed, and it is longer, so I suppose a tall person could use that if needed. All in all I would absolutely stay here again if I need to travel to Modesto in the future. I recommend!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay and easy communication with the host. Being close to work was the biggest perk. Thanks for a great stay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ginger‚Äôs place has beautiful accents and colors that anyone with an eye will love. Although there is a separate entrance, This space is attached to their home, which I think is something to mention since I didn‚Äôt notice it prior to. I felt awkward having a conversation with my husband because the window could not be shut due to the AC vent running threw the window to the outside. It‚Äôs seems that this maybe temporary but my husband had to makeshift a curtain for me because I was worried someone could see me undressing through the shifted blinds. Another personal issue, I‚Äôm only 5 ft and I could barely see myself in the bathroom mirror (however, there is a full length mirror the the bedroom that worked out well). My brother stayed with us during this time, and there is a pocket door separating the rooms which is handy. Also, The couch is large and pulls out."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I loved this space. It definitely made me feel like I need to revamp rooms in my own house üòÇ it was a short walk to a cute grocery store (with a Starbucks), a yogurt shop, and a neat Geocache!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute guesthouse! Since I‚Äôm such a Disney nerd, it made me feel like it was a mini castle ‚ù£Ô∏è it was simply enchanting as the listing said.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and clean and quit thank you very much highly recommend
2020-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was perfect for the area of town we wanted. Roseburg Square, a block down the street, has a few of the best options in town- Bob's take and bake pizza, O'briens grocery store and Yogurt Mill yogurt! Also, the Virginia Corridor is a nice walking path nearby. This air b n b overall was a nice place to stay, ideally for 1-2 people because of the full size bed. The air conditioning unit is a plug-in unit in the bedroom so the small living room in front doesn't receive much cool air. The bedroom and bathroom were very spacious. There is no tv in the bedroom and no cable. Even though the home/air b n b is located on a somewhat busy street, we did not hear the traffic inside. The neighbors were very nice. Overall, a simple and clean place to stay."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! You can tell that they have put a lot of work into making this space as comfortable for the guest as possible. The decor is very contemporary and stylish with little touches that make it like home. I loved that they provided a book with suggestions for places to eat, places to go/see, and general information about the city! I will say you might want to bring some ear plugs b/c the house creaks quite a bit. Overall, great place to stay!"
