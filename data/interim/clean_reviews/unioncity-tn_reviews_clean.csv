2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked Rosie‚Äòs retreat because we were coming in for our grandsons high school graduation. It was absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely stay there again when we come back to Tennessee from California. Thank you for a great experience for our first time in Tennessee.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosie's Retreat is a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood and very close to Discovery Park of America. Feels like home and I promise you will not regret your stay here. I loved how organized Julie had everything and my family will definitely be back.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even better in person!! The organization of the house, clear instructions, BEAUTIFUL barn and wedding venue right beside the house, and FANTASTIC communication! I will be booking my next trip back here!"

Sincerely,
Laura Brodeur"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rosie‚Äôs Retreat was such a nice place! Everything was just as listed. Very easy to find and such a nice neighborhood. House was so cozy and beautiful. And the beds were AMAZINGLY comfortable. Great place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rosie's is everything as described but so much more. This will be out go to place in Obion County from now on.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd time staying at one of Julie & David‚Äôs AirB&B, twice at Gloria‚Äôs on Exchange & once at Rosie‚Äôs Retreat. We love all the details and the extras that are provided, which makes traveling over 10+ hours lighter. They have thought of everything. Another great stay, & can‚Äôt wait until next time."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall good experience, I feel that the check out ‚Äúto do list‚Äù is a little excessive. I‚Äôm fairly clean person but I rather pay a higher cleaning fee then have to worry about taking out trash, cleaning the grill, and starting a load of laundry before I leave. Considering I‚Äôm probably already rushing with my 2 under 2 and trying to enjoy time away from mommy duties. But other than that host is very communicative, everything is as described, and the beds are comfortable. Only room with a TV is the living room and the sofa bed in the living room is pretty uncomfortable to sit on, so I probably wouldn‚Äôt want this to be a place I chose if I plan to be lounging around or wanting to lay in my bedroom and watch TV. Backyard is extremely nice and if you‚Äôre an outdoors person like myself the scenery, lights, fire pit, and grill make it worth it for me üòä"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Rosie's Retreat was described well. We had everything we needed for the one night.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and pleasant. We really enjoyed the patio area. I highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Exactly as explained. Read the book in the living room.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow. That‚Äôs the only word that comes to mind.
I stayed with my adult son and his family and the space was so homey, quaint and comfortable.
We immediately felt like kids when we saw the beautiful backyard fire pit with lighting‚Ä¶next to the wedding venue. I wish I would have booked a vacation here instead of a night.
The outdoor kitchen was vintage and made me want to have a gathering with family in the space.
The living room had a record player, lots of games and instruments. Perfect for my family of little musicians!
The kitchen serveware had vintage pieces that my daughter in law couldn‚Äôt wait to serve something from.
It was a magical place that could be a stand alone destination. You go there for the space.
Love, love, love.‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome place and relaxing
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and clean place! Was exactly as described.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay. Thank you
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The house was the most clean and organized house I‚Äôve ever been in. I love all the labels to know where things should go! Beautiful house and amazing accommodations. We will definitely be staying again! 11/10
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place was exactly what we were looking for. It was clean, peaceful, and had everything we needed, just like home. I was there for work purposes and wanted a quiet place to sleep after work, and this place fit the bill! If I need to go back, this is the place I'm staying at."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was very helpful throughout the whole process, she was a great communicator during my stay. Although she wasn‚Äôt intrusive whatsoever, Julie did check on our accommodations & as to whether anything may be possibly needed during the stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! I was there on work purposes but the house is perfect and that wedding venue is beautiful just from what I could see from the house.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Our host was very quick to respond when we needed anything or had questions. The place was easy to find while we were traveling back and forth to Martin. We would definitely stay there again.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Julie‚Äôs place was as described and very clean. Julie did advise of wedding event going on next door during stay and was proactive in providing times of event. Only downside was a lawn care team arrived day before at 7am to prep area and was very loud with leaf blowers and mowers. Hopefully the crew can begin at least after 8am in the future for other travelers.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy little home. Stocked with everything a guest would need. Host gave very detailed instructions which made the stay much more satisfying. And the back is absolutely beautiful. The host has put a lot of time, money, and thought into offering a great place to stay while visiting the area"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really great time, house was very clean and the it had a lot of different things for entertainment."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great fun little place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything about this place was amazing. Felt right at home. Unfortunately our last day here there was a massive flash flood that had me stuck at work so I couldn‚Äôt check out when I needed to.. Rosie was understanding and patient with me during the process. In my opinion it was one of the best Airbnbs I‚Äôve been too and an amazing host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Extremely clean, exactly as described. Could not have asked for a nicer place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable, clean and all around nice place to stay. The set up for outside entertaining and wedding parties was beautiful. We were there for just one night while passing through town. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my fianc√© and i loved this place! exactly like the pictures and very nice neighborhood!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very quant and clean place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rosie's Retreat was everything we hoped for....close to our activities, clean, VERY organized, and so quiet. Every little detail was considered and it is obvious that Rosie's was renovated with guest comfort and ultra convenience in mind. As someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen I was really impressed with the cabinet labels and the uncluttered, simple, yet well-thought out supplies were so appreciated. The colors in the reno were fun and coordinated and our teen girls loved the extra big mirrors in the back dressing room. Even though we didn't use the outdoor space too much since it was quite hot, I can imagine that at night with the string lights and friends would be magical. The beds were very comfortable for us and the quiet neighborhood certainly added to a good nights sleep."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay! I really enjoyed my time!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really loved the place and definitely would stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I had a great time at Rosie‚Äôs Retreat! The place was perfect for our adventures at Discovery Park of America! Super close to everything we wanted to do and see. Thank you Julie!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie‚Äôs place was amazing, felt right at home when staying here. This stay was clean, modern, and cozy! 10/10 would recommend for anyone staying in this area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This location was absolutely perfect! My stay here was a referral stay. My daughter had recently stayed a raved about the location and ease and flexibility of check in. It was everything she said it was.
If u looking for the perfect place look no more"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was welcoming and comfortable. Outdoor areas were perfect for relaxing and enjoying the evenings. Loved being able to cook meals rather than always dining out.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Perfect place for us to visit our family in Union City. The house is wonderfully outfitted with all we needed to feel at ‚Äúhome.‚Äù Treed and green backyard sitting area. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I have traveled all over the world and this is my favorite place I have ever stayed. Everything was so purr-fect!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such an adorable spot! My kids and I loved all the details and pictures of Rosie! It was a perfect place for our mini vacation and made us feel at home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and beautifully decorated home. Nice quiet neighborhood. Loved the backyard and the kitty named Justin that came to visit. I even saw raccoons walk down the path behind the house. Lots of song birds as well. Julie communicated well and even walked by to say hello. I really liked that we had a driveway to park in. The only suggestion I would make is to install handrails going down the back steps as they are a bit steep. I have a vestibular disorder and I struggled a bit with the back stairs to the patio. If the weather would have been cooler I would have enjoyed the fire pit. But the weather was perfect and I enjoyed just hanging out on the patio. Thank you Julie for the last minute reservation and accommodations. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rosie‚Äôs is a super cute place. We had a great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for your accommodations with us staying for Easter weekend. It was definitely cozy, relaxing, and easily accessible."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place really felt like home! the only thing I wish it had was a box fan or noise machine for sleeping. It's very quiet and if you're used to sleeping with a fan, you will definitely need to bring one. The back area seemed bigger in pictures and I didn't realize the walkway for historic ann's was so close to the hangout area but it wasn't an issue for us as there were no events during our stay. Our little family loved Rosie's and Justin the kitty is so sweet and lovable. We miss him already!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect for relaxation, calming, clean, attention to detail, extremely reasonable rates. We needed the peacefulness that this place offered."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and Rosie‚Äôs Retreat were both awesome! Will be staying again if we are back in the area, without a doubt."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was probably the best Air BnB experience. This place was amazing. All the details made it worth it. It was super comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Rosie‚Äôs Retreat was our first experience at an airbnb. We were quite pleasantly impressed with every aspect, from initial contact all the way through to checking out. The home is beautiful, even more so than the many pictures described. The entire team is most appreciated!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint, clean & comfortable place. Quiet, calm neigh- walkable to downtown. Plenty of local activities."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a really amazing place has anything and everything you need. Definitely will be back.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for my needs. Will stay here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a w9nderful time and really enjoyed the space!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely one of the best hosts, and facilitates we have stayed at. I highly recommend staying at Rosie‚Äôs!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was traveling with 3 teenagers - they enjoyed the stay as much as I did. Very clean and inviting. Incredibly responsive hosts.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable house. Wonderful hosts. Great neighborhood.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I traveled a lot for work. This place was the most comfortable house that I stayed in for 6 months. The host is really nice and the location was perfect for me
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place. Love the house and yard.
Great for family"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Host was perfect. Could not ask for anything more. Loved the house. Thank you
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay here was a delight. Everything is very well thought out. Unfortunately, it was too cold to take advantage of the outdoor facilities, but they look fantastic."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay with an amazing location and backyard. It has so many things included in it that one would assume would be in a 250$ a night stay but everything was perfect.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie is so kind and quick to respond. We absolutely loved the house and so did the fur babies. Being able to bring our animals was a huge thing for us, and there is plenty of room for them to potty and they even leave poo bags for you! You have everything you need plus more. The outside is amazing and the house was spotless. Will definitely return if ever back in the area! 10/10 recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cute place to stay and very well stocked!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rosie's retreat is perfect. Neat, clean, simple, stylish, convenient to everything. They've thought of everything...even down to their own brand of coffee and tea!! We didn't get to use the outdoor area but it is amazing and great for celebrating. Soft linens and comfy beds - wish we could've stayed longer!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the best experiences with Airbnb I‚Äôve had. Julie was SO flexible (I‚Äôm talking letting us switch to a different one of her properties after I realized the first one wouldn‚Äôt be ideal for our sleeping situation). Rosie‚Äôs Retreat was the type of house I wished I lived in. Chic and comfortable in every way. Communication was amazing. The vibe felt comfortable and relaxed. And the location was exactly where we wanted to be. She even threw in tickets to the discovery park of America. Overall, we couldn‚Äôt have dreamed of a better experience. If anyone opts to stay anywhere else in the area, they are just missing out. We cannot wait to be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved it. Especially the sitting area outside. Super convenient to Discovery Park.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was very close to Gloria on Exchange which made it really nice to stay close to other guest
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The house was great. The outdoor space was awesome and we had a wonderful stay. Would stay again
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"AMAZING stay! My now husband and members of our wedding party stayed in this house as a part of our wedding weekend and it was EXACTLY what we needed! very clean and organized, and they even had board games for super fun game night, unwind timeüíï 10/10 recommend, ESPECIALLY if you're getting married at or are a part of a wedding at Historic Ann's 1893"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed with Julie several times at different properties and it‚Äôs always on point! I recommend staying if you‚Äôre in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little home in the heart of Union City. Lot's to do in and around town or to just hang around and enjoy the fire pit and outdoor setting.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love everything about it! The way the house was decorated was awesome. The back yard was so nice we spent every evening listening to the sounds of nature. It was very nicely located to the city. Everything was close to the house. The bed and furniture were comfortable. I felt like I was home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I wish we would have stayed longer. This place felt just like home ! Thank you so much for sharing it with us!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed the stay at Rosies Retreat. Everything was labeled and easy to find. We had everything we needed and more. It was so clean and decorated so cute. We will definitely choose this home to stay at the next time we come into town.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Rosie's Retreat while we visited Discovery Park of America. It has all the amenities you could want and more. We will definitely stay here again when in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As I type this review no words can come to mind to describe how great Julie was as host. So I‚Äôll leave a rating
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Julie is a wonderful host. We have stayed twice with her and both experiences have be great! This time we stayed at Rosie‚Äôs retreat which was an adorable little house with a great backyard area that we utilized every day of our stay! The location is near many local restaurants and the the Discovery Park of America which is worth the visit. Would definitely stay here again. . . Also we hope Stevie is doing well!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location was beautiful as well as the surrounding area! The house was very clean and set up with everything we could need for the stay. It was also located very close to local food and attractions. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the memories!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! Located in a beautiful Historical area. So peaceful and quiet! Enjoyed sitting and rocking on the porch. I definitely be back soon.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I enjoyed my stay the house is very comfortable and Julie welcomes her guests with a cute sign as you walk in which I thought was very thoughtful and nice. I would recommend staying here anytime.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, everyone had a good time and the airbnb was comfortable and accommodated a last minute request to add a member of our group."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay! Peaceful, relatively close to Lake Realfoot. Very clean home."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie and Dave were very responsive to our needs. They are great hosts and we will for sure stay with them again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julie was fantastic! Very helpful, and has the cutest home! She has the most adorable accommodations as well!
The neighbors were our absolute only issue. Around 5am, I woke up to screaming and fighting between a man and a woman. I mean VIOLENTLY screaming so much, with a ton of curse words. It stopped for about 15 mins, then started again. This went on for almost an hour. We had one of our 11 yrs olds with us, so it was honestly awful to listen to.
With that being said, I hate that the neighbors created an issue, because this home was perfect otherwise!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Her place is very homie and comfortable. Very clean and spacious.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really good place for one night for four people. Had all the amenities, including soap and cooking items. Cleanliness was great. Main room is bigger in person than photos show. Overall 5/5 stars for price and quality."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,it was a great place to house our group. The area was spacious and felt like home. There was clear and helpful instructions and recommendations. highly recommended!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Super clean and spacious. The beds were so comfortable. The pictures don't do this place justice. I will definitely stay here again! Thanks again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location and amenities were exactly as described. It is a very nice, well kept home and it had more ""extras"" then I have had in the past. Checking in and out was easy, I had a few questions and Julie responded quickly. There is a large area next to home where my animals could run around. The neighbors behind that lot were very nice. The neighbors to the immediate right of the house were questionable with their rotating door all weekend however they kept to themselves and their guests did also. I never felt unsafe here. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows, blankets. There was even mood lighting in the living room and electric fireplaces. Very nice, thank you."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"All the sleeping accommodations were comfortable, and it was very nice having access to a pack n play and high chair. The house is definitely not baby proof though - we had to move a lot of pottery and trinkets so our toddlers wouldn‚Äôt get them. The checkout tasks are pretty extensive for the price you pay, plus already paying a cleaning fee."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Union City!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A nice spot to land and relax for what we needed it for! Good communication from host and no issues with amenities. Neighbors and their dog were loud late into the night. Other than that, no complaints."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a medical emergency & wasn‚Äôt able to stay the night. But the house was so nice. Clean, comfy, & host was very responsive."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Gloria‚Äôs Exchange.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thank you
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience and we would definitely stay there again!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Really enjoyed my stay here. The home was nice and clean with lots of space. It‚Äôs located close to restaurants and shopping stores which Julie has listed in a pamphlet . Hosts were the nicest people and very welcoming!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,‚ÄúGOE‚Äù was a great place for us to stay while visiting family in the area. Loved the photos. Clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home felt much larger when I first entered it than the photo's. So if you are traveling with more than 2 people there is plenty of space for privacy and not feeling cramped.
The main reason I booked this home was that it was Dog Friendly and Affordable! I have a 13 yr old lil lady who I didn't want to leave behind. She enjoyed the big yard and quiet neighborhood.
The location is in a historic part of town that was quiet for the most part. There is a house right next to this one noise carried, but nothing major.
If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay that is centrally located to so many places, then this is for you. Be sure to visit Reelfoot Lake and just drive around the country roads. Food for your soul!
It has all the comforts of home. The Main bed was very comfortable which I was pleasantly surprised! : )
If possible I'd suggest bringing your own pillows though. I drove so I had the options of packing more than if you are flying.
I'd def rebook again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Extremely nice place. Convenient to get to anywhere around Union City. Plenty of off the street parking
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here several years now- it is always a great trip! The house is cozy and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"awesome place, very quiet neighborhood"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a very good place to relax after a long trip...
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly like how it‚Äôs described online. It‚Äôs even better bc of the great price and the quiet neighborhood it‚Äôs located at. It is run by very trustworthy and nice people. I left my wallet there without realizing. Julie went out of her way to make sure I can get it back quickly and securely. I totally recommend this place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Union City. House was in a Historic neighborhood. Such a beautiful area with leaves falling and the crisp cool air of fall. Enjoyed sitting and rocking on the front porch. Our stay was so relaxing and the house was so comfortable and clean. Beds oh my goodness so comfortable. Fully furnished with everything we needed staying there. Will definitely stay there again.
Mary"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had one balmy night to enjoy porch and quaint neighborhood‚Ä¶.but a cold day didn‚Äôt ruin a quiet night of playing games inside and using the fireplace heaters for extra warmth and ambiance üôÇ
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria's on Exchange is the perfect location in Union City, near Discovery Park of America and a 30 minute drive to Reelfoot lake. Extremely clean relaxing environment, with subtle design features. The queen size bed was comfortable. The kitchen well supplied for a family of 2 or 4. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evenings. Highly recommend if visiting this area for work or pleasure."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very clean and comfortable stay. Real kind folks.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julie's place was one of our favorite stays ever! We love hiking and National Parks, so we were completely delighted with the home's theme (wall art of her and David's travels to National Parks). Additionally, the handmade wood furniture and locally crafted pottery made GOE a special place that we want to visit again.
Parents of littles will want to know:
-Julie put nightlights in every room!
-Yes, there are many breakable things, but also a great closet where you can stash them (with sliding door that my toddler couldn't open). We put their guitar away the moment we got there, but if you're a musical family, you'll love having the instruments!
-house has washer/dryer AND detergent; bathrooms have shampoo/conditioner/body wash
-bathrooms have great medicine cabinets if you need to keep things out of reach of kids (or just like a clear vanity space on vacation!)
-bring your own plastic plates/sippy cups if you need those
-As a family of 4, we didn't need the extra room that is optional
-You are within walking distance of one Union City Kiwanis park and a 5-minute drive from Graham park (where our boys got out all sorts of energy!). We LOVED hiking at Reelfoot Lake and exploring and seeing eagles at the National Wildlife Refuge there (30-minutes away) and our boys (7 and 3) loved Discovery Park of America (5 minutes away). Our Pink Palace membership in Memphis got us into Discovery Park for free (so ask if you have memberships in other cities that might have reciprocity).
-Plenty of convenient take-out in the town.
We packed a lot into a 4-day trip. I think we'll stay longer next time!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You know this property was exactly what we needed. It was very well put together there wasn‚Äôt anything that we needed that we did not have and Julie was an amazing host and a great communicator. The property isn‚Äôt too much and isn‚Äôt too little it was perfect. My husband enjoyed playing on their guitar and I enjoyed the view from the porch. I really enjoyed our stay only thing I can say went wrong and it more than likely was an operator error is we weren‚Äôt able to leave our photo and add to their collection. Lol maybe I will mail them one! I would definitely recommend a stay here and it‚Äôs a very reasonable cost

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at GOE! The host was easy to communicate with and answered all questions/concerns. Everything was clean and well stocked. Google Home was neat but a little creepy with the automatic locks haha. Check in and check out was a breeze. My only concern was that the beds weren‚Äôt very comfortable. The queen bed was a little better than the twin beds but they weren‚Äôt the best. Due to this i don‚Äôt know if i would suggest staying longer than a couple days. Other than that, I had a great experience."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you enjoy small towns and have memories of visiting grandparents or growing up in white framed houses with wood floors and neighbors close by, you'll step into a relaxing and simpler time when you enter Gloria's on Exchange. But unlike Grandma's house, everything is functional and modernized and very comfortable as well. We enjoyed time with extended family here, restful beds, playing ""42"" (a Texas domino game) around the kitchen table, and listening to the heavy rain fall outside the windows our first night. The kitchen was very functional, bathrooms were conveniently located in each bedroom, and the central heat/air made everything very pleasant. If we're ever in Union City again, I hope GOE will be available to transport us once again to a relaxing escape from our hectic and stressful lives. I'm sure it will do the same for you!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Gloria‚Äôs on Exchange! Julie and David are great hosts. The home was very clean and stocked with what we needed. The twin beds in the second bedroom are wonderful for families traveling with young kids. Check in and check out was a breeze. We loved the tablet and Google Home connectivity. Julie and David have also provided some instruments for guests to enjoy- that was a special treat! We will definitely stay there next time we‚Äôre in Union City.

Smells fresh, has plenty of space, plenty of room, great cold AC and all the amenities are in the kitchen that you will need to prepare meals. Large enough space for a big family, with gathering areas, cozy corners, comfy blankets, and throws, the beds were amazing, soft and fluffy. We slept really well. The house is easy to get to, on the corner in a very quiet and private neighborhood. It was such a great stay. Shopping near by, restaurants and fast food close too. We enjoyed The Grande restaurant, and Tori‚Äôs suggestion for local places were such a helpful addition to our plans.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Annabelle's to set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience. I've stayed in Airbnb rentals as part of family trips but have yet to secure one myself. We usually stay at a local hotel when visiting family in the area. However, I was preparing a celebratory dinner and needed a kitchen for this visit. I was impressed by how responsive and kind Mary communicated with me. This home is easy to find and is located in a lovely part of Union City. A grocery store, Walgreens, a pizza joint, and a Mexican restaurant are within a brief walk. The home is well-appointed and tastefully furnished. The king bed in the ensuite was comfortable. The house was spotlessly clean!!! We had an elderly dog and a six-month-old pup with us. The fenced backyard was a huge plus. The kitchen was well equipped with newer pots and pans of all sizes. I was able to prepare my special meal with no difficulties. We most definitely recommend this rental, and we plan to return in the future."

Annabelle‚Äôs was perfect in every way, and yes it was truly a blessing! It‚Äôs clean, comfortable, close to everything, it‚Äôs just like home. My brother & sister were arriving a day before me & they were running late, so Mary turned the light on so that the would not have to arrive in the dark. They were so very thankful for that kind gesture & that‚Äôs the very kind of thing that makes Annabelle‚Äôs a special place. If I ever have the need to stay in Union City, I will check Annabelle‚Äôs first. If you‚Äôve never stayed at an Airbnb, and you‚Äôre hesitant, don‚Äôt be. You‚Äôll never regret staying there!! Thank you for making our stay extra special‚ô•Ô∏è"

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The stay with Brandy started out well but there were complications and miscommunication that resulted in a other than enjoyable experience. Overall as a host Brandy is a great host but the way the Airbnb and complications were handled by her resulted in a disconnect and caused the handyman to be out of the loop and caused issues. Therefore, the main handling of things by both hosts wasn‚Äôt as well as expected. It would have been preferred to have better communication entirely and to be able to feel that our needs were being met regarding that. The stay overall was okay. It would have just been better if there was more communication."

Two points to the potential guest - there is no door on the bedroom, and the door to the bathroom (sliding) doesn't totally cover the opening. My kids would yell, ""I'm going to the bathroom, no one go to the hallway"" to make sure they had privacy."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and so cute. Very classic AirBnB feel. The only things we didn‚Äôt like was the 2nd bed was on the floor and the only access to it was through the only bathroom.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family of 6 was very comfortable. There was plenty of room and space. We had privacy and the birds and squirrels playing was relaxing for some.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We took the entire family back to where they grew up for their Grandmothers Birthday. I will never stay anywhere else when we go back there. It was just like we were home. We were so comfortable there. I‚Äôve never stayed in a place with so many little ‚Äúextra‚Äù thoughts lying around. So many special little added touches from new toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and body wash to even makeup remover cloths. Such thoughtful little extras! The house was so big and roomy and enough areas that everyone could spread out and get some peace to themselves!
The master bed was so comfy. The decor is just perfect for the Cottage House.
The Master bath along with the adorable back patio was what drew me to that rental and although it was cold and we didn‚Äôt get to take advantage of the patio, the big soaking Jacuzzi tub made up for the cold weather.
Communication with Katie was so easy and she made sure we had everything we needed during our stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this house justice. It is absolutely beautiful and Katie was the perfect host. She was so very helpful , kind, and had everything you would ever need for your stay. The house was clean and the beds were comfortable. I would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a spacious home with plenty of sitting room.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie is the best host I‚Äôve had to date! She was incredibly communicative and thorough. Her place is such a cute cottage home, with tons of space. It was immaculately clean. I loved how she had all sorts of toiletries in case you forgot something. But above all, her place was perfect for us to call home for our wedding weekend. The perfect backdrop for my bridesmaids to get ready. We look forward to staying here again when we come back to town!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Katie's house made the trip to visit the soon to be new in-laws stress-free. We loved how cute the house was, how clean it was, it smelled absolutely incredible, and was extremely comfortable. I loved the little courtyard that she has on the side of the house attached to the very neat lawn. Katie's communication made this trip so easy, and she was very quick to help accommodate any question or need. When we travel, we like privacy and comfort, and we received exactly that. We really enjoyed the homieness of the kitchen and the whirlpool tub. Her house has so much character and charm. The only thing that we had to keep an eye on was the thermostat resets to her schedule about every 2 hours and we visited on the most humid and hot weekend I have ever experienced, so we were avidly checking that. We stayed cool the entire time, Katie helped us figure out the pattern, so don't panic, all systems work perfectly. Katie was an excellent host and we will absolutely be back."

with lots of original character that make it special. She has everything you need to feel at home. The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood that is only about half a mile from downtown with shops and a nice park where I took my 3 year old.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I were absolutely amazed with the home. Ms. Katie had little post it notes to help with knowing where things were. It was really nice. The home was extremely welcoming and felt like home. We had fun looking through pictures she had posted throughout the home that really made it feel like home. The upgrades to the home are fantastic. Communication with her was simple and easy.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Yal, book this place! Our family of six visited for the weekend to play at the Discovery Park. Katies‚Äô house is unique and full of charm. It is much roomier than it appears in photos and the main living room is separate from the bedrooms if your littles go to bed early. It had all the extra accommodations ready to make our stay the most enjoyable. It‚Äôs a very close drive to restaurants and the Discovery Park in quiet neighborhood. I will be recommending this place to all my family/friends. Thank you again Katie!"

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There are not many places to stay in Union City so this was perfect for 3 of us. Much better than staying in a motel.
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie's home was perfect for our needs. It is spacious and has everything you could need for an extended stay. Union City is a special place and Katie did a great job with the information she left us about the area. The house is close to everything while at the same time on a quiet residential street.

2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This worked great for a short visit with my parents and my seven-year-old. The house was clean and spacious with lots of natural light. The neighborhood was very quiet, but close to the highway we needed to visit family nearby. Katie was friendly, knowledgeable about the area, and quick to reply to all my questions. I would certainly stay here again."
,,,"The house is adorable and decoreated very cute but the moment I walked in, I could smell mold. I didnt get much sleep because the smell was that bad to me....I hate to give a bad review but I think others should know, because its not healthy to breath mold...
Its a shame because it is such a cute adorable house, but I could never stay there again due to the unhealthy environment. Im not sure if these types of rentals are inspected but they sure need to be before they are allowed to be rented."
