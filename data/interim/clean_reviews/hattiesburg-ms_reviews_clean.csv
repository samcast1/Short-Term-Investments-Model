2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very pretty room, with an equally nice neighborhood and backyard to enjoy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts thought of everything to make their guests comfortable.
Joel and Matthew were the friendliest hosts we ever met. It was an impeccable place from the inside to the outside. The backyard was a peaceful oasis with a pond and waterfall. We will stay here again when we come to town. We have recommended this gorgeous place to our local family as well and they will pass the word on to their friends and faculty when they have out of town guests."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joel & Matthew’s spot was even more impressive in person. Beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and cozy. The backyard common area is resort quality and very relaxing. A perfect gem!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the time of our booking, through our stay and until checkout, both Joel & Matthew were professional, outgoing and always willing to assist my spouse and I. Prior to arrival, I realized that we needed to make an adjustment to our reservation of which they understood and promptly approved. Prior to arrival, we were provided with very thorough checkin guidance. Upon arrival, Joel saw my spouse unloading our luggage and without hesitation, assisted, engaged in conversation and informed us of festivities for the night. Over the course of our stay, we met both Joel & Matthew’s Mothers as well as extended family. They were filled with warmth and very outgoing as well. The Airbnb is cozy, felt like a home away from home, stocked with everything you need if you would like to cook. The bed slept so good, one day we skipped out on our prearranged plans and just slept in. The shower/bath is great with awesome water pressure and temperature. We truly felt at home. Thanks Joel & Matthew."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always as described
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked this spot last-minute & the hosts were fantastic at responding quickly and were very communicative. I'm SO GLAD we stayed here! It was exactly as described. Very clean & super comfortable. They had everything we needed to make our morning tea-the kitchen is a great space. The bed was comfy, the furniture was nice & the small space didn't feel cluttered at all. It's even nicer than the photos! The back shared patio is beautiful & the pond will be a masterpiece when finished (it's totally enjoyable already!) The neighborhood is so so cute, with tons of historic homes. It was very quiet (they are close to train tracks, & we did hear one train probably around 8 pm. They provide ear plugs if you need it). We used the historic home walking tour map & made our way around their neighborhood the next morning. It was a very safe spot & it was beautiful & quaint-I would totally stay here again. A decent hotel room is the same cost and this place is a million times better!"

Fingers crossed this property is available next time I am in town :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very classy and clean apartment. Bed slept well, nice sheets and pillows. The kitchen was really nicely furnished (not just a motley collection of mismatched dishes) had everything I needed. The clean water and bottle of wine was a nice and appreciated inclusion.
I appreciated access to laundry.
The backyard is going to be an oasis once it's finished!
I can see this property becoming quite the neighborhood gem once they've completed the backyard!
Highly recommended."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Where to even start? If I could give Joel, Matthew, and their carriage house accommodation 10 stars, it still would not be enough. First of all, as soon as we arrived, Joel came out to help us with our luggage. Once upstairs, he showed us around and answered any questions. The carriage house was so well-appointed and had so many extras (wine in refrigerator, packs of instant oatmeal and soups). The place was spotless, expertly designed and decorated. We joined Joel and Matthew for wine and conversation outside and have just never had an Airbnb experience as delightful. Within an hour’s time, we felt as though we were old friends."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joel and Matthew’s place was amazing. It was so beautiful and they thought of everything. We were only there for one night but I wish we could have stayed longer. It was in a safe neighborhood with a beautiful yard and we felt right at home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough great things about Joel & Matthew as hosts, & their place. They truly thought of everything to make you feel right at home, yet still on a vacation. As you enter the backyard entrance, it feels like you're in a private island oasis .. absolutely beautiful work in progress. You can tell they take so much pride in their home, we LOVED all the creative & festive decorations. 🎃👻 Had absolutely everything we needed. Location is PERFECT for anywhere you need to go & they gave EXCELLENT recommendations for food & fun.
Wouldn't stay anywhere else if/when we are in the area again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I needed a safe and comfortable place to stay overnight. We were so blessed to find this gem. The hosts are friendly and courteous. The landscaping is gorgeous. You really can tell the owners care about their surroundings and the people they meet. The place was very clean and decorated tastefully. Also, there was the cutest little ghost in the bathroom on the toilet who greeted you with funny sayings. I got a kick out of it. I absolutely loved the design. Each time I looked around, I discovered something unique. The bed was amazing!!! I slept so well. These hosts are so thoughtful and gracious. I would definitely recommend this place to others. A big thanks to Joel and Matthew for a wonderful stay. My daughter and I had a great time. Their place was a God send for us!"

The guesthouse itself is a serene retreat, meticulously crafted with comfort and relaxation at the forefront of its design. The bed was a cloud of bliss, providing some of the most restful nights I've experienced in my travels. It was the perfect place to retreat to after a day of work, offering a peaceful space to unwind and recharge.
Joel and Matthew, thank you for sharing your beautiful space and incomparable hospitality. I will certainly be back when I'm in the area again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joel & Matthew’s place was incredible! The perfectly setup studio had everything you could ask for. It was clean, roomy, cozy, quiet and beautifully decorated. The backyard pond added some unique flare to the stay. On top of all that, Joel & Matthew were extremely welcoming and a delight to talk to. If I’m ever back in Hattiesburg, this is where I’d look to stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was amazing. Walkable to downtown, and Joel and Matthew gave great recommendations of where to go. Everything was well worth the price - from the cottage itself to the neighborhood. We cant wait to come back and visit again"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a great experience. So much attention to detail and extra touches. It was a fantastic trip with a cozy place to stay with so much to do within walking distance. 10/10 and we will be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this place. The attention to detail was actually insane. Almost everything here seemed to have a purpose and was exceptionally clean. It was so nice, actually, that I felt bad only using it to shower and sleep instead of bringing a partner, which seems to be what this place is really meant for. Overall, awesome!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about this stay was superb. Great communication from the owners. They went out of their way to fulfill a special parking request we had. The place was extremely comfortable and clean. Great amenities. Will stay there again when passing through Hattiesburg
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot adequately express how very much we enjoyed staying in this wonderful place!
We were in dire need of some comfortable and peaceful R&R and this beautiful and luxurious carriage house checked EVERY box...plus some we'd never have expected. It was a cool oasis away from some pretty intense Mississippi summer heat. It was cozy and spacious with plenty of room to relax and watch some TV on the amazing large screened television. The kitchen was far more than adequate and fully equipped. Finally, I must mention THE BED! It was FABULOUS; adjustable and just the right hybrid of soft yet firm with very soft bedding. We slept better than we even do in our own home!
It was, hands down, one of our top 3 Airbnb stays EVER!
Thank you gentlemen for your warm hospitality and attention to even the smallest detail to make your guests stay a pleasant...and memorable one!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. It is beautiful and looks exactly like the pictures. Joel and Matthew are awesome hosts!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated and a super clean carriage house. Hosts thought of every thing…we loved the idea of disposable earplugs in a cute jar by the bed for the spouse of a snorer. Hosts were very thoughtful. We had bad weather blow through and they offered to bring us candles in case we lost power. We felt very welcomed and hope they will have availability the next time we visit Hattiesburg.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just the right getaway.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. The bed is comfy, they had snacks, fruit, nice robes, nice soaps in the bathroom. The location was great, the check in was easy. It better than we even expected. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful and great location! We will definitely be back soon!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely perfect for us. My sister and I stayed 1 night here after seeing a comedy show at the Saenger in downtown. The location was great. Safe, quiet neighborhood, but also very close to downtown area. Joel and Matthew were EXCELLENT hosts. They had wine waiting in our room, lots of coffee/creamer which is huge for me, and the place was simply gorgeous. It’s just like the pictures. The bed was so soft and everything was squeaky clean! They made us cookies and were such a pleasure to be around. They have exciting plans for their home and Airbnb and we hope to come back one day and see it all come to life."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was by far the nicest and cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Joel & Matthew are fantastic hosts with the cutest place! Can’t recommend my entire experience enough!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I've stayed in many Airbnb's over the years and this is BY FAR THE NICEST!!! My only regret was I was there for only one night. I will definitely return.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved every minute of our day. We arrived very late night and I wish we coulda got there sooner to enjoy it longer!!! Joel and Matthew’s place is absolutely gorgeous. Every single detail. Though I didn’t get to enjoy the complementary wine this time with being pregnant, I enjoyed some snacks and lots of water! The robes added a nice touch, the bed was so very comfortable, everything was squeaky clean, 10/10 recommend and will 100% be back. We loved the area so much! And the concept of the garage with lofted apartment above it is awesome and we will most definitely be utilizing this idea on the new acreage we just bought to live in while we build the main quarters. Also visited south bound bagels after departing our day and it was a MUST. Looking forward to coming back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joel and Matthew were great hosts! Upon arrival they greeted us and made recommendations to local restaurants. I needed to print a paper and they went out of their way to help me out and print it for me in their home! The Airbnb was beautiful and extremely cozy. I highly recommend staying here!!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There really should be a special category for hosts like Joel and Matthew, and property like their beautiful Carriage House. From the clear and easy to follow instructions to the top-quality ammenities, this was easily the best Airbnb we've stayed at in the eight years/20 times we've used Airbnb.
We arrived after dark to lights on in the apartment and the air conditioning on. There were baskets of snacks on the counter and cold bottles of water in the fridge. And I can't believe I'm going to mention this - but the toilet paper was the good kind (not the cheap stuff usually provided at other places)! Wooden clothes hangers, shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower, thick and fluffy towels, plush robes, soft bed sheets...it's evident these hosts want the best for their guests and are willing to spend the extra money to make them feel special. And we did.
BOOK THIS CARRIAGE HOUSE! You will love every moment of your stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an incredible stay.. Hands down the best air bnb we have ever stayed at. Joel and Matthew have went out of their way to create the most welcoming, beautiful space. They have every amenity thinkable and everything felt so luxurious! Highly highly recommend staying here. Will absolutely be back if ever coming though the area again ❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joel and Matthew are so hospitable and friendly! They thought of everything! There were fresh bottles of water in the frig when we arrived, fresh fruit, snacks, oatmeal for breakfast in case we had not shopped... and a bottle of white and a bottle of red wine awaited on the counter! The linens were clean and crisp, in a most comfortable king size adjustable bed with comfortable pillows. The towels were fresh and clean and they included bath robes! We were so pleasantly surprised at all the details that were thoughtfully considered. They offered to bring us breakfast. They brought us dessert. One night we socialized on their patio and had a blast! Our experience was one of luxury in a homey, beautiful space perched high on the 2nd floor of their detached garage; it was as if we were in a finely decorated tree house! When you open the door this lovely space filled with amenities awaits you! They respect your privacy and it is up to you if you choose interaction...just a great experience!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is beautiful and the amphitryons are the best in the area. If I could stay longer I would, too bad I had the dates busy. Plus, it's a place that's very private."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Joel & Matthew are phenomenal hosts. They have created an amazing boutique hotel experience in a beautiful studio space. The bed is comfortable, the towels and linens are finest quality, the amenities provide a home-away-from-home experience, and the design of the space is flawless. The outdoor area is as comfortable and inviting as the Carriage House itself and they continue to make improvements. Inside, there is a beautiful view in each direction and you're at tree top level providing the best of scenery. Joel & Matthew went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable and memorable, giving me tips and directions on how to navigate my way around Hattiesburg. They made great suggestions as far as dining and shopping, and the Carriage House is within walking distance of a beautiful park, the historic downtown, and just a stroll from beautiful home after beautiful home (including their own). It's truly a relaxing and unforgettable experience at a price that can't be matched."

We were very comfortable throughout our stay- we loved the soft bedsheets, plush towels, and the couch was so comfortable we could have slept there too! It was great to see that both bedrooms had ceiling fans and the blackout curtains and nightstands with outlets/charging ports were a great touch.
The entire unit was immaculately clean and we appreciated having a kitchen with a dining area. The water pressure in the shower is great and having the ability to wash clothes in the unit was a bonus.

Kitchen space was awesome for cooking and there’s a washer & dryer which is convenient. Location is walking distance to tue zoo and a coffee shop (we didn’t visit the coffee shop unfortunately).

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is small but not really th,t tiny - and Amber has packed a lot into it. Comfortable bed well-stocked kitchen, two (!) televisions, big sofa - even a washer and dryer. I did not make use of the front porch and chairs, but they're there if you want them. And there's plenty of parking space right i n front of the house. Amber provides a Keurig with coffee and bottles of water (which you really need to constantly carry in the Mississippi heat) and bags of popcorn to enjoy while watching TV. Amber's place is one of the better airbnb's out there, and as a first-time visitor to the South, I was delighted by her Southern hospitality. Don't hesitate to book this place. It's clean, quiet, comfortable, and Amber is an excellent hostess."

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time staying at Amber’s tiny home!

I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Hattiesburg!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've never stayed in a tiny house before. It was quite roomy with sufficient room to walk around as well as having a good size bedroom and bath. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom amenities were good along with the soft bath towels.
The private yard was really great! There were string lights so it was well lighted.
The front porch was so nice as it rained for most of the day but i was able to sit outside.
Because it was pet friendly, Amber even had pet bowls waiting!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Tiny House is truly an Oasis. It felt like it was very rural, but it was only a few minutes from everything Hattiesburg has to offer, many restaurants and shopping. It was quiet and very clean. Even though it’s a tiny house, it felt very spacious. All of the furniture was placed in a layout that the space feels maximized. The shower heated up very fast and had great water pressure. The bed is very comfortable. Very eclectic and had a record player that we cranked up. There is a tv in the living room and the bedroom. There is even an area completely fenced in for your pup and a small fire pit. Washer and dryer in the unit. Full size refrigerator and dishwasher. There was a coffee selection and snacks. Hosts were fantastic and friendly and very responsive. We come to H’burg often and will be booking this property in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this 1948 vintage camper. Lauren was a great host, very quick to communicate and respond to questions. We were concerned about an issue with our car battery and Lauren arranged for someone to be there in the morning to jump it if our car didn't start. The camper was clean and had everything necessary for a couple of nights including a powerful air conditioner. There isn't a burner for cooking (for boiling water) but this wasn't an issue for us since the mini oven has multiple functions. It was peaceful sitting on the front porch in the wooded setting where we enjoying coffee in the morning and wine at night. The location is great being near the highway yet not too noisy. Fantastic little place for us to relax between our travel from TN to FL. Very good value as well."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The quality of the remodel was excellent! The arrangement of the tiny home was very good; two comfortable chairs and the kingsize bed was really comfortable. I wish we had more time to spend setting on the porch! There are four tiny homes and they would be great for multiple couples to have their own place. If you're in the area looking for a place to stay and like tiny homes, this is your place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is so fun! We were able to fit a pack and play inside for our baby.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice set up
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute, private campers. Very clean and comfortable. Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute little place for a weekend getaway! Love the retro style. Bed was super comfortable. Area was really peaceful and quiet but only minutes to the city. Would be a great place to have family rent some of the other campers because there are lots of covered places to sit and enjoy the outside. Keep in mind that it’s a camper, so the shower is small and not for tall folks. Didn’t bother us any for a short stay. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The wife and I came down for a mini vacation and this was just off the beaten path! Close to everything. Will stay here again next time we’re there!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This camper is so cute and I wished that I could have stayed all weekend because of how peaceful it was. The shower felt amazing and the space may be tiny but it didn’t feel like it one bit.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,another great stay!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place. Was small, maybe different chairs. We did have issue with parking, the place below us seemed to take up the parking spots. The coffee pot leaked water so we could not use it.
Maybe a heater in the bathroom. With door shut it was freezing in there.
Maybe steps up to the camper from the driveway, especially since it did rain.
Overall I would stay again, the price is great and it’s a cute idea.
Lauren is very attentive."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing space. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a quite, small place to work, relax or simply get away from the usual hustle and bustle.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great price for such a nice place. This was the perfect stopover on our road trip. We really appreciated having a king bed and residential toilet in a camper. It was also amazing to have both heat and air conditioning, as well as the large TV. Check-in and out was so easy, and the whole area was clean, quiet, and well kept."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cute place for our little stay in Hattiesburg. It was exactly what we needed! The area that all the air streams are in is very peaceful and secluded. Lauren was also very quick to respond to questions which was extremely helpful!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying in Lauren's vintage airstream is something I have always wanted to do! The location is perfect, close to the main highway but amazingly with no traffic noise. The bed slept wonderful and the airstream was more than cool enough with the air conditioner. The restoration craftsmanship and attention to detail was appreciated by us since we have just finished building our own home ourselves! Would have loved to try the pool out but was limited on our time. We certainly want to return and try EACH airstream.. thanks Lauren for a unique and enjoyable stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One for the bucket list. The quaint tiny camper nestled it the woods was quite, clean, and just an overall great experience. Super cold A/C. 5 minutes from anywhere you want to go in Hattiesburg. We had a great time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The camper is just as it looks in the pictures. Clean, comfortable glamping at its best. Felt very at home in my little camper. Spent most of my time on the giant covered porch working at the picnic table. Under the porch and trees it stays shaded and just a little breeze keeps it nice.
Location is easy to find and short drive to surrounding areas."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot for our stopover night. Quaint 1948 Spartanette, refurbished beautifully, and set in a quiet spot. Well appointed, very comfortable, and clean. Our family booked all 3 Airstreams for the night. Great experience!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great quaint location & exactly what we needed for our stay over while in town for a wedding!
It’s in the country and super quiet! So quiet you can hear natures many sounds! Not too many places you can get out far enough and it be that quiet to enjoy those sounds!
It’s roughly 10-15 mins to an area with lots of restaurants & things to do.
Had everything we needed with a comfy bed! The only rough part was the shower. Great shower just a lil right for a 5’11” big guy!
Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay all the way around.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We LOVED it! Looks exactly like the photos and loved the location. Lauren was great to work with and we would definitely stay here again. One of our favorite AirBnB stays ever!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay very much. It was quiet, and the perfect place to just get away from it all for a couple of days."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved the place. The pictures are exactly what it looks like. Alittle misleading on the height of the place so if you’re taller than 510 be ready to duck for most of it. But despite that we would definitely come back! Beautiful sun rise and wonderfully peaceful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, great experience, worth the visit!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit and we will be back each time we are in town to visit family.

Thanks again for accommodating our family and two pups!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lauren Cate’s place is amazing! We had a relaxing evening with beautiful lodging and quiet location. The bed is so comfortable and coffee in the morning! I highly recommend staying in these fun and trendy airstreams.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Because of the covered deck and picnic table that come with the place, this offers a lot for the money. It is a well designed array of campers connected by a roofed deck and be-decked with cheerful lighting. Inside the camper was clean and well designed. We like glamping experiences, and this is one of the more cozy and communal that we have seen. We would definitely stay here again."

We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you for making Mother’s Day 2024 spectacular — with memories, we will cherish a lifetime."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed staying in Chae’s lovely home! It was the perfect location, close to restaurants and all the main things to do in town. It was easy to get to both USM and WCU. The home is located in a mature, quiet, well-established neighborhood, and we felt extremely safe and at right home as soon as we arrived. My 17-month-old enjoyed being able to run around the well-maintained backyard after a long day of driving. From snacks, coffee, a welcome note with wine, and games galore - there were so many special touches that made us feel special. When we come back to Hattiesburg, Chae’s place is certainly first on our list of places to stay. Thank you for having us!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was extremely impressed with the house. It’s in a great central location and the house is updated and beautiful. Great communication..
I always bring extra shampoo, body soaps, toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent, coffee pods; bc places never supply enough. This place had EVERYTHING you could need and easily accessible. I was extremely impressed."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. The house was spotless. Nice fenced in backyard. Recommend!
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"I arrived at night and there were no exterior lights (a motion sensor light would have worked). I had to use my camera flashlight to see the keypad. On February 2nd I bought this to the attention of the host or cohost and was told she’d get right on it. I checked out on February 29th and nothing was done.
I had questions about a garage door opener and the remote to the fireplace and was told they’d look into it but never received a response. I was there 40 nights.
The TV wasn’t set up properly for guest mode. I was on the phone back and forth and was assured that the code worked. It did not. I finally asked if someone could come over to help. The next day someone came by and realized that the code didn’t work.
The house is very lovely but the sofa is lumpy and is practically on the floor. If you’re an adult, you’ll struggle standing up.
The guest bathroom tub drains very slowly so you’re standing in water as you shower.
Otherwise, it’s a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood.."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay so much! Location was perfect; close and convenient to the university.

The linens were plentiful and of good quality. Lots of hot water too, yay! My nephew loved the electric fireplace and playing with the foosball table. The neighborhood is a quiet, respectable area. There are ample restaurants and entertainment venues close to this location and it is very near the University of Southern Mississippi. It was a very delightful place to stay.

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in H’burg for our son’s wedding, & Chae’s home provided the quiet, relaxing environment we needed after 3 long days of festivities! The home was located in quiet, peaceful neighborhood, not far from DT, which made it rather easy to run into town & the venue if we needed anything. The home was spacious, charming & stylish yet cozy & inviting, the pictures didn’t do it justice. We only had one little “oops” during our stay. As we all know things happen when you least expect them. When we arrived we realized we couldn’t get into the home. I immediately called Chae & she made some phone calls & found out that her housekeeper had been involved in a car wreck, therefore the home had not been cleaned. Chae immediately sprung into action, she & her team managed to clean the entire home while we were out to dinner with our family! By the time we got back the home was clean & ready for us to enjoy!! Chae was responsive, & made sure we had a great experience! Def would book again!"

I had packed Tide pods and unstoppables just in case I needed to wash clothes and Chae had plenty of both already in the house, which is unusual (most places leave a couple pods and that’s it). Chae has been quick to respond on all communication so I would imagine she would be quick to fix any problems that may arise for a guest. We had a wonderful trip and will definitely stay here again should we need to stay in Hattiesburg!"

From all the kitchen essentials to the fluffy towels and cozy bed. This is such a beautiful and welcoming home! The Host, Jayson, was very friendly and communicative during our stay.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super clean home and very comfy!! I am extremely picky about bathrooms (and kitchens), and I have no complaints!
Basic toiletries and kitchen supplies are provided and not limited (like in some places). Towels and linens were soft and comfy! Throw blankets were great too! I actually ordered one of them to have at home!
Great lighting in home due to OPTIONS: multiple windows, overhead lighting in addition to lamps, and even dim lighting options in master bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.
Mattresses were firm which happens to be my preference. I loved having a vanity setup in bedroom for makeup.
Basic decor of home as pictured felt warm and welcoming. I truly enjoyed my stay!"

The little “extras” from makeup wipes to Microban made this rental everything we could of hoped for. Location was everything for this trip as it was very close to USM & restaurants. I’m afraid Jayson has set the bar so high, my expectations of what an Airbnb should be will be hard to meet!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Creekside Cottage is a gem!! We absolutely loved our stay there. The home is beautiful and comfortable with all of the necessities (and more) provided. The stairs leading upstairs are a bit steep, but it didn’t bother our kiddos one bit. As nice as the inside was, the setting was even more amazing! I love that our pup was welcomed as well. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had such a relaxing time at the creek side cottage. The creek brought back childhood memories of going camping on a creek. It was so private and peaceful.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was such a nice place to stay. It was so peaceful! Lee was a great host!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were excited to stay to celebrate my daughter's Southern Miss graduation, and Lee's gorgeous home was beyond perfect! Our family of 5 , plus a dog had plenty or room and it was really just a slice of heaven. We relaxed by the creek, had coffee each morning on one of the decks overlooking the water, did some fishing, and even thought about kayaking, but ran out of time. My kids LOVED the record player- all three had never seen one and it was one of the coolest nights of our week, sitting around the living room room playing records and monopoly! :)
One of the nicest things about staying here is that Lee has thoughtfully provided so many things that made us feel right at home! From the coffee to the laundry, board games to the iron (we forgot ours) and even flashlights in case of power outages, we had everything we needed.
The house itself is decorated so nicely-pictures truly don't show it- towels/ linens were high quality, super soft.
Lee himself was wonderful! 5++ stars!"

He was also super responsive when I contacted him with a question. The cottage is the perfect place to wind down and relax."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lee tried to think of everything. We had extra towels, snacks for the kids, coffee(we don't drink it but I could see it being appreciated). All the basics like dish soap, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, soap, shampoo, conditioner, basic seasonings were provided and made things so much easier. There were even storage containers for leftovers.
The only thing i didn't notice in the initial listing was around the stair height to the 2nd story, all the different surfaces outside, , and the slanted upstairs roof. We loved exploring all the little seating areas, bridges, and fire pits but my parents would not have been able to handle the stairs. The upstairs bathroom made the most of the space. Our 6' son had to watch for the slanted roof, but again the kids actually really enjoyed each having their own beds and spaces.
It was so peaceful to just enjoy our own little cottage with such great views of the water. If we're ever back in the area, we'll definitely go back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this cabin!! Lee was great. Responded right away with any questions. Would definitely book again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home, beautiful and serene atmosphere indoor AND outdoors. Everything you need is supplied to you except groceries and shopping is no more than 16 miles. Lee is great, communication was excellent and the inside has many unexpected decorations."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lee was a wonderful host! He made check in instructions easy to follow and check out was simple. We enjoyed the beautiful creek side view that offered many areas to sit and relax to fully take it in. The inside of the home was stunning. Very modern, clean and offered everything you would need to enjoy your stay.
We will definitely be back again.
Thanks so much Lee!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We will definitely be staying again! Beautiful quiet serene little getaway!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lee is an exceptional host. Checked on us, gave us early checkin if we needed it but because kitchen had limited area for cooking utensils, he arranged to drop off a crockpot without even a hesitation. Great stay and time enjoyed with our out of state family."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cute little place! It was so peaceful sitting on the porches and deck for morning coffee, even if it was a little chilly! There was nothing we needed and felt very much at home. Even Inkey had his own little private fenced yard!
Would definitely stay again!
Make sure to stop at grocery store first as it is nice and secluded and you won’t want to leave."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was very calming and relaxing. My kids loved it. It had a very spacious backyard space which is great for big families. We did s'mores and even baked some chicken in the grill which was amazing. The area is private so it’s nice because you know no one will come and bother your peaceful getaway.
I highly recommend this place. Our 3 day stay was very amazing. Everything was super clean and neat. The Christmas decorations that Mr Lee did were super welcoming that we felt right at home soon as we opened the door. The tvs were my kids favorite part, they were super huge as if you are in a theater, we watched many movies all night. Thank you for this nice experience, would definitely come back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Location was perfect for a family Christmas reunion with our adult kids. The place was all decorated for the holidays and Lee even put-up a Christmas tree in the main open space. We will definitively go back in the summertime to enjoy the fireplaces, the river and different decks. We were all very sad to leave and we would have requested to stay longer if we didn't have other commitments.
The house is filled with everything you may need for a short or long stay. It was very clean, well decorated and everything works. You can tell after just few minutes in the place that Lee is taking very good care of his property.
We also appreciated the little fenced area on the side of the house so our dogs can play without being bothered by the other unleashed dogs from a nearby house.
We will be back! Maybe a new family Christmas tradition..."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped here on our road trip. The place is very clean and had everything we need. My kids loved this place. If we come back, we will definitely choose here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved it we will have to book a whole weekend cause we loved that view and how it was by the river and it was soo nice in the inside we most definitely will be booking again .
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lee's cottage was a wonderful weekend getaway for my wife and kids. We loved staying at the cottage as it was very clean with wonderful decor (and Christmas decorations inside/out for the holidays). The property is great with lots of spots for relaxing. Lee was very helpful, responsive, and friendly. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was nice and the beds were comfortable. We stayed there on a road trip so it was a great place for the kids to run around outside before we had to get back on the road. The outdoor area was beautiful and peaceful. We would love to stay there again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was very nice, clean and comfortable! Had a great time! We would def stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The photos don’t do this place justice. Multiple outdoor areas to relax and take in nature. The view from the patio makes you feel like you are completely isolated, deep in nature. Will be back and I’ve told all my friends about this place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean very peaceful, real relaxing. It was just a beautiful place. I like the interior designs. This was my first time doing this. When I come back to Hattisburg Mississippi, I hope to use this place again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, the photos don’t do Lee’s place justice! The view is incredible and peaceful with ample seating areas, rocking chairs, swings, two fire pits, heaters and fans on the porches. The cabin is beautifully decorated, while also having a masculine, rustic feel. The entire place is well appointed with everything you’ll need to cook and relax. It was spotless and the extra touches throughout the property were well thought out to make Lee’s guests as comfortable and happy as possible. It was the most welcoming AirBnb we’ve ever stayed in and we frequent many! We are locals and felt like we were on a vacation far away. We can not wait to take our children back for a family weekend. Highly recommend!!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Cozy Cottage blew me away. beautiful ajd peaceful tucked away spot. slept like a baby. Even some popcorn available, which was great at 2am. Will definitely be returning."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful property! Nicely decorated and very clean. We especially loved the deck over the creek. Perfect for a peaceful morning drinking coffee. The kitchen and bathroom was stocked with anything you might need and the bed was very comfortable. This was a perfect little weekend getaway for the husband and I while we explored the local antique shops. Would love to return and bring the kids next time!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Chae’s place was clean, cute and comfortable. We were in town for a wedding and it was so nice to have all our family staying in one spot
Ubers were easy to obtain as well and the house was very nice"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great location for us. The house was clean and roomy. The dog loved the backyard and we loved the sun porch--especially for our coffee in the morning.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great and as pictured! Host provided great instructions and things went smoothly!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and low traffic area. Good place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Chae was the best host — she worked with us to check in earlier and when we needed to extend our stay. The house is very cute and cozy. The sunroom was a great place to read a book and drink a glass of wine. There are so many restaurants and things to do just minutes away! I would recommend this property to my friends who visit.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you! We stayed here for USM Parent's Weekend and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hattiesburg was a pleasant surprise with its large number of good restaurants, coffee shops, name brand stores, two great golf courses and the Long Leaf Trace biking and walking trail! Chae's place, a lovely and well maintained property, was one of the few Airbnb's available in Hattiesburg that had two complete bathrooms in a three bedroom house. Two bathrooms are a requirement, since we usually have two senior couples when we travel! Chae's clean, open, uncluttered space with plenty of room to stow our stuff was much appreciated. The kitchen had what we needed, and the sun porch and back patio were lovelyT places to relax and visit! A couple of stools at the kitchen counter, a nightlight in the hall and a rug inside the front door would have been nice additions. Another concern we had upon arrival was the rusty derelict car which sits just off the curb in the empty lot across the street , an eyesore in an otherwise nice and peaceful neighborhood!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location. Clean. Spacious. Cute
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is great. Modern upgrades and decor, clean and beautiful space, great back yard, and lots of extras made this home perfect for our family. This is the one—it’s convenient to everywhere in Hattiesburg, and the hosts are responsive and helpful. Having stayed in another after our stay, there’s no comparison—this is one of the best in Hattiesburg."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The ONLY complaints I have is the furniture was dated and not so comfortable and there was a television in only one bedroom. The communication was wonderful and the house suited our needs.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything was perfect! Great space and host was very accommodating!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as described and we enjoyed staying there. Chae was an awesome host! We will definitely stay again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Was really good and clean
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved staying at this property. It was private and great for my family. We only wish they would have taking the same time in quality on the beds as the property. We appreciate the property and them allowing us to share this place. It will always be on our list of recommendation
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. Convenient location, comfortable home and nice fenced backyard. Great neighborhood for walking the dogs. Would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place, in a quiet neighborhood. Right down the street from the mall and Southern Miss. Was given the incorrect key code to get in after a 7+ hour road trip, had to wait about 30 mins for the right code. However outside of this, everything was easy and seamless"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place to stay
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place for me and my son during our baseball tournament. It was close to all the fields.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved the tiny cozy space that Becky provided. Waking up and having coffee next to the farm was so peaceful. We had some trouble with the internet but Becky was quick to respond and provided us a solution. Definitely would recommend you staying here as it’s quiet, off the main road, and just overall a peaceful stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great place for a quick visit! The bed was comfortable and the space was perfect for us two. Great spot for the price point.

So affordable ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Becky is such a sweet and helpful woman! I loved how helpful she was and caring. I loved looking out the windows or stepping outside to look at the cows and sheep. I loved her decor and how she made the place feel so homey and welcoming! i would recommend staying here if you’re looking for a quiet place to stay at. I definitely would love to stay here again in the future!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute tiny home for our overnight stay while traveling through the area. LOVED the location -- convenient to the highway, safe, and beautiful with plenty of trees and lovely neighbors (adorable sheep and cows). Just big enough for the two of us and our small dog. Comfortable bed, and had everything we needed for an overnight stop. Easy check-in and out. Would stay here again the next time we're passing through."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed with Becky multiple times and each time it’s even better than the last. We love the location and how close it is to everything but you still feel like you’re out in the country. It’s so peaceful and relaxing. Becky is the perfect host!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Everything was as described. Quiet location. Easy communication.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at the Cozy Getaway! It definitely lived it up to its name; the area had a rural feel to it while still being 15 minutes away from a lot of restaurants and activities. It was very clean, and Becky helped make the check-in and check-out process so simple!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here multiple times and it just keeps getting better.! Becky is a wonderful host and is always very responsive. I love the snack basket and appreciate the addition of hot chocolate, as I am not a coffee drinker. It was nice to wake up and drink some hot cocoa by the electric fireplace on a cold morning. Look forward to more stays in the future!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and cozy room that was great for our one night stay on our road trip.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second stay with Becky. In my last review I used the wrong name (Sorry!). I can’t express enough how relaxing our short stay was. The new remote controlled air conditioning unit is sooo nice! The area is peaceful and beautiful. I have no doubt we will be back 😊
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful! Very relaxing, perfect for two. Exactly as described and better. The first thing I noticed on opening the door was the cool atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxing smell. It felt like stepping into a spa. The selection of coffee left for us was great. Overall I couldn't ask for any better. My husband and I will most definitely be return visitors. Thank you so much, Becky, for making us feel at home in your home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great getaway for the trip we had planned. Everything was perfect and Becky was so kind. Will definitely be back!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Becky's place was great!! She was very friendly and accommodating. The bed was very comfortable!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect little weekend getaway! Looks just like the pictures. Beautifully decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable and dressed with very nice linens and pillows. We took advantage of the well equipped kitchen to cook a meal during our stay. The property is beautiful and quiet! You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere but only a short drive to restaurants and shopping. Beth was very responsive and helpful. The basket of toiletries and nice selection of coffee (even though we don’t drink it) were a welcoming touch upon arrival. We plan to stay here again in the future for sure!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was clean and nice. We had a great stay bed were comfortable too.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When you walk in the door, it smelt real good. I felt like I was at home. Everything in the home was convenient. I will stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here with our two teenagers while in town for our oldest daughter's graduation from USM. It was a perfect set up for the four of us. We had plenty of room for everyone. The kitchen is really big and it was especially nice to have the Keurig and pods available for use. Highly recommend this cute little house!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay.
Very clean and welcoming."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed one night as we were passing through. It was ok and fairly priced for a quick stop. Cute old school bungalow and had pretty wallpaper. We liked the vintage vibe. There are a few things that need repairs, cleaning, or replacement but overall everything was just “ok.” The traffic outside is randomly loud at all hours so bring a sound machine so you can sleep. I wouldn’t recommend this place if you’re traveling with children, but would be alright for adults passing through. Couldn’t get a reply from the host over the course of several days asking the same question. Again, not the worst, not the best, just ok."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, quick and easy stay. Check in instructions were simple. Great accommodations for my family and I passing through town."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved the home. It was cozy and located in a well established neighborhood.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, convenient and comfortable. The three most important factors for me."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Only complaints was the business of the street and noise that came with that. Plus the cleanliness of the home. The floors and bathroom were not clean at all. Towels had brown stains on them.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family loved this house. it was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. We would definitely stay again if it's available. Thank you for letting us stay in your lovely home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed everything about our stay. we will definitely be looking to stay there again soon
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an adorable old house on a nice street close to a college campus and hospital. The street itself is very quiet and filled with single family homes, but there are restaurants within walking distance. The house has tons of charm and is decorated well, with some small quirks. We were glad to have the coffee bar, many plugs with USB outlets, and luggage racks in each bedroom. The bathroom and beds are extremely clean, but the floor is not particularly clean. The owner is very responsive and provided great local recommendations. We enjoyed our overnight stay in Hattiesburg and would consider one of the owner’s properties in the future."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience visiting family and would love to stay there again next time in Harrisburg.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely home. Comfy beds. Will note that we did hear excessive roads noise. It could just be our sensitivity to such things and may not bother others. Matched the description given. As listed below the cleanliness was not up to par as others mentioned. That was the only negative. Overall it suited our need for a one night stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a good stay. We were on our way to Florida and stopped here. Overall it was nice.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,awesome place. will stay again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jarrod was great and his place was very nice!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,I loved the charm of this older home but updated kitchen and bathroom. The furniture was very nice. I loved the extra USB outlets.
2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We encountered significant cleanliness and safety issues in Jarrod’s AirBnB. The issues were immediately reported to the hosts and after many texts back and forth and wasted hours the issues were not addressed. In the end we were refunded half of our stay by the hosts, and the other half by AirBnB’s Air Cover.
Since many of the reviews have been favorable, maybe this was just a one-off. The host was apologetic and our hope for future renters is that things will be cleaner and the safety issues will be fixed."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed staying at Jarrod’s house while in town for USM BASEBALL! Very clean and comfortable. Recommend to other USM families.

The kitchen had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. Wifi worked great. We were in town for a family reunion in Petal, and we also did some sightseeing in downtown Hattiesburg.

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is my favorite place to stay in Harrisburg! It is the cutest little house with amazing bedrooms and great family table. Looking forward to coming back soon!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Jerrod's place felt right at home. The house was the perfect size to accommodate our family of five. The check-in instructions were very clear and helpful. The kitchen was fully equipped with the essentials, and the beds were quite comfy. The home sits directly across the street from the major hospital, college campus, Walmart, and local shops. However, the bathroom was missing a bath rug along with a stepping stool for the little ones. The doors are missing door stops, so it's easy to accidentally damage the walls. The dishwasher is loose and not mounted firmly. Some of the furniture shows small signs of wear and tear, yet it's operational. Lastly, the house could also benefit from having a keyless entry for the front door. I was afraid that I might lose the house key while it was in my possession.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was exceptional! This by far has been the best home we stayed in. The home was clean, smelled good, and was decorated very nice. The kitchen was fully equipped, literally every thing you need (even a cheese grater)! The bathroom was fully stocked, more than enough linens and wash towels. The host gave great instructions for everything in the home and was generous to have detergent and dryer sheets! the extra lighting fixtures in the rooms were great. the extra power cords on the side of the beds were great!
our only problems were that the heat/cool system defaulted to 50 at night and it was cold. also, the room with twin beds, needs blackout curtains because the street light illuminates the room at night. lastly, the blinds were broken on several of the windows, not really a big deal because there are curtains in every room."

The neighborhood was nice and quiet although we did hear the trains running in the distance a bit overnight one evening (which was a new experience for me - sleeping with the sound of trains).

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quaint and charming. It’s exactly as described. It’s an older home with wood floors and reminded me of visiting family as a youngster. The bed was very comfortable and the home’s location was so quiet it was easy to fall asleep each night.
Katie was extremely responsive and went out of her way to make sure we were happy. She replied to any messages within a few minutes. We’re already making plans to stay here in the future."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Peaceful and in the country but within 5 minutes of town and shopping. Everything was clean and tidy. Will stay again! 🙂

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and as described, very clean older home with plenty of charm and character but very homey. Really cute place and property, quiet and tucked away from the hustle bustle of Hattiesburg proper but still close by what you’d need. Plenty of room and really was just perfect! Definitely recommended!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and peaceful. 10/10!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I messaged Katie on a very short notice. She was able to get us in for a great price! Once we arrived we felt like we were at home! This older house is beautiful and so cozy! Literally all we needed was food. Everything else was provided. The photos doesn’t do justice! The bedrooms were the perfect size, has a super cute little set up in the backyard. My favorite part was no close neighbors! It sets off to itself. 10/10 recommend! We will definitely stay here again!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice and cozy
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Katie’s farmhouse has a peace about it, I can’t put into words but if you need time to yourself or family or just time to reflect or map out your future goals/plans, well, this is the place. It has a home feeling about it. At first look, I was wondering if it had bugs or spiders being close to woodlands and trees but this was not the case at all. It was very clean and bug/rodent free lol. The kitchen was nice and well stocked with pots and pans for cooking, charcoal grill accessible with charcoal and lighter fluid. The shower and sink water pressure was outstanding as well as the heating and air conditioning. Absolutely no complaints and look forward to visiting just for the serenity and get away. Thanks for allowing our family to have quality time at your place Katie!
P.S. Katie’s response time to the one time I reached out at the end of my stay was immediately noted. TBH, I only reached out cause I am use to more of an exiting clause like, remove linens from beds that was used, placed used towels in or near washing machine and etc; but NO, Katie laughed and said that’s what the small cleaning fee is for."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The farm house was the perfect spot for my girlfriend and I. It was dark out in the country, where you could see every star in the sky..the house was exactly what we wanted. If we are ever back that way we would absolutely stay there again."

The home is beautiful in a beautiful setting on a lake in a very nice development. You have the spacious upstairs with two bedrooms, bathroom and den. The space is very clean and quite comfortable.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a really nice stay at her home. Toni is a wonderful, gracious hostess. It's a beautiful home and I especially enjoyed sitting on her back porch area that overlooks a beautiful lake and other beautiful homes. I loved the spaciousness of the upstairs rooms. We had some wonderful conversation and she was always available for answers to any questions I had. I will definitely stay there again if I'm ever back in the Harrisburg area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni’s home was lovely, clean and comfortable, and felt like staying with a friend. She was happy to chat but also gave me space. Having the entire upstairs felt like having my own apartment. She is very mindful of her animals, I got to meet them because I asked, if that isn’t your thing you won’t be around them (and they don’t go upstairs). Her porch is wonderful for watching the birds, all so peaceful. Highly recommend! And if you’re looking for a good grab and go spot for breakfast, Petal Donuts is a short drive north and had delicious breakfast sandwiches and, of course, donuts!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was perfect! Very lovely, comfortable beds, quiet, nice touches to welcome you. Would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni is the definition of class act. Extremely responsive, nice, and should be the picture of what Airbnb should be. Her place is phenomenally decorated and beautiful setting nestled in a small little cove on a pond. Absolutely stunning views great person, great place, nice hot tub, and clean comfortable bed. You could not ask for anything more. A+"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Toni made us feel welcome and right at home. Her place was so much more than what we expected! So peaceful and beautiful! We plan to make it our little getaway spot! 😇
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Toni was a fantastic host with a great house. I really enjoyed catching Bass and Perch after work. Thank you for letting me use the kayak!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The only bad thing to say is I wish it was closer so I could go more often! She shows true southern hospitality and has the most inviting and relaxing space to enjoy. We enjoyed the hot tub and relaxing on her back deck. We are grateful and thankful to have made the last minute stop on our drive home here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni's place was VERY nice. Close to the I-59, which was important to me, as I was just passing through. The house was very nice, the dogs were cool, and Toni is a really nice person. Definitely recommend."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni was very good at communicating with me and my provided a great place to stay. I was very impressed with her home, it was an amazing place and everything within the home was high quality. Guests like Toni make Air bnb such a great value."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay here. The place was excellent and comfortable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hattiesburg is easy to navigate and beautiful in the springtime! A feast for the eyes with dogwoods, wisteria and azaleas in multiple vibrant shades. Toni's neighborhood and the city is bursting with color!
People here are very helpful and friendly. They eagerly gave recommendations of places to eat or shop. One of our favorites was Del Sol, a Mexican restaurant recommended by many. A+
This city has many colorful murals, which add to the charm of this place. The college campus is beautiful. It is a very clean city. It's easy to see that they take pride in their home town.
We took a 30 minute drive one day to Laurel (of HGTV fame) and enjoyed lunch at Cafe La Fleur. Again we saw murals and charming architecture.
We relish hunting for treasures at thrift shops and consignment stores. In between we delve into culture at an art gallery or museum. We were not disappointed.
All in all, this trip exceeded our expectations. Southern hospitality is alive and well!
Thank you Toni! ❤️"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is absolutely stunning! The room you will stay in is upstairs, so if you are not comfortable climbing stairs, reconsider this listing. Moving on from that, this gorgeous home is very high quality, clean, well-kept, upgraded to the utmost level. Beautiful amenities. Mrs Toni is very sweet and friendly and very responsive. I would definitely recommend staying here and WILL stay here again in the future. Thank you, Mrs Toni, for making us feel right at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a great place! Don’t hesitate to book this place. Had never booked an Airbnb that wasn’t completely private and this felt like it was. Perfect for our family traveling through and needed a night to have a good sleep. Beautiful clean home and wonderful host! Hope to visit again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As a single girl traveling solo I felt safe and comfortable. She was a great host! I look forward to staying here again. The views and neighborhood is amazing. 😍
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place in Hattiesburg that was close to the soccer fields and it was a 5 minute drive to the Tatem Sports complex. It was the perfect homey feeling we were looking for in order to rest amid a busy weekend of tournament games. Toni was so very friendly, welcoming, and helpful!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay there. Will likely be back next time we visit.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day of travel, Toni’s place was the oasis that kept us going on our trip. It was New Year’s Eve, and we just needed a quiet place to rest. This was perfect.
Even though Toni was out with a friend, she kept in touch with us and made sure we arrived and had everything we needed.
The place was gorgeous, and she made us feel like friends.
Conversation the next morning flowed so freely, we almost found it hard to leave. When we finally did leave, we were revived and refreshed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Toni’s house is like staying with family. The accommodations are top flight, so comfortable, just like home. And the neighborhood is very peaceful and calm. We made some really special holiday memories there that we will never forget."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni as well as her home were full of gentle sweetness and comfort. The space is spotless, the screened in porch lakeside very serene, the bed room and lounge area very comfortable. I was only there overnight but can say this is a great, relaxing place to stay in every way!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh, my goodness! Staying with Toni was a ""divine appointment""! First off, she is delightful and welcoming, so gracious and giving. Sweet touches---snacks, coffee, fresh flowers everywhere, bedside chocolate--were so heartwarming. It is IDEAL for a single traveler...and yet the space can easily accommodate a couple or a family--up to 8. I had a choice of bedrooms at the top of the stairs...there is a common lounge/relaxing area (TV, bookshelves, games, coffee) with a bathroom that serves two upstairs bedrooms. One is equipped for four (two queens) and the other for one or a couple (one queen). I chose the queen...and the bed/linens were literally dreamy. The interior/exterior are such a welcoming, comfortable, artistic space--I can't say enough wonderful things about it...but what was really priceless was hearing Toni's story and the reason for her provision. There is nowhere in the area you could stay to surpass it. Prov. 11:25 to Toni and Rev. 22:20 to all blessed to stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family and I had the most wonderful time staying with Toni. She was among the most delightful and gracious people we have met. Her home was full of charm, beautiful and smelled amazing. Toni made us feel welcome and part of her family. We now have not only a great place to stay when we visit Hattiesburg, but another friend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing!! Everything was clean and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The owner was very friendly and sweet and she kept great communication with me. This was my first time staying somewhere without family and I felt completely safe and I will definitely be staying again. Everything was cozy and welcoming and the overall feel of the place was open and relaxing. I would 100% recommend this stay!!
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was beautiful and immaculate. The backyard and lake were very scenic and would have been almost perfect if the hot tub had been working. It would also have been nice if the host was home as expected. I prefer not to stay in empty homes and was not informed the hot tub wasn’t working until a few hours after I had already checked in. If I had known either of these things before hand, I would have stayed somewhere else. The hot tub was my priority this Airbnb. She did have an electrician come and work on the hot tub however at 9 PM of my last night, the hot tub was 82°. A hot tub should be around 103°. I never got to use it.
There were at least a couple dogs at the home that I was told would be relatively quiet. They were not. They barked almost every time I walked anywhere near their door. Upon check in, there was a little girl in the room with what I assume was the dog sitter and she loudly sang Elmo songs for nearly 90 minutes. I am not exaggerating."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A charming home, nestled by the lake in a lovely neighborhood. Toni made us feel so at home; making it a restful retreat. It was a pleasure and we look forward to staying again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ms. Toni was an absolutely amazing and gracious host for so many reasons. She always responded quickly and communicated very well. She went the extra mile to make sure my daughter and I were comfortable and had what we needed (and wanted). The entire time that we spent there was sprinkled with God moments. You will not regret your stay at Ms. Toni's home. It's breathtaking, inspiring, serene, and spotless."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, beautiful lady host! 100% recomendable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night at Toni's home and she could not have been a more friendly and gracious host. Her home is beautiful and well located not far from Interstate highway I-59. I booked late in the day and Toni was able to accommodate me with no problem. The bed was very comfortable and I got a good night's sleep before a long drive the next day. Toni embodies ""southern hospitality"" and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Hattiesburg to stay with Toni. I wish I had more time than I did to walk the surrounding neighborhood. Toni was also able to recommend a local breakfast place, Topher's, not far from her home that was perfect before resuming my trip. I hope to stay again at Toni's home someday."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very beautiful home and very awesome host. I will most definitely come again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my favorite place to stay so far. Spacious and the temperature is well regulated. I will be staying here again in the future.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni's place was our favorite stay in a string of Airbnb's we experienced during a cross country trip. Toni was also our favorite host! She is incredibly sweet, hospitable and kindly answered any and every question we had. She went above and beyond to ensure we felt at home.
Her home is very comfortable. The neighborhood is very peaceful. We are so glad we found Toni & her tucked away Gem of a listing. I highly recommend her place, and her hosting, thank you so much Toni!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni is a very sweet and gracious host. You will instantly love her personality. Her home is absolutely gorgeous! She has every room decorated so chic and instantly makes you feel cozy when you walk through the front door. Honestly, her home is so beautiful that it could be in an interior designer's magazine. There is a spectacular view of the water from her back porch. Upstairs are two large welcoming bedrooms and a spacious den situated between the bedrooms. I highly recommend staying with Toni."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful, and the upstairs was super comfortable and had everything you would need or want! Toni was very responsive to every question"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at No. 54 was an absolute delight! From the moment I walked in, I felt like I had stepped into a cozy oasis. Toni was incredibly sweet and attentive, making sure every detail was taken care of to ensure a comfortable stay. The place itself felt like a warm embrace, with its inviting decor and thoughtful touches that made it truly feel like a home away from home. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better Airbnb experience. If you're looking for a place that combines comfort, charm, and a touch of whimsy, look no further."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Toni’s home is absolutely beautiful and peaceful. She had the kindest soul and made me feel right at home.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is perfect! Toni is one of the best people I have had the privilege of meeting. So, genuine, sweet, and welcoming. The short time we spent was a blessing. Her home is breathtaking. The dogs and Elvis the parrot are a delight. And her granddaughter is just adorable. Souther style, charm, and hospitality at its very best!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot recommend enough. Nice place and Toni was great.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Toni is an absolutely amazing person! She is the sweetest most easy going host I’ve ever had! Would definitely recommend her before even thinking about staying somewhere else!
We had tons of fun talking and getting to know one another! Will DEFINITELY come back!! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Toni’s place was absolutely stunning. My son and I felt right at home. The part we loved the most were her dogs. Our experience was amazing! We will be returning in the fall.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great stay and look forward to returning.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Toni is an exceptional host, and I couldn't have been more content anywhere else. The added bonus of being entertained by Elvis, the Amazon Parrot, made my stay even more delightful. Without a doubt, this is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at, and I have visited dozens over the years. The cost of staying here is worth every penny."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love staying at Toni's place! Look forward to the next time we can stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, I want to keep Toni’s beautiful house and amazing hospitality, all to myself 😊 But she was too great of a hostess to do that to.
If you ever go to or through this area and need a place to stay, I highly recommend it. We had everything we needed and Toni was never more than a text away.
We love animals and never missed an opportunity to hang out with her feathered and fur babies. They do have their own area to be in though so if you aren’t into that, it’s no problem either.
We missed several eating and shopping spots due to the timing of our visit so will most definitely be back to the area and would stay here again, without question."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb experience to date! There was more than enough space for my group of four (and a half) with room to spare. The house/rental space is beautiful, decorated with serene colors and comfortable furnishings. The lake in the back was icing on the cake as far as the “place” goes.
Then there’s the host - Toni was great!!! Before we arrived, she was helpful and precise with check-in instructions, as well as recommending restaurants and things to do in the area. And while we were in the house, it literally felt like her home was our home. She was so welcoming, it felt like visiting a long-time friend. A very respectful host!
Highly recommend!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent stay! We felt right at home! LOVED our stay and can’t wait to stay again! She felt like family. Loved on our kids! Such a peaceful and beautiful place to stay! Don’t look anywhere else - book with Toni! I promise you’ll be glad you did.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mrs. Toni was wonderful. She was a great host. From the moment we walked in the door, we felt at home. We communicated as if we been knowing each other.
Of course, we both are alumni of HHS! So that made everything 1000x better, and to top it off, she even work there. That made me feel so good to know she went back to teach. That made my heart melt.
Elvis, the parrot is the real entertainment of the house. He will talk up a storm and try to over talk you. He does sing Elvis songs. Just hearing him talk really brighten my day.
The stay is one of a kind; and every time I come home, I will be booking with her. Thank you Mrs. Toni for everything. SMTTT"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was very thankful for finding this spot. Toni was very helpful and accommodating for a late check-in.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Well. We’ve stayed at dozens of homes during our journeys across the USA over the past 20 years. Never have we encountered a nicer person, better host or friendlier atmosphere. Toni is an absolute sweetheart. Her animals made the experience so much fun for our kids. The accommodations met all of our families needs and are absolutely as advertised. We now have only one place we’ll stay when visiting southern Mississippi…Toni’s Place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,What a great place to stay! A wonderfully retro feel like being at granny’s house but with a twist. Had everything we needed and more. Plenty of room and a great neighborhood. Would definitely recommend and stay at again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Taylor is a very responsive host. I needed some sharp knives and a cutting board for a dinner I was making Saturday, and her mom dropped off a new set before 5:00!
The house has plenty of seating for a crowd at meals, lots of gathering places for fun activities like pool and ping pong, and it truly is the Brady Bunch era decor. We got a classic photo of our grandkids in their pj’s in the pink tiled bathroom. Amazing."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House is very spacious big back yard for family fun. All amenities were on hand. Great reply when reaching out. Only mishap was birds in the chimney in the living room area found one live bird inside house in window seal. Scared the living hell out of me. But he was set free. Other than that would stay again.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Brady Bunch home. Taylor was so friendly and responsive. This adorable home is like taking a step back in time to the 70’s and we all loved it.
Ten of us had a comfortable three night stay for my son’s wedding weekend and had plenty of room with all the luxuries of home. We walked into a very clean home that was just as described. If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely book here!"

We along with her Grandmother, sister & brother-in-law, 2-year-old niece, uncle, friends from Texas, and a bridesmaid had the perfect stay. Plenty of room, close to things we needed to do all weekend. Lots of laughter, tears, food, and memories were made at this house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Brady Bunch house was a great spot for our family who was visiting Hattiesburg for a wedding. Between the multiple living room/game rooms the house provided ample space for us to hang out and rest between wedding activities. We also had a great time looking at and reminiscing about the decor of the house.
There was also plenty of parking for our vehicles.
I highly recommend The Brady Bunch house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The Brady Bunch house was just as advertised and provided more than enough space and comfort for our party of 8 attending a wedding in the area. Would def stay there again with a large group for any event in Hattiesburg and the surrounding area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Huge house & perfect for a group kayaking trip!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was perfect for our family. The layout and amenities provided room to stretch out, enjoy meals together, entertaining activities, and peaceful rest. The decor was nostalgic and reminiscent of our time together at our grandmother and aunt home, where we used to stay when in Hattiesburg.
The Taylor's were excellent in communicating from my first inquiry about the rental , checking in, inquiries during our stay, and following up on post checkout.
The home and accommodations are easily a 5, I only rated it 4 overall due to the cookware. However, they were apologetic and advised that they would take care of it for future occupancy.
This will certainly be our first choice when returning to the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. No problems at all. The house is very spacious and comfortable for large groups. The outdoor patio area is definitely made for entertaining. We will definitely try to stay in the future.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 10 had a wonderful stay at the Brady Bunch house! It was definitely a throw back to the 70s and came complete with a rotary phone (we had to show the younger generation of our family how it was used to make a phone call!) There were plenty of clean rooms and bathrooms for our large party, the kitchen was huge, and we had everything we needed to make meals. The 2 living rooms and dining rooms made it easy for all to sit/talk/eat, etc. The game room with a pool table made for enjoyable rounds of pool, while the screened-in porch with the ping pong table provided another avenue of fun (although it was hot out there!). The house afforded us a place away from home to enjoy the upcoming festivities. Grocery stores and fast food restaurants were close by and the house was easily accessible to the Hwy 98 and 59. We would definitely stay here again!
Our super host, Taylor, was very responsive to our questions/concerns and was easily accessible through the Airbnb site."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house very quickly became a home for the Saint family for the wedding of our youngest son. Visitors from North Carolina to New Mexico to SW Florida got to experience this beautiful home with four generations represented. The house was more than enough for those who stayed there and brought wonderful memories to the ones who shared in the nostalgia. We hope to visit The Brady Bunch house again in the future!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"First off, our blended family had an AMAZING time spending the weekend together in the Brady Bunch house! I have no complaints about anything at all! Our daughter graduated from USM so it was nice to have family and friends from out of town come and stay with us! Perfect space for entertaining outdoors OR indoors! The pictures don’t do this home justice. Everyone who came had something great to say about this MASSIVE and unique house! We enjoyed teaching the teens about rotary phones, encyclopedias and 8-Track tape players!! The ONLY thing that would improve this property would be a swimming pool! But we bought our granddaughter an inflatable pool to play in the spacious back yard! I would recommend this property to anyone I talk to! If we have a future need, we would return here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Taylor’s place was perfect for our group of 10. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great experience from my initial phone call about having difficulty with my reservation until the time we checked out. Taylor is absolutely wonderful and this place is exactly as advertised. 6 of us traveled in our party and everyone was very impressed and are still raving about the ambiance of this older model home. We absolutely enjoyed everything about this place from its location in a nice neighborhood right off the highway,the well manicured lawn,to the well furnished,well taken care of residence. We will definitely stay again. We Loved It!!!!"

I love how Taylor has updated it, but it still feels like a home. My Dad loved having people visit, and I am comforted that his house is still so welcoming and warm; and that the legacy of his hospitality is being continued through Taylor."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Brady Bunch is strategically preserved and well maintained. There are lots of conversation pieces for us that experienced the 70's. Taylor was wonderful and most helpful. She went out of her way to look for a lost fedora hat (Taylor-we did find it in the truck...thanks agin for your efforts). The space was amazing and easily accomodated our group of twelve. Next trip for us through Hattiesburg will definitely include a stay over at the Brady Bunch. Thank you Taylor for making this gem available to my family!
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The house was very beautiful… I’d rent again… we had small issues that set us back but over all the place was nice … lil pricey but worth it…

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing time here with our friends and family. It felt like a family reunion even though we were there for my mother’s funeral.

Taylor is an amazing hostess and a beautiful southern belle who is very responsive and do her best to ensure your stay is a pleasurable one. Yes, I will be renting her place again this summer."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was perfect. Plenty of space for us and our five kids, with their significant others….so much room for everyone to have their own space. It was spotlessly clean, and had tons of activities/ games to keep everyone entertained. We will definitely be back!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family stayed at this home during the loss of a loved one so we could all be together.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was used as a gathering for our family and to say we most definitely had more than enough room. This home is the perfect fit for large family . When ever we are back and in need of a home if it’s available it is the first on our travel list for the area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I almost hate to leave this review because I selfishly want this home available anytime we visit Hattiesburg relatives. The house was perfect in every way for our large crew. An ideal gathering spot for all of our Hattiesburg family and those staying in hotels. We had 20 folks for most dinners and general hanging out - ranging in age from 8 months to 94 years old and never once felt crowded. There's enough space that loud game play in the dining room didn't disturb sleeping babies in another part of the house. Huge backyard. The screened porch is amazing. Photos don't do it justice, and the sunsets were just beautiful sitting on the porch with a glass of wine. The house has a retro feel in all the right ways and Taylor was a pure delight as a host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hello Taylor! I have expressed how this home was a blessing to my family. Taylor it was the best Airbnb that I have rented in Hattiesburg by for.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our extended family stayed the week of Thanksgiving, with relatives driving in from Texas, Florida and Louisiana. We grew up in this house, and were thrilled to get to continue the tradition of all being together for Thanksgiving, without the stress of cleaning and prepping for the week. The local family members came over every day, and we had plenty of room for 28 of us to eat and cook various meals. The kids loved the game room and the parents loved that we could be upstairs visiting, while the kids played outside and in the game room. Great location, plenty of space, and everything you need right there on hand. Taylor was wonderful about all aspects of the experience from booking through checkout. We’ve already reserved for next year."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best stay ever - We have stayed in over 20 rentals since our retirement, and this one is our current favorite. It is in a great neighborhood and only minutes from the Longleaf Trace bicycle trailhead, which was our reason for visiting this area.
The place was pleasantly decorated and had everything we needed to enjoy our week biking the local trail. We loved the lighting, the TV instructions, the new shower, and all the counter space in both the kitchen and the bathroom. The bed was extra comfy and though we didn't get to use the pool, we did enjoy some time on the putting green right next to the rental. This place had everything and it was obvious that a ton of thought was put into making this a perfect experience for anyone staying there.
We love our law enforcement people and we were honored to be able to rent from a retired LE officer. He was super friendly and we really enjoyed our visit with him on our last day there. We hope to be able to return for another visit soon."
