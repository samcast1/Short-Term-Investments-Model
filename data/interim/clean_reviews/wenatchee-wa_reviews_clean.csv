2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very cute and comfortable place on a beautiful property. Highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre visiting Leavenworth. Much better value and the drive is not too bad. I will be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Easy to find. Everything as described. Would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay with Deanne is very good and quiet. I feel safe and rest on this beautiful place. The room comes with everything you need and the vectors super quiet and invites you to walk, enjoy nature, and capture beautiful photographs. Just a few meters from the river, which has an area to walk or just sit and delight in the mountain magician. It is my second visit to this beautiful place and hopefully I will return again since it is located a few minutes from Wenatchee and in a short time you can also enjoy a day in"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little place! Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had to book last minute and she was very responsive when I had any questions! Will be staying here again next week! Thank you Deanne!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was pristine beautiful lots of flowers grass and small orchard good views and Deanna‚Äôs family was very nice. Unfortunately there was no internet or wifi upon arrival due to a recent provider change. Deanna did try to resolve the wifi issue. I‚Äôm sure this will be fixed for future guests it was just bad timing. The accommodation was comfortable good ac and fan to keep it cool when needed. No kitchen as advertised set up was basic like a hotel room with small microwave, small bar fridge and coffee pods /kettle. Paper plates. The bed was comfy and had nice linens. Bathroom/shower was spacious. I liked the location being only a few minutes down highway from shops etc however this property overlooks the highway and traffic noise was constant. There is also a fairly busy road in back of property. Overall I enjoyed my stay in Wenatchee and was decent for two nights."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Deanne‚Äôs place was just what we were looking for‚Äîan overnight stay in a quiet neighborhood with attractive landscaping. It was peaceful and relaxing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was small but lovely. Great views and a nice place to sit outside. Despite the proximity of a highway and ball fields, it was fairly quiet and a good night‚Äôs sleep was had on a very comfy bed. Good value!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value for a weekend getaway. I‚Äôm use to a few more amenities like plates, silverware and napkins but we did manage to get these from the restaurant when we ordered takeout. The room was clean and there is a sitting area outside with a nice view of the orchard. Very quiet and relaxing. One note there are baseball fields that start games very early so don‚Äôt leave the window open during game season. üòä"

The Columbia River is 5 minutes away, where you can walk and admire nature. The people in the community are super friendly . The arrival at the studio is very easy and I felt safe and happy. I would definitely like to come back as Deanne has magazines showing you the different attractions of the place and I would like to continue exploring again. Thank you Deanne"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place to spend the night. Sure beats spending more money and staying at a hotel. Deanne‚Äôs place has everything a hotel does and maybe more (flavored coffee creamer). Exactly what I needed.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bargain for Wenatchee. A little out of town, but not far. Very private and in a quiet neighborhood. Responsive host who immediately answered my messages. She allowed us to check in early, and brought extra coffee upon our request for her machine. The space is cute and clean and everything works. The wall AC saved us on a very hot summer weekend. Designated parking space at the unit. Recommend! We may be back ourselves!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my place for the night before heading to north cascades from Leavenworth. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt stay in a motel in Wenatchee. Their garden is beautiful - has cherry trees in the back and the birds keep you company singing their sweet tunes. Host let me pick cherries too. Overall a great stay - highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stay, this place feel like home and we enjoyed every minute.
The views were perfect setting, the patio chairs allowed for a nice breakfast and coffee before setting off for the day.
Deanne has nothing out of place and all was better than what she described. Definitely coming back when I‚Äôm in town."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay. Deanne was wonderfully responsive from the moment we booked our stay. We‚Äôd never been out this way and were headed to a show at the Gorge. Her communication immediately took any stress and worry about our accommodations the night of the show.
The room was very clean and comfortable and the cherry orchard was amazing. Our only regret is we only stayed one night and didn‚Äôt get to sit out and bird watch longer."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was clean and had everything what I wished for. It is furthermore quiet close to the enchainments which is ideal for hiking. Overall a very nice stay wished I had more time here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we were looking for since we were traveling to the gorge a couple times. Very reasonable pricing as well.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and charming spot. Close to town and amazing views.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,such a gorgeous view! was a wonderful place to stay for hiking around wenatchee!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was wonderful. Unfortunately, we arranged two months ahead of time for cot. We were treated dismissively when we arrived and found a thin waffle mat laying out on the grass. We were told to bend it in half. If told of situation and earlier, we could have brought air mattress and sleeping bag from home. We were not treated welcomingly, which was unfortunate, because I loved everything else about it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Beautiful spot.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a weekend wedding nearby. It was a perfect place to stay rather than a nearby hotel. Beautiful scenery, and the access road nearby made it easy to get around to the venue, local shops and restaurants."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely love this place! It was perfect for my needs and made me wish I had stayed longer. The space was so cute and private. The area is quiet with beautiful views of the mountains and Columbia River. The space was super clean and cute inside with a comfy bed and lots of bedding and linens. The bathroom was spotless with lots of drawer/cupboard space to store stuff. The designated parking space and private entrance make this a perfect little hideaway to return home after exploring Wenatchee. It‚Äôs wonderfully located close enough to restaurants and downtown but away from everything as well. Take advantage of Hydro Park for a great walk or jog along the Columbia. Everything about staying here was easy thanks to the wonderful host. I‚Äôll definitely be back!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely stay here again! Deanne was super communicative, parking was easy to find, and overall this home was a cozy, quiet place to unwind. Not to mention the view from the front door was amazing!!"
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Overall we had a nice stay and the room met our needs for a quick stop over. Nice setting, clean, and easy to find. I could be wrong, but it seemed pretty clear that the bed was a full size bed and not a queen as listed. It was comfortable and would be great for some but I normally wouldn't select a rental with a full size bed for 2 adults."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was great. Would recommend. The bed was also super cozy.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved staying here!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay before skiing the next day at Mission Ridge, and this was it! Only a 25-minute drive to the mountain. We had a one year old with us who's pack and play fit well in the room. We liked that there are no shared walls, so if she fussed there was no stress. When asked for recommendations for places to eat in town, Deanne was ready with them. It was great that we had our own assigned parking space, and the neighborhood feels very safe. The view from the bedroom window was incredible. The drive from the main area to get there, no problems. If we ski mission ridge again, we would book this again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little studio. Extremely clean and conveniently close to Wanatchee and Mission Ridge. Thank you!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was overall great and as described. I would highly recommend it, but my only criticism is the pocket bathroom door had no way to grip it and pull it in and out so that was kind of a pain. Other than that minor thing, everything was great."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, well decorated, comfortable, small. Main area is the size of a large bedroom. Bathroom is good sized. Rather like a smallish hotel room in terms of size and amenities, but of course nicer location and privacy."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, quiet stay about 30 minutes from Leavenworth. Nice and private. It‚Äôs a great stay for someone looking for a place to sleep, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily hang out there. Beautiful setting with a grove of cherry trees to sit and wonder at before going to bed at night or first thing in the morning. We got a discounted rate because we booked the day of, and it was well worth the money!"

2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and very clean. Very small and no place to hang clothes.. also no tv but that is in the listing which i didnt notice. Bed seems to be a full size not a queen. Seems overpriced to me.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming small guest house, host was very friendly. A comfy bed to sleep in in a calm area, and a well lit bathroom to meet the all the needs. Great outdoor space for easing into the mornings on a beautiful property. Definitely recommend should one need a refresh and good night sleep."

Great at always, AC worked wonderful, I came for work, and an outlet near the desk would‚Äôve been more convenient but luckily I came prepared with an extension surge protector. The Wi-Fi also got a bit too slow after extended amount of use but by then I was finished with my work. 10/10 would recommend!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, Cute, Clean, & Comfortable ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Deanne‚Äôs Place. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, while visiting Wenatchee. It‚Äôs a great location ‚Ä¶ which feels like you‚Äôre out-of-town a bit, but with quick and easy access to anything you need. I definitely hope to stay here again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice little spot to stay. It is in East Wenatchee a bit south of all the businesses. Access to the highway that leads into town is very quick and easy. The room itself is designed for one guest or a couple. It is equipped with a queen size bed, a small table and two chairs. There is a microwave and a mini fridge, but otherwise, no kitchen. It is modern and clean and off the road a bit, so parking is semi-private. The window looks out onto some mature cherry trees, but unless you go outside, there is no real view. Outside, there are a couple chairs you can sit on for your morning coffee. From there you can get a small view of the hills to the west and a little piece of the river. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. We would rent there again if and when we return."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay after a show at the gorge!!! Easy late night access ...

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was fantastic and set in a very beautiful location. The communication was clear and we had a pleasant stay at this small and cozy airbnb. Some of the nice to have things would be to include a closet and drinking water supply as we just had the bathroom's sink to use for all purposes.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a comfortable and clean space. The back porch area is simply quiet and beautiful. I have already booked my next stay, and will be checking in for future visits!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute little place to stay! Very clean and quick communication response from the host!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, private. A great spot on the edge of the city - close enough to everything yet feels out of town."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and very gracious hosts.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deanne‚Äôs place was a perfect weekend mini-getaway. The space is clean and I appreciated the reserved parking spot! The place is also close to downtown Wenatchee (less than 10 min). I also did some hiking at nearby (20-25 min drive) Squilchuck State Park and Mission Ridge.
Deanne was so courteous to allow a later check-out. I got to take my time exploring the trails because she let me stay a little longer. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The drive from and back to Seattle was gorgeous this early May. I can‚Äôt imagine how much more beautiful the orchards will be once the blossoms and fruit come in! And gosh, any drive through the mountains (weather permitting) is heaven.
Thank you Deanne for allowing me this weekend to rest and recoup!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place! It had everything we wanted, was plenty private and they had all the amenities like water bottles we wanted already prepared inside! 100% would recommend."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay. Was perfect for my situation.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A warm and cozy place, absolutely perfect for a few nights. Clean, very private, easy to access and with the amazing extra bonus of having your morning coffee sitting on a porch overlooking the most stunning view of Columbia River valley. The apartment is walking distance from a public park on the river, 10' drive from historic downtown, 25' drive to Mission Ridge Ski Resort. We told Deanne we had an electric car, so she had an extension ready for us! Thank you for everything!!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Deanne's place was the perfect place to rest my head after a long evening's drive from Portland. She was very understanding and flexible with my check in and out times as I needed to work the following day and requested a late check out. The room was very clean and had all the essentials I needed to be comfortable. The bed was particularly comfortable! Thank you :)
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy place that is convenient to everything and very comfortable and spotless
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't recommend Deanne and this location enough: for the ease of checking in, the cleanliness and comfort of the space, and how incredible their communication was. We booked it late and extremely last-minute after our other plans fell through, and Deanne was immediately accommodating, which helped us save our night. What a superstar!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darling, cozy space. Comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. Close to town, but quiet and private. You can hear some road noise from Hwy 28 with the door open, but not with the door closed. We used this as a ‚Äúguest room‚Äù when we had a few friends over and ran out of space. Very comfortable. Great communication with the host."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A++ Such a great space, I would highly recommend!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice semi secluded location, great price. My 1 night stay was very comfortable. This is a small studio but cozy and neat. The only things I would suggest would be to add a curtain for the restroom window as another person suggested. There is a house directly across the bathroom window and if you have your light on at night, they get a straight view into the bathroom as well as right to your bed if the bathroom door is left open. It could also be a bit cleanlier, as there was a spider greeting me as soon as I walked in, as well as spider webs along the bathroom door corners. Other than that, this is a nice value for the money and a great location. It‚Äôs definitely a cozy and quiet stay. Would recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good location, clean and easy. Would stay here again!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, comfortable space. Big comfortable bed. Simple and easy parking and access. Fast and easy communication with host. I asked the host to leave me out a snow shovel to clear my car in the morning and she did. I was thankful."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Deanne‚Äôs place as a home base for stops in Leavenworth, Mission Ridge, and beyond! It was exactly what we were looking for - quiet, warm, comfy bed, easy access to come and go. The little kitchenette is a great size for small meals on location too. Will definitely be back soon!"

We were able to check in a little early and had a wonderful setting to visit with friends after dinner. The home is beautiful and perfect location. Very close to main part of town yet right by a park and in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. I would highly recommend the home and host!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay in Wenatchee at Brett's BnB. Great communication from the host and plenty of amenities in the house. Location is nice, right by a large park. Not too far from downtown. Overall a great stay."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little house with enough space for the seven of us. Lovely views and a nice town.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house would have been 5 stars if not for a persistent smoke smell. We're guessing a previous guest smoked during their stay and the smell of smoke was overpowering despite air fresheners and an air purifier. Given the cold temperature outside, airing the place out wasn't really much of an option, so we decided to just deal with the smell. Other than that, the place was great. I would have also appreciated a heads up about the smoke smell prior to our checkin though."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house very clean and comfortable Ôøº
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Brett's place. The house is welcoming and light. The beds are comfortable, and all rooms are nicely decorated. The kitchen is well stocked."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Brett‚Äôs Airbnb was an exceptional experience that truly exceeded my expectations. I was thoroughly impressed by how Brett has transformed this 1900s house into a modern haven while retaining its original character. The attention to detail in the restoration is evident, and it made my stay feel both unique and nostalgic.
From the moment I stepped in, the cleanliness of the place stood out. It‚Äôs clear that Brett goes above and beyond to ensure the space is spotless and inviting. The house was equipped with all the amenities one could need, making it feel like a home away from home.
Brett as a host was amazing. His friendly demeanor and eagerness to ensure my stay was comfortable made a significant difference.
In summary, this Airbnb is a gem that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, and unique place to stay. Brett has done an outstanding job with the house, and his hospitality is unmatched. A 5-star experience through and through!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came to visit family and ski mission ridge. Weather didn‚Äôt cooperate for skiing. But the house made a great place for making memories and was walkable to town. Brett gave great instructions. The home was well cared for. We would stay here again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot. Charming fits the description. Super impressed with the kitchen. We were making our own food, and they had it more stocked than most kitchens."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Brett‚Äôs for a ski weekend. The house is really cozy - next to a huge park for dogs and kids to play and on a quiet street but still walkable to downtown if you wanted (tho lots of parking options downtown if you wanted to drive the few minutes there). Beds are comfortable and shower is nice and spacious! Living room area has a comfortable couch and a nice open area.
Brett is also super communicative - didn‚Äôt have a problem at all during our stay! Would come here again!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice craftsmen home 2 bedrooms down stairs 1 up stairs. Bathroom shower only in case you have kids that need a bath.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful little place!
Just enough room to quaintly accommodate our family of 5.
The dinette on the front porch facing the park and sunrise was amazing. It was a really great way to start each day.
The location right across the street from a great little park made it easy to get out with the kids and let out any urgent wiggles.
Literally just a 5 min drive or 10-15 min walk from groceries, restaurants, etc. If that's not your thing then the kitchen had amazing cookware and appliances to get the job done. Couldn't have asked for more!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Brett provided clear and responsive communication. House was spacious and very clean. Good location with pleasant front porch.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. Wenatchee had significant wildfire smoke during our trip, but the house was sealed up tight and didn't seem to be impacted at all. The air conditioners were very effective, too. We appreciated the full kitchen and 6-person dining table, easy parking and park across the street, and great location near everything in Wenatchee. Great place!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came to town for a work event at Morris Park. Brett was super nice and friendly. Check-in was extremely easy. The house is literally a one to two minute drive away from everything it seems. One minute away from Morris Park and about two minutes away from downtown. If you are coming to town for work or just to visit and hang out, I don't think you can find a better place than this."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute, clean, well-appointed home. It had everything we needed in a convenient location that allowed us to walk and enjoy charming downtown."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great little respite from a crazy couple nights of concerts at The Gorge.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brett was very friendly and welcomed us with provided coffee and A/C units in each room for comfort which was greatly appreciated (even though we had colder weather than we anticipated). The house is cute and we had a nice stay. They had clearly vacuumed though it didn‚Äôt seem as clean as I expected. There were crumbs and old drips of things from other people on the kitchen floor. They had air fresheners but they got to be too strong. After taking a couple air fresheners out we immediately smelled dog on the carpet and couch and plugged them back in. Not much by way of kitchen pantry supplies, so if you‚Äôre looking to cook, bring or buy your own. Luckily there is a grocery store very close by. The beds were firm, but I thought mine was quite comfy and they had several pillows to use. When I booked, I guess I didn‚Äôt realize they lived below, so waking up to them making noises (seemed like closing drawers/doors kinda loudly) was a little disappointing. I‚Äôm sure they heard us too though."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brett‚Äôs place was spacious and had a great park across the street. The water pressure in the shower was amazing! Coffee was fresh ground drip coffee which was a nice touch. Had everything that we needed for our weekend stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our granddaughter brings her daughter to the park to play and when I told her where we were staying she knew exactly which house it was! Looks like a place you'd like to stay in and it is! The kitchen was well equipped. We liked the coffee beans and grinder and the coffee pot and electic tea kettle. We didn't do any cooking but we used the fridge and microwave and all was well. The living/dining room area was comfortable. The individual AC units worked well on two very hot days. The bathroom was nicely done with a really nice shower. The beds in both downstairs bedrooms were really comfortable. We even enjoyed sitting on the chairs on the front porch. We weren't there much as we were in town to visit family, but would choose to stay there again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay! Clean place and easy to find and check in.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I love Wenatchee and this is a great place to stay. A nice older house that has been updated to make it comfortable but hasn't lost it's charm. Across the street from a park and close to downtown, but not too close. I hope to get back there next year."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you Brett!!

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Never know what to expect when staying somewhere with no previous reviews, but our stay was excellent. Everything was clean, communication was great, exactly as described. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house with everything you could need. Gorgeous view of Wenatchee too! Would highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back. Lisa was very nice and great to work with.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at this beautiful house! The cleanliness and stunning views were impressive. The game room provided endless fun for everyone. It‚Äôs clear that the host is very caring, providing all the necessary appliances and even some snacks. A perfect place to stay, and all my friends thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had booked the house for two families, 4 adults and three kids. It was perfect for us. Kids room was well prepared with a bunk bed and few games and puzzles. Outdoor area, games and the garage was set up really well for a staycation. We had a really good time and would definitely stay here again, if we are to travel to Leavenworth."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had the pleasure of staying at this charming home, and it was an absolute delight for both the kids and the adults. From the moment we walked in, we loved the warm and inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home.
Kids were thrilled with the playroom, stocked with toys, books and games suitable for every ages. The house was impeccably clean and well-organized with large bedrooms, making it easy to settle in and relax. The kitchen was fully equipped, which had all the essential utensils to prepare meals for everyone including kid-friendly utensils and dinnerware.
The hosts were incredibly welcoming and provided us with helpful tips and recommendations to make our stay even more enjoyable. Overall, our experience was nothing short of wonderful. We highly recommend this home to any family looking for a kid-friendly stay that doesn‚Äôt compromise on comfort or style. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house ‚ú® Comfortable bedding and clear instructions.
We felt right at home ü§ç"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnbs, this was by far the most clean and nicest homes for the price. Samantha have clear instructions for check in/check out. Would love to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, convenient location. Will be back for sure!"

Large decorated back yard with fire pit and gas grill. Neighborhood is very nice, feels safe and low traffic. Samantha is a great host and easy to communicate with. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again! Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! Cassy and Jason were responsive to our needs, the place was very clean, the kitchen is so well stocked, beds were comfortable, and my 11 year old could not stop talking about the view, while my 2 year old kept exclaiming, ‚ÄúMOUNTAINS!‚Äù If we are in Wenatchee again, we will definitely be repeat guests."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Most comfortable bed ever.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third or fourth time staying as Cassy's place and as usual, the experience was great! When we visit Wenatchee, we don't always layout a detailed plan and this location provides a lot of flexibility. We know that we'll enjoy peaceful evenings with beautiful surroundings if we stay in and yet it's a very short drive (or bike ride) to any number of activities closer to the river. After several years of experience with Airbnb hosts, our positive interactions with Cassy and Jason have stood out above the rest!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful location and place to stay! It‚Äôs so quiet and peaceful and seems so far out of the city but it‚Äôs only about a 5-8 minute drive to downtown Wenatchee. The house was comfortable and spacious, it had everything we needed and Cassy and Jason were so responsive and friendly. There were fun games, neat historical books, a great patio and amazing views and hiking. This is definitely where we‚Äôd stay again in Wenatchee."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice Place. Great views out the door. Inside had all that we needed for cooking etc. Dog wandering around whole time, but was quiet and friendly."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a weekend getaway. Kids friendly, awesome views and Cassy is a great host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views all around!! Great rates, great for family or private couple stay. Would definitely recommend. Great hosts!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at Cassy‚Äôs place. The beds were comfy and we had everything we needed for a 4 night stay. Conveniently located both close to Mission Ridge and town. We‚Äôll be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing view with a great location between the Ridge and the town of Wenatchee. I‚Äôll be visiting again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pros:
*It is close to Mission Ridge Ski Area.
*The beds were comfortable, the heat worked well, it had tall ceilings, and feels spacious.
*Check-in and check-out were easy.
The Cons:
*The oven doesn't work. It is damaged so that it only offers ""stay warm"" and ""convection"" ... the convection doesn't heat to the appropriate temp and only cooks to warm, not hot. We had to use the microwave to finish heating our meal that was designed to bake. The reason we use Airbnb vs a hotel room is so that we can cook our meals when we are done skiing. The control panel of the oven is clearly damaged, there is no way that the host doesn't know it's melted and doesn't work.
*limited comfortable furniture to kick back and watch a movie. One couch and chair are comfortable, the other two chairs are not as comfortable.
*The living room TV is small, only 40"", and difficult to watch a movie as a family
The description is not accurate, it was disappointing to discover the oven wasn't working."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a ski weekend and Mission and it was PERFECTLY located. The place is comfortable, looks just like the photos and is easy to get to."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy and Jason were great hosts. The house is below their house, so there is some light foot noise, but overall the place is very quiet and in a beautiful setting, close to Mission Ridge. There were some small things that were broken/missing in the apartment due to others who had stayed before us and had not let the hosts know. They responded when we reached out about the missing light bulb, broken blinds, etc.
The house is beautiful and well decorated, with a very comfortable bunk bed. We loved the location, close to Mission Ridge and thought they were kind and considerate hosts. The house has all that you need (kitchen stuff for cooking, coffee maker, etc.) and was cute and comfortable. We would stay here again!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a great location for us to stay at while skiing at Mission Ridge. The hosts were very kind. The place was clean, and the beds were comfortable. Furniture and kitchenware are a little worn, but it didn't bother us. It is a very good value, and we would try to stay here again if we were in the area."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Extremely accurate photos and description of the spot. Fantastic location if you are headed to Mission Ridge. Only about 15 min from slopes. Clean, nice decor, comfortable and a great price."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home. Cassy was very accommodating in allowing us an early check-in. A private area, with a short drive to downtown Wenatchee. There were a couple things missing (shower soap and propane) but Cassy got those taken care of when notified."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful stay, just what we needed for our ski trip."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughters and I stayed here to ski Mission Ridge. Great location and nice space. Oven didn‚Äôt seem to work and a few details could have been better sorted, but overall the place was pleasant, clean, new, and very comfortable."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! We felt right at home! We skied at Mission Ridge and had dinner in Wenatchee. Cassy‚Äôs place was easy to find and very cozy and comfortable.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice quiet place that has everything you need within driving distance. It had plenty of towels, blankets, extra toiletries as well as plenty of spices and condiments. The views were amazing and we had a great time! Would definitely go back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy‚Äôs place is quiet, lovely and cozy. We feel right at home. The views were amazing too! We have had a wonderful stay! Thanks"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very good place with all amenities . The view of the mountains is great. The firepit outside in a cold day is a bonus. We roasted marshmallows :). The rooms are nice and spacious. Overall my family was very happy.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great night stay at Cassy and Jason‚Äôs. Unfortunately we only stayed one night and left early the next morning so didn‚Äôt quite get to see the surroundings completely but from what we could see, it was just beautiful! Immaculate place and warm welcome decor. My 10 year old appreciated the games. Not a bad drive from Leavenworth. Very friendly and responsive host. Would def stay again if in the area!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Me and my family absolutely loved staying here! The view of the mountains looked even better in person it was just so beautiful. We stayed over christmas and really enjoyed the details put into the place with christmas decor! Would definitely book again for my next trip to washington!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy was great at communicating fixed any issues he had really quickly.
The place is spacious and in a nice area. We enjoyed Wenatchee.
The place and linens would benefit from a deep clean."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was nice, clean. The view of the mountain in front of the window is awesome. They were a great host in communicating on what we needed to know before the check-in and arrival date."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled here for my birthday with our two young kiddos, and we truly enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival, we were greeted by two local sheep (which my kids loved). We enjoyed sitting on the patio with the fire going and waking up to the beautiful scenery outside. This property is very private and modern.
Cassy provided toys for my kids and made sure to communicate promptly when we needed something. She was super friendly and made us feel at home.
There were a few times we could hear heavy foot traffic above our unit, but as soon as I mentioned something, it was addressed. We would gladly return here in the future. Amazing airbnb!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a beautiful little home to stay in as well as an amazing view. It easily fit 6 people with no issues. Highly recommend, will definitely keep it in mind next time visiting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great base for a wenatchee visit. It fit our group of 6‚Äî a couple slept in one bedroom, and our family of 4 in the room with the bunkbed. It was a bit of a tight squeeze in that room but worked fine for a short stay. The place was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well outfitted. The views from the living room were amazing. Just wish it had been warmer outside so we could have hung out on the patio!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very easy check and check out
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great girls' weekend at Cassy's place! The location was great--it was peaceful and quiet, but still close enough to downtown that we could easily visit restaurants and shops. We had everything we needed, and the place was clean and cozy."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy's home is beautifully located right outside of the town center. It is easy to get to everything you need, but still secluded with a beautiful view of the mountains and valleys. We came to do some hiking nearby to see the changing autumn colors.
The home itself was beautifully decorated and included everything we needed, including a gas grill and fireplace to hang out by at night. Cassy and Jason were responsive when we asked for a new propane tank later in the evening."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful scenery right out the front door. Spacious home with a great espresso machine!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Clean and spacious 2bedroom ground floor unit. Has everything for a comfortable stay. It is 10 mins away from Wenatchee and 40 mins drive to Levenworth. Has a very nice front porch with a fir pit, bbq grill, and nice mountain view. Will definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Good place clean and tidy
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean place‚Ä¶great scenery. Loved the neighbors dog
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a peaceful, lovely place for a getaway. Provided great recommendations for places to eat. Clean, quiet, private space. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Casey‚Äôs place! The photos don‚Äôt show the beautiful scenery surrounding the place and could never convey the peaceful surroundings. Cuddling up around the fire pit at night or waking up to a glorious morning with the sun shining through the windows and reflecting off the mirrored wall were unexpected pleasures. The kitchen has everything you need and there are lots of little extras tucked away‚Äîmore than can be described. What an amazing place with great hosts.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed here for two nights of concerts at The Gorge Amphitheatre. (It's 45-75 minutes away, depending on traffic, in case you're wondering.) While the instructions to get there are pretty clear, I would highly suggest arriving during daylight hours so that you've done the drive at least once before you try to navigate it in the dark.
I was hesitant to stay in a place where the host is on-site, but I never once saw them. Their cute dog came to visit a few times during our morning grounding sessions in the grass & coffee on the patio. . .& we could hear them upstairs at times, but nothing obtrusive.
We unfortunately missed sunrise & sunset from the patio, but I imagine it would be gorgeous. It's peaceful & serene. . .& you can even hear cows mooing on the hillside.
Unit description & pictures are accurate. Good communication with the hosts. . .& easy peasy check-in & check-out procedures."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic find! Close to Leavenworth, 5 minutes from the Public Farmers Market, Dutch Bro‚Äôs and the best breakfast We‚Äôve had in a long time at the Wild Huckleberry. The kitchen was well stocked, plenty of linens, plus there‚Äôs a cute dog that likes pets"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cassy was very responsive, helpful, and accommodating."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really beautiful spot for our family of four. Cassy and family were exceptional and attentive hosts. We were looking for a place somewhat in between Chelan and Leavenworth, and stumbled across this listing. We ended up wishing we stayed longer simply to just enjoy the air bnb, and the view/outdoor patio space. Really recommend giving yourself at least one full evening to enjoy the sunset and fire table at night.
The unit was great - clean, private, and comfortable for adults, and our 6 and 2 year old. Hope to make it back one day!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Cassy‚Äôs place- beautiful quiet spot outside Wenatchee with great views of the hills and valley. The house had everything we needed and Cassy was very responsive . Definitely recommend it.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location with beautiful surroundings! Loved the floors and the kitchen. Exactly what was advertised. Great host and place. I highly recommend it!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked for the stunning view, which did not disappoint, however, we were pleasantly surprised to find the ultra-fluffy towels and extra soft sheets. Some Airbnbs are stocked with the cheapest furnishings the owners can find, not this place.
I will note that if you like firm pillows, you should bring one with you."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, thank you Cassy and Jason!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was an awesome stay! My kids, husband and I loved the place so much! They are very nice and easy to communicate with. Will definitely stay at Cassy's again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great experience while staying here! Jason was super nice and helpful with recommendations on what to do around town. Overall it was super clean and the beds and couches were comfy! I would come again for the hospitality and the great views :)

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We will be back for sure. This place is private and quiet. It‚Äôs very comfortable and Cassy was available and prompt when needed. This was a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place! üòÄ
Location is phenomenal as super relax part of town, yet near everything.
Really enjoyed our stay here. If visiting Wenatchee again, we would stay here again.
Negatives: washer was broken, bathroom could use a deeper cleaning."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super lovely home to stay. Really like the interior design and also the outside view!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love this place because it's not busy, the yard is beautiful, there is a nice patio, and we were able to see the great night sky. Furthermore, it's close to Saddle Rock Trail which is one of the most famous trails in Wenatchee. I can recommend it to everybody!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The afternoon outside ‚Ä¶ the view and fire pit, really nice place to relax :) love it"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful setting. Wonderful place to stay. It felt brand new! Owners were easy to work with and they went over and beyond to make our stay great!! Would definitely return!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Cassy and Jason‚Äôs apartment! The apartment is exactly as described and in a beautiful location. They were super communicative when we had questions and promptly addressed a couple small unexpected hiccups during our trip which were not their fault (a local fire and a malfunctioning washing machine). We really enjoyed our time in Wenatchee and will definitely stay here again next time we‚Äôre in town!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place üëç
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,thanks for a marvelous weekend stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot overlooking hills and vineyards. Kitchen was nice and huge! The town of Wenatchee is a short drive away and the Gorge was about an hour away. Definitely recommend for a weekend getaway.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great girlfriend getaway here. Town was only 10 minutes away. The house was spacious and well appointed. Great kitchen and patio with grill, firepit and lovely view."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will probably be spoiled from this stay being my first air BnB stay.
Amazing views, clean and well kept home. Wish I could have stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy and Jason are super friendly A+ hosts! Their private guestroom was a perfect niche on a South Wenatchee hill for my family of 4. The unit is very spacious, well lit, with all the amenities of home away from home. Kitchen and room decor is meticulously designed with comfort and taste in mind. Great views of the apple orchards. The outdoor seating is fantastic with a cozy firepit. The West Wenatchee is easily accessible in 5-7 min driving distance. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful stay in the valley with touches of luxury!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Exactly what we thought it would be. Clean. Cool and collected
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay, I wanted it to be a little more private but still worth the money."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Casey and Jason‚Äôs retreat! The house is modern and clean, plenty of space for our troop and fully stocked so we could save some money by cooking all of our meals. The quintessential Eastern Washington orchard/mountain combination view from this property is breathtaking as well. We will definitely be keeping this place in mind for future (hopefully longer) travel arrangements to the East side! Thank you Bartel Family!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! Beautiful views and a great little getaway

We appreciated their flexibility and the rooms were gorgeous, quiet, and surrounded by beautiful scenery. It was a perfect place to relax and rest during our hectic weekend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Cassy's place and we suspect it will not be the last. The location is fantastic; tucked away in the hills, but still close to town. We sipped wine by the fire both nights of our stay and had the good fortune of meeting Jason (co-host). He took the time to chat with us as the sun went down and we thoroughly enjoyed his company. Great place, great people, don't hesitate to book!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved it!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cassy and Jason's guesthouse was amazing. Very convenient for our long weekend visit to Wenatchee, close to town center, but also private and surrounded by beautiful surroundings. Kid-friendly, had some toys and kid necessities. Would highly recommend."

We enjoyed lunches and dinners at Pybus when not eating in. Be sure to catch a Wenatchee Wild BCHL home hockey game at the East Wenatchee Town Toyota Center!

We were in Washington celebrating our anniversary and we had originally booked and stayed at a different Airbnb listing. Unfortunately we had to leave that home and found this once! We wish we would‚Äôve found it when we were booking weeks ago.
It had everything we could‚Äôve needed and wanted. The kitchen is well stocked and everything was very comfortable.

The friendly sheep down the driveway added a great ending."

We mentioned it to the host and they lent us 2 sets of double tubes for our family and life jackets for our kids. The host also left us a bottle of wine as a gift.
We were a bit concerned about noise because the host lives upstairs but it was an issue all. We barely heard anything the entire that we were there.
Lastly, if you're not familiar with Wenatchee area, it's really beautiful. We ate outside every night and enjoyed the beautiful landscapes."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cassy and Jason‚Äôs place is great for a little getaway in the area. It‚Äôs not far from the heart of Wenatchee, but tucked into the foothills for that out of town feel. The views are amazing, and you‚Äôll love relaxing on the outdoor patio. A little fire pit table, some relaxing seating, picnic table and bbq. We really enjoyed having breakfast out there in the mornings.
Wifi was good, and easy to log into. Kitchen was well equipped. Beds were comfortable. The owners actually live upstairs (but we hardly heard them at all), and their adorable dog came down a few times to visit us. Probably my daughter‚Äôs favorite part, being a puppy lover. üê∂ It‚Äôs about 35 minutes to Leavenworth, but a beautiful drive with several fun stops along the way (be sure to check out the Aplets and Cotlets candy factory in Cashmere). It was perfect for our Girls getaway. We definitely recommend this place. Thanks for hosting us Cassy and Jason!"

Everything is easy to use and in good condition and of good quality. As it is on the outskirts of town, the night sky is unparalleled.
I wasn't a fan of the master bedroom mattress and there is some noise, so it's not completely quiet, say as if you were in the country. Overall, I had a very positive experience and would highly recommend the owners and the unit."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property worked well for us during our Gorge visit. It was a scenic hour-long drive to the venue. We took advantage of the 10-mile loop around the nearby Columbia River for some exercise and to get some nice community vibes.
Heather was very responsive and helpful!
The kitchen has salt and pepper, as well as some Keurig pods and coffee filters‚Äîso be sure to plan accordingly.
The mattress is very soft, so would not work well for those needing something firm (just a head‚Äôs up).
Would recommend this property and Heather, for sure!"

Directions were precise, they responded extremly fast, and it was dead of winter when we went and they made sure the driveway was shoveled and sand was laid down. Would absolutely recommend to anyone."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. A bit out of the way of Wenatchee but it is nice not being directly in the city. We enjoyed our stay and it had all of the amenities needed to have a great stay. Highly recommend this place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we are so lucky to have found this beautiful cottage. the space looked newly renovated, it was inviting, warm, and so well thought out. there were many amenities to make the space feel like home, like a provided Keurig, filtered water, hair dryer, toiletries and more. as we entered the cottage we were even welcomed with local cider and cupcakes. the cottage is only a short distance away from groceries stores and shopping areas. we stayed for the weekend to explore leavenworth and snowmobile, both locations were any easy drive from the cottage and even in the middle of the snow storm our hosts cleared the entire driveway before we arrived back for the day. heather was extremely kind and we look forward to staying again during our future travels. thank you!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed in the twin bed, small Bonus room, in the Swiss style chalet built by Heidi‚Äôs husband. Excellent location near Leavenworth. Steep hiking trail in the hills at back of the house, along electric fence, for the goats. Will definitely be back."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had such a lovely stay! Heidi's amenities were so thoughtful: she had clear instructions and would leave little treats in the coffee bar. Very comfortable room that's surprisingly practical for its small size! Heidi and her husband are very friendly and welcoming.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Liked this place a lot, it was kept very clean and I loved the fact that I was at a ranch. The kitties were my favorite part! There is marked parking spaces in front which made unloading so easy and the house has a great view."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Their cats make great host/hostess, but Daddy is great too (the host herself happened to be away). No fuss, simple getaway I wanted, at a surprisingly warm and genuine family ranch home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay! Super friendly hosts. 30 mins from Leavenworth and 1 hr to Stevens Pass. Heidi had gone out of her way to help me with some of my snowboarding gear. The home itself was beautiful. The cats and horses were so cute (: Exceeded my expectations!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'll never stay anywhere else.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, very cozy and the cats were awesome! The hosts were kind and courteous."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a cozy space in a beautiful location! I loved waking up to the snowcapped mountains and having breakfast with the cats for company. Heidi was so kind and responsive and her husband Martin was fun to talk to. This place is a great deal and I'll definitely come back here for another overnight trip in the area.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Heidi‚Äôs place definitely felt like you were walking into a loving home . Bedroom was clean , the place was nice and warm during the winter and her cats were lovable and amazing . I didn‚Äôt get a chance to actually meet Heidi cause I spent the majority of my time in Leavenworth but I did get to enjoy her amazing baking ."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely stay with Heidi again. The home was absolutely beautiful and she was kind. From the moment I booked, she was responsive and eager to assist. All instructions were outlined and from the moment I arrived I was greeted with warmth and hospitality. She made muffins from scratch, keeps the home in stellar condition, has a coffee/cider/ cocoa bar with a mini fridge for us. The cats were amazing and I loved the scriptures in the home. There is also an area with various brochures of things to do locally. Thank you for your kindness and for sharing your home. I‚Äôll be back soon !!! Can‚Äôt wait to feed the animals again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really loved the house. It‚Äôs so huge, and so quiet at night. It‚Äôs a really peaceful house. They also have two cats that were really really cute. Definitely would come back again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'm SUPER EXCITED to stay there again. being on that side of the mountains is a regular occurrence for me and I'll definitely be back. Love the Cats.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here! It's about 25 minutes away from Leavenworth making it a great place to rest but still have access to all of the downtown amenities that Leavenworth has to offer. This house felt like home to me. They also had the most adorable, cuddly cats! Great hosts. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended !!! Heidi and Martin are very kind people! The ranch is huge and beautiful and the pumpkin cookies that Heidi made were delicious.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and lovely place for travellers to take a rest
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi‚Äôs place was exactly as described - peaceful, quiet, and beautiful! I had a lovely stay and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book with her again."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful location and a lovely house. It wasn't quite clear how to access the outside sitting area, since you had to go through the private kitchen. However once outside it was a nice place to sit and look out to the hills."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a unique experience to stay over at this place. The house is at a farm with horses and goats. It is facing a hill which might block the Mountain View which I was expecting. But I was able to see some wild animals passing through. The house has a lot of country style decorations which personally I like a lot. There is a garden is right outside of kitchen with running fountain, little pond with fish, growing vegetables/fruits, and blooming flowers. I enjoyed sitting in the backyard for the entire afternoon with some fresh grapes. Yes, Heidi offered fresh fruits for her guests and they were so delicious since they were just picked from farm. Although I cannot use the kitchen or living-room but that didn‚Äôt bother me much. Maybe my time is right. Flower is blooming. Pears are ripe. Weather is gorgeous. Cats are friendly. Wish life is always beautiful like that."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so awesome and matched the description! It was perfect for my solo adventure! It reminded of Switzerland. The surroundings were so peaceful! The view of the mountains and animals were so relaxing!
It was just 20 minutes to enchantments which I hiked, and to Leavenworth.
Heidi and her husband are marvelous hosts! Their cats were super cuddly too! Heidi even gave me yummy grapes and boiled egg before I left! Thanks for sharing your home with me!
Highly recommended!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Stoller ranch is a nature paradise in a beautiful wooden house built by Martin, the husband of heidi. You will have excellent views a private small waterflow, and a cozy place in made by excellent quality wood. Heidi is a really friendly and lovely person, and I like too the initiative and work of Martin to build a so lovely place. You have a big ranch to walk and see the views and the animals. In the night the stars are bright and the morning is bright and silent. Enjoy a coffee in front of the valley is a lovely experience. High roof tops. and EXCELLENT HOSTS. They are people you like.!! The room was small but i lke this kind of places, so i enjoyed also the room, and was like announced. The price was very good, and the only thing is that is a little retired from Town, so you are in the mountain. A little isolated, can be good for some people, and not so good for people who like shopping and towns. In my case I love Stoller Ranch!! I will repeat if I can!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for solo travelling - if you love cats it is also a bonus!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house, everything is perfect"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good price cool place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd stay here and was perfect for what I needed. Super peaceful, clean, easy check-in and the home is wonderful. The drive up to the property is also beautiful and relaxing - just what I needed and will be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay! Heidi was out of town during my stay, but her communication with me was perfect. Martin was great as well. He's got a dry sense of humor and I truly enjoyed our banter. I stayed in the little Eiger room, which was very cozy and perfect for my needs. There are all kinds of little touches that made staying there very homey and comfortable. I would absolutely stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much Heidi and Martin!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi‚Äôs place is a total gem. Their home is off the main road making it a peaceful escape but only a 20 min or so drive to Leavenworth and minutes to downtown Cashmere. And the road to her home is flanked by acres of orchards making it a beautiful drive.
Little Eiger is absolutely perfect for the solo traveler. I only stayed for 3 days but easily could have done 30.
Heidi provided assorted breakfast foods and coffee which were delightful in the morning and very much appreciated.
If I‚Äôm ever back in the area, I would love to stay at Heidi‚Äôs again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Visited Heidi & Martin's chalet in Cashmere this July - a serene retreat with tremendous value. Heidi's hospitality shines, complete with the delightful company of three friendly cats. Despite its size, the room is cozy, well-equipped, and reasonably priced for solo travelers. The spacious bathroom and relaxing hammock in the garden add to the charm. A few minor improvements could be the room's window facing the occasionally busy backyard, and Martin's less enthusiastic demeanor towards guests. Nonetheless, this tranquil haven is ideal for solo peace seekers. Will return and recommend. A solid 5 stars!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I hope to stay again. Unfortunately my plans changed last minute and I didn't get to finish my stay. But it was a wonderful experience that did not disappoint.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi and her husband were very welcoming and kind. Beautiful home and scenery.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay, great place!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, real cozy.. but
Can't use: Living room, kitchen
Could do better with breakfast items instead of just sugary quaker oats.
Host was nice but he came off a bit harsh when I arrived.. I'm part asian and I'm not used to barging in people's homes so I rang the doorbell and he came down and the first thing he said was ""did you not read the instructions?"" (or maybe that's just the way he talks coz later we talked about the farm) Anyway, I just thought that being a host - be ready to accommodate any situation or people or circumstance. Overall, my stay was good. Drove to Leavenworth to check out the German town there and came back after 9 and the place was dead quiet ü§´. I'd come back for another stay when the time is right. Thanks to the owners."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing stay! A beautiful home in a beautiful location. Hope to be back soon and stay longer. Great hospitality and felt like family while being there.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is spectacular! There‚Äôs lots to do in both Leavenworth and Wenatchee which are both about 15-20 minutes from this location. The cats are absolutely adorable (along with all the other animals). Timea was very helpful - she gave me good recommendations for hiking/areas to explore, checked in to make sure everything was okay with my stay, and showed me around! Thank you for an amazing stay"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Home was absolutely beautiful. surrounded with quietness and the cutest and sweet cats! owners were super friendly and helpful!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay. The family is absolutely so welcoming and just amazing people in general. Heidi was such a beautiful person to talk to and so was her husband. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and see them ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was one of the most beautiful and peaceful stays I had in a while.
The gorgeous wood house makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale. All the decor and the small details well placed, together with the breathtaking surrounding, really welcomes you and shows how Heidi wants you feel home.
Heidi is very friendly, approachable, knows a lot about the area, so if you are an outdoor person, she will definitely know how to guide you!
For sure, a place if you want to take a break from the hectic life. Wish I could spend more days there."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just came for one night for a stay. I had a warm welcome, and was directed to house appropriately. Had done muffins for breakfast too. The house looks good and comfortable. It was a short room as described."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. I was only looking for a place to sleep while I secured employment and missed taking in the beauty of being on the property. This is a perfect place as a base to explore this amazing part of the country
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hiedi went above snd beyond for my stay, I would say her place and my experience was beyond my expectations. I would classify my stay as one of the top Airbnb places I have been too, i would not exaggerate to say she surpassed 5 star hotels. Whenever you‚Äôre there, expect to find a family atmosphere, warmth and love."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place. Peaceful and good place to get away.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at Heidi‚Äôs home. The Bonus Room is very small - it was fine for me because I was just sleeping there, but if you plan on spending much time at the house, maybe opt for a larger room (no common area access). The keurig bar and homemade breakfast pastries were an excellent touch, the surroundings were absolutely beautiful, and I‚Äôm obsessed with her cats. Overall, excellent stay, it was extremely cozy."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a great price! Heidi was communicative and the place was nice. Not very far from Leavenworth.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here. Could not ask for any place better. Perfect.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay at, away from the hustle and bustle of busy towns. As a fellow believer, I appreciated Heidi sharing her faith so openly. I felt safe as a solo female traveler. The coffee area is well stocked with one-time use utensils and other foods, like fresh boiled eggs, gluten-free muffins, and fruits. Also has goats and horses so cool to show off to kids. Would definitely come again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi‚Äôs place is the perfect getaway, with plenty to do within a thirty minute drive. She was organized, and the place was clean and put together with lots of thoughtful details. No problems with the wifi - I was able to stream a movie."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stollerheart Ranch is just Magical! The surroundings are incredible and the house is absolutely beautiful, extremely cozy and with a lovely energy. Heidi and Martin were such great hosts, really kind and friendly, they made me feel like at home, I highly recommend this awesome place. I‚Äôm looking forward to come back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thought this place was a great deal and accurately described - the room is tiny but the ad/pictures are clear and it was warm, clean and comfortable. The hosts were friendly and gave helpful check-in directions that saved me from blundering around in the dark. Lots of fun cats (I was amused by trying to distinguish between them in the dark or count how many cats there were, lol). It's basically a bonus/kid's bedroom in a big mountain ranch house. Perfect place for a solo ski trip.
I didn't encounter anything pushy or uncomfortable around religion, lifestyle etc., no one brought up anything like that (just noting bc I shared some people's concerns about decorations, but it's decoration, de gustibus etc.) and the hosts were interesting and friendly to me despite me probably seeming like a crazy person because of a hectic week of work and getting up there.
May be better to ski Mission Ridge from here? Really appreciate you guys and would love to stay again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Quiet and clean .
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay here. Heidi and Martin are the perfect hosts. Not only is the home amazing, the location is beautiful and serene. I stayed warm and cozy while enjoying the snowy scenery. The drink station area is fully stocked with warm drink options to enjoy while you take in the views. Do not pass up the magnets featuring photos taken by Heidi. I am also truly grateful for the wonderful help from Martin alleviating my fears of driving and parking in the snow. He went above and beyond helping us out with the snow covered car. As a Texan‚Ä¶ I was a fish out of water and they were very helpful."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heidi was a great host, very friendly, awesome cats and a Swiss style chateau, definitely recommend it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heidi‚Äôs Place was a breath of fresh air. The room was cozy and accurately described. The coffee nook was charming and had a beautiful view of the snow on the trees outside. Heidi was friendly and provided a short tour of the amenities upon my arrival. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay from arrival to check-out went really well, and I am grateful for the moments I had to connect with my hosts.
Their home felt like a country western meets a little European inn out in the mountains, and this time of year, you can enjoy time next to the fireplace in between your activity or rest.
During my stay, I took time to tuck away for a few days here, and focus on a project I had lost focus on‚Ä¶and rest (do nothing)‚Äîthis was a good place for me to do that.
Heidi was always there when I needed to fill my thermos with hot water to stay hydrated through my work, and shared some homemade GF cookies.
Worth a stopover at the Chalet if you‚Äôre passing through the area!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi and her Wonderful Family and Fabulous Home are SUPER AWESOME!!!
Excellent room, Service‚Äôs and Breakfast!!!
I would stay every day if I could!!! 5 STARS!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, easy stay. Hosts were very nice and had a cute little coffee bar set up for the morning."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi's place was just as advertised. The room is small but it was perfect for one person. She gave good directions/instructions and I was able to check in easily. The home is located in a quiet town up the mountain. It was very peaceful. I recommend!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely place, lovely people"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Short and great stay. The Eigerroom was cozy with a comfortable bed, and the house and location overall are great. Very peaceful and amazing views. Check-in with Heidi was easy and I'll definitely plan to stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with Heidi while I was getting my wfr certification in Leavenworth. Her house is very peaceful, safe, and quiet. It was the perfect place to wind down after a long day of school/exams. Both Heidi and her husband were welcoming and kind. I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a peaceful place to stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy and detailed check in and a really nice coffee bar with breakfast in the morning
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very comfortable bed and location was stunning. All the animals are a huge plus!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A beautiful, peaceful and very safe place.
I hope I can find the place like Heidi's in Airbnb anytime I need to get away.
Love happy animals there!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is so much more than the standard bed and a shower. It‚Äôs a whole experience with the house, animals (you‚Äôll be in cat heaven, fun goats, chickens; horses in the distance), views, making friends with other guests, helpful and funny hosts. It is near Leavenworth, hiking, horse riding, lakes, wineries etc.
This is a religious home, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more inspirational and spiritual rather than heavy religion.
Room is tiny, a religious girl decorated, had a comfortable twin bed, desk, chair and a screen with dvd‚Äôs to watch on. Sounds of water fountain outside. Bring slippers and possibly earplugs (depends on other people staying there).
All in all, I had a wonderful stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay for 1 person on a modest budget. Definitely off the beaten path, it took me a few turn arounds to find it in the dark. If you're a light sleeper, others in the house might keep/get you up, even though I never saw the owners and only once saw another guest. The bed was very comfortable, and all the shared spaces/ammenities were clean and useful! The coffee bar was an excellent addition. Overall, a great stay and would definitely recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was wonderful. Clean. Comfortable. Absolutely gorgeous setting. Would love to stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, very homey and comfortable. Beautiful home with a great tranquil water feature just outside the window. Room is not big but it was more than enough for me."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax after hiking the Enchantments. Beautiful setting. Loved the coffee bar with yummy muffins each morning. It was a great landing pad so I could do some more day hikes in the area. Hope to stay again!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, comfortable stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heidi has an awesome place. Truly. From the house itself to the views. She‚Äôs also super welcoming and accommodating. So happy I found this Airbnb!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely little place! Perfect for someone rolling solo who just needs an at home feel at the end of the day.

2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Avoid, avoid, avoid. Inundated with hand-written, laminated bible verses on every wall. The only thing more suffocating than the Bible verses was the overuse of air freshener/fabric softener. I‚Äôve never seen anything like that at an Airbnb."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was great!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a warm and welcoming stay with Heidi. I felt comfortable and it was great to be able to talk to her and hear all of the recommendations around the area. Very peaceful area to be.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's room is small and very cozy! I had everything i needed. As it was Summer, i left window slightly open at night for the cool mountain air, there was a nice waterfall just outside, to loll me to sleep!
Although I left very early both mornings and never saw the hostess( she was around the 2nd evening), there are other rooms at this Airbnb, and I greatly enjoyed the couple from India who I met the 1st night, and had coffee with every morning! üòÄ. This is a wonderful place to stay, I'd stay here again, and I highly recommend it üòä"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a DELIGHT!! Heidi is kind and helpful, the landscape is incredible, and the value is 10/10! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my stay. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A homey stay while the host was celebrating Father's Day. I enjoyed relaxing on the deck catching up on the Internet and took a hike on the hill behind the house. The host was informative and the treats were delicious.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our daughter, a professional actress has had a lovely experience staying with HeidI while working locally.
It is a wonderful place to be and relax after a full day of work with the Leavenworth Summer theater!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was in town for my aunt's funeral. So it's not the happiest reason to be at a place. My stay was good. I received clear instructions on how to check-in. The ranch and the house were lovely. There is a pleasing view from the breakfast nook. It was a nice way to start the day. What I needed was a bed, a bathroom, and a light breakfast. That's exactly what I got, plus some added bonuses. The cats were very friendly and a joy to pet. I loved seeing the horses and goats around the property. The view out the window of Little Eiger Room is the patio with a waterfall. It's calming. The room is small, but perfect for one person. There is a single bed, a petite desk, a chest of drawers, and they have a monitor set up with movies available on it. I did not watch any movies, but it was nice to know I could. There is a shared bathroom. I was the only guest for the night, so sharing didn't come into play. As others have commented, if you are staying during snowy months, you will need a 4x4 vehicle."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is like staying up in the Swiss or Italian Alps. The house is set on the side of a green valley with beautiful farms below. I woke up to deer in the pasture, baby billy goats, and little chicks. The house is huge and very nice and clean. The hosts were super friendly and offered to give me rides while my truck was being worked on in Cashmere. I thought that they were way above and beyond any expectations I had. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay as always- cozy, comfortable, and convenient. And Heidi baked some delicious muffins too! Looking forward to coming back at some point later this year."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent three days at the ranch during a short-term work assignment in Cashmere. The ranch and surrounding property are so beautiful.

It was just right for my stay and I look forward to going back twice more in the upcoming weeks."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm so thankful that I ended up staying here while I was working in the area! While I didn't get to meet Heidi in person until halfway into my stay as she was away for a few days, she was very communicative by cell phone and made herself available for any questions. In the interim, her cats were excellent hosts, as was her husband Martin. :) He is early to rise, and I was able to chat with him about life on the ranch before heading to work.
Regarding the room, it is perfect for a solo traveler with a single bed, dresser for clothes, and a desk at which to work. The wifi made it easy to get online work done, and the coffee from the coffee bar did too. Heidi made sure to add little touches throughout her home for guests, from the Keurig coffee maker, to grab and go cereal bars and oatmeal, to fresh tangelos to break your morning fast with. The shared bathroom and room were spotless, and the communal areas were very tidy.
I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance! It's a lovely retreat if you're a solo traveler looking to stay connected to the outside world but get a taste of the country, and Heidi, Martin, and their cats are solidly amazing people to get to know. Hope to see you guys again soon!"

I‚Äôm usually more of a shy person and they immediately had the ability to get me out of my shell during my stay! The beds were comfier then ever and the rooms had a comfortable and safe feel to them!

Overall it was a beautiful place to stay at and I would 100% come back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved my stay here. Since I came solo the little Eiger room was perfect for me.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi and her husband created the most charming place together. And their hospitality is outstanding! A real treat for me who is European to experience a Swiss chalet just two hours away from home. I cannot thank them enough for the experience.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Y'all, Heidi & Martin's cute ranch is what makes a traveler- not a tourist. Seeing how locals live and create a cozy home is part of the fun. The hill parking was daunting at first but totally doable with 2WD."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room was very clean and well-kept. Heidi was very kind and hospitable. It‚Äôs the perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre traveling solo and need a spot to crash for the night. I‚Äôd book it again without hesitation.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place literally (not figuratively) can‚Äôt be improved upon! Kindhearted people- helps to understand Swiss culture to fully apprehend singular experience. Having visited now 59 countries including Switzerland; having AirBnB‚Äôd in many places this surpasses all. No exaggeration needed. Thank you to both.
Martin and Heidi‚Äôs Hospitality shows in that they truly care.
Loved the very personable cats as well- each have such personality - all seem like show cats- loved the animals
Horses, goats, chickens, cats-
Very likely the most enviable destination in Washington State- if not entire Pacific Northwest"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very sweet place to stay.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bedroom is super small. I felt like I was in a closet than a bedroom. I didn't have that much room to put my things. The bed was OK since it's a one person fold out chair. It could have been a lot worse since she added extra padding. I barely fit on the bed length wise since I am 5'11. It didn't bother me that much since I am used to sleeping on a shorter mattress. I loved the coffee bar. She actually had snacks and candy for her guests. She had a good selection of tea and coffee. In addition, she had hot chocolate and hot apple cider. The mini-fridge was clean and worked like a charm. The bathroom and shower were clean too. I love her cats!! She has six cats that come inside at night. Some of them are very friendly and want to be petted. The room was at a great price for the accommodations. It was a nice place to stay after working all day. I would stay there again."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heidi is a wonderful and kind host. The chalet is off the beaten path which I think is great - it‚Äôs incredibly peaceful, homey and gorgeous. I enjoyed my brief stay very much and will be back again!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heidi's place is a perfect rest stop for a weekend in the Cascade loop. It's very close to Leavenworth. The chalet is beautiful. The little eiger room where I stayed may be a bit small for tall people but otherwise it's really comfortable.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for 2 nights. The bedroom feels bigger than pictured. I had a few bags with me and I was able to place them in the room without it being crowded. I am 5'6"" and the bed was the perfect length for me. Room smells really good! The house was definitely beautiful and had this lodge feel to it. Heidi and Martin were very kind and super easy to chat with. Every morning there was different kinds of baked goods that Heidi prepared. This place had a great system for guests to use the shared bathroom, never had to wait. Overall a comfortable and great experience!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a perfect place to stay near Leavenworth! The room was super cozy, everything was clean and welcoming.

As she says, it is off the beaten trail, maybe 15 min from the fwy, but wonderful escape with loads of appealing seating areas outside in the back. Her goats are a hoot to watch. I enjoyed feeling more in the country. She really tries to make extra touches for her guests. Recommend this!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly hosts the both of them! Clean, exactly as calm and refreshing as it looks like, will be staying with again and hope to develope my already complicated relationships with their 6 cats. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stoller Ranch is a beautiful place to stay. The drive in is a bit long, but definitely worth it! The home itself is gorgeous and very homey. The animals are friendly, the sky is gorgeous at sunset, and the stars are all bright at nighttime.
Heidi is a wonderful host who is friendly and hospitable in every way. The coffee bar she provides is above and beyond. Coffee, fresh fruit, and breakfast bars and much more. She also has tons of brochures and advice for what to do around the area which is super helpful.
This room was a good size for me personally but may not be for everyone as the bed is quite small as she mentions in the listing. The bed itself was decent, but if I were to stay again for more than one night I would definitely book a different room in her house.
There's a small fridge and microwave to use in the common area, but note that there is no kitchen access so it is probably better for a shorter stay unless you plan on eating out for most meal."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely stay in their beautiful home. Super comfortable and clean, loved the movies available to watch, and loved the great little breakfast nook. Would love to stay again the next time I pass through!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There was something magical about this place. You park on a street and enter a path through the trees. The room was already open and inviting. The details were exceptional -- the fridge had a few treats, essential oils and diffuser was a welcome antidote to being in the car for hours and the clawfoot bathtub was immaculate with a window view of the trees and the sky. Every time we thought we needed something it was there. Traci was very kind to let us return for a last minute use of the wifi for an emergency communication we needed to make. We are grateful for the welcoming comforts she provided, her eye for detail is SUPER HOST level. BAM!"

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice location. For being in a neighborhood setting, it is very private and hidden from view by trees and plants. Nice lighted walkway to cottage.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci's place was exactly what my husband and I needed after we spent the day adventuring around Leavenworth. It was cozy, warm, and sprinkled with Christmas decorations that made it really feel like a place we could relax in."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place couldn't be better. I love it so much. The beautiful surrounding and a private location for us. The room was also clean and well-equipped. I'll definitely be booking again. Strongly recommend for those who want a cozy and lovely getaway.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely oasis for an overnight stopover on my trip. Everything was comfortable, I had what I needed and I especially loved the bath experience! Traci was a wonderful host and even helped with a last minute item on my holiday to do list. Wish I could have stayed longer and hope to return sometime!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Traci's place had everything we needed for our stay! My partner and I had a quick overnight visit to check out the lights and festivities in Leavenworth with our pup and Traci's place provided every amenity we could need for a brief overnight. It was clean and organized and we absolutely loved being able to soak ourselves in the large clawfoot tub!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I loved Traci‚Äôs place it was cozy and elegant. I will be staying again next time I‚Äôm in town!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was was quite and cozy. We enjoyed our stay.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute and cozy space - you feel like you're in the woods and not in suburbs! Tons of cute, thoughtful and useful amenities and soaking in the cast iron tub was a delicious treat after a long day! Traci is sweet and welcoming to her human and canine guests and we'd definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super clean space and communication is great! Traci even asked if we needed a dog bed before we came, love all the warm touches. Also great location."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a sweet, little nook atop Sunnyslope, in amongs a lovely, shady garden of trees and shrubs. I can only imagine how much more cool this place would feel when it's hot. The contrast to the sparseness of the surrounding neighbourhood to this lushness is striking. Though we didn't meet Traci in our stopover for one night, she was very responsive. The clawfoot tub is a bonus! The bed was Super Comfortable. Loved the treats, teas & coffees. Thank-you. We would absolutely stay again!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and private. There was nothing wrong at all with the property and the bed was very comfortable. Very cute, well maintained, and thoughtfully furnished. Quiet neighborhood and never heard anything while in the room. It was pretty private on the small deck but not 100% private.
The listing is accurate to a point. It is very cute and ""cozy"" as the title says. Not sure where the ""breakfast"" part of ""Bed and Breakfast"" was. There were 2 packets of oatmeal available so maybe that was it... It says no TV but want to make sure people know that. I missed that on the listing. Not a big deal but was expecting to be able to wind down the evening with some news.
My biggest issue was that there was NO SHOWER. The listing does not say that there was one but I assumed there was. There is only a very cute tub. I am a big boy and a tub is not feasible for me. I also can wash my hair when I am trying to rinse in water that my body stewed in. Game changer for me. NO SHOWER"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little staycation - would stay again in a heart beat!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very clean.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracis place was very relaxing, clean and close to everything. Bed was comfortable,"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were only there for one night. We arrived late in the evening, after booking only a couple of hours before!
Traci was very responsive and had everything prepared when we arrived - so many nice additions to the room, like turndown chocolates, aromatherapy diffuser, claw foot tub with bath salts, all sorts of teas and a keurig for coffee, a small fridge, cozy bathrobes, and a multi-device compatible charging cable. Even as short as our stay was, it was lovely!
Note for future guests: there is no shower, but the bathtub is glorious"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Accommodated very well with our dog! Super happy with the stay!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time here with our pup! Check in was a breeze, Traci was very accommodating and the place felt just like home. It was everything we needed! Highly recommended. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It was our first overnight adventure with my aging pups. Somehow we managed to remember everything but the pups food üòï. Luckily the owner stopped in to deliver a few things and was able to save us a trip to the store by bringing us some. The view from the backyard was beautiful. We also enjoyed the clawfoot bathtub and the privacy that the landscaping and plants provided.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was perfect for my stay! I was in town for a work trip so having a quiet place to come home to at night and relaxing was great. Traci was very responsive and helpful, and the room was well-equipped with all necessary amenities. Might just have to stay again sometime!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space for a short stay with easy check in!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! Traci's place exceeded our expectations. From the ""turn down"" service she provided because we were arriving very late in the evening to all the sweet touches she provided that were unexpectedly delightful, we were just delighted. We loved the large stand-alone tub, the private porch area where we enjoyed our morning coffee (it was like being in a hidden forest!), the cozy bed... it was just a darling place all around.
We went to a concert at the Gorge and drove to Wenatchee following the show -- the drive took about an hour and 15 minutes but it was worth it (and so much better than driving back to Seattle late at night!). We will definitely book again the next time we go to the Gorge or need a place to stay in Wenatchee."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! Everything was so neat and cozy. Beautiful views and location, extremely peaceful and inviting. Traci was so kind and welcoming to be sure we had everything we needed, including for the doggo! Such a comforting place and detailed with cute and thoughtful decor/amenities. Side note: The bathtub is AMAZING. I will definitely be staying again if we come out this way for a sweet, relaxing getaway! Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci did a fantastic job of thinking about the details. She included a fan and space heater to make up for the lack of temperature control, which was amazing. There is a floor vent in front of the door that you can open or close, but we didn‚Äôt realize that until we were checking out, so the fan was a huge help for us. She had epsom salts for the bath and a wide selection of hot teas, making it such a nice spot for a getaway!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traci was very kind in welcoming us and our cat to her beautiful room and bathroom. We loved the private landscaping to the room and appreciate all of the snacks, available hygiene products, and linens/towels/bedding. It worked perfect for our white water rafting trip in the Columbia River in addition to us being able to visit Leavenworth. I highly recommend if you need some R&R and escape from the hustle and bustle of life."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My pup and I stayed here along a road trip to the Seattle area. I was able to catch a great concert at the Gorge on the first night and was nearby Leavenworth and surrounding areas for our next stop. The place was charming and I absolutely loved the path to the unit. My elderly pup seemed to enjoy himself too. He did end up needing an urgent vet stay our morning of check out and Traci was helpful with the timing of things. I‚Äôd happily stay here again. Quiet and safe new neighborhood too. And I second Wild Huckleberry. Pleasant little breakfast spot.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice, clean room to stay in."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space Traci provides is peaceful and beautiful. It felt like I was definitely in a secluded environment. Very relaxing. I hope to come back and stay again. üòÑ

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great stay!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I had a wonderful and romantic time. Traci's super cozy and cute airbnb made us feel comfortable and right at home. We brought our 15lb pup with us and Traci had a bed, treat and food/water bowl all ready for our fur baby. He loved the treat and slept soundly on the bed the entire night. The view while taking him on walks was absolutely gorgeous, mountain views just a block down the road. 100/10 will definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traci has created a secluded forest get-away in the middle of a suburb. It is a beautiful setting, cozy inside and very convenient. We would happily stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! Like the description, the space was cozy like a tiny home. We really appreciate the emphasis on relaxation with the bath (note: no shower) and diffuser.
Easy drive to town and great hiking! Also appreciate it being pet friendly for a small fee. Traci provided a bed and dog bowls for our fur baby!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had an excellent Valentine‚Äôs weekend in the mountains, thanks to Traci‚Äôs lovely accommodations! The bath is so comfortable and she even provided us some aroma therapeutic bath salts. The small touches (like chocolates on the bed when we arrived) added to how homey the space felt! This space is extremely private and well located in Wenatchee. Thank you, Traci, for a wonderful stay!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We'd the perfect getaway! Smooth check-in, comfortable accommodation. We got the much needed break from our regular lives. The location is extremely beautiful. There were a few games that we loved playing. The tub was the best part, after a long day of snowshoeing, ending the day by soaking in the tub was just perfect to get rid of the tiredness. It was a relaxing experience.
We'd left the phone charger in the car and were too tired to go out again, to our surprise there were chords for charging your devices. These personal touches are greatly appreciated.
We would definitely want to stay again when we visit Wenatchee. :-)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay! Traci was a sweet host, helpful, friendly and easy to communicate with. We loved the location and the room was very cozy and comfortable. Would absolutely come again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I would recommend this location to anyone who would like to take advantage of Leavenworth and the surrounding areas. Super private spot and felt like home for the short stay it was for us. Thank you again Traci for opening up your home to Kristin and myself.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy provided a neat and cozy private room, which functioned well as a cost effective hub for Leavenworth explorations.
Traci was proactive about communicating through the app to assure seamless check-in and was available through the app; quickly providing options when we discovered our stay may have been extended by an avalanche block ing our only way home.
The room was very clean, the bathroom was refreshing, and the checkout was easy."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enchanting place to stay. Almost like walking into a fairy tale. Beautiful stand of birch trees as you enter the path. The inside is charming and comfortable. We- my dog and I were supplied with yummy treats. I‚Äôm grateful I found this little gem.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traci‚Äôs place is very clean and very accommodating to pups which is so nice to find! It is cozy and pretty tight for 2 adults and a dog. Would be more appropriate for 1 person. Worked ok for us as we were only sleeping there and out for most of the day. Nice, quiet neighborhood but a drive into Wenatchee. Perfect retreat away if that is what you are looking for :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Traci‚Äôs private room is just as pictured! A very nice cozy space thats perfect for a quick getaway. Traci is great at communicating and made the check in process very easy. Easy 30 min drive to Leavenworth and 10 min drive to downtown Wenatchee. Would highly recommend Traci‚Äôs home!

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The surrounding neighborhood is lovely, as are the grounds of this cottage. Location is easily accessible.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little space!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Room was really nice but the tub was the best part. There‚Äôs a picture of the yard in the Airbnb but we never saw it. Not sure if we were allowed to use it or not, as it was not listed in the description. About 15 minutes from town so not too bad for getting around and getting things done.
Traci was very great at communicating back and forth with me. She also went and got a fan for the room when I inquired so I really appreciated that! She‚Äôs an amazing host!
Overall great place to stay, just watch your step getting off the deck!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a perfect little spot-- quiet, welcoming, cozy. So many welcoming touches. Sparkling lights line a sweet little path to the front door. Soft linens on the bed, delicious soap and lotion in the loo-- even a bowl of essential oils on offer so you can choose the right compliment for your mood. My pooch and I had a great sleep, then a nice morning walk around this very pretty residential neighborhood with a delicious cup of hot coffee in hand. Highly recommend for anyone needing a home away from home in Wenatchee area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little air bnb! Small, but had most everything we needed. Great place for people who are planning on spending most of their time out and about and just need a place to relax and sleep. Note: per the pics, it has no shower, so a little more difficult to rinse off after hiking all day. Great for relaxing though!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Traci‚Äôs cozy cabin and would recommend this spot to others traveling in the area.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place. Very clean, well decorated and lots of romantic touches.

Will definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Traci is more than a super host!

Thank you Traci!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci has thought of everything. This little cabin in the woods is a beautiful and cozy spot to stay. There isn‚Äôt a shower so we chose not to stay our whole trip, but I definitely took advantage of the claw foot tub and comfy robe. :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was fabulous. Traci has an eye for design and comfort. Having the cabin tucked in the trees is delightful. Would absolutely recommend this stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a wonderful respite away from the hustle and bustle of town but also located conveniently close. We all, including our doggie, really appreciated the many trees and plantings and the cool they provided. It was nice seeing our dog feel at home when coming into the space and finding a bed and water and a treat in her dog dishes. It felt so welcoming, very appreciated! It is lovely to look out the front door window and see sunlight filtering through the trees - but not blinding, hot light. Summers in Wenatchee can be rough! The porch faces the east and is fairly shaded. Just perfect. Just the right amount of room for the three of us: I feel that the pictures posted of the listing make it appear tinier. Kind and easy to deal with host, thank you Tracy!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great room and location
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This host is definitely a superb host. From arrival to departure you are gonna like where you are.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Little Gem. This small bedroom had everything we needed for our one night stay. Unbelieveably clean. Spot less. The decor is really cute and you feel like your in a little cabin in the woods. There is a microwave and bar fridge and that was perfect for our stay; no kitchen. No shower but a claw footed beautiful bath tub. Very comfortable bed and linens. Loved that we could bring our little dog with us. The neigborhood is extremely nice, secure and quite. Loved our stay there and Traci is a fantastic communicator. 100% would book again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A peaceful oasis with everything I needed and extra touches that made my stay here with my dog a wonderful little retreat. Soft bathrobe, thick, plush towels, comfy bed, lots of pillows to prop up against the headboard (no chair in room), extra blankets, nice dishes, cloth napkins, some choices for what to put in the beautiful claw foot tub. The neighborhood is really nice as well and I felt very comfortable walking my dog around."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci welcomed me with a gorgeous smile and made me feel right at home after my first week of vanlife full time. I was so excited to get to soak in the amazing tub and sleep in a real bed!
She went above and beyond for me and was such a blessing.
This is a wonderful space to relax, work, feel safe and enjoy scooting around Wenatchee for a few days!
Thank you Traci!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little enchanted forest oasis in the middle of Wenatchee. We loved our stay here! The place was all we hoped for and more. With a ton of little touches that made our stay that much more enjoyable. Very good location that made it easy to explore Wenatchee, the surrounding area, and Leavenworth. Definitely would stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci‚Äôs place is secluded, quite, and comfortable. It was a great place to stay while visiting the Wenatchee area. I would stay again on future visits and recommend it for those like myself that are traveling through the area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Very cozy.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci is the most generous and welcoming host I have experienced on Airbnb so far. She was quick to get in touch with me and so friendly, and her space is absolutely gorgeous. She provided some bath salts and bath essentials for her beautiful claw foot soaking tub, and many other thoughtful touches in the space like an oil diffuser that really make a difference when you need to recuperate from travel. The bed was very comfortable and the whole cabin had a lovely unmistakable cedar smell, truly living up to its name. It‚Äôs the perfect little getaway cabin, very quiet and secluded with a nice little porch as well to sit out on. Wifi is fast and check in was easy with a code. I like to meet my hosts when I travel and it so happened we were going to the same concert and Traci was kind enough to invite me to meet up and that really has made my stay in Wenatchee extra special as I was travelling alone.

The living space was comfortable, welcoming and perfect for me, my girlfriend and our 4 legged companion.

2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,me n my gf nearly got sick because the tub didn‚Äôt have enough hot water to even fill up a moderately warm bath. we patiently waited for it to ‚Äúheat up‚Äù for multiple hours and ended up heating up water in the tiny microwave to warm it up at least bit by bit. in the end we were too mad n tired of this crap to even use the bath so we fell asleep. the host never replied when we had the problems with the bath or after. just because of the bath it was the worst airbnb experience i have ever had but besides that it was aight.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Traci‚Äôs Cozy Cottage was just that‚Ä¶.cozy! Traci is a kind and wonderful host. Her little cottage was just what I needed for an overnight stay. And the kindness she shows towards your fur babies‚Ä¶..just awesome. How many accommodations you know have a bed, food, treats and toys for your pup? That right there says a lot about Traci. Will definitely stay again next time I am in Wenatchee."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Traci‚Äôs place! Totally last minute and unexpected, but what a pleasant surprise. We would have our door propped open just to view the beautiful bathroom and tub from our bed! Lol. She really did a great job making you feel as if your family was secluded and private even though attracted to the main house. It was warm and cozy and perfect! Great place between Leavenworth and Lake Chelan."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location to see Leavenworth and Wenatchee National Forest. The downtown in Wenatchee is really cool too and located super close to Traci‚Äôs place. As far as the accommodations I feel like Traci thought of everything. We were able to make coffee, she left lots of different snacks, plates/cups/cheese board/silverware and a microwave (which we loved because we get tired of eating out). The bathtub was AMAZING and so were the big fluffy robes! Her property was really pretty too, with lots of trees and privacy. Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was just so cute. Even tho it‚Äôs very close to down town the way it‚Äôs situated behind many trees I felt I was in a secluded cabin. Traci has thought of everything one might need from hairdryer to extra toothbrush to umbrella. The bathtub had me feeling like I was in a 5star resort. I never got to meet traci but could feel the kindness in the walls :) thank you for the stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy adorable suite. Very comfortable, slept well, quiet. Has a mini frig and microwave. Very welcoming. Loved the lighted path leading to the front door!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice one night stay at this quaint guest room. Traci was accommodating with a mistake on our part booking the room on the wrong day. Fortunately we were able to stay and checkin was seamless with private entrance and keypad. The room is small but met our needs for one night.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traci‚Äôs cozy suite was adorable and comfortable. We especially enjoyed sitting on the deck, reading and listening to music in the very private tree surrounded space.

We had a restful, quiet stay and we will definitely return if coming to Wenatchee. The only thing to keep in mind is that there is no shower, only the tub, but this was perfect for us!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands down on of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed at. There were plenty of amenities to make the place feel like a home.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a night this summer with our 2 dogs! It was a quick stay but it was worth it. It was perfect for what we needed. I loved the tub! Definitely recommend this place. Keep in mind it‚Äôs about 25 mins outside of Leavenworth. We didn‚Äôt mind but it‚Äôs good to know ahead when making travel plans!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a clean space with a big bath tub, but may be important to point out there is no shower. I would stay again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute and comfortable bed :). Had a nice a nice time!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a sweet escape! After camping out at the Gorge all weekend, this cedar cabin escape was everything one could even dream of. It‚Äôs the perfect size for two - easy easy to find & wonderful central location, close-by the airport & the perfect spot to take-off and explore no matter which direction you‚Äôre headed to next! It truly feels like an oasis from the moment you arrive ü§ç I‚Äôve never slept in a bed more comfortable with soft cool sheets & a heavy blanket. A/C makes it a comfortable place to cool off during the heat of the day! Cute little snow boot brush - that I didn‚Äôt even know what it was for - I came all the way from Alabama. You can tell the family put heart into this cabin - the aesthetic is perfect & truly a cozy hidden sanctuary with everything you could think of. Even, a claw foot bath tub with a view. You can see the little garden from the window! It felt like home away from home, but taken up a level to feel very spa like ü§ç will be back! Be sure to leave your story of your own adventures in the notebook!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had tickets for a concert at the Gorge and decided to make it a weekend getaway. And Traci's place more than fit the bill: be it relaxing in the claw tooth tub with the essential oil diffuser and drinking coffee on the deck, exploring the great outdoors through her local guidebook recommendations, or the easy commute to the Gorge. We're especially grateful for the thoughtful pet accommodations. Not only is Traci's place pet friendly, but she provides a dog bed and dishes, making bringing that furry best friend along super easy. Highly recommend, would love to stay again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean, and a claw foot bathtub that truly hits the spot after of a day of adventuring! Top notch."

So clean as well and great location, definitely recommend."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect guest house for me on a business trip to Wenatchee. Traci made it easy to find and get into the house, and the room was very welcoming and clean. The bed was comfortable, and the bathtub was much needed after a long work day. There was sparkling water in the fridge which I appreciated, and the whole house was surrounded by trees which felt private."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a lovely time staying in Traci‚Äôs suite for our anniversary trip. Wonderful bath with plenty of hot water made for a relaxing soak. It was so handy to have a spacious mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. Traci does a great job setting everything up for guests! Check-in was simple, and she‚Äôs very responsive. I‚Äôm sure its a plus for many travelers that she accommodates pups. We could hear her own through the door on a few occasions, but that‚Äôs understandable. We had some friendly kitties greet us in her front yard, as well, which for us was an unexpected plus. Great location, great accommodation, great host!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely Lovely Retreatü•∞Bathtub is amazing!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little spot. Private and clean.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful space you have created, Traci.
Sometimes AirBnB stays are in a place that feels a bit run-down; not so here. This felt like staying in the guest bedroom of a very nice home, complete with beautiful art and tasteful decor. The absolutely decedent bathroom was a delight, with a soaking tub and extra-plush towels. Loved her iron tree branch sculptures, and all the little touches she put into the room. Excellent hospitality.
The one thing I will note is, I failed to notice there isn't actually a shower. I was in town for work and it was very hot (July) - normally I would take a quick shower but that was not an option, and it felt a little wasteful to fill the big tub during a drought unless I was going to use it. All in all that was very minor thing and I made do - and the flip side is, I did take full advantage of the tub, too, when I had time to enjoy it! At the end of a long day, a nice soak felt so great!
The tranquil back patio and the gorgeously landscaped property felt secluded and private - like being in my own forest retreat, with lit trails through the trees. A+, would definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay here. We would recommend it to anyone.

I also appreciate the accommodation of my dog, and the provision of bowls, a bed, and a treat :)
I also really loved the neighborhood - beautiful views, quiet, and just a nice place to walk around."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at Traci‚Äôs little hidden gem! The accommodations were top tier and the location is really convenient to everything Wenatchee has to offer! We‚Äôll be back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely place, the feeling is very zen and serene, quiet and inviting. It is beautifully appointed and had everything we needed.

The room was cozy and had everything we needed. The house was quiet and we felt very welcome. Dawn was the perfect balance of gracious and helpful, but not intrusive.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the delightful Airbnb property hosted by Dawn.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dawn and her home are amazing!! We arrived quite late and Dawn was wonderfully accommodating. I only wish we had more time to visit with her as we were only there one night. Her breakfast the next morning was next level good and her company was even better. It was fun to get to know her. The bedroom and bathroom were just what we needed after a long day of travel. The bed was super comfortable. I highly recommend Dawn and her home to you.

It was also nice having your own private bathroom in the bedroom so you didn‚Äôt have to bother anyone walking around the house. Everything was clean, and accessible.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious, definitely a great start to the day while we headed to the next part of your journey. We will certainly stay again if we need to be in the area.
Thanks a lot Dawn!"

Can't forget the sweet kitties!
I do hope to stay here again and can't recommend Dawn's place enough. A must stay in Wenatchee if you are lucky enough to find an opening."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Dawn's place was a perfect pit stop for me and my rat before traveling home. The bed was comfortable and the room was very neat.

Wenatchee is a relatively small town, so everything is 15 minutes away or less. Dawn was gracious about my very late arrival. The room and bathroom are very clean and very comfortable. The bed is exceptionally comfortable. The shower has plenty of hot water and great water pressure. I like that there is a coffee machine in the room, with coffee, tea and a variety of snacks.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved Rachels's place. Rachel offered early check in as I attending an event that evening. Unfortunately I was unable to take advantage of it. I arrived late that evening and was in awe after I looked at the place. The place looks exactly as described. It was close to the venue that I visited along with several other places. After I arrived, I went to the bathroom to change clothes and I immediately felt warmth beneath my feet. It was cold outside and this felt soooo good. The bathroom floors are heated which is great. There is a magnifying makeup mirror which would have been very beneficial to me had I dressed at Rachels place. This was the first place I stayed at that didn't have white towel which I really appreciate. She had soap made from goat milk which made skin soft. The bed was so comfortable that I removed the sheets to see the brand. The carpet was so soft. I could have stayed there forever. I highly recommended her place."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The basement studio was beautiful. You can tell it‚Äôs a new remodel and everything was immaculately clean. Rachel had a cute welcome sign with all our names and it was such a sweet touch. The bathroom is huge and had a spa feeling to it. House is closed to Street but we didn‚Äôt hear anything. The house is very quiet. We stayed for an event at the Toyota Convention Center and it was a 5 min drive to location. Definitely recommend staying here.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Very comfortable, lots of room and all the amenities. I especially liked the snacks in the well-stocked kitchen, as well as the cool light fixtures on each side of the bed. Awesome value, will book again the next time I‚Äôm in Wenatchee."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachael‚Äôs place looked quite new! It was clean, inviting and had an amazing bathroom! It‚Äôs a great location about 30 min from Leavenworth and it‚Äôs a steal compared to the hiked up prices of staying in Leavenworth proper. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My teenage son and I stayed here while visiting local family. Rachael was an excellent communicator - I had several questions and she always responded very quickly and helpfully. The house was easy to find, and we had a code to get in through a private entry. Even my son said ‚Äúwow this is really nice!‚Äù when we opened the door to the space. It was like a cool studio apartment. There was a little electric fireplace and a small kitchen with a fridge, cooktop, microwave/convection oven, and Keurig coffee maker with a ton of options (including cocoa). We really appreciated the snacks and enjoyed playing board games. There were so many nice little touches and even a portable crib for folks traveling with a smaller kiddo. We had forgotten something so we needed to run to the store and there was a WinCo within a half mile or so - we walked there after dark and felt very safe.
All in all just a great visit and we will definitely stay here again if we need a place in Wenatchee!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My two sons (10 and 13) and I thorouhly enjoyed our stay! We all loved the spa-like bathroom! It's what I would describe as very sensory-friendly for anybody with special needs (ASD, anxeity). It's clean, lighting can be adjusted (sliders to turn down brightness), and it has a private entrance. The hostess went out of her way to make the apt. feel like home, with personalizations and treats. Kids enjoyed the snack bars, I enjoyed the goat-milk soap!
I also think this location is especially nice for North Wenatchee - the senior center is around the corner and beyond that is a school field, so any sports enthusiasts or joggers would love having a soccer/baseball field ""right there"". I totally felt safe having my kids walk around in the neighborhood by themselves. They could go down Maple (there are sidewalks) and walk around/across the sportsfield during daylight hours.
Thanks, Rachael! We'll be back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just as described; can't wait to return! It's surprisingly hard to find a place in Western WA with a king bed and air conditioning. This one also has access to Speed Queen laundry machines!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb that I‚Äôve ever been. Great experience and atmosphere.
Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"super cozy, comfortable, clean. bed was so comfy. lots of amenities. hostess was readily available via phone call or email. space was absolutely perfect. lots of nice personal touches. I didn't want to leave, I absolutely love this place. walkable distance to multiple stores. not far from town at all. I highly recommend Rachel's listing to anyone. I cannot say enough good things about this rental. Rachel States that she apologizes for any possible noises from upstairs, which is where she and her family live, but actually I think my aunt and myself were probably louder (laughing) than any of the noise I sort of heard from upstairs. I am hoping I didn't disturb her. neighborhood was wonderful, clean, and I felt very safe in this area. lots of nice little personal touches. I hope that I get to stay here again if it's not already booked in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was really nice. Spacious, well-decorated, comfortable, great A/C (it was hot outside), and very quiet.
The location worked incredibly well for me. I was doing the move in process for an apartment nearby and shopping for essentials for it and could do that without getting bogged down in construction traffic or even really leaving the side the streets. It was perfect.
I had a great experience staying here."

Well appointed interior dining table, small desk unit, couch with two recliners, a bathroom to die for which had a heated floor and a comfy king size bed for a great night of pleasant dreams.

Molly the dog was my absolute favorite and was so friendly we wish we could've stayed longer! Overall very beautiful and Rachael gave us a local breakfast recommendation, The Wild Huckleberry, which was delicious and a perfect stop before getting on the road! Thanks again for everything!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's such a great spot! The space is very easy to access and feels very private. Living space and kitchen were clean and comfortable. The bathroom is the real gem, though, with heated floors and a huge shower. I'd definitely stay again when I'm in town."

We hope to return again and would highly recommend to anyone in this area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Basement airbnbs are always a gamble.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachael‚Äôs retreat is the perfect getaway. She treats you with handcrafted lotions and soaps, snacks, and water.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures didn‚Äôt fully do it justice! A super cute place/a lot of attention to detail. For us it was just a place to crash for a night, but it was definitely a cozy place and convenient location"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachael has created a beautiful space out of her basement. The bathroom is especially modern, warm and luxuriously spacious. The only reason for our 4-star rating is that it was listed as a 1 bedroom but it is actually a studio. Only the bathroom has a separate space. We travel with our young child and having a separate bedroom for her to fall asleep in allows us to have some time to watch tv, play a game and/or just hang out and talk. Instead, staying in a studio means we have to go to bed when she does and all rise together. It was probably good for us to get the added rest, but we definitely thought we were booking something different and were disappointed by the inaccuracy. Highly recommend this space for a solo individual or a couple, though, if you happen to be staying in Wenatchee. Otherwise, it was lovely and the keyless entry allows you to check-in without needing to coordinate a meetup and the design of the space never makes you feel like you are staying below someone‚Äôs home."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was very thoughtful and clean. Great hosts!
Went out of their way for us to have a great stay. Thank you!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachael‚Äôs place is superb, one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Pleasantly surprised by the many small and yet personal touches Rachael put in to welcome her guests - personally hand crafted soap and lotion, snacks etc. It did not feel like a basement at all, the room was huge , beds were comfortable and the bathroom was THE Best ! . Rachael also graciously offered her upstairs kitchen to let us use the stovetop to cook our dinner. I highly recommend this fabulous place . Thank you Rachael !"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Rachael and Charlie's house was an amazing experience. I only saw Charlie and Molly (their dog) and during that time Charlie gave me some good local tips and drove me to the airport at 5 AM! I asked if there was a taxi service I could use, and he seemed to know that it wouldn't be possible so he offered to drive me with Molly! His hospitality was a highlight of my trip to Washington. I felt more than welcome and would absolutely suggest this stay to tired travelers. (They also offered some nice handmade sample soaps/lotions for washing) I'd take this over a hotel any day!"
