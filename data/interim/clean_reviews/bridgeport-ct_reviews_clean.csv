The temperature stayed around 60 degrees except for 5 hours of the 39 hours we stayed. The host did come to try to fix the issue but for some reason, even though the thermostat was set at 70, the heat only came on intermittently and often blew cool air.

I would absolutely stay there again if accommodations were needed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was super clean and cozy. Super romantic with the lighting and candles. Ricardo was super helpful with responses and recommendations. Only down side of the stay was the amount of noise during the night due to loud music of cars passing by at all types of hours and the amount of arguing that occurred right below the window. Besides those minor things, loved the stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ricardo’s place was cozy and had so many thoughtful touches. It was private and parking was never a problem, and the place is newly renovated. If you are a light sleeper, I would highly recommend bringing ear plugs, as the windows are single paned old school. Temp was great and appreciated all the cute light combinations. Ricardo was super nice and really went above and beyond to make the place cozy and was really helpful and responsive."

Can't wait to come back (we will be back) and recommend to all my friends and family 💚 Thank you again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am very glad I got connected with Ricardo. I always struggled either branding the bank on a hotel or feeling like I’m being a burden at friends places every time I go to CT to visit my daughter. His unit was affordable, clean, looked like it was recently renovated and close to many coffee spots and restaurants. I grew up in BPT so the crowd around downtown doesn’t bother me.
Thank you Ricardo, I appreciate your accommodations and trust."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay here! Everything was spotless and matched the pictures. We stayed for parents weekend at Fairfield university and it was only about 15 mins away. This location is close to everything.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"ONE HUNDRED OUTTA TEN !!! As soon as you step in, it smelled very wonderful and CLEAN. I love the details of the place, and i feel like it is made with a guests experience in mind (: definitely would look to come again .

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Colette responded quickly and was very accommodating. I had a problem getting the key from the lock box and the co-manager came right down and helped me out. The suite was spotless and in a nice area. Would definitely recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Colette’s place was SO CLEAN and super cute. She had a cute tiny space heater on and snacks and waters for us when we checked in. The outdoor patio space was also beautiful.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was comfy and cozy only thing that someone should be aware of is the stairs that lead right into the Airbnb from the upstairs that was a bit of an uneasy feeling that anyone could walk down if they wanted to. Other than that it was a easy and convenient stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and beautiful, snacks and drinks were left for us and everything you could want was there. The hosts made us feel more than welcome and we will be sure to use them again and again!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect arrival, the hosts were very discreet . The house was very clean.
There is still a catch, we can't adjust the heater and it is very cold in the evening. It would have to add an additional heater. Also the lighting is too intense, or everything is on, it's mini light. Otherwise, accommodation very well."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great, clean place to stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, beautiful and thought of all the small details. Would definitely recommend her Airbnb!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and easy check in. The only thing to know the AC is central. You can close or open vents which was fine with us. You couldn’t have your own thermostat but like I said it was fine. Would stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Colette’s place was extremely clean, comfortable, and felt homey. They were great about communicating, giving suggestions, and they provide a parking spot for you! It’s less then 10 minutes from the amphitheater and was easy to access. We would 1,000% stay here again! Thankyou!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the first house of my life where I stayed
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a problem with the lock, but only because we'd never used one like this before. Everything else was great. Beautiful and modern and everything we needed. We came to Bridgeport to see shows at the Hartford Healthcare Amphiteater. Nice short ride to get there and some good restaurants in the area. Would love to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Colettes place was great! It was spotless and filled with essentials to cook + clean with. The place was super cold which was refreshing after being outside in the humidity. The backyard had a nice area to chill and have some coffee in the morning.
The one thing I would say is that the bed was creaky when you moved on it. Other than that, I highly recommend! :-)"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Colette's place was exactly as described. It was pristine, and a perfect find to spend a night. The amenities were perfect. Communication was clear, and they always responded quickly. We stayed here for a concert, and it was inexpensive, and the area was lined with plenty of restaurants. The only think I would have future visitors keep in mind is that you can hear footsteps above, and at times, muffled talking. This location is a converted space in their home. It is VERY well done and affordable. We were not bothered, whatsoever, by any of this. Overall, it was a comfortable stay, and I would encourage you to select this space for your future stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place between moving apartment. This place was perfect.
Everything matches the description."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can say so much but wow this was a total vibe and I felt right at home! This guest suite is truly a gem! Felt like I was right at home. And not to mention the view! It’s almost like your in the mountains as you sit in the backyard and watch the sky. A great stay and great value. Appreciate y’all and for providing a place to stay.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, nearly perfect stay with a couple of notes:
- Bathroom sink water had a weird taste
- The provided blinds on the entry way door leave a large gap where someone from the outside can see directly into the bed. I know it’s a private property and that’s highly unlikely, but it’d be nice to know I can have total privacy when I’m sleeping.
Aside from that, a great little spot for a solo or couple traveling to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean and convenient as it was central point to my needs while visiting family. She was amazing with the hospitality from snacks, toiletries, etc. Great communication, parking, overall satisfied. My only mention on opportunities is the bed wasnt the most comfortable and creeks alot. Otherwise, highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place! Great hosts! Will come back again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd stay here again. I was in town for my daughter's graduation and wanted to bet near her dad's house soon we could hang out, order sushi and watch anime. We did just that. It was nice to be able to make myself breakfast. The kitchen was so clean and had all the cookware needed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for this stay! The space is kept super clean and comfortable. We were here only for one night but were very grateful for the amenities (fridge/freezer, toiletries, even little snacks/coffee available). Thank you Colette!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome place definitely recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a comfortable one-night stay at Colette's apartment. The area was well-appointed, attractive, and free of clutter. The open floor plan gave us plenty of room for our suitcases. We appreciated the water and the snacks left in the kitchen. We were not familiar with the radon gas detector in the basement wall, but Linfield (co-host) was able to quickly answer our questions about the device. We both had a good night's sleep on the comfortable bed. We did not meet Colette, but met Linfield as we were leaving in the morning. We felt that the apartment was a good value and would recommend it to others."

The kitchen has a four burner stove, microwave, countertop oven and mid-sized fridge. It appears to be in a safe neighborhood and there's a nice patio for that morning cup of coffee in warmer weather. About a 15 minute ride from the train station. Presently a great value!"

Really spacious and comfortable. Very thoughtful touches, even in the least expected places. Not only that, great neighborhood. Bridgeport is a very residential area and close to Coletee's is plenty of EXCELLENT food options. The Jamaican place right nearby was fantastic. So thankful I found Colette's listing, was the perfect place after a long couple of days of driving. Fantastic value. Thank you, Colette!"

Jim is a fantastic host and I couldn’t recommend the location more. It is centrally located and a quick stop to all nearby attractions.
Thanks for having us!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This Loft in Black Rock is amazing. This was our 1st AirBNB experience and it was superb!
Jim & Marina are consummate hosts. Their property is immaculate and beautiful.
The Loft is a homage to rock & roll. Jim personally built it & the details to music are incredible.
The kitchen and bathroom are downstairs & well-stocked. The bed is very comfortable and the furniture, cozy.
Right outside your door is a beautiful built-in pool & patio with a covered grill.
There is ample parking on the property.
Black Rock is a historic, artsy neighborhood. It is quiet and pretty. There are tons of restaurants & bars and gift shops...all walkable.
You MUST walk along LI Sound at St Marys, have coffee at The Harborview, eat breakfast at The Tasty Yolk (the ""Pig"" sandwich is unbelievable!), dine at BRYAC, lunch at Hub n Spoke, shop at BR Vintage (David is awesome), the Pious Bird, BR Dept Store. H&H Latin bakery is delicious. Enjoy music at Park City Music Hall... fantastic vacation spot"

* Easy check in, combination lock to unit was convenient
* Safe area, many fun attractions withing walking distance
* Local parks and even a dog-friendly beach was only a few blocks away
* Jim took the time to reach out by sending notes on events going on in the area
* Large back yard with amazing pool and patio area was super enjoyable
* Layout of unit was great with kitchen and entertainment on lower level, with bedrooms upstairs
* We really enjoyed the music theme of the unit and the many CDs and LPs that were available
* Local cuisine and brewery options exceeded our expectations, make sure you visit BRYAC!
* Jim and Marina were very friendly and engaging and made us feel very comfortable during our stay
* Comfortable bed and lots of dressers
We can't recommend this unit highly enough. A+++ AIRBNB!!"

This property in particular was perfect for myself and my dog for a long weekend.
Tucked behind the beautiful main house, the space the rear and upstairs of the large garage. A lovely yard, pool and deckare right outside the door.
The kitchen and bath are both located on the first floor (no stove in the kitchen, but a microwave and toaster oven.)

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot. Highly recommend. The listing was as described in a quiet neighborhood. This is a separate building away from the main house. Jim was a great host and I felt like I had privacy. I worked from the space on several days and the wi-fi was fast. Bonus, there is a great vinyl collection!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay - Jim and Marina have a lovely property and are so welcoming. I had previously stayed in the basement apt and came back to stay at the loft. Appreciate their dog friendliness as it makes it easy to travel with my two small dogs bad love the fenced in yard!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a value! Super private even though located on property with host’s home.
Spacious, clean, well stocked and comfortable apartment! Love the 2 floors…made it feel even roomier and offered plenty of space for two people to work from home.
Great neighborhood for walks or biking plus very close to restaurants, entertainment and conveniences.
Lovely pool and outdoor area too! Hosts are so friendly and accommodating. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great neighborhood, wonderful host. everything was perfect."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jim’s place is great. A perfect location and beautiful space on a beautiful property. Perfect spot!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was amazing. Everything you need for a extended stay. I recommend this to anybody that is a music lover as well. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to this area for business. More than a 5 star rating by far.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, roomy loft space with a super record collection, nice furnishings, a pool in the backyard, and a great host. Book it if you can get it!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy access, and big living area to stay in."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jim and Marina were great hosts. They made us feel very welcome and we enjoyed our stay. The loft was very clean and had thoughtful touches all throughout. I’m looking forward to our next visit!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay. Absolutely sparkling and attractive space. Near the beach, restaurants, and music! Jim is a great host. A+"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This little bungalow was a delight. My wife and I were there to both do some remote work and to rest, and on both counts, this was a terrific place to stay. The hosts were responsive and friendly! If you have reasons to be in Black Rock, I can strongly recommend this AirBnB."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome space!! The loft is super cool, and has fantastic music memorabilia. Great yard and owners are very nice. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very comfortable and peaceful stay at Jim’s one of a kind property. The carriage house was private and impeccably clean, with thoughtful touches throughout. We enjoyed lounging by the pool and exploring the beaches and trails around Black Rock."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was a lovely, cozy, and clean place to stay with close distances to great restaurants and the beach. Jim and his wife were both very welcoming and had the best restaurant recommendations. Everything is exactly as pictured and described. They did a great job blocking out sunlight on the top floor so you can sleep in comfortably. No curtains on the main entrance door on the bottom floor which faces the pool/yard area so just be wary since it’s right in-front of the bathroom. They do rent out another Airbnb in their main house so the backyard area is a shared space, but we were lucky to have it to ourselves for the majority of our stay. Would recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great space. Treat yourself to a wonderful loft. Amazing dining nearby and close to waterfront.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft that we'll plan to visit again soon. Amazing touches and such a wonderful place to unwind with lots nearby to enjoy!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Marina’s Airbnb is beautiful. Plenty of room, cozy and a lovely pool right outside your door. Marina was super helpful and hooked us up with restaurant recommendations and even live music one night. My friend and I met there as a reunion and we did everything we wanted - beach, pool, tasty meals, live music, shopping and we even had a fire one night by the pool. Can’t say enough good things about this spot. Thanks again for all of your hospitality!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful loft adjacent to Jim and Marina’s house. The two of them exceeded expectations and made me feel so welcome. The space is so well maintained, spacious, and quiet. A very nice and large, fenced-in backyard with a beautiful pool. I spent my week relaxing by the pool and enjoying the spacious upstairs of the loft. The place is pet friendly as well. I brought my cat, and though I forgot to mention it, Jim and Marina were incredibly kind and understanding. They even gave me cat food and a cat tree for me to keep. I very much enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend it."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely stunning! The loft is a large relaxing space that is beautifully decorated. The outdoor area was perfect for some chill time by the pool and we were able to take advantage of the bbq as well. Our dog was able to run around in the yard and loved just sitting in the sun and soaking up all the rays. Everything was wonderful and Jim and Marina (and Jim's parents) were wonderful!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim’s place was great! The loft was perfectly clean, well equipped, and in a very convenient location. Jim and Marilyn were incredibly accommodating hosts and I highly recommend staying with them!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent Memorial Day weekend at Jim and Marina’s cottage with my husband and our dog as a welcome escape from NYC. The cottage was very clean and comfortable, it’s clear they’ve put a lot of thought and effort into making it a great stay. We really enjoyed being able to bring our dog along, play in the yard and go on walks. Unfortunately we weren’t able to use the pool yet but the yard is a great space. There are also some good restaurant options and beaches within walking distance. Thanks Jim and Marina for your hospitality!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little getaway location. The loft has a lot of room for hanging out and relaxing after spending the day out and about. The space has a great style and feel to it. Plenty of great albums to listen to as you unwind from the day.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's description and photos of the loft are very accurate. It was a fun, comfortable place to hang out, and Black Rock is a great neighborhood. Easy access to I-95, but you don't feel like you're anywhere near a highway. Great place, and I hope to be back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I used Jim's place to work from home while I was closing on my house. The place was nice and Jim was friendly and the wifi worked good.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jim has done an outstanding job with this place! plenty of room with great amenities and record collection! Awesome record collection that shares with you to listen made this a great stay for a business trip. Super close to some great restaurants

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a little over a week and absolutely loved this quiet, cozy cottage getaway decked out with rock n roll feels. The upstairs large TV area feels like a private screening room and it was so fun having another large TV in the kitchen too. There is something so grounding about having a great collection of records to play too. It was great to have an upstairs and downstairs that we could both work and take calls in separate spaces as needed. There is a dishwasher, microwave, counter top oven and powerful two-up hot plate that does the trick for cooking. Tons of food delivery options too. Everything you might need is super close by, including a Whole Foods. There are many small touches throughout that feel thoughtful and make things more comfortable. The shower has a floor made of smooth large pebbles and it feels nice to stand on. Heat works great in January! Jim is very responsive. We want to come back in the summer!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As expected, everything was great! Jimmy and Marina were the best hosts/neighbors and couldn’t have asked for a more relaxing, enjoyable few days in Bridgeport. Thanks again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful getaway trip and spent Christmas here!! It’s actually a lot bigger than I thought, the atmosphere is cozy and warm, decorations on the second floor is amazing, has a great vintage, fancy vibe. The instruments section amazed me, and I love the carpet!!!"

We hope to be back there soon!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jim’s place was great. Loft is much bigger than it looks in pics, layout is perfect and cozy. I stayed at his place for a little under 2 weeks and had no complaints! Jim was super responsive and nice, and you’re within walking distance to great restaurants/bars. Perfect place to stay. Thanks Jim!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful! Jim has done an amazing job of setting it up, and the effect when you in is jaw-dropping.
It’s cozy yet spacious (more spacious than it looks in the photos, even!) and all the furniture is super comfortable.
Black Rock is a quiet, adorable gem of a town, and the gorgeous fall colors are not to be missed. This place is an ideal getaway for recouping your mental sanity, and close enough to the City that you can lose it again quickly if you need/want!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not your average Airbnb - this is a very nice space with full working record collection and player, instruments that can be played, and lots of modern style. Didn’t have a chance to check out the in-ground pool, but looks perfect for summer stays. Jim communicated well and I was very satisfied all around. This space is worth the price. Looking forward to returning in the future!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Exactly as you see in the photos - clean lines, spacious and everything you need. Great host."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place is one of the kind. The studio-loft has a lot of character! It is very spacious, clean and stylish!!
The separate living & dining area offers tons of spaces. The main loft comes with large music selection, and the sound system was impressive! Both indoor and outdoor of this home, is truly perfect getaway that anyone wants."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a cozy space in CT. The pool is steps outside the front door, and the second floor has lots of space. The host is friendly and responds quickly."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stylish, comfortable and fun space in the thick of Black Rock. Jim and Marina were amazingly welcoming and communicative. (They even brought over a guitar for me to play during my stay). Easy access to 95 and the post road for navigating north and south along the coast. Big thumbs up."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you'd expect and then some! Super clean space and an awesome collection of music. Really the perfect getaway for anyone who's looking for a break by the pool!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos of the space are excellent but the apartment is even better in person. It’s big, cosy and immaculate, with an awesome pool right outside. We had a great time here and it’s such a quick and easy getaway from NYC that we plan on coming back next summer. We used a car service so didn’t have a car during our stay but most places were walkable and Uber is readily available if needed. Jim and Rina are also the most lovely hosts and we spent our last night outside by the pool chatting away with them. Definitely can’t say enough good things! Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this location was nothing short of spectacular. The space has a modern-vintage look, it’s a lot more spacious than what the pictures lead on. We were able to use the pool and backyard as we liked. Jim was a very hospitable host and responded very quickly to any questions or concerns we had. He really does go out of his way to make you feel comfortable and at home, but also does not intrude on your privacy. There are restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, and fast food areas within walking distance. You can also drive to an escape the room location, bowling alley, zip lining, kayaking, and the aquarium (the aquarium was lots of fun)! I had a great time and would most likely come again. Thank you Jim!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay, Jim has worked hard to present a stylish but cosy space with plenty of room! We love the decor, the cottage has the real feel of a music studio with album covers and a music corner with vinyl collection! The pool is just a few steps from the front door - a total treat this August.
Jim and his fiancé were on site for anything we needed, and gave us plenty of tips for exploring the area! Very friendly and relaxing atmosphere around the property. We are hoping to go back again!
Great location for exploring the local coastal area and some great spots within a short drive, the house is also walking distance from some nice bars and restaurants, and there is a large supermarket nearby."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cottage loft was lovely, clean, and beautifully decorated. Perfectly located near restaurants, a cute beach, and a 5 minute drive to Fairfield which was beautiful as well. The pool was perfect for our low key relaxing week away.
The owner was considerate and friendly and anyone lucky enough to stay at one of his properties will get exactly as described. He takes good care of his property and it shows. Hope to return again."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Super clean, big space with a TON of fun musical instruments, record player and rock'n'roll relics. The only complaint I had was the lukewarm shower. Perhaps Jim could turn up the water heater out there?"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place is amazing ! (He did a lot of work to make that place a little paradise and the result is just stunning !)

P.s for rock music lover that spot is perfect ;)"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying in Jim’s loft was a great experience! His space is clean, comfortable and is decorated nicely. Loft is tucked away from the street, centrally-located to I-95, and parking is a breeze. Jim responded quickly and was a great host. We hope to stay here again in the future!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"M’s listing is very nice! It is easy to find with directions & looks just like the pictures. It has everything you need & more. M was a fantastic host who checked in on us & always answered in appropriate timing. Overall, this is a very nice listing that is very close to restaurants, malls, the beach, a stadium, and many other things."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for money homestay, private import and exit, private bathroom.Next to a large lake with a beautiful view to go for a run in the morning.There was no hair dryer in the middle and the landlord said, and immediately saw her drive to buy one back, very timely, a great experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think this host has actually traveled or worked in hotels since it's the first host I've ever come across to provide all the hotel amenities that normally come in a 5 star hotel such as tea coffee, mini bar snacks, mouth wash, tooth paste, extra towels, etc. If all host were like this hotels would go out of business. Well done!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and cozy place to stay. Everything was exceptional and the host was attentive via email making sure you and everything is well. Definitely will be my go to spot when in Connecticut.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I truly don't think you'll find a better place to stay if you are a simple traveler visiting this area solo or with one other person. It's everything you'd get in a hotel except better. The neighborhood was easy to find and if it hadn't been downpouring, I would have felt very safe running there as a woman. The accomodations look exactly like the pictures. The little kitchen setup exceeded expectations (coffee, little fridge with water etc, snacks!, a table to eat at). Plus the whole place smells nice. Oh also the shower is beautiful and after a day in the rain was so perfect to warm up. M even checked in on me after the first day. All around a great stay. FYI there is a little space heater next to the television. I missed it the first night (I was tired) but turned it on briefly the second night and it's a powerhouse. If I ever need to come to CT again, I hope M's place is available."

Convenient location right off the highway, yet just the right distance for no road noise. The bed and bedding was clean, fresh and comfortable. Amenities galore. Cold bottled waters. Hot clean shower. Comfortable temperature inside, and with an air purifier and extra heater if needed. Plenty of parking on the street just out front. And excellent communication from Mansoor throughout the stay. It’s so turnkey though, that you don’t really need to ask for anything. I would absolutely stay here again, and recommend it highly."

I had a nice chat with Mansoor, very well mannered, polite, and thoughtful.

If I keep ranting about how amazing it is, y'all are gonna book it up, and I'll have to camp in my car or something. 🚗😂 Seriously though, it's the perfect spot. Super clean, great vibes, and the host? A total legend. Just do me a favor and leave some dates open for me, alright? 🙏 #BestKeptSecret #DontTellEveryone"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay I found my new spot for when I’m here for work thank Mansoor for your beautiful hospitality!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is so easy to give this place 5 stars - Recommended :-)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A returning guest - so you can imagine it is very good.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mansoor went above and beyond to give my family the best airbnb experience we’ve ever had.He left candy,ice cream, and more for us at no cost.We felt at home and the place was very spacious and clean!Would definitely come back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and affordable place to stay if you are in the area. Very clean. Great amenities provided. Mansoor is a friendly and responsive host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you! I’ll be down a lot for my daughters Bball games at Fairfield…
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, have been here multiple times."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great as always
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Although we were only here for a very short time, we felt very comfortable. Mansoor did everything to make sure we were doing well. The pre-warmed apartment and sweets were a nice surprise. Everything is as described and very clean. Only we didn't particularly like the location."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed at this place for a night with some friends and felt right at home. A perfect place to relax after a night out 😄
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great 1 night stay. This was a step up from a hotel room and we payed less! The pillows and bed were very comfortable. The big win was the bowl of candy, Oreos and free soda!! Getting into the apartment in the dark was a little tricky, we figured it out eventually though. It was the door out back through the side gate that leads to the apartment. We got in late and didn't interact with the host. The door between the up floor and the place we stayed in is thin enough that we could hear clearly upstairs conversation and movement so not much different from a hotel room. We were on west coast time so we watched a movie and hoped it wasn't too loud for those upstairs. The ceiling was low in some places but my husband who's 5'11 Didn't have any problems but someone taller might. It was a decent stay for the price."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's my second time here, and definitely a place I'll be back. Exceptional host and top-end place. Worth every penny."

The host was very concern about if we were comfortable enough, very polite and respectful.
We are going to go there again for sure.
PS. I think it’s better than a Hotel but that’s my opinion."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was fantastic! Polita made an effort and beyond to make us feel welcomed. We loved that the place was spotless, the linens were all fresh and clean. The closets, floors, furnishings, fixtures, and dresser were all new looking or freshly painted. Plenty of places to plug things in, there was even a small end table in the living area that had two USB ports on it.
The stove, dishwasher, and refrigerator were all new looking and functional.
A huge bonus was that there was a washer and dryer right there! So don’t forget to bring some Tide Pods and some dryer sheets with you.
Parking was a slight issue, but Polita was able to quickly make it work for us!
Overall, a wonderful experience and if I’m ever in the area again, I will not hesitate to return."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ivette was a fantastic host in all ways. Very clean house, easy check in, and with many towels provided! When I asked her for an iron within minutes she came and dropped one off. While the area is a bit gritty, it ended up being a great plus due to local restaurants and bars right on our block. Can definitely recommend a stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place book with Yvette you won’t be disappointed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My and my beautiful queen had an amazing time and felt at home… she loved it so much and ask will we be able to rent this Airbnb again. I definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone who is staying in Bridgeport CT. Just make sure you leave me some days to rent too. The host was very responsive and always attentive.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, easy street parking right in front, clean and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing exactly like the photos, easy to find clear instructions, very clean super responsive private, and secure It’s a real deal everything you could hope for. Thanks for the hospitality."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"description and photos matches, lots of little extras such as water bottles, candy, snacks, and a wine bottle! neighborhood is a little colorful but not once did it feel unsafe. walked to neighboring restaurants with all four of our children ages 8-17. recommend the Brazilian restaurant .2 mi and main Port fish and chips .5 mi away from location. have to find parking along the street, tenants above have children (didn't mind the noise through the day, at night respectful with no noise but they are up early morning between 5-6am lol). the living room sofa sleeper sleeps two and comfortable, kids twin beds great and both rooms comfortable temps with a/c units. be prepared for master bedroom to be hot though, no seperate unit. we had the fan cranked up (small portable in closet), would recommend an a/c unit there as well. others great stay and recommend it."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Ivette's house was clean and well maintained, there was water for all guests and amenities were great. Ivette is a responsive, helpful host.
However, that house is for 5 people maximum not 6."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Many things in this home gives a “work in progress” or unfinished look: 1) TV missing in master bedroom with hardware remaining 2) Dark blue paint patches on the wall 3) Missing faceplates 4) Semi-remodeled bathroom, but the radiator looks old/dirty & new caulking would help.
Would love to see cotton sheets available rather than polyester. There were no top sheets, only a fitted sheet & comforter. The 2nd bedroom only had two decorative shams on each twin bed. My friend slept on hers & I borrowed a pillow from the master bedroom.
The neighborhood is a mix of homes that are kept up & homes that look depressed.
We enjoyed the nearby Brazilian restaurant. The couch was cute & comfortable. The basket on the counter with wine, extra toothbrushes & small soaps was a nice touch.
We felt that the cost was too high ($300 all in) in mid May compared to the other lovely places we stayed for the same price. This place has potential. We wish this family all the best in their business."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"First off, Ivette was very kind and always responded to messages right off.
If you’re not from the area (we are not) you are in a city. There’s noise. There’s neighbors above you. You will hear them. It’s a little “rough” neighborhood. (Didn’t bother us too much) the pictures didn’t show the cosmetic issues with the bathroom. The internet didn’t connect. We couldn’t watch the tv at all. (We also didn’t message Ivette about this) wasn’t a big deal to us. It was clean. The queen bed was comfortable. She left travel size soaps, shampoo, and toothpaste. And a bottle of wine. Very nice. I think the price was a little steep for what the place was. But it worked for our sleeping quarters for 1 night. Thanks again Ivette for being so kind and letting us use your home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay, spacious and cozy, it has all the amenities you need and the process to arrive is really easy."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, good place to sleep!"
2023-03-01,3.0,Group trip,"Based on the photos and description stating “4 beds” I did not expect one of the beds to be a couch bed. Upon arriving, we purchased food to be cooked in the house, but to find out there were no pots and pans which we then had to purchase. There were products in the refrigerator that was expired. There was also no microwave. There were a lot of noises throughout the day/night from the upstairs neighbors as well. Communication was great, only if there were better amenities."
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Ivette was very nice and very responsive. Cozy apartment and easy access. Very clean. But older home with old home smells. If you are expecting newish modern atmosphere you will be disappointed. Neighborhood was sketchy to me.

I would definitely stay here again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victoria's apartment may just be my favorite AirBnB yet. I was concerned that the reasonable cost was ultimately going to mean being unpleasantly surprised, but this great little home away from home was perfect in every way. The description was spot on, the home comfortable (bed was EXCELLENT!), washer and dryer a blessing, and instructions for check-in and check-out super easy and accurate). I walked into an immaculate little reprieve while in Fairfield to work on my late mother's estate and I will definitely be staying here each time I travel to Fairfield. Cannot recommend it highly enough for others who are looking in this area, too!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, comfortable and in a great location!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victorias’s unit was very clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and as a senior, I appreciated that there were substantial grab bars at either end of the shower/tub.
Having stayed in a motel on all previous visits, this was a refreshing change with lots of room and comfort.
I will try to book it for future visits."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The place is perfect and so is the location.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and clean. We were greeted each morning and night by the super mellow and friendly Frankie the dog! Nice quiet neighborhood. A real “at home “ feeling !

All the little details were accounted for: decent knives, containers, etc. for food prep; stocked essentials like olive oil, vinegar, coffee (decaf and regular!); GOOD shampoo/conditioner/soap/facewash/laundry detergent; pen/post-its/scissors; perfect list of recommendations for eating, etc.; mattress was comfy with soft & cozy linens. We were even welcomed with a selection of fresh food staples that were so appreciated! The space is well maintained and lovingly cleaned - someone is paying attention to all the nooks & crannies - including the oft missed spaces like baseboards, drawers & ceiling corners. Loved my stay. Would definitely rent again."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-designed and clean basement apartment in a quiet, safe, walkable neighborhood. Everything we needed was provided. Bed was very comfortable. All directions and instructions were clear. All in all, a nice Airbnb at a good price. The only downside is that the walls and floors are thin, and there’s little separation, so we heard everything going on in the house above. It kept us up on our first night. It wasn’t a party or anything like that, but still distracting. If it weren’t for the noise issue we’d happily stay there again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to spend a few days!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We come to Fairfield frequently, and we stay at Victoria's every time we can get it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Victoria's apartment is a little gem tucked into a quiet neighborhood just blocks from the many businesses and restaurants on Black Rock Turnpike and a short drive to downtown. The combination living room and sleeping area was super comfortable and the spa-like bath was an unexpected treat. This is by far the nicest accommodation I have found in Fairfield and I am already planning a return stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very well done and in a great location but I couldn't tell from the listing that it was a closed off bottom portion of a raised ranch house. So if you're a light sleeper, bring a noise maker, because the bedroom is below the primary living area. As long as you're aware of that, it's a great spot."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay, despite rain and snow!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is my third time staying at Victoria's place.

The bed was very comfy and warm. Loved the seating area. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The location was perfect. The perfect space for a visit with friends who drove down from MA to see me. I would stay here again and highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to go the AirBnB route."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victoria’s ABnB is a great value in a marketplace that is short on good, reasonably priced ABnBs and hotels. Since my wife and I visit Fairfield often and stay a week or so, we look for attractive small apartments in nice neighborhoods with a comfortabke bedroom, bathroom, working kitchen, washer/dryer, TV and WiFi and convenient to shopping and restaurants, Given its demographics, the supply of those is limited in Fairfield, qnd Victoria’s is one of the few! And it comes with a sensible price and a friendly, helpful hostess! Highly recommended."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a private unit attached to the main house. It is in a quiet neighbourhood and a car is necessary to get into Fairfield. A private parking spot is provided.
The unit is clean and comfortable. The bedroom is large but there is no separate living room.
Ideal for 2 people; would be very tight for 4. Victoria is responsive and helpful. We had a good stay."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and nice little apartment within a larger house, but we had total privacy and did not interact with anyone else, which was our preference during this COVID time. Cute neighborhood. Nice to find the shampoo/soap/water bottle and other thoughtful little touches. We only stayed for one night in the area and it was well suited to our needs!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So much to say! The Airbnb is GORGEOUS. Photos don’t do it justice honestly. So gorgeous and so comfortable. Everything is absolutely wonderful.

So much to do around the neighborhood and overall just one of the best if not the best Airbnb I have ever been at.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful and cozy place to stay for the weekend. I even got a meet and greet with Anna’s 4-legged pup, Charlie! Beach towels and beach chairs were available, and Anna’s place is located very close to the waterfront park and beach. Love that they provided us with many board/card game options. Downtown Bridgeport seemed a bit desolate, but the area is private and quiet, just what we were looking for. I would highly recommend The Adventure Park at the Discovery Museum if you stay here!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna has a very nice studio. It is clean and fresh. I would stay here again once the construction is finished. I understand Anna did not have anything to do with this, but I think a heads up or an updated listing would be helpful to let guests know what to expect. The construction is on the other side of the wall that the bed is on. It started around 8am both days I was here. Enjoyed my time in the space otherwise. Thank you, Anna."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a great place to stay. The host was very responsive and the place suited was exactly as described. The main concerns were external factors like construction in the area. Would stay again!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was beautiful thank you for everything will definitely want to book here again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna was very kind and responded quickly! She gave us extra beach towels and chairs to go to the beach. She also had great recommendations of things to do in town.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute place. I would stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Anna was great. Very helpful and informative, always quick to respond when I needed a question answered. The place had everything I needed and was very comfortable. I highly recommend."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quick stay but great host and space! Will say the town was kind of desolate and there wasn’t much to but the location of the rental was very close to a large waterfront park. That and our dinner at the Bloodroot made the whole trip.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying with Anna was great! The place was extremely nice and clean. She had some board games / jenga / cards which was a great bonus. For me I was visiting my sister who goes to Bridgeport university so the location was perfect. Anna was extremely kind and I would definitely recommend her. My next stay in Bridgeport will definitely be with Anna!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was honestly by far my favorite place I’ve stayed at. I felt so at home, I didn’t want to leave. I loved the decor. I loved staying here and would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfy, and cute. Had everything we needed. Quick responses to any questions. Great price for space. The bed and toilet were just a little bit low for my old body, but that're what hubbies are for! We'll definitely request again if we're there for the same reasons. Can't go wrong!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Attractive space in a historic building very close to Seaside Park. Nice amenities, easy access and parking, and overall very comfortable. Anna was communicative and our experience couldn't have been any easier."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for attending Sound on Sound at Bridgeport. Easy walk back and forth. Very clean. Great communication. Worth the price because of location near the venue.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was lovely, check in was extremely easy, the noises she described with the dogs upstairs wasn’t overwhelming at all, overall was extremely clean and cozy and will definitely book with her again !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Came to Bridgeport for a concert at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater which was literally a straight 5 minute walk from this airbnb! Stayed with my pup who felt comfy being left alone. Host was awesome and had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. Warm and cozy unit! Easy parking and Ubers had no problem picking us up/ dropping us off. Overall had a great time!!! Dinner at Paci which was a quick drive away and multiple breweries around. Seaside park which was also walking distance/short drive gave us nice sunsets! Will def book again if I’m in the area again. Thank you so much for your hospitality!!! 🤍
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Michael and Anna’s place is lovely! My husband and I stayed there two weeks in the midst of a move overseas and the apartment had all the comforts of home, such as stocked towels, linens, essentials for cooking and cleaning. We walked Seaside Park nearly every day and celebrated my husband’s birthday at Brewport up the road. We spent a few days at Jennings Beach, a short drive away. Staying at the apartment long-term without a car may be tricky, there aren’t many convenience stores or large grocery shops, but the larger Bridgeport area isn’t more than a 10-minute Uber away. One can tell that M & A care a lot about their guests, just by the conveniences they provide. We would stay there again, if given the opportunity."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was a wonderful host! The park and beach nearby was walkable, and the place was perfect for a weekend stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely place to stay. Cute, clean, and easily accessible, especially if you’re taking the train. It’s the perfect place to stay if you’re going to an event at the amphitheater, and I loved the proximity to the ocean. Our host was friendly and responsive, too! Loved staying here!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb experience! We were headed to a concert in Bridgeport on a Saturday night so decided to make a weekend of it and Michael’s studio was perfect! Not only was the place super adorable, but it had everything you could possibly need - full kitchen, roku for streaming, games, toiletries, throw blankets, etc. Plus the location was great, there were no issues with finding parking, its walkable to the amphitheater and some great restaurants, and everything else we wanted to do was a 10 minute drive or less. Michael and Anna also went above and beyond as hosts, we accidentally left a shirt in the closet and less than two hours after we checked out they had sent us a message letting us know and offering to send it. Would definitely stay there again (and hope to)!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy studio apartment within a 5 minute drive of most locations we came to see. Excellent shower pressure, neat and clean, and just what we needed for our weekend getaway. Would gladly return someday!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall very reasonable price within the price range considering the location. The host was very friendly and communicative.

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this Airbnb during our trip down the CT coast. The studio was well put together and had everything we needed for a few nights away. It was super clean and nicely designed. We really loved how close it was to the seaside park and path, and the coastal downs down south were fairly accessible from the studio. The property is a lower unit so you do hear a good bit of sounds from the upper unit so maybe not the best if you’re sensitive to noise. Being a lower unit in the winter, we found it chilly even with the baseboard on. Not a dealbreaker but wise to be mindful of. The host was responsive, communicative, and flexible which I appreciated."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Really enjoyed my stay - this was a temporary housing solution as my partner and I were relocating to Bridgeport. Location was quiet, safe & literally across the street from the beach! Morning walks with my dog next to the beach were our favorite! We had everything we needed for cooking, sleeping and entertainment. It is a studio, so small space, but it was perfectly fine for myself, my boyfriend and our dog Athena.
The only complaint I would have is the wifi connection - I work from home in a heavy meeting based work culture and I would tend to lag out or lose connection every few hours, but it wasn't something I couldn't work around.
Michael was very communicative whenever anything was going on with troubleshooting or if the internet was going to be out of commission. They also offer a complimentary cleaning service weekly - we opted out of this option, but it's there!
All in all, I would recommend Michael's studio as a great place to stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was great, location was awesome. In town for work with a few coworkers and out to a show and it was a great place to come back to. Clean, hot tub was an awesome touch and plenty of space for the three of us. Would definitely stay again next time I’m in town."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,grea stay! thank you
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Dylan's house was perfect. The house was full of amenities that we didn't even expect to be there (ziplock bags, condiment basics, shampoos and soaps, laundry pods if needed, etc.) Just that having those simple luxuries made us feel so welcome. Of course we enjoyed the patio area by cooking on the grill, playing games outside, and relaxing in the hot tub. The area was quiet and peaceful, and any place we visited was within 10 mins away from the house. We would definitely recommend staying in Dylan's charming house!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! House was clean and had everything listed, nice kitchen and great amenities. Location was amazing and had everything you'd want with a visit to Connecticut in a short drive away, with a zoo nearby, a few beaches in driving distance, and a few amusement parks about an hour away."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time staying here with our pups. Close to restaurants and lots to do! We really enjoyed the back yard and hot tub.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I stopped at Dylan’s place to break up a long drive home from northern NH. There were 6 of us (2 adults, kids, 1 baby) as well as our dog. Dylan’s place was easy to access and a great location. The inside of the house is thoroughly labeled, which we appreciated. The beds we’re comfortable and the water pressure of the shower was great. We liked the fenced in yard because our elderly dog could hang out there and enjoy himself. We had a quick stay, just one night, but it was everything we needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful long weekend stay with my wife and our dog! Tons of great food nearby, but also the house had everything we needed to prepare a few meals in. All throughout the house not just the kitchen, little needs (especially when you're traveling) were anticipated and thoughtful extras too! Kind of felt like we were staying at a friend's who made sure to take of us!
The backyard and covered patio were a favorite spot for all three of us. The hot tub was set up and running and immaculately clean!"

We used the hot tub once, it was clean and a nice treat for the kids. Dylan was very responsive. The house had everything we needed aside from food. It was a perfect central location to all the things we wanted to do during our stay and close to the highway. We will 100% stay here again on our next CT visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dylan’s place was beautiful and perfect for what we needed. Everyone loved it and would stay again. The backyard area is really nice. Would definitely stay again.

Overall the house is super cozy and really accessible to most things via car. We’d stay here again and highly recommend!

The hot tub and outdoor fireplace with the lit up backyard was our favorite place. Dylan recommended the best beaches and the house was stocked with everything we needed and much more. We didn’t want to leave!!! This was probably the best experience I’ve had traveling with Airbnb since 2020. It’s pet friendly so we were able to bring our family rescue dog. Thank you so much for being such a wonderful host. If you ever sell the house, give us a call lol!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My daughter and her friends had such a wonderful time. Everything was spotless, comfortable and relaxing!! Thank you so much Dylan!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house with homey touches - just as pictured and described. Extremely well stocked kitchen. Host was very quick to respond with clear communication.
The one and only downside to the place is the only bathroom is upstairs - but the beautiful, fenced in back yard, super clean hot tub, and nice accommodations make up for that.
Would absolutely stay again and recommend this place."

Dylan was proactive in his communications and check in was a breeze. Thanks for having us!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dylan was an excellent host! the first night, there was a huge chain of thunderstorms which had knocked the breaker to the hot tub.

I will absolutely contact Dylan for future trips we take to the area!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed my overnight stay at Dylan’s property. He has put thought into small details that add to your stay. Having the lighting hooked up to Alexa was an awesome feature!
The home is very clean, modern, and well appointed. It’s got all you need for a short or longer stay. The bed was super comfortable and the living room was a cozy place to hang out in the evening. The backyard was beautiful and quiet. My dog loved exploring and the yard is big enough to play fetch. For dog owners who struggle to find good properties with a backyard, this is your ticket!
Dylan was very attentive when I had an issue getting inside the home. I appreciated his quick response and it put me at ease on my journey. Overall, it was a fabulous stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would recommend Dylan's place to anyone visiting CT. The house was beautiful in a nice neighborhood close to little shops and stores. I was picking up my wedding dress and was able to check in a little early to freshen up from our drive from NY. The patio with the hot tub was so nice and relaxing at the end of the night. Dylan responded quickly, even when I sent a late night question!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dylan is a wonderful host! Very prompt in responding and accommodating of our needs/requests. The check-in instructions were quite thorough and useful. The unit was well-stocked and spotless. We were delighted to find such a modern home right near where we wanted to be. It was the perfect place for us to stay and such a great value.

Would absolutely stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best places we've ever stayed at! Very clean and cozy house, with a nice yard that my dog absolutely loved. Cooking up a BBQ, and then taking a dip in the hot tub was an amazing and relaxing feeling. We also enjoyed walks at the nearby Wooster Park, where we could let the dog run freely after school hours.
Everything inside the house was available, labeled and easy to use, so you never felt like you were searching for how to make things work. But in any case, Dylan is very responsive and thoughtful, and even let us stay a bit later before checking out.
The entire stay was a perfect mini vacation, and it's definitely a place we'll repeat any time we're back in CT!"

The home was clean, beautifully decorated, and in a great location. The hot tub was our favorite amenity - the patio lights and beautiful yard was the perfect way to relax.
Kitchen is fully equipped with all needs and the bedrooms were comfortable! Would definitely stay here again.
Lastly, Dylan as a host is amazing. I felt like I could contact with anything at anytime and was given a flexible check out time!
Thank you Dylan!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect getaway! Home: spotless, very inviting, thoughtful touches like having the kitchen stocked with the tools you needed and plenty of it. Also things were labeled so no time wasted fiddling with things. Beds were very comfortable. Bedding and towels we soft and nice. Hot tub was a plus. Surroundings: My son had fun tossing the ball and fishing across the street. Neighborhood was quiet. We were close to many things to do and visit and eat at but not smack in the middle of things which made for a relaxing time. Host: very friendly and responsive when we reached out with questions. Overall the place was perfect for my family (2 teens). Checking in and Out was the easiest we have ever experienced. Host said pets were allowed which could have been disastrous with my allergies but I was perfectly fine and the house smelled fresh and clean."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,5 star stay! would recommend
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to crash after attending a show at a nearby venue. Quiet neighbourhood. Nice big bathroom. No kitchen, but the room does have a mini fridge/freezer, microwave, and coffee maker.
I will note that there are two pretty steep flights of stairs to climb, so if you have mobility issues or difficulty climbing stairs, this may not be the best place for you to stay. As I'm young and healthy, it was not a issue for me. My older mother, on the other hand, would struggle. Just a head's up.
It was a great place and I would certainly stay here again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Not too much to do in the area however is worth the price and is close to Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Alejandro's place was a great deal for a one night stay in Bridgeport for a concert. The area left much to be desired, at no fault to the host, but getting ubers to the concert venue was a breeze."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you like a soft comfy bed, quiet, safe and a well-appointed bath, this is for you."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall the stay was amazing especially for the amazing low price. The host was super responsive and kept the room clean. The only thing that took away a star unfortunately was the other guest. Since this bnb is a shared space you sometimes may come in contact with other guest that may not be the best and this is for any bnb. The guests in one of the other rooms did not keep the bathroom clean and this was at no fault of the host but maybe can be emphasized in the description or messages at check in to keep common spaces clean and to know incase someone else is using it.
Overall host, location, room was amazing and I will return here if I’m the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Alejandro was so responsive and friendly to deal with. His place is exactly as described and the pictures are very accurate. The room was spotless and the bed was comfortable. Thanks Alejandro!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A first glance the house seems to be in a little rough area but it's super quiet around there, with some views of the ocean even. Instant access to the I-95 freeway, and close to Starbucks and Chipotle. 3rd floor walkup but once you're up there the bedroom was clean and very comfortable. For the price, no complaints. Very good deal considering the rates for hotels around there. Thanks Alejandro"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good area , very clean , nice bathroom"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice large room and very clean. Great TV and wifi.
Uninteresting view of the port and construction site.
Let's not be great.
You can hear everything in the neighboring rooms, poor insulation."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for the money, nice room and clean bathroom - you share the bathroom with others if there are others on the third floor, but it is just fine."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall we were pleased with the room and the photos matched! If your looking to go out in the area I would not recommend but it’s great for a night.
Location: There is not much to do in the area but, it’s right next to the water. We felt safe but the outside appearance was not the best
Pros : The pictures matched 100%, the bathroom and room was spotless and the bed was SUPER comfy and cozy. There was a coffee maker with tea and coffee as well as cold water bottles in the fridge
Cons: Upon arrival when we entered we noticed someone was sleeping in our assigned room. We contacted the host and he promptly had someone come up. They advised us we could have the other room as they were in ours…..in most cases I wouldn’t have been happy but the room was larger than what we booked. Unfortunately due to the mix up we only had one large towel and a number of smaller ones."
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,I didn’t know the area but wouldn’t return. Very clean space though.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the first Airbnb I’ve ever had and it was amazing. Looks just like the pictures and it was a clean and secure place! Definitely coming back again
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Stay ever, in Airbnb. For Bridgeport. In a tough neighborhood but awesome view of the sea, and the rooms are modern and very, nice and well kept. Intelligent setup. A perfect stay with great responsive hosts. safe entry, and like home vibes."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my first time staying in this particular room and I actually loved it. Bed was a little firmer than room #1 and was still super comfy.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, last airbnb I stayed it, it was was too dusty and my eczema flared up. At this place, it felt so clean and the place was comfy."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is worth wayyy more than is advertised! It smelled so good as I walked in the house. Contactless, sophisticated check-in. And beautiful room and bathroom. Tv, fresh linens, medium-sized fridge and microwave. Easily my number 2 favorite place I’ve stayed at!
Alejandro was very nice and accommodating!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for me to crash on my drive down from Stowe, VT to Philly, PA. Apartment is three stories up. Walls are a little thin (can hear neighbors TV). Bathroom is shared. Mini fridge, microwave, and fan in private room. There is a Chipotle 4 min away and I think there was a Walmart in the area. Airbnb is conveniently off highway but the area doesn’t feel perfectly private and safe but it is fair for the economic price. Would consider staying again as it was the cheapest option with good ratings :)"

2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Listing was close to many restaurants and our concert which was good. The room was nice but I didnt realize the bathroom was shared with two other airbnb rooms upstairs. The cleaning service that came in was very loud talking which woke us up after long flights. There was no trashbags to throw away any trash in the bathroom or in the room

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a short stay!
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: Nice remodeled room and bathroom. This is the cleanest shared bathroom I have seen at an AirBNB! Plenty of parking on the street. Clean. Great value.
Cons: The door code provided to us did not work on one of the doors and we had trouble getting in contact with the host for +1 hr. Arrived around 8pm on Friday so maybe he was busy. We got lucky that someone heard us and opened the door. Previously, the host had been quick to respond. Another con is that the area is not the nicest--we brought everything in from the car when parking overnight. We did not feel unsafe at all, but it seemed like a bad idea to leave a car full of stuff on this street. The host was honest about this subject when I asked before booking"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best air bnb rooms I’ve seen! Good location with street front parking and secure locked entrance. Room and bathroom are extremely clean and tastefully decorated. Alejandro was quick to answer any questions we had. We will definitely stay here again!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best airbnb room ever seen.
,,,"very very disrespectful, needs to work on her customer service, instead of being rude of the bat, she simply could’ve talked to us and sorted things out like an ADULT dont know why kid’s younger than her are more respectful, on top of that she needed her string bean son and daughter to push us to leave when we simply told her we weren’t leaving until i know when my money hits my account, pretty place, with horrible host involved."
,,,This place has rats roaches and ants. When you ask the host about it she’ll say they’ve never had a issue before and the fumigate monthly. Lol who fumigate monthly but never had an issue? I was trying to be a good guest told her let’s get some trap and deal with it she said she’ll look into and never did. When I asked about it the second time she upped the rates of the rental. And claimed to be taking a loss. Worst Airbnb rental I’ve ever had.
,,,"Decor was great and room was nice. Horrible location with so much street noise. The house shook every time a truck went by. At first I literally thought “is an earthquake happening” it was so unnatural to have it be shaken like that.
Also, the hosts 10am check out time is a joke. Worse than a hotel."
