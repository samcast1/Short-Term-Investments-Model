2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a fun comfortable place to stay. We went to watch the eclipse and it was a great place to stay over the night before. I love the sunlight light and beautiful view of Mount Washington! I would recommend to the guests to bring an amazon fire stick or something if you wanted to catch a game or something. The tv's are not smart tv's. Also, be aware the pool sticks do not have tips! Makes for a few extra scratches. The kids loved the third floor beds, living area and kitchen!"

Scott was awesome thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great location for any White Mountains excursion you may have planned. House has a lot of character and the renovation is clean and comfortable. Don‚Äôt be thrown off by the extensive admonitions about rules and neighbors who will call the cops on you for minor disturbances of their peace. Neighbors definitely not friendly but they will leave you alone if you‚Äôre not throwing a house party.

I parked my crew cab pickup on the pleasant st side of the house along with 2 sxs. I parked a 24 ft trailer on pleasant street across from the house at the direction of a neighbor. The street and house are well lite at night. There is room for 2 cars on the High Street side of the house. We will definitely stay here again in the future.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely amazing! Beautiful on the inside, super comfy furniture and has everything you need! Scott and his team were super responsive and very friendly. Only thing to look out for is if you‚Äôre renting and bringing ATVs and trucks and trailers, make sure you utilize the train station parking as the driveway can only fit one truck and trailer!"

Plenty of bedroom space- nice to have two bathrooms, one up and one down. Plenty of towels and nice showers
The large front deck was great; we loved sitting there talking and watching people drive by.
Two free-standing AC units, one on the first floor and one on the second; they did cool the house, as it was muggy when we were there for the July 4th Holiday. Each bedroom had a small fan which was nice. We had also brought an extra fan for our room, which came in handy one really hot night.
Communication was great; the house rules/instructions were clear and concise- easy to follow.
We would rent Camp Jericho again."

Susanne was very responsive to our questions prior to our visit and the house was fantastic, a perfect location for a weekend with the SXS. Each of the 5 bedrooms were big and plenty of room through out the house. Wish we could have enjoyed the firepit, it is a great area to relax after a day on the trails, however the rain kept us from using it.

You can ride right from the house to the trails. The gas station is close by along with a Dunkins and restaurants.

I want to point out that on Saturday we had lots of snow. We left in the morning to go skiing and when we came back (by the end of the day) the drive way was plowed. They were super efficient plowing the snow from the drive way.
The house is equipped with all the basic needs for a house so you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything."

The home is extremely clean and well stocked both in the kitchen and with bed linens/blankets and bath towels. We had zero issues during our stay. The hosts of this Airbnb, Suzanne and Nathan, have mastered the accommodations for small or large groups wanting to explore the area including ATV and snowmobile riders. The fire pit out back is a destination place for our group every night. Each visit we find more local pubs, restaurants and unique shops to explore.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susanne was great from start to finish and the house was perfect for our annual friends and family trip to ride the trails! The house is only a couple miles from the trails and the two bathrooms were perfect to rinse the dust off after a day of riding.
The grill and fire pit were awesome, and it was so convenient to purchase extra bundles right next door, as needed.
Definitely recommend this great location if you're looking for a clean, spacious home to enjoy with family and friends!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Camp Jericho was fantastic. Just minutes from the ATV trails and not much further to the store and dining. We will most definitely be back again.

2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was very clean and very nice nothing is unfinished and everything you could need is there she supplies towels and everything you need for bedding. I will definitely be returning my number one Haily suggested house
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The house had everything you would need! Fully furnished interior with everything we needed for the weekend trip. BBQ grill out back made cooking at the house each night super easy. Fire pit was great after a long day of riding on the ATVs to be able to relax with family. Super convenient for hitting the trails with them only being a few miles down the road. Definitely worth booking and look forward to our next stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, trailheads approximately 2 miles in either direction. Plenty of space with the 5 bedrooms. Overall a good value for a weekend of atving with family and friends."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very clean and cozy house with everything that you could possibly need for your stay! Nice front porch that would be very enjoyable in the summer. We visited during sub zero temperatures so the living room floor was a little chilly, I'd suggest packing slippers if visiting in the winter! The second day was in the 20s and the floor was much warmer. The temperature in the house was warm, just a chilly floor! The upstairs where the majority of the bedrooms are was nice and toasty, the second night I slept comfortably without blankets. We will definitely stay here again!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, comfortable beds, lots of room, close from santa's village, easy communication with the host. We were 11, including 5 young kids and we had all the space, towels and beds we needed."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect. So clean and comfy. Plenty or room for our growing family (coming form near and far) to have Christmas together. Every detail was perfect. From the yummy warm brownies to welcome us to every inch of he house was sparkling clean. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. To top it all off, they even had a Christmas tree all decorated for us. Sue answered all are questions in a timely manner and was very nice. No hesitation to give 5 stars here!!!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Don‚Äôt second guess renting this house! It‚Äôs everything you want and then some. The house is sparkling clean, plenty big, and comfortable. The hosts are super responsive, helpful and kind. We rented this house with small children and an an elderly grandmother and it worked for everyone! There is a bedroom and a bathroom on the first floor that made it easy for old and young. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean! The kitchen is stocked and there is plenty of room for parking! We have rented many houses and this was a great house and great value! Great place to stay if you‚Äôre looking to go to Santa‚Äôs village! Thanks for a great stay!!"

Thanks Susanne, we will be back for snowmobile season"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suzanne and Nathan were exceptional hosts during our stay. Our party of 7 enjoyed a 5 night stay for an ATV trip. The accommodations were perfect for our needs. The special touches in the home from the now famous and expected brownies waiting for us on the kitchen table to the stacked firewood out back by the fire pit made our stay that much nicer. The home was very clean and ready for our arrival. Plenty of room for parking trailers and ATV‚Äôs. Direct ATV access from this home to the trails and town for gas and food. 5 STARS!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chris was excellent to deal with. Can't say enough good things about Chris. Always helpful
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We traveled to NH to see the eclipse. It was a great location, the house was very clean and comfortable, and the local restaurants were surprisingly good. It was expensive but considering why we were there, I think all the local places were charging more than normal."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,They were great communicators but there were hairs in the shower upon arrival and was cold at night with no heat in the living room.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place! We enjoyed it for thnfall foliage.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was exactly as pictured and we enjoyed staying there. The house is in a very quite neighborhood and a great place to take walks with our dog. The back yard does needs a lot of maintenance but the fire pit was nice. We would definitely recommend this place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay in Berlin, NH. The house is quite cozy and welcoming for our furry friend. Traveling with a pet is always nerve wrecking whether they feel at home or not. Jax took to this house very quickly and the fenced in backyard was perfect for him to stretch his legs after our long travel. Host is very responsive and check in was a breeze. Highly recommend for doggy parents."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, plenty of room. Bedrooms were comfortable, living room area was really nice. Great having access to washer and dryer too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you sharing your home with us. We loved the fenced in yard for the dog. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. We liked sitting on the deck and enjoying the view.
It was close enough to walk to the river walk which was our evening routine.
We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Kind of no- frills place without any extras. The house was clean but yard really needs some work.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice pet friendly place, walk to Heritage Park and the river! The neighborhood is a bit of an incline though, so my Mom couldn't walk, but there's plenty of parking down by the river."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was clean. Great instructions for an easy check-in process. Dog friendly. On a steep hill. It is private with a nice cozy feel. Safe location and close to the river.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay here! The house was clean and looked just as pictured. Would stay again!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"First of all this review is about Chris, not Melissa. I only dealt with Chris.
This home is an older house that needs some TLC. The place was perfect for 1 week of solo hiking in The Whites. Everything I needed was there except a small (6"") skillet for cooking an egg or burger. The bed was comfortable, plenty of hot water, the neighborhood is quiet, and TV & WiFi worked fine after we resolved the issues on day 1. Convenient deck for relaxing outside.
Chris was very helpful in resolving issues. He always responded quickly & did whatever he had to do to make the stay comfortable. Case in point, the only coffee pot is a Keurig machine, which I was not aware of but it is listed on the website. My fault. He told me to buy a drip coffee pot & he will reimburse me for the cost of it. That's good service & support.
Note: The 3 bedrooms are upstairs & there is no bathroom there.
Note: A roof leak onto the stairs between the dining & living room was supposedly fixed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,house was great. clean and nice home. would stay there again. thank you
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant stay in the heart of the White Mountains with plenty of hiking opportunities. Quiet neighborhood, easily accessible, functional and spacious accommodation, comfortable beds, large terrace with a beautiful view. Very responsive communication with the hosts (allowed us to arrive a little earlier). Too bad the bathroom is a bit small. To recommend !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect house in a nice little town with amazing views. Easy drive to tons of hiking trails.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The AirBnb was lovely and we had a nice time in the area. Comfortable sofas and King bed and clean. Easy to get to and into with self check-in. The residential neighborhood had sidewalks and easy walking distance to riverside park. Drove to Presidential range lookouts and beautiful parks nearby. Weeks Park was a nice find. Restaurants nearby as well. Our dogs were comfortable and happy. WiFi was great. Highly recommend it.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and a good value for your money.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of my favorite places to stay up north!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was perfect for our family. We rode the trails in Jericho. Place was clean and comfortable!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little place conveniently located in Berlin. Very clean and comfortable. We saw a bald eagle flying overhead while hanging on the back deck. The weather was hit or miss last week so it was nice to have a clean comfortable place to watch the storms. Really appreciated the early check in as well. Would stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was well maintained and had what we needed, hosts were very responsive, would stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Place! clean. easy to get too. Chris responded in minutes when a question was asked. We hope to stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good experience!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Incredible home! Has everything you need for either a one-night stay or an extended period. Extremely comfortable living room. Nice TV with plenty of options for viewing. It is an older home so everything is not perfect. You can tell they have spent time getting it ready for it to be used as an AirB&B. Top-notch communication. Would for sure stay here again. It was perfect for my family including our doggies!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very comfortable, clean and many extra.. Definitely would stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Area is quiet. Home was cozy! Def enjoyed just relaxing with the family and most of all being able to bring my fur baby! Would def stay here again! After having to cancel our first dates to reschedule Melissa and Chris made it super easy and we‚Äôre really patient with me. Thanks for having us!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute place! A few things definitely need some fixing up (2 bedroom doors would not close properly and dining table was very crooked, couldn‚Äôt sit on one end of it) but overall very nice place to stay. I like the deck to sit out and view the mountains. Would stay again in the future"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and just as advertised.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay very much! Love the family/tv room! Was perfect for us to just relax together & enjoy some movies! Everything was clean & comfortable! Loved being able to bring our pup with us too! Would definitely stay here again if we get back to the area!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Melissa's place was great for us to stay! We had our pup with us and the AirBnB was outfitted with a dog seating area which was the cutest thing ever. The living area was way larger than I imagined and there was a decent size deck in the back. Rooms were comfortable (the stairs were a little tricky as the wall tilted in so beware) but overall super comfortable and cozy. Only fallback was there were no hangers in the closet, but we made it work with the chairs and the bannister for our ski clothes.
LOVED the shower - water pressure was 10/10. Overall would stay again -about 45 min from Sunday River, but really close to Walmart and other convenience stores around."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved staying here, very homey and warm! This Airbnb was everything that we were expecting and more."
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Communication with the hosts was great & they were quick to respond! We brought two young toddlers & felt the house was not very child friendly. The door with the key pad (auto locked from the outside, which was great) opened easily from the inside & could not be locked from the inside. Two of the bedroom doors would not close, so it was difficult not to worry the kids would open the door & fall down the stairs when putting them down for naps/bedtime. We had to purchase a gate so the kids would not go up the stairs. The bathroom door was like a closet door that you could not completely close from the inside, so it did not feel private. We also wish there was a welcome book with info on the house/things to do. There were only maps to look at. The location of the house was 5 minutes away from a very cute small shopping/dining area and 10 minutes away from a Walmart and other great accessible places! The living room was spacious and very comfortable. Only 30 minutes from Santa‚Äôs Village!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was just as described, with a nice spacious living room. The house was perfect for our family to spend the holidays. It was well stocked with the basics as well. We look forward to staying again in the future!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa's house was clean, warm and inviting. Exactly as listed. Would rent again. TY"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was perfect and exactly as advertised. It was close to shopping and to the trails that we went there to explore. It was a terrific few days and we would absolutely recommend this listing to anyone who's looking to stay in the area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very quick to answer any questions and helpful
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Good time overall !
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really clean. Communication with the owner is fantastic. Great location for hiking Mt Washington.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute and cozy house close to good hiking and mt Washington! Good views from the front porch too! Would definitely book again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and comfortable home with a nice decking area to have morning coffee and admire the foliage. Beds are big and easy to sleep in after a day exploring the White mountains which are in very close proximity. The hosts are friendly and communicative. Just wish we were staying longer!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice stay we will definitely be back
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a fantastic find for a quick weekend trip. It was perfect for bringing my dog. Loved the mountain view and having breakfast and dinner out on the deck. Cute riverwalk nearby as well as a couple of restaurants. The whole neighborhood is very hilly so we definitely got our cardio in taking walks with the dog. Very clean and cutely decorated and the hosts were very communicative. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean home. Convenient location for Santa's Village and skiing/hiking. Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the location was great and the house was perfect. i was able to rent a utv for the day only a few minutes away . i will be returning for sure üôÇ
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really cute place! Perfect location if you are going on the trails and it being pet friendly was a huge bonus for us.
Really clean and nicely decorated. Great communication with the Host. I would definitely book again!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Based on other reviews as well as the listing description - I did not expect this place to be a high end accommodation, at all. However, I did expect it to be clean, which it absolutely was not. It appeared as if someone STARTED to clean the unit and just stopped. I don‚Äôt have enough space to list what exactly was dirty but they left cleaning supplies in the unit so I just quickly cleaned before we fully settled in. If you‚Äôre sensitive to smells, be weary the odor of the bathroom is nauseating. I do hope they find a better cleaning crew because the owner was a wonderful, responsive person. Also, it isn‚Äôt expensive to have a little more pride in the upkeep of this property. The outside appeared to be a dumping ground for junk and rotted wood. The bathroom flooring can be easily replaced for $40 in materials and MAYBE $100 in labor. There is no reason to keep the bathroom floor looking (and smelling) that disgusting. I just had 800ft2 of floor installed in Gorham for $300 in labor."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The good: the host is super friendly, gave clear instructions, and had VERY neat and clean accommodations!
The not so good: a fair amount of the local roads are in terrible condition (New England in the winter), and the outside of the building could use some updating‚Ä¶
Overall experience was fantastic and the host was SPOT ON with some of their recommendations!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location if you‚Äôre looking to do some hiking. Great price and close to town to grab some food.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The location is close to skiing and hiking. The kitchen was well equipped.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"It is what is. If you‚Äôre looking for a cheap warm cozy place to stay this is it. Small as pictured, hot shower, close to Gorham and less than an hour ride from most sites to see in NH in the winter."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Simple place, but perfect location, and all you need for a home base for hiking and outdoor adventures in the area! Easy check in. Responsive host. Clean. Quiet. Well stocked. Comfortable bed. Good hot water and decent water pressure. Internet could occasionally be a little finicky, but generally worked well. Kitchen is such that at most you probably want to make a simple breakfast, reheat leftovers, or bake a frozen pizza (be aware of the dorm size fridge when packing!). 5 min from some restaurants in Berlin (Exile Burrito!!!) and 15 min from the main drag in Gorham (Big Day Brewing!). There must have been at least a dozen good winter hiking options within a 30 min drive. I will definitely be making this place my home base when visiting the area! A big thank you from me and my labradoodle, Blaze!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and I will definitely be back! Thanks!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great person!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Everything was as promised!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have been trying to get to the White Mountains, specifically Mount Washington, for years - but the weather and our schedule never line up. This weekend, we finally were able to make the trip and Christopher went above and beyond to ensure we had a place to stay - even after we made a mistake with our booking. He ensured we were still able to come down and were able to make this trip - even at an inconvenience to him. It was truly above and beyond.
We hiked with out dog on the many mountain trails within minutes of the location and enjoyed our exploration of the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well worth the money, I would definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations are exactly as pictured and provided everything we needed. Instructions were perfect. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great area for hiking and ATV riding
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"He was super accommodating, especially with a last second booking. I had another trip planned but was canceled due to the hurricane. He got the place all cleaned and setup for me to stay in less than 24 hours. Also allowed a late checkin with zero issues. Great spot if you are looking to chill in Berlin, hike trails and go atv riding. Had a blast up there! The bed is super comfy as well."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris was a great host, he responded very quickly when I had a Wi-Fi question. He gave very specific information on other requests for local dining. His place is nestled in a quiet neighborhood, which was close to our local adventures"

Everything you need to cook on site, BBQ much appreciated. Market place and Liquor Store nearby in Berlin. Functional and useful air conditioning. The accommodation was clean. For the price, I recommend it."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Place needs to address electrical safety issues, stove needs to be replace and a bigger fridge should be look upon replacing. Heaters don't work properly and neither do the lighting. The entrance needs some TLC.
Overall the ubication is good and its a quiet neighborhood."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and relaxing stay. Would definitely come back
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"The property description is exactly what we stayed in. However, there was an insect infestation and remaining trash below the bed. Cleanliness is to be desired!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christopher was very accommodating when we realized we were missing a towel. They responded fast, and we were able to secure an additional one almost immediately. The place was perfect for our group of 4 because we all needed to go to bed and wake up at the same times. The kitchen and TV both worked great. We were so thankful the place was stocked with basic spices. Some other places are just bare bones kitchen. Parking was easy, too. Would definitely stay again. Thanks so much! :)"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The price you pay for this apartment is extremely good for what it is. There is a lot of space and It is well located. It is clean and good for resting after a good hike. I would recommend this for younger people that are going an adventure rather than someone who knows well the zone. Just because I feel it goes more with the charm of the place.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is perfect if you‚Äôre just looking for a place to crash after a long day of hiking/being out and about. Just like other reviewers have mentioned, what you see is what you get. The place was clean and everything worked. We were able to cook dinner with everything there. Nothing fancy, but it‚Äôs got what you need!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at Christopher's place, we used it as a base for some hiking in the White Mountains, and the city of Berlin offers nice places to get food in the area. Highly recommended!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described. Everything you need, nothing you don't. This would be an ideal basecamp for hikers or ATV-ers who need a place to eat and sleep. Note there is no privacy between the sleeping areas. I had a pleasant multi-day stay, and appreciated being able to cook my own meals and do laundry on-site!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Christopher‚Äôs! We like that it is close to the ATV trails, gas and stores. Comfy sleeping, well stocked kitchen, washer and dryer and plenty of hot water."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nearby trails.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had everything we need to cook, rest well after hiking, wash our clothes, and use wifi to work from the Airbnb all week. The shower pressure was great, the kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies and the mini fridge actually held a lot of items. It was in a great location for hiking. Not super fancy, but that wasn‚Äôt what we were looking for, just a cozy place with all the necessities. :)"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Christopher‚Äôs place to ride OHRV‚Äôs and the location was very convenient. It‚Äôs a good size place for two people. Keep in mind there‚Äôs two other rentals in the building so communication with the other renters is key for parking. There is a lot of space, but all three renters had trucks and large trailers. Christopher‚Äôs description of ‚Äú it‚Äôs not a luxury hotel on fifth avenue ‚Äú is correct and as long as you know that going in you‚Äôll have a great stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recently stayed for a spontaneous 4 day getaway- communication was great and the place was just as described. Not fancy, but perfect for 2. Shower is super hot and great water pressure, and all the amenities you‚Äôd expect in a more expensive place. Definitely would stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Camp style apartment which was really awesome. Plenty of parking for a trucks with trailers. Tucked away from most houses so a lot more privacy than expected. Really cool fireplace area which allows you to have a few beers by the fire and hang out with the other renters of the other units. Great trail access. 3/4 miles to Jericho and less than half a mile to Success. 10 out of 10 in my mind. Will definitely stay again! Very affordable!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great. Host was very accommodating. Already planning another trip!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Christopher place was awesome I was booked to stay 5 days my trip was cut short everything was nice perfect for a family with a small pet !
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at this Airbnb! It‚Äôs placed on the quiet side of the river with access to the success trail a quarter mile from the house. There was lots of room for parking and a convenient atv ramp if you needed it. A cute fire pit was there that we wanted to use but it rained most of the weekend.
The space itself was clean and there was enough room for myself, my partner and our two corgis. Of note there is a mini fridge instead of a typical size fridge. This may not matter to most but we almost didn‚Äôt fit all the groceries we brought. The bottom futon folds into a couch so that was convenient to watch tv. It might be a bit tight if 4 grown adults were to rent this space but if you were like us maybe you would only really sleep there.
We enjoyed Chris‚Äô place we would love to go back in the future!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect rental for base camp when adventuring out into the Whites. Exactly as described and Chris had the quickest communication I've ever experienced. Dog friendly is a huge plus.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying here. The bed was super comfortable! And being pet friendly meant that we could have a relaxing trip with our dogs. Plenty of space and amenities. Not a far drive from lots of hiking and decent food options. We mainly spent the days out being active and enjoyed returning back in the evening to relax with hot showers, a full-ish kitchen, and TV/internet. All around quite comfortable."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The AirBnb is overall well equipped and well placed to enjoy White Mountains hikes. The arrival is easy with the automatic box. Christopher is available if we have any questions and he was very accommodating during our stay.
It was a pleasure to stay there!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Berlin is in a great area to do all things outdoors. Our stay at Christopher‚Äôs was excellent for our ski vacation (nearby many mountains). The place was clean and we especially appreciated the in unit washer and dryer :).
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Extremely close to AVH which is perfect for anyone coming up here to work. Was plowed after the snow storm. Had everything necessary for my stay. Didn‚Äôt hear anyone else in the other apartments during days or nights. Plenty of parking.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our long weekend
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was happy to find an affordable place to stay with my husband and our dog at the last minute and so close to the mountains! Christopher‚Äôs place is as described: no luxuries but everything you need in an adventure base camp. We liked having a place to get warm and clean and fed and to sleep comfortably in between big snowshoeing and skiing days. We didn‚Äôt come to the mountains to lay around inside, so this suited our needs perfectly. Christopher was attentive to our needs and responded quickly to texts, and we drove up there through the end of a big snow storm and found the driveway well shoveled so even our little Ford Focus had no trouble with it. We‚Äôll be keeping this place in mind for future adventures."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,place is great
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for winter hiking! Christopher was really quick with communication.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I enjoyed our stay IMMENSELY. We arrived at the right time, so that we may enjoy the snow that we received throughout the weekend. The set up of the home was so cute and cozy, it was a perfect getaway for two hardworking ladies. The hosts were wonderful, super attentive and quickly responsive! We can guarantee that, if the opportunity presents itself, we will be staying there again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had some in between time while we were in the process of relocating to NH. Christopher‚Äôs place was a life saver.

We will be back!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christopher responded quickly to any questions we had. It wasn‚Äôt exceptionally clean, but a nice place overall. It‚Äôs in a good location, not too far from Mount Washington."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"nicely furnished, fullyequipped in the kitchen, soap and toiletpaper, niceTV reception, cellular reception comes and goes, quiet except for neighbors' dogs. didn't bother me as I have a dog."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place has everything you could possibly need for stay in Berlin. The place was clean and neat, easy to find and to get to and they even leave guests a little bundle of firewood in case you want to sit around the fire pit! I highly recommend staying here!
Thanks Again Christopher!"
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place had plenty of towels, sheets, pots, pans, cups, dishes, etc. All easy to locate. There was plenty of garbage disposal. Seemed to be a safe location. Close driving distance to center of Berlin. Adequate sleeping room for 4 people w/o pets or 2 maybe 3 people w/dog (not great place for cats due to local dogs barking which is no fault of owner). Owner/host very responsive to our needs and contacted us immediately with any issues/questions we asked and/or encountered. For this, we would give it 5 stars. On the negative side, didn't have view described (windows frosted), but that was not an issue for us. There was not enough toilet paper, trash bags, and there was no washing machine detergent. Most importantly, it is in need of repairs (plumbing, bathroom area floor, walls cracked). Carpet need to be professionally cleaned or replaced. The place was musty and had a bad odor either from the carpets and/or plumbing issues which was untenable."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for weekend getaway. Super close to the atv trails. The place was clean with a nice outside area too!! Chris was very responsive. Would definitely recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The efficiency unit was perfect for my husband, daughter and myself! We loved exploring and checking out new areas and being away from the crowds of North Conway but close enough to go visit! We will certainly be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christopher‚Äôs place is cozy and has everything you need to enjoy a weekend ATV‚Äôing or exploring the area. Close to stores, gas and very close to the trails!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very comfy and roomy. The kitchen was well stocked, washer and dryer worked great, and it gets plenty of light. Area was quiet and if you're going to ATV there's plenty of parking space and access to the Eastern trails. Check the Washington observatory page off you're going to drive up there. it was foggy with VV001 for 7 straight days but there are three other mountains you can hike."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a nice stay.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at Christopher‚Äôs place. It was convenient for getting to various spots in the White Mountains and was very clean and neat with lots of supplies available.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great efficient studio for hikers or anyone really that needs a place to recharge after exploring New Hampshire and its surroundings. We loved the fire pit/grill area outside.
The area is ideal if you want to avoid the crowds but not be too far from things to do."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chris' home is in a stunning location. The home was very clean, neat and had everything you need to have a comfortable stay.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful large house in the center of town!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was pristine and adorable. Some renovations but host clearly communicated this ahead of time and did not detract from the stay or the space. Spacious and quiet, close to neighbors but once inside it is like an oasis. would stay again, 5/5"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Being able to cook one‚Äôs meals makes a huge difference these days, and a house is so much nicer than a hotel for socializing."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Easily one of the coziest homes I‚Äôve had the privilege to stay at. Kevin was a fantastic host who not only made sure we were accommodated but was kind enough to check in on us to make sure we were happy with the services.
While staying at the Bnb we were slammed with almost 2 feet of snow in a day and the hosts made sure to have the snow plowed for us. This is many of little things that were appreciated from the host. I will be looking forward to staying here next winter for snowboarding season."

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kevin's house was spacious, clean and nicely decorated. Although the temperature went below zero at night, it was very warm inside. Check-in was smooth thanks to clear instructions. I would highly recommend Kevin‚Äôs place to others."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin‚Äôs place was perfect for my boyfriend and I to have a birthday celebration. The house is very warm and inviting. Care was taken into creating spaces to spend quality time with family and friends. The living room was my favorite part of the house - fireplace, board games, warm accent lights. After a day of adventuring, we would wind down with a fire, read books, play board games etc. This weekend successfully worked in shutting our brains off! Thanks Kevin!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very cosy place for its size. Plenty of room but still nicely furnished. The host was proactive and responsive. The kitchen was well stocked. The view was nice and there isn't much to complain about and we will come back.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kevin is responsive and the place is spacious. We have 2 little ones and Kevin provided 2 booster seats for us. The stair is pretty narrow since it‚Äôs an older home. Kitchen is well stocked and great for families.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so peaceful, warm, and inviting. Each room has its own character, which is such a nice touch. The location is PERFECT if you want to get the Wildcat skiing/hiking experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful welcoming home. Easy to get to other areas from the house. Very comfortable. I would stay again.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cozy and Kevin responded to all our queries very quickly. We loved all the little nooks and crannies to escape to for privacy. It was very clean and the decor was attractive. We had hoped for snow to do some skiing, but ended up spending most days reading in front of the fire place, very relaxing. We appreciated all the small touches around the house that made us feel welcomed (chocolates by the bed, the welcome message on Scrabble Board‚Ä¶). The kitchen is beautiful, the beds are comfortable (good pillows!), and , with the exception of some creaky floors upstairs (as wooden floors will do), we enjoyed our time here. The Thai restaurant in town was great, and so was the thrift store downtown."

Communication was very clear making check in and check out easy. Thanks Kevin!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"When we arrived, Kevin was at the house personally ensuring that the contractors working on the kitchen ceiling had cleaned after themselves. His personal attention to detail was impressive! His care for the safety of his guests was evident in multiple places. He gave us a helpful house tour and taught us a little town history. It‚Äôs clear he takes great pride and joy in hosting. Our kids enjoyed all the games. Every room was beautifully decorated AND comfortable. It‚Äôs rare to find both! Well done to Kevin‚Äôs wife. We hope to return for a longer stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A good, comfortable place to stay. The stairs were a killer for seniors, but doable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but wished we were able to stay longer. This place is extraordinarily clean (and my standards are high). So cozy with ambient lighting, tons of pillows and throws and comfortable seating. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was perfect as my son was cooking a ""gourmet"" meal for us. Having cooking supplies and wares as well as coffee for the morning was awesome. Kevin was super communicative, friendly and helpful. Recommend highly if you are looking in this area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin really cares for his place and our stay. The place has all the charm of an old house with all the modern amenities and beautiful art pieces. We didn't have enough time to enjoy it, but we had a fantastic breakfast in the cozy kitchen"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin was so on top of things. He made sure that we had gotten in okay and even took the time, more than once, to tell me the area's history and make suggestions of nearby attractions. His place was cozy and spacious. It had a ""homey"" warm feel to it. If I were ever in that area again, Kevin would be the first place I'd book to stay. It's a place to experience yourself to really understand how great his home is. Perfect host, has a great atmosphere, a real ""must-see"" type of place. Thank you Kevin for allowing us to stay in your home away from home. Lindsey and Deborah"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spacious house, Kevin gave us very good service. Beautiful area for hiking."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kevin‚Äôs place was better than we expected with special little extras that really made a difference. We arrived late and the lights had been left on for us which was a lovely welcoming gesture. Gorgeous place with plenty of room to relax and unwind after a long drive. Fantastic washer/dryer which was so needed for us. Unfortunately we had to leave early due to a forecast hurricane so didn‚Äôt get to go adventuring in the area which looked so inviting - plenty of opportunities for hikes and adventure on ATVs as we arrived late and had to leave early Kevin kindly offered us a late check out which was appreciated. Generous host who seemed genuinely interested in us and our travels. Highly recommend especially if you are a large group travelling together and looking to hike or explore the mountains or river.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in Berlin. Had everything you would need, especially for a longer stay. The owner was very responsive and accommodating. The house had a great vibe to it and was just very homey. would definitely stay again while in the area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was by far the best and most positive experience that I have ever had in booking an Airbnb.
For one thing, Kevin‚Äôs place in Berlin, NH is warm, charming, spacious and well-maintained, in addition to containing anything that one might require for a getaway of a few days.
For another thing, working with Kevin was an absolute delight. He was not only super responsive to my many messages and questions, but he went above and beyond in exceeding my expectations from a host. Kevin went out of his way to vet and find restaurant recommendations for me and my family, and he was super flexible and easy to work with at all times.
I would not hesitate to bring my family back to Berlin, NH and stay at his place again.
Thank you so much for making me and my family feel so welcome, Kevin! And it was so nice to meet you and your family in person, too!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Kevin was an amazing host. He was very responsive and detailed in all the aspects. His place is amazing for a getaway.

Such an amazing host. Will surely stay here in our next trip.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything you want from an Airbnb, cheers!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a place to stay before our mount Washington hike and this house is in a good location about 20-25 mins away. The host was very helpful for checkin and provided us with required information. The property itself needs quite a bit of updates though which it looks like it is underway but not there yet for the price. The beds and pillows were not at all comfortable, creaking when you turn. The bathroom requires major updates. The bedding and sofa pillows had a moldy smell. The kitchen could be stocked with some creamer and sugar."

They went out of their way to bring us a grill on the second day of our stay, something they didn't have to do, but was appreciated. The house was in great shape and there was so much room for our family. If you like to cook like we do, this kitchen is the ideal place to do so - so much space! It truly felt like a home away from home for our week long stay. We plan to come back to the area and hope to be able to stay here again. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is on an quiet street but close to stores and restaurant. We really enjoyed the house. There were plenty of space for everyone, games for adults and kids. There is a beautiful view from the sun room and the bedroom upstairs."

We look forward to staying again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little place! Newly renovated, nicely done. We were coming to quad as a family of 5. My only complaint was the driveway. I wish a picture of the driveway was available. We have a 28 foot box trailer, there was no way we could back it up the driveway. We ended up parking along the road in the front of the house.. idk if that is acceptable but that‚Äôs what we had to do.
We had a great 4 day weekend riding !!"

The purpose of my trip to Northern New Hampshire was to hike in the White Mountains and their home was in an ideal location for that, being close to the intersection of Hwys 16 and 2. The rental was the entire second floor of a house, and I must say I got a good warmup to my next day's hike just from moving my stuff in! My unit had likely been renovated within the last few years and and I was impressed with the all-new furniture, including the beds and mattresses (very comfy), the kitchen pots, pans and dishes/cutlery and the window air conditioners in both bedrooms and living room."

We thought this house was in a more secluded wooded area based on the outdoor photos but it is in a dense suburban neighborhood. Overall great stay, just do your due diligence on the Berlin area before booking."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were here ATVing with my husband, toddler & father. It was the perfect amount of room in the home. Our trailer fit comfortably, truck & one additional vehicle. It is in a neighborhood that seemed extremely quiet. The home itself was exactly like the pictures & it was CLEAN. The linens were so comfortable. As someone who has never used AirBnB & often feels uncomfortable outside our own house, this was amazing. Everything felt just at home. We would definitely return."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Very clean. Plenty of parking. Ride atv right from driveway. Responsive host. Cool electric fireplace. Easy check out.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a spectacular stay! The house is incredible, Carolyn is a super host, always attentive to our concerns. A highly recommended place!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well laid out layout. Perfect for a family of 4. We were 2 adults. The place has everything you need even if you forget some basics. Instructions were clear. All new appliances. Will visit again and recommend. Every stair had a small carpet on it to prevent slipping. Coffee machine had water filled already. Attention to detail was good. Thanks y‚Äôall for having us. My wife and i had a good stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for ATV/UTV enthusiasts!
A little off the beaten path but on ATV/UTV friendly roads. This means you can drive your machine right from your driveway to restaurants, fuel, shopping and the trailheads. Very tastefully remodeled with a rustic modern vibe!
An added bonus‚Ä¶the hosts also run Jericho Adventures. They rent side by sides, four wheelers and everything you need to have a great time in the Jericho Mountain area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cozy home in a great area. The host was incredibly friendly and accommodating and very responsive to all of my inquiries. I would absolutely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot to stay when visiting Northern New Hampshire.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I had a great stay in this nice and cozy house in Berlin.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt like cabin in the mountains. Great experience for what we needed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed in this area every year and never came across this place, and it was good experience for us and had everything that we needed. Lovely home and relaxing space."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great views, and the host is awesome!"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was just as it appeared in the listing. However, the heat wasn't functioning properly. We had to leave the next day because there wasn't anyone that could fix it, which also stuck us with two cleaning fees since we had to go to a new place through no fault of our own. I think it was just an unfortunate circumstance."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to say for price. A bit noisy thought. Was bit messy, floor and bathroom was dirty. I have found beard hair in the bathroom and trash in drawer units. I highly don‚Äôt like the fact that host secretly changed temperature inside when I was away! It was unprofessional and very rude but I don‚Äôt want to argue with host as it could lead to cut heating from her side as host did it manually via internet. Anyway host was always responding and helpful. Overall I would give 3/5 stars for this price. The place itself is beautiful."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"10/10 place to stay. I stayed here for just shy of a month. The host responded promptly and was always helpful. The place was clean and inviting, decorated for the winter season when I was staying. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about my stay!
Durning my stay the washing machine stopped working, the host not only promptly started getting it fixed but also offered to pay for a laundromat in the meantime!
Only thing I will note is parking, while 1 car is super easy to fit, anything more is a little harder. However - the whole city of Berlin has horrible parking, so you still won‚Äôt find a better place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Denisse‚Äôs place was great for me. i spent a week hunting the local mountains and was able to find everything i needed at Denisse‚Äôs.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really liked that house as soon as we arrived, very clean and nicely decorated. We spent time on the front deck in the evening, nice view of the mountains (and Mount Washington I think). Denisse was very proactive when we told her about the lack of hot water, we were able to fix the issue very quickly. Would recommend that place to anybody who are visiting the White Mountains, a little bit out of the center of it, but still only about 20 min from Mount Washington Road."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was great

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was ok for the price. Parking was not what was described in the listing, there was no ac, no fan in the main bedroom, which the listing said there was. Bathroom was very small and shower was tiny. Definitely worth it for the price but a little disappointing."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay for Memorial Day weekend at Denisse‚Äôs place was great! Everything was very clean and the place smelled great! Comfortable bed, nice Roku TVs, plenty of towels and essentials. The front porch has a great view and we really enjoyed having our breakfast out there all weekend! This place is not in the center of town, so its nice and quiet.
The bathroom is on the smaller size, but the spacious shower made up for that!
If you are bringing a medium/large size trailer with a truck, the parking can be a little tricky as the spaces are tight on either side of the house."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Third time staying at this place. Definitely recommend it

Thank you Lauren!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I would highly recommend Lauren's home, it was perfect for our long weekend. It was very clean, with plenty of amenities. Lauren was so helpful throughout the weekend, answering all questions very quickly. And the location was great for riding!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts vacation home is modern, very clean and well appointed. The location is in a very nice part of Berlin. We rented for an atv trip. There was more than enough room for the 7 of us. We were easily able to park 3 vehicles, a small trailer and 5 UTVs. The large backyard and seating area on the river was one of the high points. Each day one or more of us would either sit for coffee in the am or catch a few minutes late in the evening. The hosts do a wonderful job renting out their vacation home. I hope it is available for our next trip."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We went to Berlin for an Atv weekend. Perfect location and the place was very clean! We would highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My co workers and I came back for the week and as always the place was spotless and Lauren was a wonderful host.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Best place I‚Äôve stayed through air bnb so far! Lauren was super hospitable and responsive. Would recommend 10/10 and stay again for our next ATV trip!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The host was extremely responsive and provided so much additional details and information not only regarding her house but for the surrounding areas. The house was beautiful! Super clean and inviting and the open floor plan is perfect for families. The house location was a quick ride from town. The biggest perk was accessing the trails directly from the home. We recommend this place 100% and we cannot wait to return!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lauren is a very responsive host. She was quick to answer my questions and offered many things to do in the area and restaurants they enjoy. The home was very clean, kitchen looked brand new with everything we needed to cook in the home during our visit. The pots and pans and utensils were in great shape, unlike some other places we have been to! There is also plenty of seating in the dining room and living areas, both upstairs and downstairs. We are pretty jealous of their large sectional with recliners! The kids Loved having ‚Äúhuge tvs‚Äù in their rooms with access to our streaming accounts.
About the only thing I would try to add is an air conditioning unit in the downstairs bedroom. The units upstairs would wonderfully for the warm weather we had this week.
If you are in the area to visit Mount Washington or use the OHRV and snowmobile trails, I would definitely recommend this place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lauren‚Äôs place was beautiful, spacious and clean you can tell they put alot of hard work into their house. Also a great spot to the trail system.

Thank you again Lauren!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was comfortable and Lauren responded immediately to any questions or concerns we had via the airbnb app. The house is about a 30 minute drive to Wildcat mountain resort. The River bordering the property was beautiful.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay here was amazing! The house was clean and modern and was exactly what I was looking for. It was the perfect spot for my friends and I to relax and spend the weekend after leaf peepin the fall foliage! I would love to stay here again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at our home away from home. As always Lauren was easy to communicate with and check in was a breeze. The views from the house of the river and mountains are even more beautiful now that the leaves are changing.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While working in Berlin, my co workers and I stayed here for several weeks.
It was a beautiful spacious house that made us feel comfortable while we had to be away from our families for work. Lauren was more than accommodating and always had quick responses when we had a question. It was clean, had great views and it was close to downtown."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren‚Äôs house is really lovely and incredibly comfortable. We were in the midst of a brutal heat wave and I had been skeptical that the portable room air conditioners could keep up with the heat but they were really powerful and did a great job keeping the entire house cool. Lauren had turned them on before we arrived to make sure the house would be cool upon our arrival. Wonderfully comfortable beds and the house was spotless.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I just want to say thank you to Lauren for allowing me to stay in her amazing house. The view was amazing and the house was very clean. 11/10 would stay again!!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of four stayed at Lauren's beautiful house in February. The house is spacious, well-equipped and tastefully decorated. It contains everything your family may need on vacation (even the ski boot dryers!). The kitchen is well-stocked, the beds are comfortable and a living room with a large reclining couch and a gorgeous view of the river is relaxing and inviting. Highly recommend."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"this was the perfect house for a great ski weekend with friends! we enjoy cooking at the house, so we really enjoyed the fully outfitted kitchen and big table that could easily hold everyone. the house was very clean and their bedroom set-up was perfect for our group. although we were there for the winter, i imagine the view out the back windows over the river is beautiful during the warmer months. if i'm back up in the area, i'd definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at River‚Äôs Edge! Everything was nice and clean and just as described. The home was very comfortable and we loved that it had a washer/dryer. We had been traveling for a week so that was really helpful! The yard is beautiful. We really enjoyed using the fire pit and sitting out by the river. It was really easy to walk to a few restaurants. There is a footbridge that crosses the river near the house that was very convenient! It was a little closer to the neighbors than expected but overall was great! We had a really nice stay and would highly recommend it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Waking up and drinking our morning coffee on the river was definitely a highlight of our stay! The house was extremely clean, well kept and had everything we needed. All the beds were comfortable and had enough pillows and blankets (seems silly but is very appreciated). The house is in a nice location just out of the hustle and bustle with a nice walking bridge right around the corner. We were also able to ride our ATVs right to the trail from the house which was pretty cool. The host was kind and responsive and checking in was a breeze, we will definitely be back soon!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great spot to stay for atv'ing, we rode right from the house into the trail system, house was very comfortable and the fire pit by the river was nice at night and also both neighbors were very welcoming and the host was great"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We only stayed for a weekend but it was amazing there, I‚Äôm very glad she let us stay in there and it‚Äôs pretty, there‚Äôs a couple silly design choices and the stairs are fairly steep so make sure u watch ur step, but other than that it was so fun! She was an amazing host and let us use her kayaks and canoe and the kitchen is fully furnished and comes with amenities!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We breezed in for a quick overnight stay while traveling - the location was great and the stay was exactly as pictured/described. Everything was easy and Jenni was a very responsive host - much appreciated.

House was clean and had everything we needed‚Äîplenty of linens and laundry/dish detergent provided. A walkable neighborhood, even walked to an ice cream shop!"

Very clean, safe, and lovely home. Easy check-in. Lots of outdoor amenities for a longer stay, so plan a full weekend or more if you can."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I enjoyed our stay very much! House was very clean and had everything we could have needed. The river is a plus and so is the fire pit. We would recommend this place to anyone and the host is amazing and very friendly and easy to talk to!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved this house. It was clean, well furnished with many amenities and had plenty of space for our family. We enjoyed the river view and fishing. The ATV trails are conveniently located just down the road. Jenni is super responsive and accommodating. We would definitely rent this house again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a great place to stay for ATVing or relaxing by the river. Communication was excellent. We would highly recommend staying here.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is very accurate to the photos, and is so charming! Some important facts about the house is the TV is a smart TV, kitchen is stocked with utensils (even some condiments in fridge), guests may have to buy propane themselves if the ones at the house are empty, neighbors are VERY friendly (they also have friendly dogs), bedroom on first floor has no door, great location for hikes, a Walmart is a short distance away. Overall a great place to stay!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is in a very quiet neighborhood, and is adjoining a very calm stretch of the river. We really enjoyed grilling, canoeing and campfires by the river (ample wood is provided). The outdoor shower was lovely, and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need. We enjoyed playing tennis in a public tennis court just a 2-min walk from the home. There are also great fishing spots on the river, as well as a nearby brook. The home did have some negatives, though. The biggest con was the lack of curtains in most of the bedrooms, forcing us to wake up very early even when we wanted to sleep in! Also, the WiFi was a little bit unreliable, and especially noticeable since both my wife and I were working the whole week and had to take video calls. Another issue was the creaking floor, which was especially pronounced at night (but maybe this is normal for houses - we live in a city apartment). But overall, it was a very nice stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay with family and friends, Jenni is really helpful and communicative. Supermarkets are just few mins drive away."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic experience with Jenni. Great communication, easy entry, plenty of space, clean!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house on the water. We enjoyed walking across the pedestrian bridge. 25 minute drive to Mount Washington, which was our main reason for the stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our young family enjoyed staying at Jenni‚Äôs place. It was honestly our best air bnb experience yet and we‚Äôll be back! Her house was clean, well stocked with kitchen essentials, had comfortable beds, beautiful yard, quiet street. I‚Äôm not sure what more we could want! Checking in/out was extremely easy and Jenni was very communicative. I highly recommend this home. Enjoy!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jenni was a great host and her place is beautiful! It is decorated in such a cute way. I love the kitchen and the bathroom interior design in particular. My young family and I stayed for several days and enjoyed the cozy, homey atmosphere. Jenni was really good at communicating within minutes during my stay. She also has her next-door neighbor available to answer any questions. My only complaint is that only some of the windows had blackout shades, and the all but 1 room are too bright to sleep in without them.

Truly you‚Äôll get more than what you paid for. Owner Jenni is a nice person and very helpful. Backyard is an amazing place to spend time and we enjoyed a lot kayaking on the river. There are many out-door activities around. ATV trail is just few blocks down. Rafting, hiking, boating, moose watching, and many more. Safe and quit Neighborhood with friendly neighbors. We surprised with the bed on skids(pallets) in the master bedroom but later learned that it signifies the iconic annual ‚ÄúRiverFier‚Äù festival in the town.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed multiple times with Klaus, and have never been disappointed. Units are always spotless, full stocked with anything you may need. Close to a gas station, Walgreens and numerous places to eat.
The building is also on a street that has ATV/UTV access so we are able to leave right from the building."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Expect a nice a clean apartment with all you need and more. Very well located and easy parking next to the house. That was a great place to stay for the week .
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Klaus is a great host! The unit has modern finishes, clean, comfortable, and all the essential amenities. It was really great being so close to the Presidential Range and skiing. When back in Berlin I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus' place was great and just as advertised! Clean, comfortable, and in a great location for hiking in the White Mountains. Would definitely stay again."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and super easy check in. If visiting in the winter be extremely careful as the driveway was very ice and my car slipped when trying to exit but other than that it was a great stay. I will definitely be back.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in an ideal location!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and the host is very responsive.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Klaus‚Äô place was great! Clean and perfect for what I needed during clinical rotation. Close to local hospital and downtown Berlin. Driveway is a little steep and icy but able to tolerate with 2WD.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely perfect for a relaxing getaway. Everything you could need for a short, or longer stay. Make sure you rent some Atvs and visit the trail park, it is worth it. :) highly recommend this apartment it‚Äôs comfortable and clean. This was the second time I have stayed here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visited New Hampshire for the weekend to tackle some of the 48 and this place was great. The location was less than 30 minutes from many trailheads that I was looking to get to. Everything you needed was just a few minutes away whether it was gas, Walmart, food, etc. It was a great location and being able to see the back drop of the mountains from the driveway definitely makes you consider making the move to New Hampshire :). The place was exactly as described and would definitely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time here. It's a cute little apartment that was nice to relax in. We went up for the sunrise drive on Mt. Washington and we didn't have much planned besides that. The apartment had a bunch of brochures to go through where we decided on what we were doing for the day and we had a blast!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for a great stay!!

Plus, the mountain views from here are amazing!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, and comfortable. Perfect spot for a few days workation in between a camping weekend and a hiking weekend. The apartment had everything I needed. Wifi worked great. The neighborhood/town is quite sleepy but it might just have been that I didn‚Äôt get out much during the week due to working and rain. There are some nice mountain views and a supermarket a few minutes drive away. Beautiful hiking nearby and Jericho Lake State Park was great for kayaking and a swim."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect spot close to a lot of day hiking. A nice little apartment to wind down in
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked out perfectly for my needs- running the Mt Washington Road Race!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a terrific warm and inviting place to stay. Anyone who stays here will love it
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nicely decorated Airbnb with a very comfortable bed (always a priority) and a well-equipped kitchen. For a few days of my month-long stay, I could hear the TV of the people staying upstairs but for the most part, I wasn't bothered by noise. I didn't hear anything once the door was shut in the bedroom so it seems like a well-insulated room. I was working while there and never had any issues with the WiFi. I appreciated having a full washer and dryer and a mud room for removing my hiking boots. I highly recommend checking out Mount Jasper Trail if you have a chance.
Contrary to a comment of another reviewer, this Airbnb is located in a residential neighborhood, not an industrial area. There is what looks like a paper mill several blocks away so perhaps that's what they were referring to but the home itself is surrounded by blocks of other homes. The host thoughtfully researched an early question I had about the area. Really appreciated that and enjoyed my stay."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot to base myself for a weekend of skiing in the Whites. Great location and great host. Super easy.

needs improvement: freezing cold bathroom & noisy upstairs apartment"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for three weeks, and it was perfect for a longer stay‚Äîit had everything I could have needed in-unit, was within walking distance of several convenience stores and a drugstore, and just a few minutes‚Äô drive to the grocery. The unit itself was clean and comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed in apartment 2 to ski for a few days, and it couldn‚Äôt have been better. The apartment was cleaned beyond perfection when we arrived, and the security of a passcode lock made us feel secure. All amenities were fully functional and the couch was even upgraded while we were staying there. To our happy surprise, a lot of spices were available just above the stove! All in all, Klaus‚Äô apartment provided an experience that only added to our ski trip. 10/10"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed here a few times before and it is always super clean. The location is also amazing - 20 minutes from Wildcat Mountain, 45 minutes from both Breton Woods and Sunday River. I always have a great time here."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and great communication from Klaus, which made the check in process easy!"

2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Goood place if you‚Äôre in the area for winter sports etc
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying in Berlin. The apartment was very efficiently equipped, parking was a breeze, and we appreciated being able to use the full kitchen. Would definitely return. Thanks, Klaus!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to lay your head when traveling threw Berlin, NH."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent apartment for someone like me who travels frequently for work and at night wants to feel at home
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus' place was a great spot to stay for a weekend in the mountains. It was clean and we'll located, and I loved the mountain view out the bedroom window."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Klaus place was a cozy and comfortable place to relax after our adventures. It is a good space for a couple who just needs a place to unwind after a day of hiking, biking, or any other of the many activities you can enjoy in the white mountains."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great host and very helpful. Was locked out and Klaus quickly assisted with keypad entry.
Highly recommended."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently placed for access to the white mountains.
We stayed at Klaus's place for a couple nights and enjoyed the home from home feel with a full kitchen and comfy linens, it's what was needed after a long day hiking."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! The apartment was super clean and comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with everything you need to cook, and there‚Äôs tons of great hiking nearby. We had a bit of an issue with the keypad lock but Klaus was incredibly helpful and got it sorted out right away. Looking forward to visiting again sometime!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was a good value for a short term stay, and check in and check out were very easy. I was sort of just passing through and working during the day, and there was a decent desk set up, which I appreciated. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking. I was traveling solo and had plenty of space, but think it would be a tight space for more than 2. The location seemed like a great spot for launching off for day hikes and other outdoor activities, but there's not much to do in the immediate walking area vicinity. The area was a little more industrial than I was expecting, which isn't necessarily a problem, just something to keep in mind!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall it was a nice place to stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great! Was worried about parking with a trailer but everything worked out. Trails are right there, Jericho mountain park was the best. (Go to the wind towers)"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus was very easy to communicate with. My husband and I had a great time staying at his apartment. It's a best place to stay for people who are interested in hiking, skiing or any other outdoor activities. Good value for the money!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment 2 was fabulous! There was a kitchen fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils, dishes - everything you can think of! (Walmart is only a few minutes away to pick up groceries.) The bed was very comfortable (a little on the harder side, but we loved it) with a nice closet to keep our bags out of the way. Living room was cozy for watching Netflix and YouTube in the evenings. It was very convenient having a washer and dryer as well as the dishwasher. The place was clean and beautifully decorated. Sheets and towels were clean and plentiful. While there was not a ton to do in Berlin, it was a central location to all of the activities we had planned and was easy to get around. Parking in the back was convenient and the keypad for self-check in (and getting in and out) was perfect. Even with other guests in the other units, we never felt like we didn't have privacy. Overall just a great experience!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! When I had an unfortunate event to go to Klaus responded quickly and allowed me to switch my departing date and get funds back. It‚Äôs a very clean and cute apartment. Would recommend for sure!!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great space close to amazing hikes!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and in a great area!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The best stay in Berlin!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This unit was exactly what we needed! Our small family had an event in the area and required a place for us to call home for two days. The unit was comfortable, recently updated, and very clean. Klaus was very responsive to communications and made us feel very welcomed!"
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay here. It was neat and clean and pleasant to stay in. The kitchen was thoughtfully stocked and had everything we needed for our short stay. The area was quiet.
We had a couple of hiccups with the driveway being a little steep and not plowed when we arrived (couldn‚Äôt get the car in), and also a smoke alarm that beeped the two days and nights we were there. I really appreciated that Klaus picked up when I called at midnight(!) to tell him I could not get the car in, but it was definitely frustrating to have to shovel out the driveway after a late arrival.
It would have been nice to get a response on the smoke alarm issue before we left.
I think those were special case kind of issues, though, and not something I‚Äôd expect to run into regularly! Overall we had a good stay."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Klaus's place is extraordinary. Comfy & cozy and everything one needs!
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A good place to stay if you‚Äôre looking for somewhere on the cheaper side. Great for staying near mount Washington but a bit of a drive if you‚Äôre looking to spend time in the North Conway area. Price reflects quality and size of space
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean place conveniently near Sunday River. Great for a weekend trip!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klau's place is a nice and convenient appartement in an house. Large kitchen, comfy rooms, with all you need! A parking at the rear. 25min from Wildcat, 5min to jasper mount! Nice place to enjoy NH outdoors activities."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Space was very well taken care of clean! It was great to have extra blankets as well. Living room was cute and cozy. I love the sign in book as well and book of attractions in the area. Planning on coming back during the summer !
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Everything you need at an Airbnb and more! We stayed here for the great value and would go to Wildcat or Attitash Mtn each day. Great place to crash!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus's place was awesome, great amenities, location (really close to a nice bar), and very clean when we arrived. A little tight for four people, but an all around great Airbnb that is only 20 mins from appliachia trail head."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Klaus‚Äôs place was beautiful. It is in a semi industrial neighborhood. Klaus does a great job with making sure your stay feels like home. There was plenty of brochures on what to do. Food was in minutes away from the house. The snow removal for the driveway was quick and efficient. The house was clean. It was in great distance of several ski areas. We did have one annoyance with the fire alarm in the basement going off all week but Kalus did communicate with us about it. Would recommend the place to a friend.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and lovely apartment.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here to ski at Sunday River for the weekend. It was perfect for what we needed! Great value and very clean. Thank you, Klaus!"

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. Convenient location. Klaus is a great host!
2019-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,If the place had been kept up with the dusting and the carpet vacuumed it would have been a great stay
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very worth it! Cheap and affordable with great views!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great stay!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a remarkable place. Clean, spacious and comfortable. Next time I come out to New Hampshire, Klaus's place is theright place to be!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus's place was great. It had everything we needed, especially in the kitchen! Janet, the co-host was super responsive when we needed help and we really appreciated knowing to reach her instead while Klaus was away."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great apartment! Clean, local, with washer, dryer, and dishwasher. Everything you would need when visiting the White Mountains. I highly recommend!"
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice. Full kitchen. Excellent value. You must provide your own tv access.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was absolutely clean and well-designed small place. You would find everything you need for your stay in this apartment. Klaus was a great host and gave a lot of instructions to help you in your stay. The location was good if you are visiting north of New Hampshire and White mountain National park. There is a large Walmart in the town and you could find all the amenities that you need to cook here. I would highly recommend staying here if you find this place free for your dates.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My first experience with this type of stay and loved this apartment. It was quiet, clean and very comfortable. Close to some great restaurants and beautiful scenery. Klaus is a great host, attentive to every detail. This will be our new go to place! üòå"
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was truly sparkling clean & all brand new. Very cozy, with all of the necessary amenities for a short or long stay."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little spot! Wifi was a little hit and miss but we didn‚Äôt spend much time in the apartment for that to really bother us! Clean and comfortable!
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our rental was wonderful! Aside from some minor confusion at check in, the unit was very clean and the space was simple but awesome. We had everything we needed and had a great time in the area. We would love to stay in the unit again!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place. The host is accomodating and quick to respond. Very close to the mountains of New Hampshire, and easy to get groceries and food around Berin."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Klaus has considered any needs you may have while being away and made sure to meet them. There were even ziplock bags and plastic food containers which came in handy when preparing food to take with us for our 3 year old. There is also a water filter pitcher which was greatly appreciated. It was these touches that really made you feel at home.
The apartment is also spotless. This was our first air bnb experience and Klaus has set the bar super high for any future stays."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great value! Everything was comfortable, clean and delivered on expectation. We had all the amenities that we needed for two nights. The apartment was quiet, secure and a great space for 2-3 people for a short term stay. Great hosts who were flexible and prompt to respond when we asked for a later check in/check out time (we so appreciated it!). Wifi connection was excellent, water was hot, and there was AC/heat available to us. Just keep in mind that the area in which the apartment is located is a little farther away from popular hiking and activities. It took us about 35-40 minutes to get to Mt. Washington and an hour to get to Conway, NH, which has a larger bar scene/nightlife. The area surrounding the apartment's location is a little tired & worn, but we never felt unsafe or unwelcome. I would recommend and would stay again!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place at a great price.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was really happy with the place and there was no reason to feel otherwise.
Good address!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, good location, great host."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was located in a bad area of town. But it was very quiet and clean. Was disappointed that there was no soap or dishwashing pods to wash dishes or garbage bags. And no shower soap. Host was very responsive to provide necessities and we bought some items to use and left them for future guests. Also no instructions on how to use Roku tv.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, recently renovated, place to relax after hiking in the white mountains. Most trailheads we used were 30-45 min by car. Kitchen contained all basics and a dishwasher. Very happy that there was a free washingmachine and dryer available in the appartment. Good value for money!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! The apartment was very clean and the host was great!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Klaus‚Äô place was clean, perfectly located and suited our needs. Quiet neighborhood with access to highways and a short trip to local sightseeing/hiking. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book with Klaus!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had to reroute bc of a tragic accident that took place in a town very close to Berlin. I called Janet about the expiration of the security code and graciously she extended it to midnight. Place was very clean and close to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, Walmart and dominos.. overall it was a great experience and I will go back in the Fall.. thanks Janet and klaus"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to rest & relax after a day of hiking in the White Mountains. Very functional & clean apartment. Quiet and peaceful. Would definitely come back.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment, great location. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very Nice place . Great Communication.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed to be closer to the Path of Totality for the 2024 Solar eclipse. It was only about a 40 min drive to the place we watched from but because it was April, a lot of the winter stuff like tubing etc were closed and the summer spots were not opened yet but we knew this ahead of time. Eclipse was the point of the trip :) We didnt anticipate most of the restaurants being closed though but I think owners were afraid of the unprecedented eclipse crowds.
The house itself was adorable though. Super clean and had all the amenities you can imagine. It was very spacious and felt like home. A close drive to many winter/summer destinations in the area but the direct neighborhood/town is kind of run down. This beautiful home and another close by kind of stick out because theyre so nice. The house was spotless, beds were super comfortable and kitchen was huge. The only suggestion I have is for brighter lighting in the kitchen/dining area but thats literally it. A wonderful stay! Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here! Communication, check-in and check-out instructions were clear and easy. The house was very clean, comfortable, and you can't beat the location if you're looking to do some skiing at Wildcat or hiking near Pinkham Notch. And, if you forgot something, Walmart is just 5 minutes away. Hopefully Shannon's house will be available for our next trip to the area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Very easy checkin and checkout. Shannon was very response and helpful with questions we had.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay at Shannon‚Äôs place. Very responsive to my messages when I had questions, had the driveway plowed without requesting, and very helpful. The house is nice, spacious, and beds are comfortable. We would definitely stay here again"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was as advertised. We enjoyed our stay a lot. Would have loved a winter wonderland but that is mother nature‚Äôs fault.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon always attentive. This property was amazing it was beautiful very very spacious. Quiet peaceful the view from the master bedroom breath taking ‚Ä¶.. I will definitely come back‚Ä¶. And Shannon your amazing host !!!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shannon was an excellent host! Met all our needs and gave great referrals for places to eat and visit! The house was spotless and very accommodating. There was a beautiful fire place in the back yard with great views and the master bedroom had awesome windows that gave a breathtaking view of the sunrises with lots of privacy as well! My husband and I had a great relaxing weekend will definitely be back this winter!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was seamless. We had everything we needed and more. It was warm and very comfortable. We will definitely try to get this house again on future trips to the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shannon‚Äôs home is exactly as described!
Checking in was easy and we had everything we needed for a weekend stay.
After a long day of riding our ATV, it was nice to come back and hang out on the comfy couch and watch a movie! Unfortunately it was cloudy the whole weekend so we were never able to catch a sunrise through the awesome windows of the master bedroom!
I highly recommend Shannon‚Äôs place to anyone looking for a nice private location with great amenities."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic long weekend enjoying the fall colors and SXS trails. The location of the vacation home is great, away from the traffic noise yet close to town. We really enjoyed sitting on the deck taking in the views. Very comfortable and plenty of space...love the art in the bathroom with the instructions...very funny."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"great place, clean, plenty of space...."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to stay and would highly recommend! It met all of my families needs and was close to the ATV trails that we came to ride. The house was clean and had everything you could need.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family and another family spent two nights at Shannon‚Äôs place so that we could ride our side by side and four wheelers. The house was cute, clean, and had everything we needed.
The only problem we had was that it was really hot in the two smaller bedrooms. The fans in those two rooms really didn‚Äôt help and they were loud when on.
Other than that, we were happy with our stay. Shannon was great!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for what I wanted. Close ride to trails, restaurants, grocery store, etc. The beds are extremely comfortable and I must say clean as a whistle. I very much would like to come here again in the very near future. Thanks a lot Shannon"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay! Shannon‚Äôs place was super clean and very comfortable. Thoughtful touches throughout made us feel right at home! Downtown is just a walk away and it‚Äôs a 15 min drive to Valley Way trailhead for hiking. Master bedroom has walk in closet perfectly fits a pack and play if you have a baby with you. Wrap around porch is great for hanging outside and front facing windows have great light and views. Will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From my first interaction with Shannon (asking a question) to my last, she was incredibly responsive and helpful. Her property is exactly as described in the listing. And it's a beautiful! home. The beds were so comfortable that I actually slept very well (which rarely happens when I travel). The home was immaculate and we are all neat freaks, lol. It was exactly what we wanted for our UTV/Motocross trip to Jericho State ATV Park and hiking in NH. Shannon was helpful in every possible way. We loved our accommodations and we now hope to do this as a yearly trip - and we hope to be able to stay at this property again. I would probably stay at any property listed by this host (Shannon). She is highly skilled at being a host and we could not have had a better experience. We only stayed 2 nights. But, we would have happily stayed there a whole week. If you're interested in staying near great hiking and great ATV/UTV/Dirtbike riding, this is probably the best place available in Berlin."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Beds & Linens were very nice and the house was very, very clean. Host was very quick to respond to our questions. Towels/washcloths provided were sufficient for our party. The following are things that we noted that the host may want to consider for future guests: We arrived in the dark and there was no visible house number. No bathroom on sleeping level (upstairs). Stairs are steep, have narrow tread and a sloped ceiling next to the railing which make them difficult to navigate for the elderly and tall people, which we had both in our group. Poor lighting throughout house. Lamps in each room would be an improvement. No heat or air conditioning on second floor (sleeping level). For the size of the kitchen, a dishwasher would be a nice addition."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay! The house was immaculate and as pictured! The living room and deck were amazing with exquisite views. The kitchen was large with an abundant amount of counter space. The only thing I wish I could change was the weather(rain). I'll probably visit again sometime in the fall. Thanks again for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and spacious, perfect for our family of four. Very clean and had everything we needed. Would gladly stay again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great surprise for my anniversary. We had so much fun and will definitely be back! So relaxing by the fire with such a beautiful view.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb was amazing! Super clean and comfy especially if you have a family and are looking to have great time in the mountains. The host is great and super responsive as well and the home is in a safe area. Would definitely stay again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I had been to the Berlin area as kids, snowmobiling with our family, but had not been back since we were adults. This was our first time back in close to 30 years. In the past couple of years, we have purchased ATV's and are starting to look for places to go with them. We figured Berlin might be a good area to look at. I reached out to Shannon about her listing, and she was quick to respond to me about my questions - how close are the trails etc. My husband and I had a weekend free so figured we would venture up to look for ourselves to ensure when we booked for a longer stay, that the accommodation would be what was listed. The house was perfect for us. It was clean, organized, the decor was updated to make us feel comfortable. There was a great little journal there that other people that have visited the house wrote recommendations of what they had done during their stay. Needless to say - I will be reaching out to book this house in the near future again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon‚Äôs place was so nice and made us feel right at home. It was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The location is great with a lot of activities close by. We will definitely stay again!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shannon's place was amazing! It was a fantastic retreat in the White Mountains. Super easy to get to all of the local trail heads and such an amazing place to relax after a day in the mountains. She was very responsive and made us feel at home.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a ski trip and the location was perfect. Right among the mountains and reasonable commute time. The master bedroom is so pristine that you wake up to the sun rising above the mountains in front of you. Shannon was really considerate too and allowed me to be flexible with my dates since there was a snow storm and it was Christmas weekend. Had lots of fun and would definitely come back here with my family and friends.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! We came here for opening riding weekend. Excellent location to ride the trails right from the house or a walk down to heritage park. Big living room area with plenty of seating to hang out and relax. Fully stocked with towels to accommodate both bathrooms. Having a second full bathroom is key when staying with others. Bonus game room in the basement with lots to do. Plenty of parking for our 2 trucks and 2 trailers. And Denise was very responsive!

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our 2nd time at this home and, again, it was fantastic. The new furniture in the living room was very comfortable, kitchen well set up, and bedroom linens clean."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've been staying in airbnb's in the berlin area for 3 years. We go there to ride sxs's. Denise's home was by far the nicest we've found . This home is better than the description. Parking my f 250 crew cab with a 24 foot trailer on the street in front of the house was the easiest and best parking I've had in the area. The driveway was big enough for two sxs's and a vehicle. The neighborhood is very quiet and nice. This home is very well stocked and immaculate. Nicest furniture we've experienced. This is our first choice for future trips.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect for our ATV trip. Clean, comfortable, well stocked and lots of thoughtful extra touches. Loved the game room! The space in the common rooms was great for a group. Close to trails was an added bonus. Definitely recommend and we hope to go back!"

The home is well kept and very clean. Owners take pride in their home. Downstairs ""man cave"" is an added bonus and lots of fun. Upstairs is a great space for kids with some kids toys and awesome ceiling lights! The only downside was some areas had creaky floors. Awesome bonus was Denise's book full of information and we tried 2 restaurants on the list! Recommend this house!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, and beautiful location. Our original Airbnb had a water outage for the area, so we found this beautiful location for a better price and experience.
The host (Kyle) was quick and responsive, and even sent someone to shovel and salt the snow in the driveway.
The driveway is steep, but once inside, you feel taken out of New Hampshire.
The house has modern features like a towel rack warmer, ambient lights, a smart heated vanity mirror, and more.
Everything was clean, and instructions are super easy and streamlined. It was a pleasant experience and we‚Äôd recommend to anyone in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kyle‚Äôs place was a treat. Super clean and very relaxing. There was a storm on one day that we stayed and the driveway and stairs were shoveled for us! So kind.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle's property was so clean and provided so many extra amenities. Everything from check-in to check-out was easy, during our stay it snowed and we woke up to a clean driveway which was a nice surprise. Staying here felt like right at home. I definitely would plan another stay!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Clean. Great host.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place, very modern and super clean. There isn‚Äôt much to do in the immediate area, but not a bad ride to Wildcat Mountain for skiing (about 30 mins) or to Attitash (about 50 minutes). The only concern for us would have been the steep driveway. It wasn‚Äôt an issue because the weather was mild, but if it had snowed or was icy-the driveway would have been very difficult to navigate without 4 wheel drive. Overall, a great bargain!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular! My family and I stayed here for a few days after Christmas and it was nothing short of spectacular. The house was spotless and it had everything you can possibly need. Kyle is super attentive to details from multitude of food spices, games and even portable containers for food. He was super kind, attentive and would answer very quickly. We ran into problems with our car and he helped us get out of a huge issue that he didn‚Äôt have to help with at all. I would recommend this stay to anybody and will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle's place was everything as described. The check-in was super easy.
In a very quiet neighborhood, the house is well equipped, spacious and super clean. It is very close to a gas station, state parks and Gorham. The mountains are very pretty.
Kyle has been very helpful and very fast to answer my questions. Clear instructions and very detailed guide for places to eat and see.
We are very satisfied and will try to go back in the summer for some hiking activities."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kyle‚Äôs home was above and beyond what was described in the listing! It was such a beautiful, clean and comfortable home with extremely thoughtful touches from wireless charging lamps on every end table/nightstand to a Graco Pack n Play with a crib sheet in the upstairs closet! Also, the home has many upgraded features such as a towel warmer in the bathroom. From the moment you walk in, you feel comfortable and relaxed. It was impeccably clean. The kitchen was stocked for cooking (including storage containers and bags for leftovers!). The bathroom had all the basic toiletries you would need plus some extra items you might not expect in most rentals. Kyle gave us great recommendations for places to go with our toddler while visiting. He was great to communicate with and made us feel very welcome. We hope and plan to return - it was a great getaway for us to unwind and enjoy the beauty of New Hampshire in the winter."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kyle‚Äôs place was PERFECT for our group of 4.

My wife is extremely picky but LOVED her bday getaway (she had to be removed from the couch on last day lol). A good amount of food places in the area, even a few vegan options. Kyle‚Äôs property was beyond what we were expecting so another trip will DEFINITELY be planned."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Air BNB far exceeded our expectations. I was not expecting the house to be completely stocked with everything we need + more. (It felt like you were right at home)

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend! First, Kyle is incredibly responsive and friendly.
The house was immaculate. It has a pretty view of the mountain. Looked newly renovated, very nicely done. The kitchen had everything we needed. The bathroom had some nice upgrades like a towel warmer and a lighted mirror. The beds were very comfortable, so was the couch to hang out on.
We were traveling with young toddlers, so a few things to keep in mind. The stairs inside the house are pretty steep. Our 4 year old did fine, but we needed to carry the 2 year old. There is a safety gate to use of needed. Second, which is our fault we didn‚Äôt pay attention to the photos, there is no dining room table (but there is a kitchen island to eat at) which had 3 stools, but the stools don‚Äôt have any backs on them, which was also a challenge for our youngest. Also, the driveway is very steep and narrow. I‚Äôd be concerned for anyone with mobility issues.
Overall we loved it and would definitely recommend!"

His home is absolutely lovely, to say the least! The Inside of the home is brand new and everything was clean and minimalist, Which made our experience stress-free! Kyle was so easy to communicate with and very helpful. We went out to eat a few times in Gorham, which was less than a 10 minute drive away.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful stay! Couldnt have been anymore comfortable!! Definitely felt like home away from home!! The place is beautiful and fit my whole family. Kyle was a great host any questions i had he was very quick to respond. I will be booking again for the winter and fall views !!!! 5 stars!!!!!
,,,The host accidentally gave the key code info to another group that was staying in a different airbnb. The host apologized but it was beyond terrifying to wake up to three guys walking into the airbnb I was staying in.
,,,"I'll share the experience of my stay here. There was no dish detergent or dishwasher detergent in the kitchen. There was also no handsoap or wastebasket in the bathroom. The bed in the bedroom and pull-out bed from the couch were extremely uncomfortable to the point of being painful to lay on.
I also feel the need to point out that the area surrounding the home is rough. There are several buildings that look bombed-out and partially demolished. Broken walls, windows, etc. Now, AirBnB and the host will point out that this is out of the host's control; and it is, to a degree. However, I'll point out that there are several images of Berlin that are included with images of the home that do not reflect the immediate (several blocks radius) area surrounding the home.
I understand it's the responsibility of the potential guest to research the area if they are unfamiliar with it before booking, but again, the included images are misleading at best and I think it's only fair to warn others that may be unaware of this.
I only spent so much time detailing my issues with the surrounding area because I feel it will be a point of contention with the host and I want to be clear.
These issues compounded enough that I felt it was best to cancel as soon as possible so that I could try to find another home to use as a hub to explore the White Mountains, and minimize the charges I would incur."
,,,When I had arrived there was snow blocking entrance the fridge handle was broken and I had found chips behind the bed also the area was blatantly racist and I had felt uncomfortable walking around.
