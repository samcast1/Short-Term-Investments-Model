2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This place was wonderful!!! The fire pit with the view of the lake was the perfect end to our days. The water was pretty brown so we never went swimming but it would’ve been perfect for kayaking or canoeing. The inside of the place was so cute and clean!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely hosts and lovely home
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place if you’re trying to stay local to the town!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Such a nice place with charming accents in the house and comfortable beds. We really enjoyed the outside patio overlooking the lake. Nicely shaded so didn’t feel the late summer heat!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a really nice time, had plenty of space between the outside and indoor seating and were impressed by how clean and accommodating the BNB was!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Rachel was a good communicator, friendly, and very responsive. We enjoyed the cozy cabin on the lake, especially the patio area overlooking the lake and with the fire pit. We enjoyed using the two kayaks, walking on trails near the lake. The house was well stocked with towels, toilet paper, games to play, etc. Even with just one bathroom we six women got along fine. We enjoyed family time! We had some delicious meals at Grizzly’s Grill and at the Oaks on Eagle Creek ( 2 restaurants Rachel recommended)! Thanks for your hospitality Rachel."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a great one! The host was very responsive, and appeared to really care about our stay. The house had a perfect view and was very clean. The yard had complete privacy and was safe for our toddlers. Would 100% recommend to others!"
2023-06-01,3,Group trip,"Unfortunately this stay was not as expected. We were unable to use the lake that the property was on due to lake water very unswimmable and full of algae and weeds. (This is one of the main reason we booked this place). Outside patio area very unkept- over growing weeds, spiders, dirty patio and long grass. Inside of the house was ok but small bathroom for 8 people. Lots of leftover food/ random items in the kitchen. Overall made the best of it was able to go to the beach about 10 min away from property."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house was cute and beds were comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kind hosts, great house! We had a rotating team of 2-4 staying for four months, and the home was perfect."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Myself and a few friends stayed at this beautiful home for a weekend getaway. It was the perfect place to stay for a weekend. very clean and lots of room inside and outside to hangout.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house is very cute, and nicely decorated. Close to town and recreation. The lake is small, but my husband caught 10 bass in less than an hour in the kayak!!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay on Foot Lake. Beautiful backyard patio!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay. Comfortable and clean. Wi-Fi 80-200Mbps down. 10Mbps up. Did not do any video calls but no problem streaming video.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a wonderful time. The place was spotless, nicely decorated and with everything you need for a wonderful stay.
The surroundings are beautiful, great patio, fantastic backyard and a beautiful deck by the water.
It can get noisy at time because of the proximity of US 71 but you quickly forget about it.
Perry and his wife are extremely responsive and answer all questions within minutes.
We made memories for a lifetime and that’s priceless."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fabulous long weekend get away!!! The place is special. Very clean - very well appointed and a great amount of living space/s! The deck is where we ate almost every meal...it was spectacular! the dock and raft in the lake were perfect for our hot day. The firepit is great. The outdoor bags were a fun extra! We will be back!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The lake place is perfect for one or two families to enjoy a long weekend! It is swimmable off the dock with being 3ft deep well off the dock. They have a canoe and kayak to use and the water is very clear. Fun to fish off the dock too! Thank you for another great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay as always! Always love the Willmar place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, during our stay Perry was very quick to respond to my questions.
Second, the home is beautiful and well-maintained. It’s spacious, well furnished and comfortable. The deck was shaded and had both a table for meals and cushioned chairs for relaxing or conversation. The kitchen had everything needed. We just brought the food and cleaned up after ourselves. There are four different sleeping areas with comfortable beds, plus two bathrooms. It’s right on Lake Eagle and there is a canoe and kayak for use."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perry was extremely responsive and accommodating. The house was clean and came with so many amenities! I packed some toys for my boys (ages 1 and 3) but it was not needed, as the house was already stocked! They also included strollers, high hair, pack-n-play, etc. The downstairs bedroom was great for our family of 4, as it had a cute little kid size bed as well! You can tell the owners definitely had kiddos in mind, very family friendly…they even had a cute little nook!
We liked the outdoor toys and enjoyed swimming off the dock. The lake is a nice size and had good success with fishing!
There were many good food options, accessible stores and we took our son to “Big Kahuna fun park” to celebrate his bday where they had mini golf, go karts, arcade games and bumper boats.
My husband and I were saying we wish we had stayed longer. Super cozy home and would stay here again! Thank you for hosting your home."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time! Beautiful property!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have been coming to Perry’s place for 4 years now. Its always clean, great location. Wilmar is such a kid friendly town! So many great family memories made!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were four old friends having girls weekend at the cabin. It was perfect for us! Very peaceful and homey. They have stocked everything you could possibly need and there are so many homey touches to make your stay comfortable. Kitchen is on the small side but that’s ok as there’s a great covered deck with a large table and seating area. House is very clean and we found the beds and linens very comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 4th year at this cabin and we love it! Perfect for our family and Perry and Jeanien are wonderful hosts.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed a long weekend and capping off summer with family at the lake house! Everything was provided- from toiletries in the bathrooms, condiments & spices in the kitchen, life jackets, water toys & fishing gear to lawn chairs and fire pit supplies! Perfect and comfortable spot to enjoy lake time with family or friends - we certainly hope to be back again to make more memories!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a long awaited trip and it did not disappoint! The house was immaculately clean and stocked with everything you might need for the perfect lake visit. (It was a kid-free girls’ weekend for me, but I noticed a nice selection of kids toys and books and child-sized life preservers that make me want to come back with my family). We enjoyed wine on the lakeside patio and kayaking on the beautifully clear lake (including a nice clean sandy dock area). We also slept so well on the comfortable beds. Absolutely perfect experience!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I decline to write a public review.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is awesome! It had everything we needed from dishes and cooking utensils to life vests, a canoe and tubes for the lake. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay for the weekend."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The lake house was perfect! It was very clean and comfortable. The lakeshore was very clean and free of weeds. It was a very hot weekend so we spent a lot of time in the water relaxing. Our 18 month granddaughter especially enjoyed all the toys in the lower level and playing in the water at the lake shore. Great place and highly recommend!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay as always! The owners worked hard to get the beach completely clean and we had sandy bottom all the way to the end of the dock. Kiddos jumped off the dock and had a blast! House is clean and has everything you need. Perfect place for a family vacation!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Rented this cabin for a long weekend getaway. By far one of the most well stocked Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. This place was everything as advertised and we really enjoyed our stay.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"If you are lucky enough to stay at this property, you will not be disappointed. The Owners have thought of every detail to make your stay wonderful and in many ways feel more comfortable that your own home. Whether your stay a week or just a few days there is plenty to do in Wilmar and the lake. One of the best properties we stayed at offered through Airbnb."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place. Centrally located. Was perfect for our family!! Thank you
We rate this place a 10!!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,There was everything we needed and then some at the cabin on Eagle Lake! Very nice accommodations for our family to enjoy the lake life!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second year at Perry and Jeanien's lake cabin and it won't be the last! The cabin is clean, has everything you need, and is family friendly! The shoreline is sandy and the water is only waist deep even beyond the end of the dock. We used the pontoon for some cruising and jumping off into the water. The water is clean, with mild alge at the bottom. The lake is quiet even on weekends its not unusual to only see a couple boats on the water. We will be coming back at least once per year. Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great hosts. Clean accommodations. Everything you want is there. Beautiful lake!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"My family of 5 adults spent a long 4th of July weekend at Perry & Jeanien's place. The house was immaculately clean. The amenities were more than I've ever seen at an Airbnb. The kitchen was dated but everything worked perfectly. The kitchen was fully stocked with any pot/pan/utensil/storage item you could possibly need for your stay. The living room TV was already logged into Hulu and Netflix to use during your stay. The bedrooms were big with plenty of storage areas for anything you packed. The beds were comfy and there were extra pillows & blankets if needed. There were plenty of towels (both bathroom and beach!) to use and the bathrooms were stocked with all your essentials. We didn't use the washer and dryer but it's a nice option if needed.
When we rented the place it was to be near family for holiday get-togethers but due to Covid 19 our plans changed we never left the house. So I didn't experience any destinations around Willmar or any restaurants.
It was about 90 degrees every day of our stay. The A/C kept up and the house was cool. We spent our days in the water followed by sun-set boat cruises at night. I will say the only negative thing was the lake bottom around the dock was murky, clay like, and weedy. We had water shoes but they would get stuck in the muck when we tried to wear them which made walking very difficult. It did not detour us from being in the lake but it was unexpected as the listing said it was sandy.
If you're looking for a true ""Minnesota Cabin Experience"" you won't be disappointed by your stay here. Perry & Jeanien have made a very comfortable home for your stay and I highly recommend it."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful home! The place was very clean and had everything you would need and then some. Check in and check out was very easy and communication was quick and helpful. Thank you for an amazing weekend.
2019-08-01,4,Group trip,"Perry and Jeanien were great hosts! Check-in and out were clear and easy, the home was full of thoughtful touches, and the lakefront property made for a wonderful weekend getaway!"
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was awesome! The place was very nice and accommodated our family of six well. Clean, decorated nicely, good kitchen, and deck area. Had fun on the lake and fished from the dock. Ate at Grizzly’s as suggested by the hosts. Attended a Little Crow Ski Club performance and would highly recommend that."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,Great location
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderfully clean and well taken care of, it was exactly what our family needed for a little get away!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perry and Jeanine are great host. They respond in minutes. The house is very well thought out and very very clean. The amenities are over the top, if you needed it she had it, if you forgot it, it was there for you. The yard, swings, deck and lake were perfect for us and the grand kids, they had a ball swimming and fishing. We made alot of memories that are priceless. We will be back. Thank you again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for sharing your lake home with us! It was perfect for our two families to meet up and make great memories with our kiddos! Our 2 year olds had a great time playing in the shallow water off the swimming dock. We rented the pontoon and enjoyed some swimming in the middle of the lake as well. We also enjoyed everything Willmar has to offer including a sandy beach, amazing park (Robbins Island), indoor play place (for the rainy day), and a splash pad! Perry and Jeanien had everything we needed to have a great week!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic backyard space, great fishing right off the dock, and a very nice house. Perfect for the kids and adults. We had a great time and were so comfortable. Thank you!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,The place was amazing!! Jeanien was amazing with answering all our questions and was the perfect getaway in the perfect location!
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house right on the lake was a wonderful getaway for our family. The lovely home had everything we needed from the cozy areas to sit and relax, to some well thought out amenities by the host. We personally enjoyed being able to make our own breakfast and eat out on the deck that overlooks the water. It's a great location! Just outside of Willmar to make it feel ""away"", but close enough to get anything you need in town. We would highly recommend a stay here and hope to come back again in the future."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was easy to find and everything was clean and comfortable, everything we wished for and more. There were multiple good conversation areas both inside and out. The kitchen was very well organized and all of the basics to prepare meals was supplied. The fishing was good – fishing poles were in the porch – sunfish, perch and 4 large-mouth bass were caught and released from the dock. There's a bait shop next door. It was a perfect spot for our family to spend a long weekend leisurely catching up with each other. It was very obvious that much thought and careful planning went into making our experience enjoyable. Highly recommend and would return in an instant."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our technicians enjoyed their stay!
Cool place to stay"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked last minute to watch the Aurora Borealis. The kids got to play at the park near by in the morning. The space has a big back yard and a lovely view from the deck. The space was clean and bright. We would stay again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wendell was an excellent host. He responded within minutes of our question. The beds were very comfortable. The outside space is not very attractive but the sunset on the lake is beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the stay on this home, beautiful view to the lake, the sunsets were just amazing, the home just felt like a real home cozy. I highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for the great response and assistance when needed! We'll look for you next time we're in the area!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I only needed a place to sleep and shower. I was there 6hours a day, and I booked it with about the same amount of notice. I arrived within a few hours of booking, and extremely late at night, yet Keri still met me at the door with a smile and covered everything I'd ever need to know. She was very pleasant. it was 1/2 the cost of a hotel suite, 3 times as big. I wanted to be warm and comfortable and it exceeded that requirement. I was there because my Aunt was extremely ill, and all I kept thinking is what a great place, my whole family would fit here comfortably, I wish I could sit and actually enjoy it. the livingroom was so home-y and comfortable with the warm gas fireplace. Huge number of extra blankets everywhere. I have absolutely nothing negative to say, which is rare because i am generally super picky, but I would love love staying here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very easy to stay and cozy place!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying, and it won't be the last. I'm so happy I found this place. It is a great home away from home, especially when on business trips. It is clean, peaceful, and private and has a great homey feel. Pete and Kari are great hosts. They're friendly, responsive, and run a great place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet, comfortable. good stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Pete and Kari were great hosts. Pete met us at the door and gave us a tour. The apartment was just as they described. The said it was in a basement so would be chilly. But there was a gas fireplace and temperature controls in the bedrooms and lots of blankets. We were very comfortable.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely friendly. Nice quiet neighborhood. The place is a hidden gem. I was in town for a business trip. It was great to go to a place that felt like home versus going back to a hotel everynight. Look forward to using their place next time I'm in town. I will be sharing this place with my coworkers as we travel to Willmar.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Honestly, everything was great. They did a super job with communicating and responded quickly to any question we had. The place was cozy and clean.
We were very happy with everything. Thanks so much."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here ! It was nice and peaceful and we felt right at home !
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host was very nice and accommodating we were able to check in early and it worked great for both of us. Very homey loved the amount of space and laundry area! Only complaint it noise upstairs which is to be expected in a basement. Nothing that bad a few times there was quite a bit of noise but they had company so no big deal. Pretty bumpy road but I’m used to gravel so it wasn’t too bad just take it slow.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Pete and Kari were fantastic hosts - great representatives of American friendliness and kindness. Their apartment was spacious and comfortable and they were happy for us to have our grandchildren to visit us.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a pretty good space!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was a good stay and very walkable for our needs. It was also very clean. We appreciated the fully stocked kitchen and the movie selection. The only thing that could be improved for the price was the really uncomfortable beds/pillows. We had three people staying in the place that all woke up with back/neck pain. The beds were also very loud in addition to being hard. Good stay for our needs, but we probably would have booked elsewhere if we knew how uncomfortable the beds would be."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious , clean and comfortable ."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The space was larger than I expected. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kari met us at the door and unhurriedly showed us around the accommodations despite the fact she had a full house celebrating Mother’s Day and a grandchild’s birthday. She was available to answer questions and recalled our initial conversations about our coming to see our Great Granddaughter perform in a school concert. Later we received a note asking if we had any questions or concerns. We felt comfortable at her home and in her neighborhood.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and hygienic
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had a great stay for three weeks while doing a nursing travel assignment in Willmar. Pete and Kari were kind and welcoming and accommodated my dog. Felt at home!!

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Charming little apartment. Entry from the garage into the basement is a bit steep, but it’s worth it once you get settled. Very clean, cozy setting with a fireplace we very much enjoyed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great stay — 5 Stars! The separate basement was clean, warm, spacious, solid wifi, and a very reasonable price.
Pete & Kari were extremely communicative and accommodating of my fluctuating arrival time due to delayed flights. They made it easy to check in and out and make use of the apartment during my stay.
Only note is that there is some moderate floorboard creaking (at least above one of the bedrooms... I didn't test the other one); so guests who are light sleepers and don't like to get up early could find that to be a potential issue. Other than that, nothing else to report. Very satisfied with my stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Pete & Kari were wonderful! Super friendly and helpful times with check in & check out. Very responsive & amazing people!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love the view of the lake and at the same time right in Willmar. Also available to rent Kayak, multiple sizes of life vest(include small toddler) is available. Most of the amenities was provided too. Will love to come back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer was always responsive and really really kind. We spent Christmas holidays at her place and we had decorations and even a Christmas Tree set up.
Her place it’s really cosy, beautiful and charming. The lake it’s right outside the house and there’s a big garden and the possibility to sit outside to relax and even light a fire pit.
Heating, TV, WiFi and a well equipped kitchen were all provided. We spent 10 days extremely comfortable. The house was really clean, organized and the access to it and everything around it was really easy.
We are very thankful to Jennifer because we spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve feeling like we were at home."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place. We enjoyed our stay. I loved everything about this house. Felt right at home. I hope we can stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jennifer and her husband were great hosts. They answered any questions we had very timely. Their place was wonderful. We enjoyed our week on the lake in Willmar.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Jennifer was great to deal with before and during our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the second that we walked in the door, we all felt right at home! This house is a home! Our family, including 2 small kiddos, really enjoyed staying here. The backyard is breathtaking! We went kayaking right from the dock, and our kiddos learned to fish here. We lounged out back under the big oak trees while listening to the waves, and we all agreed that in and of itself was worth every penny!
The water pressure was great, and the huge tub was perfect for unwinding after a busy day and giving our kiddos a fun bathtime experience!
This will be our go-to place any time that we are up in this area! The host was super kind and easy to reach! Check in and out was a breeze!
110% would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"You get what you pay for in terms of the house but the yard is amazing! It’s a clean and nice house but don’t expect luxury. They have bedroom ac units which is very nice and the entire house stayed cool. The real showstopper is the yard!! The yard has nice patio couches, a fireplace with chairs, outdoor patio table, huge oak trees and an exceptional view of the lake. We spent the majority of our time outside during our stay and loved this Airbnb."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a fantastic host! She answered all my questions very quickly and made things easy for me. She was flexible about arrival and departure times and making last-minute adjustments. The house is quite large and will accommodate a lot of people, and has a lot of outdoor space. And the house was a great value compared to others I was seeing in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Dana's place is a beautifully maintained house. There are so many pluses about this rental. The Master bedroom is very nice and the mattress is so comfortable. The master bath is unbelievable. Everything in the bathroom has been not only updated but upgraded. It has a beautiful roomy shower with quality shower head and body sprayer, it also has an awesome jetted two person tub and a camode with a great bidet add on. And the light fixtures are really neat. The washer and dryer are convenient to the master and are modern and get the cloths really clean. The office is definitely ready for someone who works from home and with great internet. I like to cook so I have made some good meals in the kitchen and it is simply a chefs dream with the upgrades and storage and ease of cooking. Dana is a really nice person and a busy lady, that will go out of the way to help you with whatever needs you have. And the neighborhood is so safe and the neighbors are very nice. I have to give it a 10+++."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay!!! Dana was an excellent host. The house was very clean, had a luxurious bathroom, super comfortable bed, and all at a great price. Will definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful Oasis!!! Dana is a super host! Can not wait to stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I will stay there again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dana's place was a hidden gem. Located in a quiet residential area, it was easy to find and close to shopping and restaurants. The master en-suite is luxurious with a cozy king bed. The third room can be set up as a nursery (which is how we used it) or office/reading room. There is a huge walk-in closet which was great to iron and hang clothes, as well as store bulky luggage.
Dana is immediately available and lives on site in the lower level. We never heard them and wouldn't have even known they were there!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for hosting me Dana
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! The pics that Andrew has up are exactly what you get. Fun place to be and pretty much close to everything.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at The Loft. It's a super cozy yet very spacious space.

Hosts make this space feel very welcoming, and we prefer it our go-to when we come back to Willmar to see family."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place to stay! Perfect for our group of 4 for a little weekend get away but could of fit up to 8!

The location fit our needs great while in town for a class reunion."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew and Maria are wonderful hosts! Quick, clear communication with easy check-in. We loved staying at this unique and beautiful home. It was a perfect place for college friends of 53 years to have a reunion weekend in Willmar. We were all so impressed with the architecture, craftsmanship, decor, cleanliness and the lovely outdoor space. So much attention to detail. As elders, we felt safe in this quiet neighborhood which was walkable to the Barn Theater and restaurants. The Loft is a special gem!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,We have stayed here multiple times and enjoy it every time. Thanks.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Came in town for a wedding and had a great stay at Andrew’s bnb! The other guests and I were impressed with the cleanliness and the vibe of the bnb.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second time staying at this location. The hosts are wonderful and the space is perfect for our family. Plenty of sleeping space and the outdoor patio is great! They have thought of anything you might need when traveling with children.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew has a wonderful Airbnb. The pics do not do this place justice. Thanks Andrew.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The AirBnB and Andrew were great, the place is spacious and Andrew was always responsive. Tehe surrounding area was beautiful and for any disc golfers, I'd recommend the course nearby."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Layout is perfect for a group. All 3 levels plus the huge deck provides ample space to spread out. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This house was exactly what we needed. It was located close to our destination, adorable and most importantly, clean!

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is the nicest air bnb we’ve ever rented. The 3 stories, each with en-suite bathrooms was perfect for us for our daughters wedding weekend. We will stay again. Hosts were accessible and attentive, and extremely cordial."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Air BnB in the area. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do it. The place was clean, well set up and very unique. Pictures don't do justice to the loft."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful clean and peaceful . Would definitely come back.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Had an issue with temperature late evening and Andrew addressed it quickly and completely
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The Loft was amazing! The pictures actually don't do it justice. There are several sitting rooms, spread over three levels, so it was more space than we needed. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen fully stocked. I was a little worried about the proximity to the railroad, but it wasn't an issue at all. The patio was incredible. We were in town for a funeral which always turns into a family reunion. We were able to have all of our family back to our place after the funeral for a nice evening. As the sun set, we turned on the outdoor lights and started a fire. It was perfection. I just wish we traveled to Minnesota more often so we could stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very last-minute booking, and we're so thankful that Andrew was able to accept our stay! While I unfortunately wasn't able to stay, my husband and his co-workers said this place was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and they were happy to have a home like environment. They enjoyed having a fire in the fire pit and cooking on the grill after a long day at work. We appreciate the stay, and thank you again."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for people who don’t have issues with stairs and railroad noise. It’s an older house/building that has been renovated into a loft over a business in a neighborhood near the railroad. Absolutely lovely patio deck with outside shaded eating area. Nicely appointed kitchen (although bring your own paper towels/napkins) and nice living areas with extra things like games and a piano. Lots of neat little nooks and crannies throughout for people to spread out as needed. Our family enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay, I really appreciate all friendly, the host was. Anytime I have a question can you answer me very quickly, and the place is quiet, and a very peaceful. I really appreciate my stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Wonderful place for a girlfriends getaway!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Andrew's place is creatively designed, spacious and very comfortable. The exposed brick and wood throughout the home were very beautiful and inviting. We made all of our meals for a special gals weekend and the kitchen was very well stocked and fun to cook in. The table space and living area were set up well for meals, game playing and visiting in a relaxing space. Beds were comfy too. We will recommend Andrew's place to others."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay! It worked great for our group of 5. Clean and spacious and very functional.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,This home was very charming and had so much character. 5 adults stayed comfortably in this Airbnb. Andrew was very responsive and friendly. We hope to come back during the summer months to enjoy the large deck!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home with an abundance of character. Lots of love was put into the remodel. The entrance was connected to a commercial office, which created a little confusion upon entry. Once we were in the home, it was absolutely wonderful. Be prepared for the trains if that is not something you are used to.
I would recommend the home to others, and we were very happy to have a central location for our trip."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The LOFT in Willmar is an amazing space! Very creative use of building materials! The spacious outdoor deck area is beautiful & private even in the heart of the city! Plenty of interior space, especially for our group of 3 families gathering for a weekend - including 6 adults, 3 teenagers, and two small children. Everyone agreed the beds (& even the multiple sofas) were comfortable for sleeping. The upper & lower levels tend to be a bit cozy/toasty, the middle level stays at a comfortable temperature. The kids had a lot of space to play and all of us enjoyed exploring where all the stairs led to. We all appreciated the baby gates available to block off the stairs for the little ones! The kitchen is great, we made a couple of meals during our stay. Andrew & Maria Cecilia are very clear & super friendly communicators! We were curious about showers since the photos only showed tubs - turns out there are really cool spa-like showers! I can't say enough great things about our stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Andrew was a great host, he was extremely helpful and friendly
His place is immaculate, beautiful,well kept and well stocked with everything we needed for a pleasant and comfortable stay.
I would recommend his home to anyone"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place to host our family. We had 5 adults and 2 children under the age of 2. It was beautiful, plenty of sleeping options, and several bathrooms. We were very impressed with the fact that they thought of children. There were baby gates for the stairs, a high chair, safety locks on the kitchen cabinets and children's plates and cups. The beds were very comfortable. I hope to stay again sometime in the summer months when we can use the outdoor patio. It's a great place. I highly recommend it."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It felt weird renting such a large place for just two people over the holidays- but this space was well worth it. We moved out of MN earlier this year and this was our first visit back home... I think this Airbnb may be our go-to place whenever we come back. While you wouldn't know it from the outside, this is such a beautiful home and there are so many little details about this place that make it so unique (the bed with the massager was my personal favorite). I would spend a little more to stay here instead of a hotel in Willmar Every time. Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful huge spacious loft in Willmar. We were visiting family in Clara City, got stuck in a blizzard and unfortunately didn’t get to see most of the family or have our Christmas dinner. We are very thankful we didn’t stay in a hotel as if we were to be stranded we wouldn’t want to be stranded anywhere else! They even put up a Christmas tree. :)
The pictures doesn’t do the place justice as how big it really is! The interior wood feels like a cabin with modern accents. It is decorated so homey and has lots of natural light. The trains didn’t really bother us. There are a lot of steps so keep that mind for elderly staying there or visiting. We can’t wait to return sometime in the late spring, summer or early fall to enjoy the deck."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Not a ton of options in Willmar, we’ll definitely be back. The space was great, everything we needed. If you’re a light sleeper the train is loud but hard to avoid in willmar, kids didn’t even hear it. Maybe the cleanest place I’ve stayed in, they do a great job!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice spot! Roomy and great location. Was pretty cold so we didn’t get to enjoy the patio, but looks very nice! Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home!! Very well equipped kitchen! Lots of stairs, might be difficult for someone who has mobility issues or trouble with stairs. Beautiful deck, unfortunately it was too cold for us to use it. We have family in Willmar and would definitely stay her again if it’s available!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an excellent spot. We were in town for my father's funeral and needed a gathering space - it was perfect. The house was very clean. The kitchen is loaded with pots, pans and all things you would need for your stay. Andrew was really communicative and made us feel welcome. The house is only 2 blocks from downtown Willmar, super convenient for my walks to the church for the weekend. The home is even more beautiful the pictures suggest. I would come back here in a second. Thank you, Andrew, for such a nice stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,it was a great experience
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This space is beautiful and has so many smaller areas for privacy. The outdoor patio is fabulous.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is so unique and charming. 3 floors, full kitchen, plenty of amenities in the kitchen (excellent coffee!) and bathroom. It really was one of the coziest Airbnb's I've ever stayed in. Definitely will be going back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved every moment here at Andrew and Maria Cecilia's lovely, seriously spacious...space. Felt rather indulgent to be staying solo in a place large enough (per the guest book) to have accommodate bachelorette parties and three-couple stays. But I managed. The quick walk to town meant I could leave my vehicle parked almost the whole stay. And speaking of town, follow the hosts' recommendation to Azteca for terrific Mexican food. Tacos and tortillas that stand with any I've had anywhere."
2022-08-01,4,Group trip,A hidden gem in Willmar! Andrew was hospitable and the place was perfect for what we wanted.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, better than local hotels. Definitely recommend"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,We were group of friends and decided to hold our retreat at Loft. This was our first trip to Willmar and we absolutely fell in love with this beautiful place. Greatly sized for both small or big groups or family settings. Andrew was very accommodating with our Additional request and was so flexible. It had everything we needed. The area is great! Not far from the city park and Saulsbury Beach. This is definitely somewhere you want to stay. Thank you for hosting us.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Thank you!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,WOW! As soon as I walked in I thought “this is perfect!”. The Loft is soo beautiful and located in just the right area! The deck was everyone’s favorite part of the stay. I would definitely come back for another stay!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place! The decor is great and comfortable! The deck was a blast hang out on, a great way to end the day. we used the kitchen to cook quite a few meals, it has everything you need. we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place was incredible! So unique and comfortable. It was nice to be centrally located and for our whole party to be able to stay together.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a wonderful stay for two families. So beautiful, attentive owner, and easy access to restaurants."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful three story home with cozy wood, exposed brick, and lovely large deck. Private bedrooms on each floor made it even better. It's also child friendly, because of gates on the stairs, child latches, and that cool deck for playtime."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our group of 7 were in town for a wedding and loved our stay at the Loft!! It was a gorgeous, clean, well-organized space with so many little thoughtful details and the big open-concept kitchen/living/dining room were just wonderful for cooking, relaxing and catching up. We did have a couple of small issues with the house that we weren't able to figure out how to fix ourselves (ended up being just a circuit breaker having been tripped before our arrival) , but Andrew responded within just hours, came personally to the house and resolved them, and then without our even asking him gave us a very generous partial refund for our trouble that was far more than I expected! A++ for both hospitality and space. I would certainly stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique spot in the middle of Willmar. Great spot to hang out and relax
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home had so much character! We had a great time. It was clean. The communication and check in process was a breeze and the outdoor patio was AMAZING! The only thing we hoped for was better weather, but I guess Andrew can't do anything about that! We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house is conveniently located and absolutely an amazing Airbnb. Andrew the owner was easy to communicate and always replied back in a timely manner. This house is 3 floors, enough privacy for everyone and yet plenty of gathering space for large groups and families. We were in town for my nieces wedding and absolutely loved this place. If you have young kids this place was also kid proof!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our group of 6 adults and 2 kiddos had a wonderful stay here! it was perfectly clean and well decorated. There was plenty of space for us all to stretch out, and there were no issues with seating for eating or lounging. the beds were pretty comfortable. Make sure to take advantage of the amazing deck! If you are traveling with little ones, this is the place for you as there was a high chair available, and all the kitchen cabinets were child proofed. The location is a little ways from the main area of Willmar, but we could easily drive to restaurants/stores. Overall we had a very comfortable and relaxing weekend :)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew was a great host, and the loft was a huge space with lots of character. The place is well kept and has plenty of space for a big group. It was quite windy so we didn't get to utilize it much, but I bet the patio would be stellar in warmer/calmer weather. I could see this as being a great space for a family gathering. we enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to come back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful space...so much room! each floor had a massive bedroom/living space. such a beautifully built home with character and charm! Will definitely be back
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,If you all need a spot in Willmar to stay it’s here! I was super happy with this place and hopefully I can rent it again in the summer time to take advantage of the large patio! Thanks for making my pre wedding spot amazing
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Friendly approachable host, Andrew was eager to make our stay pleasant, including bringing over a crockpot for us to use. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils for cooking, and the home is exceptionally clean. The house has child proof locks and gates if you have a little one staying with you."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved it! We were in town for a hockey tournament and it worked great for two families. With a bedroom on each of the three levels, everyone had plenty of private space, and the kitchen/family room/dining room area was perfect for shared meals,
TV, games, etc. Andrew and Maria were very gracious hosts, too. Highly recommend!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The place was great, super clean and well stocked for the extended stay traveler. Andrew and his wife were super nice; so nice we actually ended up doing business in another capacity too. Definitely glad to have met them."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Unique Gem! Exposed brick, gorgeous layout. Privacy found on every floor! Great for our family gathering.
The kitchen with huge bay windows on one side and HUGE party deck! Like I have never seen. I was thinking it would be big but this was huge! Great especially during COVID nice to have such a fantastic outdoor space with a cozy fire pit!
And also outdoor gate for the stairs for those with little ones.
The master sweet had a fancy shower, massive walk in closet that went on and on and had the laundry right in the closet! convenient!
The upstairs bathroom with jacuzzi! All the built in drawers! So unique and full of character. Loved it and our kids like the upstairs as their domain.
Especially for those wanting to host a family gathering or just want a spacious space to kick back with a group of friends this is your place! It is so clean and fancy!
Unique. Full of character. Clean. And charming host. 5 out of 5 from us!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family stayed at the loft for an extended period of time and fell in love with it. The character and charm of the space is unmatched with its brick and woodwork throughout. The lit balcony/deck provides a romantic and social atmosphere where we grilled and enjoyed a small fire. We enjoyed the view from the large bay windows and the proximity to downtown shops, restaurants, and the public library.
The loft is equipped with essentials including bed linens, fuzzy blankets, bathroom items, kitchen tools, games, and more. It was nice to be able to do laundry here as well.
Andrew maintains the loft in pristine condition and we were so pleased with how clean and welcoming the space was.
We would love to return again and make more memories in this now nostalgia-filled loft!"

He was very flexible when I asked if we could check out an hour later than the posted check-out time. The apartment was spotless and was fully stocked in the way of amenities. The three air conditioners in the condo really helped the days we were staying there when it was in the upper 80’s. We had a great view of Green Lake and the building was quiet and within walking distance of several restaurants. The building itself is a little older, but once you were inside the condo you didn’t even notice because the condo was remodeled and everything is new. We were there for two nights while we were in town for my nephew’s wedding. Jason was a great host and I would definitely stay there again!"

The place was clean and had plenty of extra sheets and towels. Kitchen had everything we needed! Clear view of sunrise over the lake every morning and even though it was in the center of town, just off HWY 23, it was quiet...no street noise heard when inside the unit. I would definatley stay here again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great, pictures exactly matched the interior of the place and it’s walkable to all the downtown areas with the lake right outside. Jason responded very quickly to any and all inquires, would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The building is older and doesn’t look great from the exterior but the condo was very nice and looked just like the photos. It worked well for our short stay. Jason was great to deal with and was nice enough to accommodate our later check out due to a later sporting event start. Very responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Was an absolute beautiful area and home. Great price for a place right on the lake. Stayed here for a week for work, and was a great to get back and go jump in the lake. Jason will help with any issues you have. The microwave went out upon the 3rd day, contacted Jason, and he immediately sent in a new microwave."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, nicely remodeled, good air conditioning and sweet mirror in bathroom."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall had a great time and enjoyed our stay. One thing we noticed that would have been nice is a washer/dryer, and the unit should have an iron and ironing board available. The unit was nice but the building is looking a bit rough. This was low income housing when I lived in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location - walkable to all the main things in Spicer and directly across the street from the public beach. Very clean, newly remodeled, plenty of space for a family, and they provided all the basic necessities!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for my brother's wedding. Very comfortable and felt like home. The location is great and quiet. Waterfront views are nice and walking distance to close restaurants and parks.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place and super host. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay and the host was exceptional. Everything needed was available and more.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space! Clean and easy to find. Responsive hosts.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay for a girls weekend! We picked the location as it was a “middle” meeting spot for us. The host was kind and gracious. He even left a large bowl full of fresh fruit for us! It was a spacious location for 5 people. It was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with anything you could need. I would definitely recommend this location if you are in the Willmar area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, flexible host, exactly what we needed!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing host! Very responsive, understanding, accommodating and quick to fix any problem we had! Would stay there again for sure!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place! They were super responsive and flexible as we needed a late check out and also added time to our stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an absolutely beautiful location. It was very close to downtown Willmar with incredible walkability. The hosts could not have been more welcoming. Hope to stay again next time we're in town!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great hosts and wonderful place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was clean and very spacious. The hosts were very attentive, regularly checking in, leaving notes and occasional small gifts for our children. It initially didn't seem stocked for a large family such as ours, but they were quick to remedy that with extra dishes, etc. We'd love to stay here again!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Very clean and surprisingly excellent hosts. We really enjoyed our stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great hosts! Better people! I have stayed at many airbnb's all have been good experiences but these have been the kindest and most attentive hosts I have ever had. I cannot thank them enough for their kindness from start to finish.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lisa's home was perfect for what we needed. Lots of space for our large group. She was very helpful and easy to communicate with about our check in/check out. Great experience all the way around.
2023-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Worked for us, but would have appreciated the floors and windows being clean and having extra blankets available, as all the bed covers were quite thin/not heavy enough for us.
We were really shocked and disgusted at the large amounts of alcohol sitting out all over the living room within reach of small children. Our four year old could reach all of it which is as dangerous as leaving drugs in a child's reach.
You'll want to bring in your own water as the water is very hard and not drinkable.
The kitchen was well stocked and there were lots of bath towels and wash cloths.
Our maps took us into the neighbors driveway so pay attention to the house number at the end of the driveway to avoid our mistake."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice stay, rustic: sort of like a vintage farm house with modern bathroom and kitchen teleported inside. Thanks for your hospitality Lisa."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is amazing and so is the communication provided by the host it was a great stay with beautiful scenery
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time amidst the soybean fields.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyable stay for family gathering on a secluded farm. Just what I was looking for.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay at Lisa’s place. A nice retreat outside of town with a beautiful property.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lisa has a great place. It worked perfect for our family. We had 6 adults and 2 babies. We had plenty of room for all of us. It is in a great location. Quiet and felt like home. Lisa was great to work with. She was very responsive and very welcoming. Highly recommend staying here!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time staying at this farmstead. Lisa was phenomenal, kept in touch and was very welcoming. The house was secluded, with a country feel, but minutes from town."
2022-08-01,4,Group trip,Lisa was wonderful at communication. The place was as described. The outdoor space was perfect for practicing disc golf (we brought our own baskets).
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Lisa's farmstead was exactly what we were looking for when we planned our event, and it did not disappoint. Lisa was extremely responsive and accommodating throughout. We had planned this event for months and truly this location was a huge part in its success. The grounds, farmhouse and bunkhouse were exactly as described and terrific. 100% recommend. A+ host!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This farm house was truly a quaint, rustic and secluded getaway out in the country on a beautiful piece of property. The location was convenient - close enough to swing by the grocery store but isolated enough to not see a neighbor or even another vehicle. We were able to have family visit and we enjoyed the fire pit very much! The charcoal grill was a nice change from our gas grill at home and everything we cooked on it turned out absolutely delicious. The house was well stocked and we found everything we needed. We felt the house was lived in and comfortable - and pet friendly, which made all the difference to us! We got to experience a weekend in the country that gave us all some solitude, relaxation and fun! We played the bean bag toss game outside, sat around the fire a lot and talked, had a card night inside the house one night and we all had our own space for when we needed a power nap or just a moment to ourselves. Our host, Lisa, was very helpful from the first time I messaged her and she responded quickly to all my questions (and I feel like I had a lot). I haven't rented an airbnb before now, but Lisa set the bar high for any other hosts. She was friendly, accommodating, considerate and accessible. This place was quiet (very peaceful at night), had super comfy beds, and had a great set up for having company or just hanging out. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and would recommend this place to anyone!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful peaceful place to relax.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Lovely cozy farm house. My family enjoyed it!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely space in the middle of no where(ish), but only 5 miles from town! Lots of space, bugs, crickets chirping thru the night, and nature all around. The home is equipped for most all cooking types, just no microwave. Lisa was very open about her home and what we could do there and even what was in town for our family to do!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,This was a great place to stay. We all unplugged and spent a lot of time enjoying the fire pit. It was a perfect getaway for the 5 of us staying.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa’s farm house was perfect for our family vacation of 6. We read the other reviews and knew to expect no microwave, tv or WiFi. It’s a country experience and that is what we wanted.
Being in the country we expected there to be bugs, but the house was clear if bugs on our arrival. In fact, the whole house felt clean. We had all the kitchen items we needed to make our dinners plus dessert. I don’t think we ever thought, “Man, I wish we had….”
Our older boys used the cabin and they liked their bit of privacy. They saw a few spiders, but that’s expected with farm land all around.
We sat outside much of the time. There were plenty of chairs and a table outside. We saw deer, herons, pheasants, and even bats. The star view was absolutely amazing.
Lisa was great at communicating and even took us on a tour when we arrived. It seems there was nothing off limits on the property for exploring. Her home is very comfortable and inviting.
Our only disappointment was the lake. Minnesota was in a drought and we weren’t able to swim or fish in it. The path was well mowed and easy to walk, but it was too far to walk for my elderly father in law. We did find some nice places to fish and swim in different lakes nearby.
I would recommend her home for anyone wanting some peace and quiet, and to unwind."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,very private / secluded / wonderful spot for a group getaway or reunion. We will definitely be back!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful piece of history. Please keep in mind this is an OLD farm house. To it creeks and sweaks and smells old. But that is what makes this such an experience. No TV, cell phone service was touchy. We didn't mind one bit. Sat around a table playing card games, laughing and enjoying the company of each other."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I had a great stay at the farmhouse with my family! What a beautiful quiet acreage. The oaks and light are just great. Kitchen had everything we needed and close to good breweries/restaurants. Highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place is a hidden country house gem. So quiet and beautiful area, we enjoyed just relaxing in the yard watching the wildlife. The canoe and lake is an added bonus! The kitchen is so well-equipped to cook, we ate in every night! Lisa responded quickly to all questions before arrival and checked in to make sure we arrived and everything was ok. Highly recommend this stay!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Quiet, peaceful location, ideal for family getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. Not suitable for business travel. Location hard to find from road side address mailbox. Special map of long driveway to front door would help. GPS drops beyond 300 feet from roadside."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,It was a great space and very quiet and wanted to stay even longer great place to get away from the city will definitely visit again
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Oakwind farm is a gem, with beautiful acreage, a lovely ramble through the woods to pristine Lake Wakanda and thriving wildlife, including pelicans! The old 1940's farmhouse is wonderfully quirky and charming, with a remodeled kitchen and bath. It is a peaceful home with a most friendly and gracious host, Lisa. We look forward to returning to Oakwind farm in the future."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,The farmhouse was so much fun! We are from Texas and had never been to Minnesota before. Lisa was very helpful with questions I had and responded very quickly. We loved every second of it and felt like we where at home.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leave your troubles behind in this quaint and remote home. There is plenty of opportunity to just enjoy silence. You can take the canoes for a simple jaunt on Lake Wakanda, have meals inside or outside, whatever floats your boat.
The owner is very open, friendly and very helpful in welcoming you to her place. The home is so comfortable and peaceful and we are already looking at dates to come back next year.
Just because it feels remote doesn’t mean you won’t have access to everyday amenities, with Willmar being a short drive away you can still get all of the things you need for a fantastic get away.
There is a grill, but I recommend cooking in the open flame in the fire pit, along with roasting marshmallows under the stars."
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great very secluded yet still so close to town only an 8 minute drive into willmar but you feel like there is nothing around you when you are at the house I’d love to stay there again!.
2020-07-01,3,Group trip,"This is a really difficult evaluation to write. Lisa was awesome. She was easy to talk to, cordial, polite, uplifting, quick to respond, and more than accommodating of our family needs. Her place is a quaint old homestead, well off the beaten path, that has had several updates to make it useable space for herself, and now to others that would choose to stay there. It is a quiet little hideaway that is still in need of some TLC. There are lots of dishes, pots and pans, and adequate space to house 6 people comfortably. It would be great to think that with a bit of extra income, some desperately needed time and resources, this would be an extraordinary place to stay. However, there are some issues that I wish someone else would have addressed in their evaluations.
It was great that Lisa was willing to accommodate our family pet, as she has one of her own. However, there are difficulties with having pets and still ensuring that the space is adequately cleaned. We made some suggestions that should, hopefully, make it a little less obvious that an animal lives there. Dog hair can be an issue as it tends to blow around where it ends up under furniture, beds, tables, and just embedded in the carpeting. We expected some of this, but if the cleaning staff was there before we arrived, I would be looking for a new cleaning staff. The first thing we did when we arrived was to locate the broom, vacuum cleaner, and garbage can. We're not clean freaks, but we spent about an hour cleaning up after the people that were there before us.
We suggested that Lisa add more pictures and information to her website as there were some things that we just weren't expecting. The ad says that the house sleeps 6 comfortably. This is accurate. It also states that there are 5 beds. This is also accurate. However, the two extra beds are located in an old cabin that was moved onto the farmstead about 20 years ago. This is a cute little place, but it is in dire need of pest control, updates, and new carpeting. This building is typically closed and seldom gets used. Because of that, it is difficult to keep out unwanted pests and mildew. Although I wouldn't mind sleeping in this space again, it is important to know that anyone with mildew or environmental allergies really shouldn't stay in the cabin.
Lisa was so wonderful. Her space says that it can accommodate up to 10 people, but our group was 14. We added extra space by bringing a pop-up trailer where 4 of us slept. She also would have been okay if we had brought a tent and set it up in the yard. We also brought along a portable shower as we didn't expect that a single shower, located in the upstairs of the house, would fit the needs of our group. And we are so glad that we did.
Overall, we were happy to have a place to stay with our family as Covid-19 difficulties destroyed our initial family plans. I was really hoping that this would be a place that we would end up preferring to one of the state park camper cabins. I'm really sorry to say that it wasn't."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent hostess, incredibly attentive. Magical spot to relax! I can't wait to go back."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family, ranging in age from 8yrs-60yrs, enjoyed our stay."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"I stayed at the farm with a group of 8 recent high school grads. I was a little nervous about the host being cautious of our age, but Lisa was quite the opposite. She was very communicative and made sure that we felt at home and had a great time. The farm was awesome. Great landscape views of the neighboring farm and plenty of lawn space for games, throwing a frisbee, having a campfire, or anything else. The kitchen was great with everything you need to cook your meal and although there was a great updated oven and stovetop, cooking fajitas and burgers in cast iron over the fire was a lot of fun!! I would highly recommend the farm if you want a completely private and secluded getaway."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely farmhouse! The mornings were especially peaceful. The farmhouse is old so expect creaky floors and sticky doors :) Because we had a one-year-old, we had to be extra quiet while she slept since there's not much noise barriers in the house. So keep in mind if staying with kids!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the most wonderful stay. Lisa was quick to respond to any questions we had. The property offers total privacy. The house was clean and ready for us to make ourselves at home. Coffee overlooking the countryside in the morning and a fully stocked kitchen to make all our meals. We will definitely be back!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What you can expect- peace, privacy, a welcoming and helpful host, and an absolutely beautiful setting. The farmhouse is homey and familiar- you’ll feel like you’re at your grandparents’ place with simple, comfy furnishings and a retro kitchen. The house is clean and Lisa has provided everything you’ll need to settle in- including a sweet note and a cold drink in the fridge. This is where you go when you want to unplug and reconnect with your family. No WiFi and no TV- but even our teenagers loved their time at Oakwind. We enjoyed walks through the woods, canoeing and fishing in the lake, and s’mores by the campfire in the evenings. Grill and utensils, firewood, canoe and paddles, outdoor chairs were provided. You’ll need muscles to get the canoes in and out of the water but it’s worth the effort. We had the lake to ourselves and saw huge (8-10 ft wingspan!) American white pelicans and other water birds. We also played cards, sat in the sun and listened to the birds, read books, and listened to music while we cooked in the kitchen. It was peaceful and relaxing. If you need groceries, Willmar is just 10 minutes away."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lisa was great and we had a lovely stay here for our Thanksgiving holiday. The kitchen had everything we needed! The house was an authentic farm house in a beautiful setting! We would highly recommend this warm and comforting home for a holiday getaway!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the farmhouse! Cozy, peaceful, amazing experience. We saw a baby deer!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the farm. Lisa made us feel at home and is very nice. Loved the private location and the wildlife. My dog enjoyed chasing chipmunks all day!
Her flowers were blooming and beautiful. Thanks for the hospitality Lisa."
2019-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Lisa was an excellent hostess. Communication prior to arrival was great, and she was there to meet me and walk me through the house and yard when I arrived. The area is VERY private and quiet, and we enjoyed the large yard to play lots of yard games, and have a picnic. The house is a farm house, so if you are expecting modern conveniences (WiFi, TV, dishwasher and microwave) you will not find them. However, the atmosphere of times past is great. The bathrooms have been updated and worked well for our group of 7, and additional daytime guests. There are 5 bedrooms available - however 3 are in the house and 2 are in the cabin."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super set up for our extended family. Equipped with everything we needed. Convenient to Willmar. Very attractive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, exactly what we needed! Loved all the space for my family to run."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great time staying at this Airbnb! Clean, quiet, & spacious! Would recommend to anyone coming to the Willmar/Spicer area!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan and Jenny are both responsive, helpful and friendly. The location of their Air BnB house is peaceful and quiet, good for relaxing, reuniting with family and friends. The house is beautiful and clean and instructions are clearly written.
Thank you, Jonathan and Jenny for the great stay. Such a lovely home and environment. Will surely come back again in the future☺️😇"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great get together with friends in this wonderful environment.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spend a long weekend with family here. Beautiful home, beautiful location!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jonathan and Jennifer were great hosts and very responsive. The place was spacious enough to host my family of 9 adults and 4 toddlers that we never felt too crowded or in each others spaces. The neighborhood was very beautiful and peaceful. The backyard was a great space for the kids to roam around and play and they loved walking up and down the dock. We loved the kitchen space and downstairs area.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The house is very nice! We booked it to stay in for our daughter’s wedding. Lots of room for my family to relax and hang out. It was very close to our venue, perfect location. We didn’t get to enjoy all of the amenities because of the full wedding schedule but all agreed we would like to rent the house again so we can fully enjoy all it has to offer."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Highly recommend staying there. We had 6 adult couples, 60 years old. The lawn was large enough to play games, golf courses were fairly close and very nice(Little Crow Country Club)"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were thrilled with our stay!!! Very enjoyable yard, fire pit and lake views! Hosts responds quickly and only wanted us to have a good time!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice home for our family all to stay under one roof. Plenty of bedrooms and living space. Tree swing was a hit with our granddaughters. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy this home.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Jonathan’s and Jenny’s house was beautiful and spacious enough for 6 adults and 6 kids. Even the kids walked into the house and immediately said “wow”. The grandparents were happily enjoying the gorgeous view of lake from the comfort of the livingroom each day. Everyone took their turn on the tree swing! Though the lake was too muddy at bottom to swim in, the kids were in the paddle boards and canoe every day; my sister in law said it’s the most time the kids have used them this summer.
Every night was movie night in the basement entertainment room.
All in all, we had such a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The hosts were very helpful and the house was as advertised!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Jonathan, Jennifer, and Ricki were very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. They did their best to make us feel welcome and at home during our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home! Quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Could have used more bath towels and kitchen towels and cloths. The propane tank was empty for the grill. Also had to go out and buy Kleenex and batteries for the remotes. These were minor inconveniences. The air conditioner was not working when we arrived. Jonathan responded immediately and had someone out the same evening we arrived and the hvac service came the next morning and got it running perfectly. We asked about things to do in the area and we’re given a list activities. We enjoyed our weekend at your place and would love to return again someday! Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space in a beautiful location. The outdoor area was spacious and provided a lovely private place to play games and enjoy the beautiful weather. The house was the perfect size for our families (6 adults and 4 kids). Clean and comfortable. The hosts responded quickly to inquires. We had a wonderful stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the best weekend get away! We had a large family group stay with young children and we all had plenty of space to spread out. Beautiful home and amazing backyard! The tree swing in the back yard was a hit for all ages! Would absolutely recommend this home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, in a beautiful location.
We enjoyed our stay as a family.
We are considering coming back next summer because it fit our family so perfectly! Thank you for sharing your home for us to make memories in!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The home was very well appointed, nice and spacious for 7 people, very clean we had an awesome weekend visiting with family fishing off the dock to bon fires in the evening thanks Jonathan, Bob and family"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, safe, and relaxing. There’s lots of space for guests to sleep comfortably in multiple beds. Check in was easy. Our group had a wonderful time."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place on a beautiful lake. Great outdoor space to hang out in, and awesome fishing off the dock! Owners were extremely responsive and easy to work with. Would highly recommend staying here, and we would definitely book again in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent the weekend celebrating New Years with friends. Three families and plenty of space for the adults and kids. We had fun outside snowmobiling around the lake and playing games indoors. The house was lovely and a great location. Very clean, organized with everything we needed. We hope to come back one day."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great view and great hosts!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family absolutely loved Jonathan’s place, it was more than enough room for our large family, it was clean, bright & open! We were there for Thanksgiving & Jonathan’s place did not disappoint, we had everything we needed for a fun holiday family vacation!
Jonathan was responsive & accommodating, it was a great experience, the house has everything you need or could think of, all you really need to do is show up with your clothes & toiletries!
Our oldest grandson said “This was his best Airbnb family vacation”!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place. Extremely clean on arrival and comfortable beds. The place was perfect for kids as well. There were enough toys that we shouldn’t have even brought our own! Would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautiful. The layout was perfect for our kids and grandkids over MEA. The sinks that are in a few of the bedrooms were amazing. The house is very bright with a view of the lake from both sides of the house. Jonathan was very responsive with the few questions we had. The tree swing was a huge hit with the kids as was the extra ""craft"" table and game area on the main floor. We all loved the huge sectional downstairs.
The kitchen and pantry was the perfect set up for all families to have a shelf for snacks and supplies.
The park in Wilmar was so nice with several things for the kids to do that were age appropriate. Check it out if you are in the area. We will be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jonathan's house is totally awesome big, Lots of room, clean, comfy, Lakeview, fire pit, Patio with a big grill, Downstairs entertainment theater, Fireplace, big Tv's Jonathan's house has everything you need Had a great time"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was good. Met our purpose for a gathering place for family coming from different locations.
Had an issue with the listing saying- under the beds section -that the living room had 1 queen and 2 single beds causing me to assign the living room to my brother. He's not a real couch size person.
I assigned the bedrooms to the 3 ladies. At that point we made the best of it and got along fine.
Kitchen was great with lots of extras and the Kurig was appreciated by coffee drinkers. Nice bathroom. Will definitely look for this listing if we go to Spicer again next year."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Very clean, very homey, and very family friendly. Our family loved the games and toys. The grocery store, coffee shop, and Dairy Queen are all a short walk away. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying the Willmar Spicer area! Thank you Margaret!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very good experience. Margaret was quick to respond and was very helpful. Super friendly and felt like I was at home!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was 5 star! The hosts are super, the place was really clean and in a great location. Everything you could need was provided. Walkable to the lake and restaurants etc. We would definitely stay here again. Feels like a home away from home"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice place to stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for what we needed. It was very clean & comfortable. Marti was very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Best place to stay in Spicer!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Margaret and Eric were very friendly hosts!
The unit is bright with its many windows vaulted celings,and skylight.
She has thought of absolutely everything you may want or need during your stay!
Green lake is visible from many rooms and the deck.
The home is adorned with her beautiful photographic works from all over the world.
The owners do reside in the lower level,but you will have complete privacy during g your stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have been to many Airbnbs. This one was wonderful. The host was very flexible, responsible, and helpful. It was a great location within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and the beautiful lake. The beds were very comfortable. The entry into the house was cool as the passcord was something you not forget, so you didn't have to try to memorize or keep looking it up. I liked that touch as well."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for making us feel like family. This truly was a home away from home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Marti was very communicative and her home is so clean and cozy. Great proximity to Spicer activities/restaurants. 5 stars :)

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went there for a girls weekend crafting. It was very clean and nice. Not that we would have been too crazy, but having quiet hours start at 10pm and the owners living in the basement, it was unexpected. We didn’t want to watch movies, play music, or laugh too loud. They were super nice but we wanted to be courteous."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Margaret’s place was so quiet and peaceful. We felt so homey and cozy! The location was great!! Would love to stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Have stayed here several times. Always a great stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love your stay at Marti's place. The house was immaculate, and check-in was a breaze. Marti was always quick to respond, and the house had everything we needed. If you are going to be in the Spicer area, STAY HERE! This was one of the best Airbnb's I've ever used!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home in Spicer! Will definitely will stay again in the future!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was happy to stay here as opposed to a hotel for a friend’s wedding. Only one night but had everything we needed and some extras - snack bars, plenty of coffee and tea options, soft towels, etc. Would recommend. Thanks for a nice and comfortable stay!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love to cook! The kitchen had stainless steel heavy gauge pots and pans; the cupboard contained just what I needed and I had forgotten. Bonus, the home is clean and comfortable and attractively decorated. Just 2 blocks from Green Lake - a short walk. If you're looking for a home away from home, this is it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have been an Air BnB Super Host and Air BnB user for ages, and this was the very best Air BnB stay I have ever had. It is a lovely location, and the space is immaculate with all the amenities you need to have a home away from home! Thank you, Margaret!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"4 H.S. girlfriends (gf) met for a get together to celebrate 2 b-days (our 60's). The home was spotless, and had all amenities that you'd ever need. The accommodations were very comfortable, and the host we met was so inviting and kind! One thing we need to relay, that concerned the group, was that the Hosts lived in the lower walkout portion of the house and we (guests) had the main floor. Though, not at the age of being loud/crazy, it seemed somewhat uncomfortable, trying to stay low-voiced, then burst out laughing over what we we're talking about, and ""they"" were downstairs. The door to the garage, from the entry, did not have a lock on it. We did not know/check, if the access door from downstairs to the LR above could be locked by the guests, and could ""they,"" at some point, come up the stairs to the rental space? We'd still give the Hosts a 4+ star rating."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Marti’s place was so clean and worked perfectly for us and our travels!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very peaceful and so well stocked, everything I needed for a wonderful stay. You can relax on the large

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Margaret is a super host and not by mistake. She's a great communicator and she has everything organized to make your stay easy. We received an email from Margaret the morning that we were going to check in, stating that the weather was beautiful and reminded us not to forget her swimsuits. Her house is beautiful and access is very easy. She has not missed any detail and she has everything that you need for a pleasant stay. The kitchen is very spacious, bedrooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The living room is very comfortable and spacious. Breakfasts were spent on the deck overlooking her beautiful backyard. We brought our granddaughter with us and as we were leaving she said, can we stay at this house again next year. Thank you Margaret."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hosts that go above and beyond! This place is so special because of them - they are the epitome of hospitable and are thinking of what you might need or want during your stay. The rental space had everything we required and more - including toys for our toddler that kept him very busy and happy during our time there. And many reviews mention the cleanliness, and so will I! Literally could not find an uncleaned spot in the house if I’d tried - pristine is the only word to describe it."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts of this airbnb are fantastic! They are so nice and very helpful. It was clean, spacious, and comfortable. I was confused in the listing as it says the entire place is to yourself and has no stairs-- however, this is more of a duplex. The hosts live downstairs. We were a little weary about this, but everything was so wonderful! Great location and well stocked. I highly recommend this airbnb!"

Loved that Margaret left information on local events for us. The only thing I might mention is that, on the website, it states there are 2 queen-size beds. The pictures show the actual beds which is one queen-size and two twins, which worked fine for our purposes."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Margaret's place. It was a very good value for the price. It is probably one of the best stocked Air BNB's we have stayed at.

Margaret was there to greet us, show us around the place and give us some suggestions for restaurants."

Not only is the location perfect for accessibility to everything in the area-especially for bikers, but the Airbnb was so intentionally thought out what travelers would need. Ziplock bags, bug spray, sunscreen, laundry detergent, make up remover pads, I could go on all day! Very peaceful and so much fun hanging out on the deck! You will love it here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed at plenty of Airbnb’s and all I have to say about Margaret is if it rates for 5 outta 5 then I’d give her a 10 outta 10. Communication is superb. She’s is off the charts. She’s a good soul. Anyone debating a few places and this one is on your list…. choose Margaret’s spot. I leave reviews..but a Real Review like this one when it’s warranted.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is spotless, within view of Green Lake, 2 blocks from shops, restaurants and very peaceful. The back deck is a great spot for morning or evening libations."
