2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Mary Catherine was very kind, friendly, and communicative. The house was very clean and I felt very welcomed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for us to stay in the Iowa Great Lakes area with our extended family. 12 guests from ages 2 and up all had a great time! Very clean, organized, and clear instructions for check in and out. We enjoyed the game room and coffee bar as well as the cozy basement to relax. Hosts were very helpful and available with any questions we had. Such a great time was had by all! We will definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at this superb lake home! We planned this weekend to explore all of the thrift stores in the area and were not disappointed! Combined with all of the incredible food options in the area, you really can’t go wrong! After a long day of thrifting, Deb and Mary Catherine’s place was the perfect home away from home to kick back and relax or enjoy activities in the game room! We were extra impressed by the freezer stocked with meals from Deb and Mary Catherine’s business for late night snacks! This stay had everything we were looking for and everything we could ever need for the perfect trip! We’re already planning our next trip to stay here!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cannot wait to come back with our extended family! This home is the perfect setup for a family getaway. So many sleeping accommodations, a yoga room, family room full of board games and a reading nook, a game room in the garage, and all the thoughtful touches to make you feel right at home. I’m usually nervous to rent a new listing, but this one did not disappoint. Comfy beds, so many personal extras (book full of local recommendations, manicure sets, makeup face clothes, a thoughtful gift, coffee station with tons of options, frozen meals from the hosts own business, washer/dryer and supplies, so many towels and extra bedding, and so much more). If you have a large family and looking to enjoy the Iowa Great Lakes area, I definitely recommend staying here. Plus, the hosts were very responsive and sent such sweet messages checking in on us and wishing us a good visit. Will for sure book again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Andrew’s beautiful lake house! It is in a peaceful location and just a short drive to local attractions. He truly thought of everything we might need in the kitchen, bathroom & laundry room. The beds were so comfortable and we loved the outdoor spaces! We would definitely recommend Andrew’s lake house for your future Okoboji stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Lake home!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay at Andrew’s place. Such a beautiful view out of the many back windows and the sunsets on the lake every night! Loved my time here. Would definitely stay again

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay this past few days. Highly recommend this listing if you have a family. Two levels of living with beautiful views and close to everything. Thank you and until next time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay! There are two living rooms and two screened in porches, so plenty of room to spread out. It also has lots of helpful things tucked away in the cupboards and closets so you don't have to bring many supplies with you. The view of the lake is gorgeous. It was also super baby-friendly, which is a huge bonus for those of us traveling with infants! All the outlets were covered and there were fun toys for my son to play with, plus an actual crib. Clean as a whistle and not missing a thing. Would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We were very pleased with the house. It was very spacious and we all had our space. The main thing I liked was it was so close to everything. You are literally a block off of Highway 71 which in the lakes area takes you pretty much everywhere. Never stayed on Center Lake before but it's peaceful and nice to hear the waves come in at dawn. Master Bedroom shows the entire lake if you open the shades. Definitely stay here if you have a chance. It's worth it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was nicer than the photos. Great location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a girls weekend with my daughter and her 3 girls. Lots of games and toys to keep the kiddos entertained. Loved watching the sunset on the lake but being close enough to town to visit restaurants when desired.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at this house - the view was great and the house was lovely and convenient!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ive been going to okoboji since i was a kid. Due to unforseen circumstances we had to sell our cabin that felt like home my whole life. I was needed in spirit lake over the weekend and seen andrews pics so i gave it a shot and omg 😲 the house was amazingly beautiful. The minute i walked in i felt at home and it flooded me with memeories. It has an amazing sun room for morning coffee with great veiws of the water and a private backyard with stairs leading to the lake. Everything is in reach. Blankets,kitchen utensils, grill,kids toys,laundry and a sauna all right on site! You cant beat the price for these views, space, and quiet relaxing environment. Andrew was very accommodating with check in and out time. He was also very quick to respond to any questions. Will definitely be back. And next time with family. Thanks again for a wonderful weekend! Crystal and kyle pauley."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect house for our family of 4 to stay for a week. Everything we needed to cook, entertain, and feel right at home was there. The neighborhood was nice, quiet and safe. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for us! We took Long walks on the trail along hwy71, ate at all our favorite places. The house was very homey and CLEAN! Enjoyed the sauna one night as well. Hope to be back this winter!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled in the heart of a picturesque lake town in Spirit Lake, Iowa, my recent Airbnb stay was a delightful blend of tranquility and small-town charm. As I approached the property, I was greeted by the serene backdrop of the shimmering lake, its surface mirroring the soft hues of the Iowa sky.
The Airbnb was a cozy haven, thoughtfully furnished to provide comfort and a sense of home. Each morning, I awoke to the gentle lull of the lake, its quiet presence a constant companion during my stay. The living area, comfortable seating, and warm lighting invited lazy afternoons with a good book or quiet contemplation.
Its seamless blend with the natural surroundings sets this place apart. The deck offered an uninterrupted view of the lake, making it the perfect spot for a morning coffee or an evening of stargazing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time. The place was spotless and the host gave very clear instructions for check in and out.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We spent 8 days in this great Center Lake home. The owner was able to save the original characteristics of this 1970’s home that you don’t find in a new build, and yet gave it a complete remodel with new furnishings and modern conveniences. This is a true lake home-the view is lovely and the neighborhood is very quiet. It’s just a short drive to restaurants and groceries and there is an assortment of games and toys for the fam at the house too! Also, the owner is extremely good at responding if you have any questions. It was just the two of us staying-but there is a lot of room in this house with 3 large bedrooms, 2 full baths, 2 living rooms, 2 screened porches and so much more!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a short stay but very nice home and neighborhood. We will use this place again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home has all new finishes and furniture. Lovely deck right on water to watch sunsets. Views from master bedroom and lower level bedroom. There are 2 enclosed and furnished porches that can be opened up or closed up and heated. Many efforts to accommodate small children. Comfortable beds (firm mattress). We loved it. And there’s a sauna!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay! The place was house was perfectly clean, every piece of furniture, linen, and houseware was brand new. The house had beautiful lake views that were enjoyed on 2 large screened in porches. The house is very kid friendly, including child safety locks, crib, toys, and more. The house was stocked with everything you need, and the owner was very responsive. I would definitely stay here again."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Jeremey’s place! We were in town for Winter Games and this was the perfect location super close to Barefoot bar and all of the hot spot locations! 10/10 recommend!

The counter were sticky, stove not clean, microwave not clean inside, handle on stove and refrigerator was not wipe down, pots and pans were not clean at all had to wash them before we could use them, need to wipe shelves in refrigerator, took someone trash out Thursday on trash day is that my job. The carpets could be vacuum better. The bathroom floor was not swept up good. The laundry soap should be cover since got soap on the washing machine. Sorry Jeremy
Believe me the frying pan and sauce pan were not clean, not happy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home nice community really close to everything. I will definitely stay at this property again .
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great weekend at the house and booked our stay rather last minute. It was very close to events but far enough away that it was quiet. Jeremy was also super helpful when we needed to check in a early. We go to Okoboji quite a bit and will definitely be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Will be back for sure.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely Place!! Perfect host
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"This location worked well for our snowmobiling weekend! Easy to get sleds out and travel around. Roomed the six of us and our dog just fine. The neighborhood and home are so new, I’m sure it would be even better with more sidewalks and walking spaces in the future."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean, the beds and furniture where very comfortable!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"THEY THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING! Every time I thought they wouldn't have something, I found it (spices, cooking spray, a toaster). We stayed here for a midway point for two family Thanksgivings between Windom MN and Sibley IA. It was perfect for our two under 2! There were two bedrooms with darkening blinds. Jeremy was very flexible with us, allowing us to check in early to set things up and after I mentioned we have two beds to set up (toddler bed and packnplay), we arrived to find a crib for our 7 month old. So thoughtful and cut down our hauling in/set up/tear down time. The location was great as it's in a new, quiet neighborhood while still being near Arnold's Park, shops, restaurants, and coffee! There are multiple police officers living on the same street which made us feel extra safe. Our little farm kid loved the currently open lot next door to play outside. The attached garage would also make for a great place to ride trikes and play in cooler weather."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve was great even with some changes we made. He was easy to make contact with and the house was great. We were there fishing and there was plenty of room in the driveway for 2 boats in a very safe and secure neighborhood Thx again!
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"The front door keypad did not work throughout the entire stay, causing our check-in to be a hassle and then having to walk around the home in the dark at night to access the back door. The owner was helpful with the issue, but it wasn't convenient for our stay. The property and neighborhood is nice and as expected."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay while in Okoboji!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay, spacious, plenty of amenities. Quiet area, we really loved sitting in the outdoor patio area. Highly recommend staying here!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Steve was so easy to communicate with, and his place was beautiful!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"CLose to things but your not right in the action , it was nice and perfect for our mc trip. We would stay here again if we come back and visit the lakes .

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Steve had all of the instructions clearly laid out and was available if I needed anything. The home is in a quiet neighborhood so it was perfect for our trip to the lakes visiting family. Loved the open floor plan, extra towels and fire table out back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a family to stay. It's very clean. The neighborhood is quiet. The kitchen is large and the bedrooms are comfortable. If you can, bring your bikes. It's only a ten minute bike ride to Arnold's Park with a trail leading you all the way there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We never had to go to the store to get anything because EVERYTHING was provided at the house! Having a washer and dryer was amazing, too! The house was super clean & they had decorations to make it feel like HOME. The location was perfect. 10 minute drive to get to all of the fun places Okoboji has to offer! We took a super quiet, beautiful walk through the neighborhood every morning we were there.
We will definitely try to stay here again if we go back to Spirit Lake. Don’t even think twice about this home, book it! You won’t regret it at all! Overall 10/10 review for this home!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Steve was a great host. Even for 8 girls and only the 1 bathroom, it worked out perfectly for us. We never used the fire pit which I wish we had! And though the location isn't right by the lake, it was a 5 minute drive to the barefoot bar and only 10 minutes to other good spots we drove to. Great house and a great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and quiet surroundings.
Everywhere my group went was within about 15 minutes from this residence.

Overall great experience.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT little place, just a block from the water! We were able to watch the sunrise from the living room & the place was so cozy during a winter storm! Heather was super responsive & there were even snacks & water when we arrived. The couch was comfy for an extra sleeping spot, too. The location was perfect - just minutes away from everything that we did, including downtown Spirit Lake, restaurants, the Nature Center, & Arnold’s Park. Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a cute spot for the weekend :)"

Memorial Park is very close and has a big picnic shelter overlooking lake. Bring your streaming tv passwords (no local tv or cable). Because it is a lower level walkout apartment go around to the back of the house to park and enter there. Thank you Heather!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect stay after a 14 hour drive from Montana. Arrived late and Heather left candles on for us. Two full bedrooms and a wonderful shower with hot water. Full kitchen with oven and fridge. Parking was right a the door if the airbnb. Beautiful lake
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay.. beautiful surroundinga
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A relaxing stay at a vintage cottage with beautiful views of Big Spirit Lake. The location was nestled among large old bur oak trees. The nice dock allowed for sitting and viewing the lake or fishing. We enjoyed our time there!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: A super cute ""little"" cozy home on the lakefront. The home was clean and free of clutter. Had all fresh linens and extra blankets. The host was friendly at check-in and did allow us to check in early.
Cons: We never realized you had to walk through one of the bedrooms to get to the other, reducing privacy. The bunkbed tops should be for children only as they are wobbly for an adult and the mattresses were thin. Once we got on a top bunk, we were hit with spider webs that were in the corners and above our heads. Made us not want to sleep up there at all. Other areas also had spider webs in the doorways. We stayed two nights with the nightly rate reasonable, but the cleaning fee of $200 seemed steep considering the size of the home and the spider webs all over. I messaged on the Airbnb site, text, and tried to call to see if we needed to bring our own towels. Not very responsive for us to prepare for our trip."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kelly’s place is great! Right on Spirit Lake and a short 15 minute drive to Arnold’s park! We had a great time!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place to relax and unwind.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Good host.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We booked this place for our family getaway to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was a perfect place with the most beautiful view of the sunset. Close to all of the attractions of Okoboji.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay at the cabin with the family. It had everything we needed plus some fun extras like kayaks. We would stay here again.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The place is very pretty and peaceful. Beautiful sunset every night. The best part about the place is the boat dock where we can access to our boat whenever we wanted. I would love to give 5 stars but had some pest issues. I am a clean freak so I spent some time to cleaning the place which I wasn’t expecting to do during my vacation.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is amazing! Kelly did an excellent job with descriptions and pictures on the sight and communicating. The personal touches, stocked shelves made our stay easy. So homey and comfortable. This cabin is steeped in tradition and enjoyed reading the articles about her grandfather. He lived an amazing life of service.
Location was beautiful with amazing sunsets over Big Spirit Lake. Quick drive to town and short jaunt to the amusement park at Arnold's park. Quiet, and about zero traffic.
Matt was Johnny on the spot checking us in! Kelly gave us a hook up for a fishing guide which turned out to be a great decision and the highlight of our grandson's week. 4 hours fishing with a professional in every sense of the word. Well worth the investment!
Our grandchildren had a great time on the lake, fishing, running and jumping off the dock, swimming, kayaking and hanging out.
Folks, this is an absolute Gem! Thanks again Kelly and Matt!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our time at the cabin. We had lots of amenities on-site and were able to relax and enjoy being at the lake!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Grandpa’s cabin was comfortable and cozy. The lake view and sunsets were amazing! This was a very restful retreat. We hope to return again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Grandpa's Cabin immensely. It was everything that Kelly described and exactly what we were looking for, a peaceful reprieve! We were far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Okoboji but close enough to drive the 10 minutes into town for terrific dining and shopping. The dock was just a few steps out the back door and the views were spectacular. Kelly checked on us throughout our stay to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Kelly's place was very clean and organized, she had everything thing we needed and everything was well labeled so we knew where it went when cleaning up. Kelly has compiled a terrific binder that lists all the entertainment, dining, shopping, etc... for the surrounding area which was extremely helpful. We enjoyed reading up on the family history of the cabin and especially about ""Grandpa"" and all the family's military service. She even provided coffee and snacks!! We will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We always look forward to our stays at Grandpa’s cabin! The location, comfort, and amenities can’t be beat on Big Spirit Lake!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay with kids!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin on Spirit Lake. Very nice quiet area.
Loved it"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the cabin and would definitely recommend it to anyone. The neighbors are friendly. We brought a couple yard games and played them each night as the sun was setting. Such a beautiful view. Matt and Kelly are very easy to get along with and were very happy to help in any way possible. Best hosts for sure! We highly recommend going to the okoboji store for dinner and drinks as well as going to Arnold's park to play mini golf.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was fantastic, we enjoyed watching the nightly sunsets! The house had everything our group of 7 needed."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had 9 college friends stay at this wonderful cabin. We had plenty of room inside and out. Swimming, lake time, close to the busier activities of the lake area. The sunsets are second to none! We all felt the pictures don’t do the place justice! It’s wonderfully remodeled and Matt and Kelly are proud of the history of the cabin which they shared with us. As Iowa Staters, we loved the history of our fellow alum “Grandpa!” Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Grandpa’s Cabin! The place was great. Beautiful sunsets, it was clean, the kitchen was well stocked, and we lived the personal touches. There are lots of extras I don’t typically get from a rental such as snacks, a history of the cabin, local information, and a great list of suggested items to bring to make the stay more enjoyable. The host is very accessible and willing to help in any way. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little spot that has received a lot of updates.
The cabin was very well equipped and the hosts provided tons of freebies and extras like a s’mores kit, snacks, a bait shop gift card, boutique chocolates and bottled water among other things. It was unexpected and isn’t something you would see at many other listings.
We were able to rent the boat lift which is very hard to find on any rental. It was a fishing trip and being able to leave the boat in the whole trip was a game changer. Fuel up before hitting the lake because there is no gas available on Spirit Lake. The lift worked great with our 20 foot fiberglass fishing boat. They had a big wake boat there on a previous rental so it will fit a wide range of boats, up to 5,000 pounds.
The best way for me to sum up our experience is that we will be going back for sure. Thanks for having us!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We are repeat visitors and continue to be happy with the home, the spot on the lake, and the memories we make as a family. This is a great cabin with all of the amenities-- a great kitchen, comfy beds, and the couch faces the lake for the best early morning views. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This was our 2nd time staying at the cabin and we loved it just like the first time! It was so clean, great location and the view could not be beat!! Very easy to communicate with host “Kelly”."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful getaway, this is your place. The spot on the lake is tranquil and the amenities are just right: beach towels, kayaks, a hammock, a useful kitchen, toiletries, and a washer and dryer to name a few. The walking trail is across the street and town is a short 5 minute drive away. We hope to be back again next year!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The view from the firepit is second to none! Everything was great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Grandpa's Cabin, it was perfect for our family get away! Some of the best sunsets we have ever seen!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy cabin, great for families, incredible sunsets, super hosts, highly recommend dining on the dock and a nice ride up and down the bike path. If you like a quieter lake bring a boat as Big Spirit was incredible calm and lower traffic than West/East Lake Okaboji..."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"You will really enjoy yourself here! Beautiful view, lovely yard for yard games, bikes & a bike path nearby, swimming & kayaking—it was super relaxing and a blast for our family. Thank you!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here. We love this cabin - beautiful view and the cabin has everything you need to enjoy the lake (rafts, kayaks and so much more.). Kelly and Matt are great hosts and go the extra mile to make sure you have a great stay! We’ll hopefully be back for a third time next summer!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great family getaway! The cabin was even better in person than I could have imagined. The lake view was beautiful and the sunsets were gorgeous. We really appreciated having all of the family games, movies, and snacks provided. The communication was great as well. We will not hesitate to go back!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at ""Grandpa's Cabin"" was the perfect weekend getaway. The home is well laid out with plenty of beds, linens, dishes, places to sit, and tons of space outside. It is even bigger in person than I thought it would be. The cabin is cozy with modern updates and the perfect spot on the lake. We hope to return in the near future!"
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"You can expect very clean accommodations. Great communication with Matt and Kelly. The view Is picturesque and being so close to water is awesome! Top 10 spot for sure,"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very quiet and peaceful spot, cabin felt like home we enjoyed everything about our stay. Great spot to watch the sunset Enjoy doing that nightly. Easy access to everywhere we needed to go. Highly recommend"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I was expecting a cabin on the lake. This was so much more, it was very nicely decorated, the amenities included kayaks and bicycles for personal use. I loved the history behind the cabin and how the family chose to honor their Grandfather. It was a relaxing family fun week, we will be back."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa's cabin was a perfect retreat, awesome views of Big Spirit Lake and close to Okoboji! Great 0lace to take the family and enjoy a peaceful vacation!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Kelly and Matt were amazing hosts. The place was even better than than we had expected. Kelly and Matt had special little treats there for us when we arrived. Checked with us while we were there to make sure everything was going well for us and there were many ammenaties there for our use. We would highly recommend staying at Grandpa's Cabin.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our time at Grandpa's Cabin. It is a great place for a family getaway. Kelly made our stay special with all the wonderful little touches, local tips, and amenities for families to stay (pack n play, high chair, games, books, bubbles, sidewalk chalk, sandbox, etc). It does get a bit warm in Grandpa's room but it helps to leave a few doors open and run the fans. The kayaks were a hit and the sunset each night was a highlight. The stairs off the dock were super handy and everyone loved roasting hot dogs and enjoying s'mores with the fire pit. We would definitely stay again."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing location. A bit small for 7 people but the location, the lake and the dock made up for it since we spent most of the time outside anyway. This is our 2nd time staying here and absolutely loved it. Cant wait to go back."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Kelly has thought of very thing! It is the perfect place to sit back and relax. Location is outstanding and a variety of things to do right at the cabin. So if you are looking for a location to social distance but get out of your house, this it perfect. If you are looking to be around a lot of people just take a 15 minute drive to Okoboji lake and rent a boat. There is something for everyone."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at the cabin with our 3 and 4 year olds and absolutely loved it! Kelly and Matt were so wonderful! Above and beyond! The cabin was perfect - the kitchen and the whole cabin are stocked with everything you could possibly need (Kelly even had toys and books for the kids in the cabin for us) and the cabin is decorated so nicely - very cozy. A major upgrade from the old cabins I remember staying in at Okoboji as a kid! The view from the backyard is absolutely beautiful! We loved fishing and kayaking right in the backyard. Even got the kids on the kayak! I hope we can come back next year and in years to come! We loved this trip so much!

Thank you!!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful place. Loved the views of the lake during sunrise and sunset. They were the best. The place is a little small but it is well planned out. Loved the decor and the location was so nice. Close to the main attractions which made it easy to get around. Although mother nature gave us quite a scare during a big storm,which we were not prepared for, it gave us some good video and we survived. The host were so responsive to our needs and so kind. It was so nice knowing the history of the house and looking around and seeing the pictures, the books and the decor. It was a great way to spend a weekend with 3 generations."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is in the perfect location. Close to all tourist attractions but far enough away to have the peace and relaxation of the water. The cabin is beautifully decorated. The hosts have thought of everything! The sunset views are spectacular. We loved using the dock to swim from and napping in the hammock. Kelly is so friendly and welcoming. The house is very clean and having laundry there was a huge bonus for us. It is a gem!

We so appreciated the homey touches, including gorgeous chocolates from a local shop, s'more fixings, extra beach towels and sunscreen, and kayaks. The cottage is cozy at 800 square ft but has amazing views and is nicely decorated and comfortable. Anything we needed help with, they provided, including directions to the closest boat launch and help with their hoist. No marine services on Spirit Lake but plenty of access to services on Okoboji. We enjoyed our stay and will have precious memories of Spirit Lake!"

Having a great view of 4th of July fireworks over the lake was an extra unexpected bonus.

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We have really enjoyed our stay at Mama's boathouse and have appreciated the small personal and funky cool design features here, and of course the magnificent view and fishing opportunities. We plan to return again and again in the future. My son's senior pictures were scheduled during our stay and Kelly was very helpful in suggesting areas that were gorgeous settings for his pictures.
Kelly had chocolates and a personal anniversary card that made our stay so special and memorable to celebrate our anniversary.
The pictures in listing are accurate to reality, but don't do justice to the lakeside view. if you like to fish, you will love this place, as my husband caught 3 different species of fish during our stay. The part that I enjoyed was the gorgeous views of the sunrises and sunsets from the dock each day.
You cannot go wrong if you enjoy fishing, and are looking for a peaceful and relaxing location with all you need, then Mama's boathouse is your perfect choice. We loved it and plan to return again and again. Thanks Matt and Kelly for the location for one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever had."

I appreciate you having the cabin well stocked w/ supplies for us to make breakfasts, have a fire pit, & do laundry.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was hard to believe that this cabin, which looks incredibly charming with an amazing lake view, could be even more charming and picturesque than expected! Kelly was an amazing host who left tons of tiny amenities - s’mores ingredients, soft blankets, bath bombs, chocolates from a local sweet shop - plus recommendations that exactly fit our interests.
We loved to sit inside or outside and look at the lake, sit on the deck and swim or fish (we caught several), kayak, or walk or drive around the area. It was a perfectly cozy space for our family of four, with really comfortable beds to boot! We would visit again in a heartbeat."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mama’s Boathouse was a perfect spot for my three adult daughters and I to spend time together.

It really was just a serene location. Quick drive to get to any restaurants you want to check out but I was very glad to not be in the middle of the busier side of the lakes. We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing and the view. We really enjoyed the stay at Sara’s place, would love to do it again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved our stay! The view from the dock just can’t be beat 😍 The porch is spacious with plenty of seating, a gas fire pit, and a Blackstone that we used for multiple meals. The reading nook porch is simply darling, and the inside of the home is very cute and clean! Everything we needed and more in the kitchen. There is a pullout mattress in the living room couch, and a very cozy bed for the main bedroom. There was plenty of hot water and pressure in the bathroom too! Also, if you run hot like me, the AC works super well and there are ceiling fans in every room! We would highly recommend staying here 😊 15 mins away from almost anything in Okoboji."

Shelley was very responsive to any questions and the snack and toiletry baskets were an unexpected surprise. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome place to stay. Very comfortable, great access to the lake. Really enjoyed sitting on the back deck and looking out over the water in the morning, afternoon, and at night. Great hosts – – they helped with any questions we had. Lots of extra amenities in the house for us."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful cottage. Great host. Lots of cool personal touches.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A cozy, clean lake house with everything you need to relax. My husband brought some fishing poles and caught fish off the dock. My boys loved the beach access from the dock, and the stocked game closet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to relax and enjoy the lake! Shelley's home was clean, furnished both inside and outside with perfect amenities for our group of four women. The view of the lake is breathtaking, we enjoyed the sunrise and the sunset! So peaceful to open the huge sliding doors and listen to the waves. We hope to return in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about this cottage and our host. The view was so beautiful! The location is great! Shelley was a wonderful host. She made sure to let us know that we could feel free to contact her anytime with questions we may have. We will definitely be staying here again.
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"Great location! They had lots of fun extras to use like kayaks, bikes, games and a couple baskets of snacks and other things!!
Being able use the boat lift was awesome!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This home is straight out of a book or movie, and we couldn't have loved it more! The view of the lake from inside of the home is absolutely beautiful! When the sliding glass door was open, we could hear the waves!
The neighborhood is very quiet, which is exactly what we wanted. We went fishing/swimming from the dock, had a fire, kayaked and relaxed in the hammock. It rained one day, but Shelly had the perfect set up for 3 teenagers. We played board games from her closet and she even had a Wii. The teenagers were big fans of the basket of snacks left on the counter! The drive to Okoboji was just 15-20 minutes, where we rented jetskis, a boat, went to Arnold's Park and to dinner several times.
The stay was very comfortable. Everything was super clean and looked just like the pictures.
I really cannot say enough good things about this home. I would highly recommend it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is the perfect location on Big Spirit for our family of 5. Plenty of space, with all the amenities we need. Shelley is a great hostess! This is our second stay here and we’ looking forward to our next!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A lovely home, decorated with care, outstanding hosts, all made for a fabulous 39th Anniversary for my husband and I and our family. Thank you Shelley for everything! You are the best."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to kick back and enjoy lake life. Shelley's home was comfortably furnished both inside and outside with abundant amenities for our group of four adults and two littles. You won't regret your stay on the north side of Spirit Lake - the view of the lake is such that you can enjoy both the sunrise and the sunset and everything in between. I hope to return in the future.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay on Spirit Lake. Shelley was a great host, very quick to respond with any questions, and provided useful information for the area and house. The house was amazing, very clean and organized, and the location is great for a relaxing stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking to be by the water this is the place! The view is absolutely amazing from the house, deck, and dock. The waves come in and sound like you are at the ocean! Shelley has so many little extras that make this place so special! The spot is peaceful and beautiful while only being a short drive to the action. This spot was a perfect stay for our girls weekend away!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Shelley place was perfect! She was so kind! The house was in a perfect spot for a nice quiet night but not to far from the busyness either
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lake home was a true gem! My husband and I wanted a special place to celebrate our anniversary, and this exceeded our expectations in every way. The entire wall of windows looking out over the lake was spectacular! The accommodations were equal to a five star hotel, with all the comforts of home. Shelly was wonderful to work with, available and full of helpful ideas when we asked for suggestions. We heartily recommend this lake home and hope to return soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Though we missed out on having dock time due to low lake levels making use of same unsafe, we couldn't have been happier with the location of this cottage. Shelley and Dave have provided a beautifully decorated updated cottage on a beautiful lake! Location to several towns for groceries, etc. was easy. Dining-out is as much a challenge in NW Iowa as it is any other smaller communities (vs. St. Louis MO)."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Close enough to Okaboji wthout the hassle and congestion.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shelley’s hospitality was great and her place was very nice! She has lots of extra chairs, blankets, pillows, games, and really anything you could possibly be looking for. 10/10 would recommend. We will definitely keep this place in mind if we decide to stay in the area again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this lake house at the spirit lake . Amazing view from the house and very close to other attractions . Shelley was very responsive and the place was organized . Checkin and check out was very smooth . We loved the place .
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great little place. Most airbnb’s leave you with minimal toilet paper or garage bags. Not Shelley. She is well stocked and has everything you need! We have stayed in Florida beach airbnbs’s and honestly I felt Shelley was better prepared for the beach! Her towels and bedding are top notch too! The shower was amazing and the curtains allow you to sleep past sun rise. It is such a peaceful place away from the hub bub. It doesn’t take too long to get to town either. I highly recommended this place if you are ok with a drive away from town. For us, it was the perfect place to come back to fish, grill out and chill. Many mornings were spent on the dock in solitude."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Super homey, the big wall full of windows literally pulls you into relaxation with 0 effort. Seriously recommend this stay!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Cottage was well-kept, fully stocked with games/movies, kitchen gear, extra bedding, and everything else you would need! The neighbors are great, too!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,A quiet and cozy location on Big Spirit Lake. Easy access to bike trails and the lake. The cottage was perfect for our family. Fully stocked with all basic needs!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shelly’s place was amazing. Peaceful, clean, spacious for a family of four.! Would love to stay here again in the future."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the lake-front wall of windows on this wonderful place to stay! Great location, on a nice lake. Close to many attractions in Okoboji and to stores (Wal-Mart and Hy-Vee) near by. And right by a state park! Clean house with lots of amenities. Our family of four played lots of games from the stocked collection. We would stay here again without hesitation. Host is gracious and communicates well, their home has many nice touches to welcome travelers. Make the reservation to stay here in this clean, well-stocked, quaint, lake-front cottage, you will have a great get-away."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved this cottage! What an amazing view of the lake as soon as you walk through the front door! Just an excellent place to relax and unwind. The kitchen and bath had everything we needed for our stay with so many extras to make us feel right at home like shampoo, soaps, cold bottled water, condiments, etc. Bed was very comfy! Shelley and Dave were so kind and attentive to make sure our stay was nothing short of perfect! Dave even found us a set of corn hole boards when we asked (thank you for that!) We felt so welcomed there. Thank you again for being such great hosts and for sharing your home with us."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is lovely! I would absolutely reserve it again! Shelley was so helpful & hospitable! I brought five girlfriends with me and every one of us agreed that we loved this place! Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot on the lake! Great view, close to boat ramp, park, trail, and fishing, and cottage has everything you need to enjoy the lakes. We rented a boat for the day and liked having the dock to access the cottage for breaks, food or switching tubes, etc. Enjoyed our kayaks, fishing off the dock, sipping coffee or sunning on the deck, firepit & s’mores and grilling outside (fish tacos!) AND loved being inside to play the games in the game closet during the rainstorm. Perfect space for a family of 5! Definitely hope we can stay again soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful peaceful retreat in this lovely home right on the water!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a wonderful cabin! We had a fantastic time. Shelley is a great host. Everything was perfect. The cabin is clean & undated with a incredible view of the lake. We will definitely be back!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage on Spirit Lake. The house was clean. Well stocked with all the items necessary. Would recommend if you love lake life.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 5 stayed at Shelley's for four nights. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. The fridge was stocked with water which was such a nice surprise upon arrival. The house is comfortable. Plenty of blankets and the option to use the sleeper bed in the couch or a blow up mattress. Both options are perfect for kids who are prone to roll off the bed. Our room had a fan in it which is great for white noise. I have been sleeping with a fan my entire life so this was a huge plus for me. The doc and patio were ideal for watching the kids play being able to quickly run into the house to grab all of the things that kids need. We would absolutely stay here again. It was perfect.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"This place was perfect for our group of 5! I would say you could do a group of 6 here too but anymore it'd be a little tight with just one bathroom.
The view is amazing from the house to the lake with the big windows overlooking the patio, lake and dock. We spent time on the patio, grilling, and enjoying the view while playing some yard games. We also went into town a few times to enjoy time with friends. If you're looking to be closer to downtown Okoboji and whatnot, this might be far for you (around 15-20 mins) but if you're not bothered by a drive or are planning to spend time at the lake and hanging out / renting boats, this is perfect!
The owners clearly put a lot of thought into their Airbnb and have decorated it very well / cute, they painted, nice flooring, quality kitchen, just all around great for a stay on the lake in a place that has been well taken care of."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Everything you need for a trip that feels like you’re right at home. Food and Walmart are just a short drive away and gorgeous views!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and hospitable! A home away from home. A gem of a place. I enjoyed my stay with Lisa as she was super helpful about the area. Will come back again soon.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lisa’s was just what I needed for my two week stay. I came to IA for work and got homesick instantly and Lisa made my stay comfortable. The amount of snacks are REAL and if you’re around while she’s cooking, she’ll definitely tell you to grab a plate! Luna was even welcoming as well! Wish my job wasn’t so far out bc I definitely would’ve stayed for my 3 month assignment."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lisa is such a great host! Her place is homey, you can relax in the living spaces as opposed to being confined to your room. I also loved that there was a refrigerator and you could cook meals in her kitchen. She also has a snack basket which is so nice and thoughtful! Overall, I would definitely book here again and explore the lake!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was very responsive and friendly. She recommended some fun events nearby during our stay. She also had a lot of snacks (never seen so much at an AirBnB) and a separate fridge for her guests. Unfortunately, we had to leave early due to an emergency and she offered some credit for our stay the next time! I mean who does that - she’s far too kind."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was super friendly and went out of her way to make sure we had a good experience. She even offered transportation to our conference location and back when she was not committed elsewhere. Full access to the kitchen, living and dining rooms, and a nice variety of snack options and fresh fruit."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was very friendly, organized, flexible and provided an affordable option to other lodging in the area. She was very generous with allowing use of the kitchen, deck, etc. Well-stocked and furnished. Complete with full sized refrigerator for guests to share. Excellent location a few minutes' drive from Arnolds Park and other attractions."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean. Lisa was a very nice host. She had a parking spot for our boat and was close to all the Lake Okoboji spots.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cute place to stay, definitely would stay here again!! Heather was very friendly and accommodating during the entire process!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great cozy place! Definitely recommend it’s the most beach vibes.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We only spent one night but we had a super comfortable stay. Everyone had their own room and the beds were comfy. I am sure if we would have had a longer stay we would have made use of the kitchen! Great location and great place to stay! Will stay here again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great quiet place in great proximity to the lake. Felt like home away from home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! kind of retro in a neat way. It was comfortable, clean, and there was water in the fridge, snacks on the counter, and the coffee was great. I Also a good table to visit at: was perfect for cribbage 🙂"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is like staying at your holiday home, come and relax"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s place was fantastic. Everything was as it was described. I was there on a work trip and was scheduled to be there for three nights. After the first day, I got very sick and had to go to urgent care. Being at this Airbnb was fantastic rather than being in a hotel room. Heather was very helpful as she checked in on me and even offered to bring over soup or anything that I needed. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is very close to the lake and then a very peaceful location. Heather is a fantastic host for a family getaway or any reason you are in spirit Lake Heather‘s place is the place to be."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Its a great place to stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great spot, came in for Winter Games and were far enough away from the chaos we could relax, but get to activities with ease! Very thankful for Heather and the hospitality she gave my friends and I throughout the duration of the visit."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Lee & Nancy are AMAZING hosts! Very welcoming. The space was perfect for our stay. We look forward to our next stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was just what we were looking for!!
Lake + patio + firepit = heaven!
We enjoyed the board games and the bonus rec room!
We would highly recommend this lake retreat house and would stay there again!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have been happier at Nancy's place. The place is impeccable and the lake and surroundings are beautiful.

Thanks for everything and I'll see you again for sure!
Keith--- 6 stars."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was better than expectations, Nancy and Lee were Great host's they had it so organized and a lot more amenities than expected. We cant wait to return."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location! Went above and beyond with amenities! Would totally recommend.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful. Very peaceful location. The host had Lake toys we could play with like kayaks. The AC worked really great. We will definitely try to come again soon. The accommodations for wonderful.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nancy’s listing was a beautiful lake house! It’s even nicer than the photos and had almost everything we needed for our overnight stay. The dock was really peaceful and the unit itself was nestled in a safe neighborhood. Rooms also had lake views.
The hosts were lovely and I especially appreciated how pet friendly the place was — it’s often difficult to find Airbnbs with reasonable pet policies so this one was truly a blessing!
Highly recommended, especially for pet owners like myself!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,will definitely be back again soon!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice place with a beautiful view. Don’t hesitate booking if you’re interested, it was well worth it:)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nancy and Lee’s place is one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed in. They were very friendly and welcoming, even allowing my dog too hang out with them while I went to dinner. Although, I was only there for a night, this would be a great place to stay for a few days or longer. The unit is nicely decorated, clean, and spacious. The view from the sitting room is beautiful and peaceful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy & Lee were great, made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed! Very clean and gorgeous view of lake!

Very welcoming and friendly hosts, thank you both!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,FABULOUS!!! Great experience in a cozy atmosphere and friendly hosts. Highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's hard to find a more beautiful setting, right on the lake, even when it was still frozen during my late-winter stay. This lower-level walkout is very clean and cozy. Nancy and Lee have made many improvements since buying the house several years ago, and continue to make improvements such as new flooring upstairs and patio/terracing down to the lake. Great Iowa hospitality!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! We were in town for 3 days traveling to Estherville for a wrestling tournament, everything is close and easy to get to and get any items needed. Hosts were great! Informative and friendly without being intrusive in any way, beautiful spot!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just what we had hoped for. Great location, wonderful hosts, beautiful house with all the amenities we needed (plus the extra touches that were greatly appreciated). Nancy and Lee greet you at the door and make you feel so welcome right from the start. They are there to assist with anything you need. They checked in with us periodically and it was apparent that they really wanted to make sure we were pleased with our stay. We were invited for a visit before leaving and had wonderful conversation over a cup of coffee. Thank you for being such wonderful hosts. We'll definitely be back and hope to make arrangements to stay several times when we're not able to camp in the Lakes area. We appreciate everything you did to make our staff so enjoyable!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nancy and Lee are hospitable, friendly folks with a lovely lake setting. Nancy was excellent with communications through Airbnb and Lee showed us all the amenities of their lower-level apartment which was very clean and well stocked with any possible necessity. We had a short but wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great comfy place. It doesn’t feel like you’re in a basement at all with the light and well thought out AC units. I think every cabinet was labeled and full of whatever you might need or had forgotten. Definitely would stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy place to stay. Very clean everywhere and great hospitality. Plan on staying again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay!!! Nancy and her family were a great host!

2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,They were kind and a very clean space!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place to stay. Very hospitable.

Greeted us when we arrived and left.
will definitely stay again the next time we visit."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and quiet place to stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a private space in the lower level of a beautiful lakeside home. The space was perfect for the two of us plus our adult son for an overnight on our way to a family Christmas gathering. It was tastefully decorated for the holidays and had everything we needed. The host family were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a quick trip to Spirit Lake. Wish we had more time to enjoy the lake. Nancy was very friendly and helpful.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great view and felt at home
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Overall a very nice area to stay for our family for the weekend. My kids loved the room that had a pool table, board games and toys. Also had a lovely view of the lake and great location in Spirit Lake.
Couple things to consider: you can hear every step the owners take from the level above you. I wish I could post a video of how loud the creeks are. Also we were instructed to use the patio door entrance to enter our space, which is down uneven/steep steps down the hill- not great for kids."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our quick stay here. The place had all the necessities plus some extras. Enjoyable stay and we would gladly stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was impeccable and very neat. Lee was a good host and very respectful as he showed us the entire place and told us if we needed anything else to let him know. We felt very comfortable with the place and would recommend to anyone who wants to stay at their place as it also had a great view of the lake. Overall, it
exceeded our expectations."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely the best hosts of any AirBNB I have stayed. The accommodations are perfect for our trip. This is the second year in a row we have stayed and they always make us feel welcome. Will absolutely be staying with them again next year.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nancy and Lee went out of their way to provide all the amenities needed for an enjoyable stay (my husband and I enjoyed the sweet treats and popcorn for snacks and coffee in the morning). The bed/bedroom is comfortable and the bathroom is large. We appreciated that the home is pet friendly. Thanks again for a lovely getaway!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lake Retreat was the perfect spot for my family for a two-night stay. Nancy, Lee, and Winston were great hosts and very friendly. The rental was even better than advertised, as it included an activity room with toys, games, and pool table to keep the kids busy. The beautiful surroundings at the property were also an added bonus and made for a peaceful setting for morning coffee. The location is a nice middle point to head to either Spirit Lake or Okoboji for activities or dining. As is typical with multi-level, owner-occupied listings there is some floor noise from the level above, but it is minor compared to all the benefits of this rental. My family would definitely visit again for a future stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning view! The hosts were very welcoming and kind.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nancy’s place was exactly what we needed! It had everything we needed for a short stay

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one Night at Nancys Place, and we loved it. The view over the lake from the livingroom and the Veranda were amazing and we liked the lakeside theme in the whole Appartement whith all the small little details!

We did some bike riding, and the trail was very close to the bike trail. We’d love to come and stay again sometime!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,The air bnb was a wonderful place to come back to after a busy day at the Spencer Fair and lakes. Nancy was a wonderful hostess who made sure all our needs were met. We appreciated that every bedroom had its own heating/ac unit. Also having high quality towels right there was wonderful. It was wonderful having a washer/dryer right there. .Nancy provided so many little things that definitely made us know would stay here again!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious and very nicely decorated. Great views and a friendly, quiet neighborhood. Nancy and Lee are very nice. The outside steps were a challenge as we had two dogs but we didn’t want to go in and out of their home (even when they welcomed us too) and disrupt them. When home they were active similar to apartment living. . Enjoyed Winston and looking forward to booking again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly , beautiful location. Sit on patio for coffee and stare at the lake. There are some steps to navigate but they are working on that. Lee and Nancy are going very friendly and Winston 🐾🐶 like to be petted 😆. Will go back ."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Nancy, Lee and their little dog Winston were wonderful hosts. The apartment was great, and the lake was beautiful. Everything was clean, and they had plenty of extras like shampoo and laundry detergent. I’ve stayed in many places, and the beds, sheets and blankets were extra nice. It can be a little noisy, but it is a basement apartment, so that is to be expected. We are excited to return next year. ❤️"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We were passing through and needed a place for an overnight stay. The place was comfortable and met the needs we had. It does not have a full kitchen so would need to be a little creative if planning on cooking meals. The view was peaceful as it is on a lake.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay we will be back again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a gals weekend for the Okoboji Winter Games and their place was just perfect!

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apt was nice, everything clean and appropriate, nice view, plenty of room. I stayed with my daughter for relaxing weekend and it worked well. I feel like it should be mentioned or called semi private since you can’t lock the sliding barn door to the house or any bedroom doors, this could bother some people. You can hear noises from upstairs but not much more then living in an apt. Also the outside steps could be an issue with some folks, big steps, we preferred them to going into the main house though. I would like to come back when it’s warm enough to enjoy the deck that is being refurbished. Thank you!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,A great getaway for my sister and me! The space was so comfortable and the value could not be beat.

We were in town for a wedding so we didn't get to enjoy a lot of the things Nancy had to offer at her home like the lake, firepit, and beautiful deck space. They were very welcoming and kind considering we had three small children with! Everything was very clean and presented nicely. It was much bigger than we were expecting! We definitely will be considering coming back and staying here in the future!"

We loved eating breakfast outside on the lower deck, sitting on the dock by the water, and taking in the view! Meeting their sweet pup, Walter was the highlight of our morning. 🥰"
2022-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"the location was very nice. big drawback was noisy. A machine was running most of the night upstairs home (this location is lower level, private entrance) it was very disruptive to sleep, sounded like a C-pap.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have been to multiple Airbnb’s with our family, this one was extremely well equipped with everything we needed and more.
Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice place to relax.
Thank you for all the snacks and bottle of wine!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hygge House is a wonderful modern day Walden! Views of serene landscape from from every window; a private deck on the water; simplistic Swedish design; meticulously attended to; comfortable and stylish furnishings and an off the beaten path location make this the perfect weekend retreat to reconnect with family & self. Peaceful morning coffee on the little lake out back and a quick connection to the hustle of Boji out the front door. It has it all in one tiny package of a cabin. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a quick escape back home on the lake.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a FANTASTIC stay here! The house was super cute and cozy and had tons of amenities, which we loved. There was a perfect dock on both the front and back of the house with swimmable water right there. We will definitely be coming back!"

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and great location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was the perfect stay for our little family. Although you could easily fit more than the three of us! It was beautiful being right on the water. We were so close to all the activities we planned on doing.
The house was adorable and had everything we needed for our stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mona was quick to reply. We were in town for a funeral and she was helpful with availability to our family. The house was old but well kept and had a fun 70’s retro vibe. A variety of amenities were provided that we did need but would be great for other guests. Good location to get to spirit lake and okaboji.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay with my husband, toddler, and dog. The location was excellent, only 10 minutes from Marble Beach campground where our other family was staying. Apartment was quiet. Bed was comfortable, kitchen had all of the essentials. There are stairs you have to climb up to the apartment, if that is a factor you need to consider. Greg was extremely prompt and responsive. Overall I am pleased with our stay."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Greg's place hosted our family of 6 nicely. We were a little surprised that it was a second story apartment. The listing stated that it did have stairs, we just didn't realize it was a full flight up into the apartment. It didn't affect our stay, but it might affect someone else who can do a few stairs but not a full flight.
We were just passing through the area, so we didn't use the kitchen for meals and cannot comment on the availability and use of those amenities.
The window air conditioner was not placed, and we didn't need it; I imagine it would get pretty warm in there without it on hot days. We were able to open some of the windows, but the windows are old, and some are difficult or cannot be opened. The ceiling fans were also a great asset.
Greg was also very quick to respond to any inquiries and laid out all the check-in and check-out procedures before our arrival.
I would stay here again and recommend it to others who are capable of doing stairs."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Reasonably price place that is better/cheaper than a hotel. Beds were comfortable.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked a couple nights in Greg’s airnb for my brother. He said it was the best airnb he has ever stayed in, Greg was so kind to him and the surrounding neighbors were always their to help him in anything he needed. It felt like family he said, and would love to be back again! Thank you for taking good care of my brother. Do no think twice to stay here, just do it you won’t regret it!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Dog friendly place for a reasonable price. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking at the Airbnb. This is a second floor unit, and is an older building, so you can hear quite a bit through the walls."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Looks just like the pictures. Greg was very responsive and thoughtful.

It felt spacious and our host provided us with lots to do in the surrounding area. Good times and good pricing ☺️"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had two nights at this location.
I appreciated the safe and quiet neighborhood as well as the nice and helpful neighbors.
The area was having unprecedented hot weather and the a/c was not keeping up to cool the space. It was later in the evening when I arrived but in spite of the time of night, Greg quickly arranged to have an additional portable a/c brought in which made quick work of cooling down the accommodations.
I enjoyed the short walk to Main Street breakfast restaurants. There is a close convenience store and grocery stores not far down the road making food and meals very easy.
I would stay here again when I come back to the Lakes."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This apartment was just what I needed for an over night stay. even when I had an unexpected visit from other family.
The stairs to the apartment are a bit tricky but once up everything was as stated.
I will probably stay again!"

We didn’t even ask, it was a nice surprise! The house has everything you need. The kitchen is full of snacks and little stuff that you need for cooking breakfast (olive oil, spices, a variety of tea, granola bars and even oats and ground cinnamon) makes the stay so much easier and comfortable. We definitely will come back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in the iowa Great Lakes area to attend the Bluewater conference. Gina and Matt's place was a good location from which to drive into Arnolds Park. the unit is above a garage and is quiet, well apportioned, and comfortable. it is also located on the shore of Spirit Lake - while I didn't go down to the shore, I imagine someone with a boat would enjoy the dock facility immensely. Gina
is very responsive and informative."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Visiting Okoboji each summer is one of our family traditions. Matt and Gina’s place can be added to that list.

We easily visited the hubb of Arnold’s Park and West Okoboji by water and enjoyed the quieter lake north of the house near the boat launch. The space was impeccable: stylish, with all the amenities you need. We had forgotten our keurig cups but we’re happy to see some extra there!

Prime location, gorgeous property from every angle, stunning landscaping, attentive hosts, and charming accommodations equipped with everything we needed. It was clear that a lot of time and effort has been spent to make the entire property beautiful and special.

Gina was very accommodating and answered messages quickly. You won't be disappointed!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couples getaway!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Matt & Gina,
This was our first family vacation and our first time staying at an Air BnB. I do not know where to start but I will try and cover it all from beginning to end as it was an amazing time and place to stay. The check in and hospitality was extremely seamless. The instructions provided were spot on. Matt & Gina made us feel comfortable by being a text/phone call away. The first impression was breath taking. Being right on the lake in a newly developed guest loft was one of a kind. Cleanliness, organized, and everything you need right at your fingertips are the first thoughts that come to mind when opening the door to “our home” for the weekend. The pictures do not do this place justice. It is more gorgeous and provides a home away from home feeling! We met Matt & Gina out on the dock as we were taking the amazing lake views in. They made it feel as if we knew them with conversation of hot spots, things to do as a family, and even met their friendly dog. They gave us privacy and comfort knowing we could call them for anything. My family and I woke up Saturday morning and watched the sun rise while sipping on coffee they provided right from the dock. We also used Kayaks they provided. This was our first time Kayaking together while our daughter watched on the dock, taking pictures and enjoying the scenery. We went to Waterfront restaurant that Matt suggested and it was tasty times 10. From the local beer to the steak and topping it off with an amazing smore dessert we were extremely pleased with his recommendation. It was great to come back to a cozy guest loft with a comfy bed to get some much needed zzzzz’s. We will be back annually. We will also recommend this to friends and family for their weekend or week-long getaway. This was an amazing first stay. Matt & Gina have set the bar for future Air BnB stays.
We were honored to have a 5-star weekend because of Matt & Gina,
We will be booking another trip next summer"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, super clean apartment stocked with everything we needed! Awesome to have access to the dock and a patio above the lake. Quite a few stairs to the apt and to the lake to be aware of if climbing stairs is an issue for you."

2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina and Matt are great hosts. The listing is very accurate. It is a nice cozy getaway.

2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay we enjoyed drinking coffee on the dock and kayaking. Just a hop, skip, and a jump to The Barefoot Bar and just a short drive to Arnold's Park area. Space is new, very clean, and cozy. We would definitely stay again."

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Okoboji! We had a great time staying in this guesthouse. It is right on East Lake Okoboji. The guesthouse is beautiful!
It is perfect for a couple, it would be a little tight for more than 2 people.
The only thing I would caution is that someone with walking issues probably wouldn't want to stay here because you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the guesthouse.
Overall I 100% recommend! My husband & I are likely to stay here again."

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and Gina were terrific hosts! They were very accommodating with everything on such short notice of our booking their place. Their home and property was even better than described. It was very welcoming and homey. Having the extra space was very nice to not feel so cramped. The bathroom was very sizable as to easily allow two people to get ready at the same time. The outside area was absolutely beautiful! Although we didn't spend a lot of time there, the time we did was very enjoyable. The use of the kayaks was very exciting for us and made for a lovely afternoon activity on the water. The location was perfect to get away from the crowds, yet close enough to get to everything we wanted to do in a short amount of time.
We would definitely request to book their place again!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is really the perfect location. Close to boat rental, public fishing spots, bars (and grills), live music and night life (jus a short walk down to Broadway Street). This location makes your Boji trip walkable. The place itself was clean and comfortable. Very minimalist, but has everything you need. Comfy bed and covers. Easy access. We had the North Bay unit, which was your own balcony and that was nice. We didn’t use the games or fire pits or BBQ but knowing they’re available is awesome. Sherri has notes posted so you always know you can reach out and what’s available. I would say this is a good area for younger/more active couples or groups looking for easy access to nightlife and things to do. Very well done, would stay again and I’m clearly recommending. 😊"
