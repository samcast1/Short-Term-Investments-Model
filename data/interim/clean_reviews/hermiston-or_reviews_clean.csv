2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The host’s were awesome. The property was clean and well stocked. Close to everything. W 2 bathrooms the place is perfect for traveling workers like myself. The price was incredibly low compared to other properties and hotels. Extremely pleased with my experience. Only regret was not being able to rent it the entire time I was in town because it was booked. Will definitely try to come back if I’m ever back out this way for work or pleasure.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jodi's home exudes an aura of privacy and coziness that instantly envelops you from the moment you step through the front door. It's not just a place to stay; it's an experience that leaves you inspired and rejuvenated. Every detail is meticulously arranged to make you feel like you belong there, fostering a sense of comfort and security unlike any other. As someone new to Airbnb, this stay has set the bar impossibly high, leaving me with an unwavering certainty that hotels will never compare to the thoughtful and accommodating haven that Jodi has created. It's not just a place to rest your head; it's a sanctuary that leaves a lasting impression.
Thank you a trillion,

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was excellent, very clean. My only quibble is that I had arranged to meet someone to put my bags inside prior to their normal check-in. After waiting for 45 minutes, I had to leave for an event. As a result, my laptop had to stay in my car while I attended the event (there was no other option). If I had know this might happen I would have left my laptop at home. The car was parked in a public (and unattended) lot for about 8 hours. Fortunately it was not stolen. It would have caused a serious hardship if it had been. I was put at risk by the lack of follow-through. Again, this is my only reason it is rated 4, not 5."

Our grandsons were able to play in Ryan's large grassy field, enjoying some dirt and a big climbing toy. They even got see chickens and friendly cats like they have at home.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was the third time staying with Ryan and we couldn’t be happier.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Air BNB is a little gem in the country side. The peaceful setting will force you to relax.
Everything about this place was perfect for our family of 3 + 2 dogs. It's simple, modern, and peaceful.
A perfect get away.
The property is extremely secure and secluded. We left our cars unlocked without thinking twice about it... it is that secure.
Ryan and family are super awesome; Extremely attentive and responsive; and they made us feel right at home.
There are some house rules, this place is in the country and the country is not kind to nice things... and this is a nice place.
Getting to the site could be confusing if you do not read the instructions provided, but once you get there you'll really appreciate just how secluded it is from everything else. It's still only 5 minutes away from stores and restaurants, and Hermiston surprisingly has a good selection of local and chained restaurants to pick from.
PS. At night, don't forget to look up at the stars."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,By far our best Airbnb stay! Ryan was an amazing guest and went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed and we’re comfortable. Would 100% stay again.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location and a great host. Ryan was very kind and helpful. That being said It is a great get away for a vacation but not great for a business get away. The electric outlets were very weak taking much more time to charge any devices than normal and the wi-fi was barely usable…although ryan said he was going to improve that soon. All in all as a simple get away stay this would be amazing. The full kitchen and incredible attention to detail with their cleaning was above and beyond. Great spot!

The plentiful natural wood and old-west aesthetic are charming, and the incredibly high ceilings give it an airy feel. Everything was sparkling clean and well maintained. If you're looking for a country feel, with open fields outside your window and plenty of privacy, this is your place. It met our every expectation and we would gladly stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location, secluded but still conveniently close to town and the highway. Plenty of space for our dog to run around to wear her out before the drive home."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Awesome place to stay. Description matches exactly what is available.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is very comfortable and clean! Just a few of the perks:
- My husband, who is straight out of the Goldilocks story and hates almost every bed on earth, was comfortable on the bed.
- There is a large grassy area for pets to do their thing. Please note that if you do not have good voice control they should stay on leash - while there is a fence, it is not completely fenced, and there is a good amount of wildlife (plus the chickens) on the property.
- The wildlife is also a perk - we saw quail, hawk, and some feral kittens... no, you don't get to keep the kittens.
- The AC worked great and kept the interior very comfortable in 110+ degree heat!
Some things to know:
- The water is from a well, and for the first few moments of running, it has a smell. This dissipates quickly and the water tasted fine. If you are sensitive to water in new areas, there is plenty of storage area on the counter for bottled water.
- If you bring dogs, be nice to Ryan and bring some poop bags :)
- Be sure to follow the detailed instructions for getting there, they were very helpful.
- There is a grocery store about five minutes away, so do not worry if you forgot anything."

We really appreciated the space in the driveway for our truck and all of our gear and we felt very safe and well taken care of.
The Wifi rocks and the fresh eggs are dynamite in the morning while watching the chicken do their thing out the back window.

Ryan was very responsive and helpful throughout our entire stay, which was very appreciated. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay short term in the Hermiston area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan’s place is an apartment built in to a large barn. It’s clean and comfortable. Plenty of parking, great driveway if you’re pulling a trailer! There’s a patio with a view of a chicken coop and the sunset; both were entertaining. Ryan was around the property and was a friendly and interesting host. We had a great time. Plus, free eggs."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tanya’s place was very clean and comfortable! We appreciated Tanya’s thoughtfulness of having available shampoo, condition, and lotion as well as spices, cooking oil, and a wide variety of kitchen utensils/necessities available for us to stay in and cook meals rather than eating out daily on our trip. We did not run into any issues during our stay which we attribute to having a well organized home where everything was labeled, including which light switches went to which lights!
Overall the home was very clean, peaceful, and organized! We would definitely stay here again and recommend others to stay here as well!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean home with lots of space. Every time I made contact with the host ( Tanya) she is quick to respond via texting and the times I had to call she did answer the phone. Loved the comfortable home in a nice neighborhood.

The house is beautiful and had everything we needed for an extended stay. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived. Tanya was very helpful and responsive and had the thoughtfulness of having both thanksgiving and Christmas decorations available. My daughters loved that and we highly recommend this Airbnb for either short or long term stays.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for a weekend in Echo/Hermiston. The host was great with communication. The extra touches like muffins and donuts and water bottles were appreciated. We would stay at the house again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I stayed at the townhouse for a little over 3 weeks due to construction on our home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The townhouse was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. I had to contact Saira a few times and it was almost an instant response. She is very kind and we highly recommend staying at this location. The only few downfalls we noticed while staying was that there was no mop to clean the floors. But for a shorter stay I probably wouldn’t have needed to mop the floors. And due to the limited parking we weren’t always able to park on the street in front of the house. We had to park down the street. But that wouldn’t detour us away from booking this house again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The townhouse was nice place to stay, clean, had everything it and comfortable for our family. lots of room for the 6 of us to stay. It was nice to come to a home and not a motel room. We enjoyed it."

This place is very cozy and homey and has almost everything you would need. The only thing that I wish they had was cleaning products (wipes, sponge to do dishes, etc)
Saira was great to communicate with any questions I had and responded quickly.

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was nice and clean.
Saira was very nice and communicated well.
We stayed a month during the winter so we had the heat on a lot. the downstairs does not heat up well and stays a little chilly.
There was a big snow storm while we were there and no snow shovel on the property. That made things a little challenging.

However, we couldn't resist a walk to the river, park, corn maze and pumpkin patch. The sagebrush, willows and Russian olives in the area reminded us of Fallon, Nevada and American Falls, Idaho. Magpies, Kingfishers, doves, chicadees, and nuthatches were right there in the trees on Linda's place. Her beautiful cottage and gardens were like a little time capsule from bygone days. Thank you Linda, for providing all the comforts and extra amenities. We would love to stay with you again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was very pretty, had a nice shower, handy washer/dryer if one needs it (we didn’t), creatively unique loft, larger than the listing photos appear. clean, spacious living area. The neighborhood surroundings are rural, lots of old items around, hard to know where property ends and begins, but no one around to wag a finger when walking my dog. The home dogs were barky welcoming. Would stay again, and for longer as a nice retreat."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed one night on a drive from Seattle to Boise. Very cozy and relaxing. As described and everything worked. It’s an above-garage studio apartment with windows and skylights. You cannot beat it for value — you certainly couldn’t stay in a hotel for this price! :-)

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great, my wife and I are from Ontario and had a friend that lived in a similar place. It was a little piece of home."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Linda's place. It had everything we needed including air conditioning on a very hot weekend. She had lots of snacks available and even left us fresh fruit! It was a great, quite private place close to town with easy access to the highway. I recommend it! Great spot to attend the Pendleton Round Up with a short 25 min drive. Our only wish was that we had time to try out the Echo Ridge winery while we were there. Next time!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"From the comfy log furniture bed to the many choices of ramen, I felt like a valued guest in Linda’s sweet retreat. My only regret is that I was there for a work trip and didn’t get to linger. I was able to feed the darling little squirrels before I left. Squirrel food was provided:)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda’s place was the perfect place to stay while attending the Round Up.

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Linda was so kind in showing us where her spot was, was a little hard to find in the dark. Get there before dark if you can. Appreciated the amenities. Some of the dishes were a little unclean and we found some crumbs were on the floor, but overall enjoyed the hospitality. Was very easy with my dog, too! Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place!! This was our last stop on a long trip and it was everything we needed. So clean, everything that you could need is there, the host had great communication and check in was easy! We would stay again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay. The apartment was cute, clean and cozy."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a rural location on a small farm…..nice landscape, farm experience and very hospitable host. Located conveniently to interstate. Do note the directions on paper, as we were not able to get either cell or phone service to find our way. Unit did have Wi-Fi and Netflix. Unit is spacious and comfortable. Interestingly, the host offers to prepare a meal at a reasonable cost and this was a plus as we had a long day driving, didn’t have groceries and would have had to drive for a meal….good home cooking."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect little spot for a break from the monotony of the interstate yet extremely convenient (just a few minutes away) at the same time. Everything I needed was there and the room was ready at very short notice with a comfortable bed, hot shower, and equipped kitchen."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda is a great host. She raises a few animals (Pigs, cattle, chickens) that we enjoyed. The rooster provided an alarm clock that was fun for us. Linda's place had everything we needed, and we hope to visit again when we can stay for more than for one night."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda is sweet and the apartment is clean and tidy. Located on a cute farm by the Umatilla river. I have stayed here twice.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful little spot by the creek in a quiet neighborhood. Drove through during a moving trip, and the host was super accommodating with parking on property with a trailer. The living space was nice and cozy, even on a warmer afternoon. Would definitely recommend!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great stay! Loved the new piglets right outside the door, made for great entertainment while sipping coffee on the cute lil balcony! Such a quiet, serene and private spot. So many great things to say. The attention to the little details made this place a gem, like tampons in the bathroom, a lovely coffee maker stocked with cream in the fridge, superb towels and linens, great bed and tv stocked with all the apps. We’ll be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place! Had some great wine within walking distance. Location was perfect for us.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful. Linda was a perfect host - communicative but not intrusive, the accommodations were clean, well-supplied, comfortable, with the added bonus of fantastic water pressure in the shower. The location is private but very close to everything we needed access to for the Red to Red bike race my son participated in. Thank you!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Awesome location and very friendly host. Made us feel at home and was cool to be in a loft overlooking the River nearby! Would stay again

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Airbnb was cozy. It had lots of windows which my cats loved. This was the only Airbnb we stayed at that my cats would actually relax and sleep. I would definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in the area.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little oasis in quaint Echo, OR. Quiet and charming place. Awesome location and value!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay; this is a little home away from home, thoughtfully arranged. Very comfortable bed and plenty of amenities. Linda is a superb hostess, anticipating needs and went above and beyond to mail my pillow that I’d accidentally left behind. The little town of Echo has small American charm with the railroad and river running through it. There’s a small dog park along the river just across the way. Recommend H & P Cafe, just a block away, where I received very friendly service and a delicious patty melt. This is a perfect little bnb."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an amazing time! Very clean and well decorated property in an awesome setting. Linda made the checkin process seamless and was very helpful. Would 100% recommend for anyone in the area.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a little slice of heaven for a solo traveler
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The studio is a wonderful space to escape! its tucked away at the end of a gravel drive - don't let that surprise you! The space is beautiful, and has everything you need! The bed is amazingly comfy, and we loved hearing the train go through once. The pigs are adorable and Linda is so accommodating and easy to communicate with!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Homey, lovely, little farmhouse with a great view and a cute little all American town nearby."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great overnight stay at Linda's. The place was peaceful, very clean, much larger than we expected and there were lots of extras that we weren't expecting. We only stayed overnight on our way to Montana but the town of Echo was cute and when we went to get breakfast to go all of the locals were super friendly and said hello as we waited for our order outside with our dogs. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda’s cottage was fantastic! We loved the quiet location. It is within walking distance to two wineries.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed every aspect of staying at this lovely place. Linda guided me to the room when I arrived late in the evening. The room was very nice, and the location was fantastic. Linda was a terrific host."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious studio, and a very comfortable bed.
I was getting in late and Linda was flexible about my arrival time, and made sure I knew extra details to find my way."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice apartment on a beautiful property, hope to stay for longer next time!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay as we stopped on our road trip! The apartment is cute and clean, and the farm is beautiful. It is in a great location not too far off the highway and very close to two wonderful wineries that are fun to check out."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets I have ever seen! The rich history of this town is worth the consideration, and our short stay was wonderful. Host Linda was communicative and super friendly. I was here with my roommate and kids but I hope to stay again with my fiancé the next time we pass through."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice cozy farm stay with the ability to cook and prep our own food, exactly what we were looking for. Cute, cozy, clean and comfortable.
Thanks!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy apartment was a great stay for checking out all Echo has to offer. Linda and her family were helpful and accommodating. We had a relaxing weekend on their farm.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very homey place. We loved our time here!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was lovely. The property is beautiful and comfortable.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little place! We loved the comfortable setup above the garage, the comfy bed, the occasional sounds of the farm and the train horn. This is the sort of place that Airbnb was made for, in my opinion – a cool little space on a private property that I wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to experience, and at a good price. We arrived during a heat wave, so it was hot when we got there, but a few hours with the window-mounted a/c and a fan made a big difference, and we slept comfortably. I'd happily stay there again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the stay. The home is comfortable and quiet. There are animal sounds but the a.c. helps with that and it keeps the place cool. The stars were also a great addition and you can see them from the skylight above the bed at night. The hot water works really well. We explored the local area and went into Pendleton too which was fun. There are a lot of museums and the woolen mill was a cool place to visit. There's a casino a few miles east of Pendleton which has stuff for the kids and a movie theater that's inexpensive. We want to come back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s studio apartment on her little farm was the perfect place to stop with my 3 dogs after a long day of driving. The apartment was very clean, spacious, and had all of the amenities one could ask for. The pups had a blast walking down to the river before sundown and then in the morning when they were able to run around the yard and play with Linda’s adorable farm dog. The town of Echo was very quiet as I left early but my coffee cake and latte from the local coffee shop was delicious. My only complaint is I wish I could have stayed longer!"
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Linda was very kind. Conversation with her was great while staying at a very rural town. Echo is a place where you could hear loud sounds of trains and chickens. Pest issue was present due to the place's agricultural setting, which seemed inevitable. The room was very spacious."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was quaint, wholesome and safe. It literally is a little working farm (with farm animals) which we loved. Be prepared for the little insects & critters that come around including the smells. It felt like a scene from the story Charlotte's Web. The place was quiet but every so often you would here the train pass by. The airbnb is located upstairs about 17 stairs incase for anybody that have a difficult time climbing. We visited the pigs they're so cute. Linda told us upon arrival to feel free and let her now if we need anything she would accommodate us. My husband, son and I really enjoyed staying at that airbnb. Linda was a great host. We highly recommend this place. Sincerely, the Duran family."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"So quiet and tranquil with cows, chickens, and pigs nearby. The “start” button on the window a/c unit is all the way to the right FYI!"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Staying here felt like we were stopping overnight at a distant relative’s place in the country. The pros are that Linda was nice enough, she let us walk her property and it was pretty laid back. The cons are that it was as clean as you’d expect for a casual overnight at your great aunt’s house who has better things to do than clean. Which, I totally get, its just not my preference for lodging. The couch/pull out bed really shouldn’t be listed as a sleeping space as it’s very old and uncomfortable, even for smaller people (our kids). My 13yo son ended up sleeping on the floor instead. Side note- If you wake up to train horns, you’ll wake up around three times during the night. It sounds like this place has been a great fit for a lot of people, unfortunately it wasn’t for us."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were happy with everything. It was a no frills stay at a great price and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It’s on a ranch, which is really beautiful. Expect bugs in the room and animals, including roosters, making noise very early."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place with all the necessary amenities. good wifi, washer and dryer, full kitchen, comfortable bed"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Cute little stay for a night!
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable bed. In country and difficult to find place for dinner. Quiet.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This rental is a private apartment on a working ranch. It gives you the feel of country living right in a small town with all the smells, flies, and insects usually associated with a farm. There was plenty of hot water and a porch to sit on."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable and clean guesthouse on second floor over the garage/storage area. It is so very quiet and peaceful only being interrupted by the sound of chickens, hens and an occasional rooster crowing.
Surrounded by pastures and shade trees, very few houses.
A small fridge is available for storing water, drinks and snacks. A small range and microwave for preparing snacks or food.
Television for viewing though we didn’t use it.
A pleasant and comfortable one night stay on our trip. Local coffeehouse was great. Restaurant was closed due to the extraordinary heat wave. Over 115 degrees."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super comfortable bed, deluxe shower head, full size washer and dryer and a welcoming host."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little place! I will definitely recommend.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, if you want to play the golf course in Echo."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A over the garage suite with stairs leading up, very comfortable and nicely appointed. The location is on the edge of a small community so very quiet for a great nights sleep. We’ll stay again when in the area."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and comfortable!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best night sleep in a “year”. I’m not exaggerating. It’s a big private space for sleeping,eating and relaxing. I left my makeup bag in the bathroom and the host called me right away so I was able to backtrack and pick it up. Overall I highly recommend Linda’s place."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a great find! A cozy little spot with everything we needed. Great geology books, comfortable bed, train and animal sounds. And a short walk to wine tasting and coffee!"
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Great communications with Linda and a beautiful spot. But it was a 92 degree day and there was no air conditioner installed (even though her listing says there is air conditioning), so it was very uncomfortable until early in the morning."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! Linda was absolutely the best host. The guest cottage was darling and the bed was very comfy! We would DEFINITELY stay there again, the town of Echo is super cute. We really enjoyed our meal at the little cafe in town - great food and great hometown service!! One thing to note is that this is a 2nd floor unit, there are stairs to get to it - just in case you can't do stairs. Thanks so much, Linda!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay on Linda’s farm. Our kids loved the animals and the river.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious and packed with amenities. Echo is adorable and Linda is a peach.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house with lots of animals. My granddaughter loved the twin baby goats
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time here and hope to go back some day. It was so refreshing to be out in the country. I enjoyed the river view, the goats, pigs, chickens, and cows. The dining options are limited in Echo but the drive to Stanfield is short."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property and bnb are absolutely gorgeous!! And the host is so friendly and kind, we will definitely plan trips here in the future with them!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property is absolutely beautiful!!! I loved how roomy the guest suite feels and the natural lighting from the sky lights!! I would definitely visit again!!
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Hospitality and a wonderful setting.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely and private. Peaceful. On clear nights stargaze under skylight
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Came to Echo for a wedding and Linda’s property was perfect location! Charming studio was spacious, bright and comfortable for my kids and I. We were given a tour of the grounds by Liv, who introduced us to the baby goats, chicks and piglets. I’m so glad I found Linda’s place and would definitely recommend and stay again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can expect a charming comfortable space, with treats in the fridge, a Keurig coffee machine, quality shampoos, conditioners etc...and if you are lucky, you will get to hold a baby chick too!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect stop on a long road trip. It is exactly what I think AirBnB should be, an additional space to share with travelers. Linda was so helpful when I got lost. My son loved exploring the farm and the river. And the homecooked dinner was delicious."
2021-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Linda was nice enough but the place was very unclean outside and in, dog pee inside on the floor and unclean sheets. Cigarettes on the steps, and an unsupervised toddler who came up to the door. The River view was pleasant, but even then there wasn’t really a path to get down there. Would not recommend unfortunately."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s guest suite was great, it was plenty of space and a big comfortable bed for 2. The kitchenette was perfect for cooking up breakfast and the space had great natural light in the morning with all the skylights. We also loved meeting the little piglets and their friendly moms in the morning."
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Pass.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful property with sun-drenched loft and windows looking out over it all, including views of the river from the deck. A really special place. Grateful to have found this spot and to have stayed here."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a fantastic place to stay, whether you're just making a stop or whether you're making this your destination. It's very cozy, and has everything you need. I would love to come back to this place."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a cozy place and extremely fast internet speed. It’s in a rural setting, and definitely a plus to be able to see cows from the windows. It’s a great value for the price."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s place is very convenient from the highway and was a great place to stop over to break up a trip. If you can, try to leave some extra time to explore the very quaint little town. The communication with Linda was excellent and her responsiveness to questions was very fast."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little place to take a rest from the road! We were so happy with the beds, the shower, and the washer and dryer."
2021-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location right off of I-84 if you're traveling through. It's all you really need for one night. However, it's right next to train tracks, and the train rolls through often - even in the middle of the night."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome spot. Cute room in a cute town and was exactly where I needed to stop on my road trip. It was perfect :)

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in the country but within a couple of blocks of restaurants and downtown of the little town of Echo. Nice quiet place... well, other than hearing an occasional train. Definitely looking forward to staying at Linda's place again."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great option and super comfortable. We really really enjoyed our stay. Light sleepers won’t appreciate the proximity to trains, but as a light sleeper I got plenty of sleep."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great space on a really nice ranch. Very comfortable bed and the room is enjoyable to stay in. Definitely recommend it for people passing through the area or looking for a peaceful getaway.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s comfy. It’s on a beautiful farm and you wake up to roosters crowing and cows mooing!! It’s cozy with lots of windows for the sun to stream in. Has all the basic amenities needed for a comfy stay!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was doing some hiking in Eastern Oregon and I wanted a place near the highway to crash, this was so much better! The space was so lovely and clean and beautiful. The bed was amazing and everything was cozy. I really enjoyed my stay!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was just what we needed on a long drive: comfy, a small kitchen, and reliable wifi for work while traveling. Would stay here again!"
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I couldn’t find it. There’s a nearby place with a similar address. It turns out this place is on a farm and down a long dirt road. The address is not visible from the main road. Host refunded me though, and was very polite."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot. Looking forward to coming back.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was really great. We had a little difficulty finding it in the dark but we called Linda and she was a great help.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is second floor space over a garage and is a delightful make-over. We loved hearing the roosters crowing in the mornings, the sounds of farm-related activity, and the horns of passing trains, and yet it seemed quiet and secluded; away from it all."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very nice place with full kitchen and comfy bed. Quiet and peaceful with farm land all around. I woke up refreshed, enjoyed a nice walk after coffee. Linda made me feel welcomed and comfortable."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A quaint little town set out in the country. Great little farm that Linda has carved out a studio above the garage. A real sweet find. Stay two.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Linda’s AirBnB above her detached garage.
The place has all you need, comfortable bed, private bath, Keurig coffee maker, mini fridge, kitchen sink, stove and even a washer and dryer! The place is very roomy with a sitting area and a dining table.
We would stay again!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A quaint space in a quaint town in the middle of the COVID crisis. We wanted to get out for a birthday weekend and found this little gem of a spot right in downtown Echo. We were able to walk to breakfast and a winery for afternoon tastings. There is a little park, a few eateries, and two wineries within easy walking. With COVID, we were glad to find a spot that was all to ourselves.
Only downsides: had to wash our own dishes before use (dirty in dishwasher), and no response from our host till the morning we left, which made ""check-in"" difficult (which she apologized for). Thanks for the peaceful get away, Linda!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A really pretty farm and a comfortable studio. We enjoyed our overnight stay!
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a peaceful, bucolic, and well-maintained space on a working farm. Beautiful countryside and a great host! Sounds of roosters and birds rather than traffic and hotel vacuums. It was a peaceful oasis away from my work day and I think travelers will enjoy this green little area of Echo, Oregon. Linda leaves interesting books about the area and is very available to answer questions or give recommendations. Would love to stay there again!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda’s place is warm & cozy! There’s an outside flight of stairs to get to the apartment with good railings and sturdy steps. Linda was a great communicator and everything was clean and comfortable during our stay.
The location is ideal for a stopover between Boise and the Seattle area.
We arrived at dinner time on a Sunday and had a great dinner at the Broken Barrel in Stanfield - a little way past the railroad tracks from Linda’s.
We will definitely stay here again and give ourselves some time to explore Echo and the river."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is the perfect place for a couple to get away from city and enjoy some peace and quiet. The farm animals wre always fun! There is a small river on the property that you can access from the house, which was a nice bonus for us, because we love to fish! The place was clean and had everything we needed. The communication was great and Linda even offered up her fishing pole. There is a small grocery store a few minutes away and a larger city another 5 or 10 minutes from there. We would stay again if we are passing through that way."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,She went above and beyond in accommodating me.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my first experience with AirBnB and had no choice since the Hotels in the area were full. During my stay I decided that will never go to a hotel again but instead will visit local homes wherever I go. It is so fun to see the care and effort local people put in making our stay a pleasant one. And pleasant it was. Will definitively come again.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a quick one-night stay before heading further East towards the Wallowas and Linda’s place was great! So cozy and warm during the cold night and the log bed was super comfy. There’s a coffee shop within walking distance which was perfect for starting up another long drive. Would definitely recommend!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can enjoy a taste of rural farm life at the edge of wine, wheat and cowboy culture blended with simple and practical comforts here. Expect to climb the stairs with your bags, and kick away a stray leaf or twig blown out of the lovely pines and shade trees, but inside all is quiet and restful, even the trains passing the edge or town is easy-sounding out on the prairie."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You cannot go wrong with booking this home. It's in a quiet area and within walking distance of *everything*. People in Echo are friendly and the town is gorgeous.

Thanks for everything!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda's place was wonderful. We were only able to stay for one night, but it was lovely. We walked to 2 wineries and still made it back in time for my husband to test out the fishing on the property. We definitely plan on staying again and hope to take a swim. Linda was a great host and went out of her way to get decaf coffee for me and leant her fishing gear. Wonderful"

They allowed us for an earlier check in time and told us ahead of time what amenities to bring from home ahead of time since it’s a newer airbnb! The place was super clean and matched the listing.

I will start with the positives, bed was comfortable, couch in Livingroom was comfortable, access to netflix was helpful. it is a cute home. not even real negatives, the lock wasn't something I have used before so getting in initially was a little struggle but host was quick to respond to help get in. Wish we would have taken advantage of the back yard space a bit with the fire pit (propane) but it was windy both nights."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s was amazing! Will be booking in the future when I’m back in town!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy house! Very comfortable, has everything you need, and more, for an enjoyable stay. Within a few blocks there are restaurants, two bakeries, a food cart pod, a Bi-Mart store, and downtown Hermiston as well. We really liked this Airbnb!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is fine. We were in town for business for three days. We were really only in the house to sleep. We got in late and out early. One bummer was the cable TV. Actually lack of it. It’s a Roku tv so no local anything. Also. The welcome book says there are many subscription services to choose from. That is true. But. You have to have your own subscriptions to view any kind of content at all. That’s really my only complaint as the Seahawks were on Monday night football and it really took a bit to finally get to watch them. ON MY PHONE. Not the nice tv the house had.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet house. Very clean and comfortable
Loved our stay"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, I hope to be back some time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very easy place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in a perfect location for our visit with family just a few blocks away. We had to leave the area at 4PM for a graduation and Amber allowed us to check-in early so we could get changed and checked in.
This is a small but very clean, comfortable and well equipped home. There were four of us, three females and one male (my poor husband) and the home size worked just fine for us. The bathroom is tiny but was no problem for us. The home is centerally located so restaurants, grocery and entertainment are just minutes away.
Overall, we did enjoy our stay and would reserve again when in the area.."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Last minute trip and Shaun was able to accommodate us. Just what we needed, very peaceful place, quiet. Close to many restaurants. Excellent stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and friendly hosts! It was nice using the August app to get into the home. Quick and easy!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for 28 days. We were very happy with the host’s flexibility in allowing early check in at 11am. This small home has been recently painted and well decorated. The kitchen is a bit small and the absence of a vent hood for the stove caused issues when cooking, leaving lingering smells. The living room, unfortunately has an extremely uncomfortable futon couch that required us to use 6 pillows just to tolerate it for short periods while we watched tv. The bedrooms had comfy mattresses and one of the rooms has a TV. Our biggest issue with this property was that we felt as though the listing pictures of the bathroom weren’t accurate. It is very small, walking straight in you easily swipe the sink and doorknob at the same time with your body. Additionally the shower is smaller than an RV shower, with an odor coming from the drain.
We did experience a delayed response from our host towards the end of our stay, when the door lock code stopped working and we were locked out temporarily"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,You will not regret staying here!The home itself is full of small details that make it perfect ! It’s super clean and easy to access with the digital lock makes it ideal no missing keys. It has a cozy backyard.The location is perfect and it’s a safe neighborhood.Personally we all loved the selection of teas available and Alexa makes it so easy to do any requests.
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber and Shaun were very pleasant to deal with and took my reservation on very short notice due to a family emergency. Communication with them was easy and they were very quick to respond. The house was in great proximity to where I needed to go and was in a great location for restaurants, stores, etc. The house is very quaint and was extremely clean. There were added little touches like a variety of Tazo teas, honey sticks, herbs, spices, etc. There is a large choice of dvds, reliable Wifi, an Alexa as well as many other things to make your stay pleasant. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the shower was very helpful and saved me on having to pack anything extra. The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows.
This is obviously out of their control but the neighbors to the back of the house and to the side of the backyard have a dog that they allow to bark for extended periods of time, early morning and evening as well. I noticed quite a few little caterpillars in the kitchen and near the front door and relocated them outside the front door. When I opened the front door there were quite a few caterpillars out there and obviously where they were coming in from. The ""sofa bed"" that is listed is really not what I would consider to be a sofa bed and was extremely uncomfortable. I am only 5'4"" but if a tall person were trying to sleep on it, they would have a difficult time. Besides the sofa in the living room there are two chairs that were just okay and positioned in a way that if there were more than one or two people it would be uncomfortable and difficult to watch the TV.
I would definitely stay there again should the need come up."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! We loved the clean house, beautiful colors and great layout of the rooms. Did I mention the beautiful colors? The colors and textures were inspiring, happy and peaceful. The bathroom was small but manageable. I personally loved the many lighting options and the soft, warmly lit lanterns in the kids’ bedroom.
The master bedroom with the TV was very tranquil with the adorable baby plants and water images. Wifi was easy with the beautiful ceramic wifi sign. So many details made our stay accommodating, from the coasters on the coffee table to the cup and plating options in plastic (for the kids) and ceramic (for the adults). Loved having a large-capacity coffee maker and the washer and dryer were so delightful with their sing-song end of cycle alert. Overall, the house was quiet, clean and private, not to mention centrally located. All of us felt relaxed coming home to it at the end of the day. It was a great option for us and we will stay here again if we visit Hermiston in the future! Thank you Amber and Shaun!
Cheers,
Victoria & Mario

Although we didn't get a chance to use the hot tub, it was a nice option to have available. Overall, a very pleasant stay."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall nice place. It was weird with neighbors being so close in the back to back patio and sliding glass door. When they are in their kitchen they look right at you. No privacy and had to keep curtains shut. Also thrown off by offering an additional room (master) not available when we reserved the house and asking for more money to use it. But overall we did enjoy our stay at the house.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly what I was looking for when in town for a work trip. It was clean, comfortable, and had every amenity that I wanted. Having a home gym was a great touch."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Darren’s Home was absolutely wonderful. We mostly communicated with his co-host Nicole, but both were lovely, professional, and easy to get ahold of. We travelled here for the halfway point to our destination. The home was extremely clean with a plethora of amenities. The hot tub was incredible - fit all 4 of us, and again, extremely clean! Our bed was so comfortable, hot shower, nice bathroom. As far as communications went - they gave us all the information we needed and were very helpful and accommodating!

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was simple and clean. The perfect “home base” as we visited family for a wedding. I saw some reviews about being plain/lacking in decor but as someone with little kids, the less there is to touch or potentially break the better. We would love to stay again in the future."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-furnished place in a fairly quiet subdivision. hosts were fast to respond. All of the amenities were there, except for the body wash, but they were apologetic when we mentioned it.
Unfortunately, the house needed some work in terms of hygiene. There was garbage left over in the kitchen and laundry room trash cans and the window jambs were covered in very thick dust, which was pretty gross to see. There was also a half open box of waffles left in the freezer.
Also, the host had a package delivered while we were there, which was kind of weird. We didn’t know what to do with it, so we just left it on the porch but we didn’t like feeling responsible for somebody else’s mail.
Overall it was fine, but it didn’t feel like the typical super host experience. I think with a deep clean and a little more attention to finishing the cleaning job before check-in would make a huge difference."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We came for my daughter's birthday to be close with family and it was the perfect location and the space was exactly what we needed!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Darren was very responsive to an issue with the AC on the first day. He and the owner had the AC repaired right away. This was greatly appreciated as it was over 100°. There were other issues regsrding cleanliness in the kitchen and bedroom.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Boyd's House is such a cool story. When a beloved local leader passed, the city bought the property and turned it into an Airbnb ""So you can enjoy the views."" It's really big and open, the couches are very comfortable, and it has the biggest TV I've ever seen in a vacation rental.
But the view of the Columbia River is what it's all about. That and the sky. So beautiful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice view and amenities!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a slight delay in getting into the property we were quite happy with the house. Very clean, modern appliances, amazing location.
Only things that could have been better were the lack of cable TV, we needed to steam to watch the playoff sports in the evening. Also all the propane tanks for the BBQ were empty."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great access to the Columbia River.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay, good host, and close to the water!"
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"City contact indicated that they (City) took care of cleaning, even stating we could leave dirty dishes on the table if we wished.
Cleaning also included laundry (towels and sheets).
Housekeeping portion of nightly fee was stated as $140 per night.
If that were the case, would highly recommend.
However, one of first signs we see on the wall is “checkout instructions”. Says to do your dishes and laundry before leaving.
Not sure why we would be charged $140 when we do significant cleaning on our end.
In talking to a couple people wondering if our slight dissatisfaction was warranted, both responded that the cleaning fee amount is an issue with airbnb.🤷‍♂️"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful home. Clean , Spacious and comfortable. , thanks for the great experience, Scott Luna OMalley Brothers Corporation"

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place right by the boat launch. We had a great trip in large part to this great location.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was clean. Checkin was smooth. The house was huge for our parties of six. We did not utilize the back porch as there were lots of bugs in the evening. Not the homeowner fault.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! It was a perfect location and size for us as we were visiting family in Hermiston. We were able to sleep all 6 of us comfortably and our family was able to come and visit all in one place. We had everything we needed to cookout, wash clothes and play games. It overlooks the Columbia River and has amazing sunset views. It's quiet and walking distance to the water, soccer games and large fields for kids to play. Couldn't have asked for a better place for our weeklong adventure! Thank you!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was great! We stayed there 6 nights and had everything we needed (kitchen supplies, laundry, A/C, multiple TVs when the kids couldn't agree, great outdoor space, really nice BBQ). We took the kids down to the swimming area a few times and they loved that too. Only hiccup was the deadbolt was locked so we couldn't get in via the code and the outside garbage was full from last renters and very stinky in the heat. Minors things we overcame. Everyone we interacted with regarding the rental was really nice and helpful though."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. The home was clean and comfortable for everyone.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Well equiped kitchen. Lots of couches.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic location, large and comfortable with lots of amenities and outdoor space that really can't be beat for the area. Loved it! Rental photos are a very good representation of the house...but the beauty of the river location really can't be captured without seeing it in person. Would stay again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There is a lot of history in this house and we are all touched by the story of Mr. Boyd, My children and I were so honored to be here!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay here. Quiet clean house. Nice new neighborhood. We sat out on the back patio every night. Saira was very responsive in answering all of our questions. Would stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ve stayed in AirBnB all over the world. This home was an exceptional find. Close to entertainment, great restaurants, and in a peaceful neighborhood. We really cannot decide what its best features were because it was so great. The kitchen has a beautiful flow with a coffee machine at your fingertips. The bedrooms are ample size with the bathrooms just as accommodating. Some bonuses were; backyard outdoor sitting, comfortable wrap around couch, laundry room, and the use of the garage. It was easy to check in and check out. It was worth the full price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed for a week and had a very relaxing time. Everything we needed was provided for. We were able to cook, wash clothes, and spend time resting in the fenced in backyard when we weren’t busy with our family reunion. The house was located very conveniently to where we needed to be. The beds were very comfortable and it was great having two bathrooms! We would definitely recommend Saira’s place to anyone needing a place to stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was having my vehicle detailed at Expert Auto Detailing a short walk, The neighborhood looks pretty new and very walkable. Just a regular family neighborhood, I'm 1 Dude and I just need a place to RELAX & ENJOY Peaceful and beautiful surroundings & I also Enjoyed the OUTSIDE SPACE!!!
I got the downtime I needed and it was just a beautiful experience all the way around for me"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely felt at home! Super Clean and close to stores and coffee shops.
Muffins and welcome card was a special touch 😊"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely spotless. Brand new house.
Everything was perfect for us. Thank you Saira. Definitely will stay again.."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"For being hermiston, it’s nice to have a choice of a house rather than a hotel. They had water bottles in the fridge for us upon arrival which is greatly appreciated. It was a bit chilly in the mornings & evenings so having the fireplace was great.
When getting to the house, the gps hasn’t picked it up yet so make sure you follow her instructions and go around the bend. It stops at the beginning of the neighborhood and won’t get you quite there.
Little things that would’ve been nice are having the towels in the bathrooms so you don’t forget and have the awkward walk to the laundry room. Some extra pillows would’ve been great, & when we came in, if your sensitive like I am, there was a bunch of these plug in scents and it was way too much.
Outside of that the stay is nice. Also worth noting, she does charge an early check in fee if you need it. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs and I’ve never had to pay to get early access. So that was kind of a bummer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a long stay, and this really felt like a second home. Very comfortable, clean and welcoming. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we've stayed here, and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again. That pretty much says it all!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was fun staying in a brand new, sparkling clean, nicely decorated house.
Saira left us delicious desert bread and was very nice and accommodating. I was afraid to book it because it was so new that it had no reviews but after communicating with Saira I went ahead and booked. We were very glad we did. We will definitely come back again if in the area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was clean and comfortable. Muffins and danishes were waiting for us, plus lots of bottled water in the fridge, which was an awesome touch!
The only thing I would tell someone wanting to rent the house is to bring your own pillows. Also, there aren’t any extra pillows. Other than that, it was very nice!"

Having a yard was great for the dog, and the house was very clean. Definitely recommend the restaurant right around the corner, which had some surprisingly great food! Would recommend the Airbnb."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"With large bedrooms, a well-stocked kitchen, and comfortable seating in the kitchen and living room, Tara's home worked well for our multi-generational group in town for a memorial. Located in a quiet area near a park and with a fenced back-yard, this would be perfect for families with pets and/ or small children, too."

Being the idiot I am I accidentally booked my reservation for one night, and only realized this the day I checked in. I messaged Tara and instantly got a reply to see if the house was available the additional night and it was! Fast communication from both Tara and Kyle. Would highly recommend this house!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tara’s place was spacious and was very close to Hermiston which was a plus. The beds were also very comfortable and AC worked amazing. However, I’m a little disappointed that a train nearby wasn’t mentioned as it literally rumbled the entire house and made it hard to sleep through the night. The home didn’t appear to be thoroughly cleaned and only a broom provided. I do feel this place has a lot of potential if more thought an effort are put into it. Also worth mentioning that Tara was flexible with check in and check out and that was very appreciated!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable home, just as described. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, and the close proximity to Pendleton was a plus for us. The house itself was spotless, with comfortable beds and plenty of room to move about. All the expected amenities were available and a few extra's as well. The bathroom were very clean and the showers had great hot water with decent water pressure. The kitchen was well stocked, with quality cookware, utensils and appliances. We were able to cook full meals with ease. We had no problems during our stay, it was relaxing and enjoyable.
Tara was very accommodating and had great communication the entire time, and I would recommend this property 100%."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was wonderful. I wanted someplace between Kennewick and Pendleton and this was perfect. It's close to the interstate exit and Hermiston is less than 5 minutes away. The beds were comfortable and the house was very clean. Tara was great at communicating! will definitely be booking again in August.

,,,"While Linda's place was exactly as advertised and provided all the necessary amenities, I was unable to spend the night the property due to a bug issue. When I entered the apartment, the ceiling was covered with bugs crawling around. I found three in the bed and on the pillow, while a spider was hanging out in the window directly behind the headboard. There were a few bugs in the bathroom too, and by the time I decided to leave, a few had made their way into my luggage. I got out of there as fast as I could and had to book a hotel almost an hour away to spend the night. Again, while Linda's place was fine on its own, the bug issue was something I could not overlook."
