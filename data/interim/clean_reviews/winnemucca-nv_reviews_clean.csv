2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tyler's place was a good fit for the two of us and 2 year old grandson. We liked the studio. There was lots of light while still feeling private. The fold out couch was comfortable for me, I slept sort of corner to corner and avoided the dreaded fold in the mattress.
The kitchen counter is wide and easy to work at, and it was simple to use the big sink in the bathroom. The neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant for a orning walk before we headed out. The fireplace heater was a little finicky to turn on, and kept the studio very comfortable in the night."

I got into town a little early and asked if I could check-in. They quickly replied and said that everything was ready, which I appreciated after three days of driving across the country.
Enjoyed my stay and would stay again."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Convenient, quiet, a comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Checks all the boxes for my road trip. Oh, and nice shower.
No kitchen, which didn’t bother me bc I am not the type of Airbnb guest to cook. He offers a single burner setup.
Tyler made several recommendations for local places such as restaurants.
I liked “Koreana” restaurant very much, which was not on his list. Yet.
The people I met in Winnemucca were quite friendly and helpful."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A good spot for an overnight in Winnemucca with our pup. The neighborhood is nice and parking is easy out front. It’s a big space and the bed is comfy. There are a number of stairs inside up to the bathroom (and kitchen sink which is also the bathroom sink) to be aware of. A nice coffee machine was a plus. We had a great stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here passing through driving from the Oregon coast to Utah and it was a great in between spot to break the drive up. It was a small and cozy little place, but worked well to stop in and break up a long drive!"

The electric fireplace heater in the bedroom was very much appreciated. The bed was comfortable. Being able to drive the car right up to the door was an added bonus especially for unloading and loading the car. The lamps in the bathroom and beside the big chair were perfect."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very welcoming hosts - both human and dog! My dog loved the backyard. The place was nicer than the pictures somehow, and felt very comfortable. Glad I knew about the quirky sink in the bathroom that functions also as the kitchen (dishwashing) sink, and it wasn’t too bad making that work."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for a stop over on my way out to California. If I ever decided to hit up the Winnemucca golf course, I’ll stay here again it was just very easy and the price was right!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was just as described.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, perfect for what I was looking for."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"It is an ok place but I was disappointed for what I paid. From the pics, I was expecting a bright, well lit place but the windows were dirty, and it was not. The place also had a funky smell."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great stop on the drive through Nevada. Easy to book, Quiet, peaceful with parking that felt secure. Super comfy bed! If you have a pet this would be ideal.
It was really nice to just be able to land, make myself some soup and hot cocoa, and get good sleep before continuing my journey. Way better than any hotel/motel.
I did need to air out the smell from whatever cleaners or air freshener, but I’m sensitive and that was still wayyy better than a tobacco smoke filled casino/hotel or motel which is the common for Nevada.
Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location was perfect. Nice area and within walking distance of the Uptown Market.
We would stay there again."

We enjoyed our stay very much."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I thought this place was super cozy and cute in a rustic fun way! I loved the king bed, the pretty electric fire place, and the quaint feel. It was very clean which I appreciated. It has a single hot pad for cooking and a toaster oven. It reminded me of airbnb's my son stayed in Europe!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best peaches I’ve ever had from the tree in the garden.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Room was comfortable and peaceful, very clean . . . Excellent place to stay. Delicious coffee, comfortable bed, nice TV. Responsive and personable host. We would be happy to stay at Tyler's again and probably will."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to recover from a California camping trip on our way back to Colorado. The “quirks” described were not really a negative, though I did instinctively keep looking for the sink in the kitchen :)
The place was very clean, bathroom amenities were good quality, and the washer/dryer was a god-send. The king size bed was a huge treat after sleeping in a two-person tent for several days.
Highly recommend a stay at Tyler’s!"

Id recommend and definitely stay again. Thanks for the peaches we took a bag home,"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a small but very functional accommodation.The kitchen is only a simple stove, so it is not suitable for cooking too much, but we were able to make it without any problems if it was a simple dish.The place was beautiful and the bed was spacious."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The unit was older but clean. The stay was peaceful and I felt safe staying there traveling alone.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Tyler’s place was like home away from home. It was so cozy to me. Loved the neighborhood market just a few blocks away. Great neighborhood.
Inside was cozy and had everything i needed. The coffee was amazing! I cant wait to come back. Oh and Chaka greeted me! Loved him!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tyler's place was great. . .just as he described. Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet his dog. . .lol."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall our stay was easy and peaceful! The place is in a really quiet area. And check in was super easy. We also appreciated having our own drive way spot that was gated. Our favorite part was the outdoor area. I should note that we were told that we couldn’t check in until 6pm because no one had cleaned the space yet. It was not a problem for us because we booked this as a stop on our road trip so we were getting there late any way. However, I though I should still mention it for other travelers. Long story short, responsive host, safe area, and clean and space!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot! Really easy to find and to park. Probably one of the better equipped places I’ve stayed at in this price range. Comfy bed, solid kitchenette, and nice bathroom. Would stay here again if I find myself in the area."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to experience the Winnemucca I did for over 30 years, this little half address is perfect. Close to downtown, and nothing like to tacky stays there. Authentic ‘Mucc neighborhood. Comfy."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tyler is doing a great job of developing his property 👍🏻
Nice touches."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great that there was a yard for our dogs. There were bed linens left in the washer and a comforter in the dryer. Unusual placement of the one sink, which was for the kitchen and bathroom, located in the bathroom/laundry area, steps up from the rest of the house. Overall not a bad place for a night or two."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"really wonderful place for an overnight stay on a roadtrip with my pups. very clean, super comfy space. loved having that doggy door, and in the morning the lovely coffee setup was much appreciated!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler’s place was great!! The yard is perfect for dogs!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Tyler's place! It was just what we were looking for. It's true that the kitchen sink & bathroom are up 3 steps, but we didn't find that inconvenient. The bed was super comfy, & the guitar he has out for his guests was nicely tuned when my husband picked it up to play it for a few minutes. We'll stay here again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great spot for a one night stopover on my way back to Cali. My doggie loved the yard and it’s located in a peaceful little neighborhood right outside of the main drag. Also loved being able to pull my car into the gated area for the night.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice and cozy place, but most importantly private!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed on our cross country trip with our dog. Loved that it is a residential area of town.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Tyler is a very friendly and accommodating host. This unit is built for guests with a dog as it has a doggie door into a fenced yard. Amazing. When in need of staying close to Winnemucca this is a good place in a nice quite neighborhood. Bed was very comfortable and the unit as a whole, even with its unique layout, was very comfortable."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tyler's airbnb was the perfect place to rest and clean up during a long road trip. His place is tidy, clean, and we'll decorated. Shampoo, conditioner, handsoap, and dish soap were all environmentally friendly and good quality, which is greatly appreciated. Everything was well stocked and we were extremely comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tyler’s place was a great experience. We needed a place to sleep passing through town and his studio was pet friendly. Paid the same amount as a hotel but was much more comfortable, clean, and private. This was the best Airbnb experience in a while. There was a small cleaning fee (as is usual), but we weren’t expected to deep clean the entire place as well. All in all a great experience 👌🏻"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and clean. Plenty of space. Well stocked. We appreciated the water cooler and extra pillows. Quiet with no refrigerator noise. The three stairs to the bathroom could be an issue for someone with limited mobility.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed there on our way to California, great place to rest up on our road trip"
2023-07-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Tyler was a good host… Very accommodating and friendly. The layout of the unit was somewhat awkward. The only sink was upstairs in the bathroom area but kudos to the coffee machine. The bed was super comfortable and the unit was clean so overall, I would recommend a stay if you are traveling through that area."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This worked out good for us for a one night stay after driving all day. Check in was easy, lots of amenities - it had everything we needed at a very affordable price. Bonus is it's close to The Martin Hotel which was a very unique & amazing experience for dinner!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We felt right at home. Comfortable bed with pleasant bedding, nice and clean shower. Great was also the possibility to wash. Everything very cozy and prepared for directly ""living in"". Communication with Tyler is quick and easy. It was really great! Thank you"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was very easy to find. Street parking is perfect. Nice location. The backyard was amazing for my dog. There’s even a doggy door which we loved. There is no sink in the kitchen which I missed when looking at the picture. There’s a large sink in the bathroom with a dish drying rack on the counter. It was a little inconvenient but the yard and dog friendliness made up for that. The smart tv was awesome for movie night as I didn’t have to login to any of my subscriptions. Tyler was very responsive when I reached out. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler’s space was great especially for finding a quick overnight spot that was dog friendly. The space had a dog door also that our pups loved being able to go in and out of the yard at their own leisure.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler's place was cute and cozy as well as very dog friendly for our pups! my husband and I would stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were only travelling through and needed a dog friendly place to sleep. This place was perfect! We felt welcomed, were comfy, the neighborhood is quiet and easy to get to and quite walkable. Thanks Tyler!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, comfortable and everything we needed after a long day of traveling. The complimentary coffee was tasty and all the windows provided a bright and airy space.
Would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Tyler’s place was a perfect place to stop on my road trip with my parents. The place was clean and fully stocked and matched the description exactly as listed. Tyler was proactive in his communication and check in was super easy. It was great to have a fenced yard and the rooms were cozy. The place is close to downtown where there are restaurants and coffee shops. Very quaint and comfortable!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,overall great experience
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We used it as weary traveler's on a multiple day drive and came in really late. It was easy to find and park infront of. Not many neighbors to disturb that late. Felt safe, clean, and glad that it took animals being not so many places on that stretch of highway. Choose this location because we had a tow behind trailer and didn't want to worry in the city over night about it. Great quick overnight! Thanks"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall it was a very comfortable apartment for our 4 nights. The bedding was soft and great level of warmth for this time of year - the mattress was perfect! Kitchen had just enough of everything & the water filter was appreciated! Loved the front patio.
Tyler was very responsive throughout our booking & stay.
I was surprised by another dog in the back yard (his) when we first let our dogs out. Although knowing it was a shared yard, I didn't consider there would be other dogs - just good to know. Tyler responded to my concerns immediately.
I didn't find the firefighter's access to be as described. It's not completely separate as it's a shared entry with the apartment's door to the backyard. To be able to use the dog door the kitchen door needs to be open - which opens to the shared basement entry. Wasn't an issue, but didn't use the dog door because of it. Our stay was great but would have appreciated some clarity on the above aspects before booking.
Thank you Tyler"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was just what we needed and available last-minute as well as later than most people tend to book. I appreciate that flexibility. We needed a place to lay our heads and this was perfect. Tyler was johnny on the spot to respond, which I also appreciate."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend staying at Tyler's AirBnB! The space was clean and cozy. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is very close to downtown Winnemucca and all of the local restaurants.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place to stay for the night.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very responsive and kind. Nice place. Would stay again.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Tyler’s place was exactly what we needed for the week. Place was exactly as stated. Host is very responsive and helpful.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The place seems to be under a bit of construction still!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Just the best !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a stay in Winnemucca ! House had all the ammeneties and quiet at night!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This cute house is in a great location and as a night shift nurse I appreciated having a set of black out curtains. It has cute charm that is very warm and welcoming. I look forward to staying again should I need a place to stay for work.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly as listed. Cute, clean, and safe. Perfect place to stay when traveling with a pet. Very responsive when I had a question. Loved the tea kettle!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was perfect. Cozy, well decorated and clean! The kitchen is loaded with extras that you might need for cooking and the bathroom has plenty of toiletries and phenomenal water pressure. Earplugs were a great addition for our light sleeper! Neighborhood is quiet and the home is across the street from a school and church."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"There is a basement, and it feels a little scary, and the overall experience is still very good."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved this little home. Was very easy to find and reasonable price. we would love to rent it again when we return to Winnemucca
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay with your pets! Fenced yard with easy access in and out of the house. The rental was clean and easy to be at home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We always enjoy staying here! It is the perfect stopping place when traveling!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what we needed for a short stay! Everything was clean and it was really easy to find and get in!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I used this as an alternative to a hotel for traveling employees and it was perfect! Will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful home and very responsive host. Only negative was we didn’t find out about the Wi-Fi and cable until after reserving but other than that overall great experience.
2024-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"Decent for the price. I gave it only three stars because it is what it is for the price.
They allow dogs and the place kinda smelled like dogs. The towels were old and stiff. In an air bnb things like a decent bed and nice towels really matters.
All in all it was great for the price for an overnight stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay! Can’t recommend this place enough! Super easy entry, lots of room, clean and cozy! Very cute personal touches throughout the home! Excellent communication, super friendly! Definitely a must stay if you’re in the area!"
2024-01-01,3,Stayed one night,An acceptable stay in Winnemucca if you don’t like the flatness of hotel accommodation.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler’s home met our needs for a quick one night stop.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I liked the home it was very nice, a lot of DIY work done, I can tell by the door trim. Very comfy and nice place would book again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We always love staying at this home. We have stayed in the studio and in the house and have had great experiences both times. Love the little touches and the guitar was an additional plus! Thank and we will be back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler’s place was perfect for our stay in Winnemucca.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed for a night passing through. It was perfect for the animals with a nice backyard and we felt safe. Thanks again!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Only stopped in for some shut eye. Bed itself was comfy
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It worked well for our needs.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks for having us Christian! Your apartment was perfect for my family and I. We appreciated the clean comfy beds, the modern decor and well stocked kitchen!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy to check in. The house looks just like the pictures.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! It’s well decorated and a very nice location. I felt safe as a solo traveler. :)
Something I would note: I travel all over the country and deal with many hosts. Christian provided exemplary communication and hospitality and is among the most gracious hosts I’ve ever encountered in my last five plus years using AirBnb for business and personal travel. I caught a bug traveling and his kindness will always be remembered."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable apartment with all the amenities necessary. We had a nice stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very nice, had everything you could need. Very good communication with Christian. Would definitely stay again if I’m in winnemucca."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Hard to check in to the unit. The instructions weren’t correct for the lock & was hard to get in contact with host. The place has dirt & dust in the rooms under the beds & there were AC units in the rooms that were very very loud & lots of outside noises. Was a cute place though & did the trick for the weekend.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,At under $100 a night the price is perfect for the small space. Bedrooms were nice a cool.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Christian was responsive and friendly! We had an issue with the refrigerator and he had great communication with us every step of the way! Very comfortable and was perfect for our little one and my husband and me.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We very much enjoyed staying here for 4th of July week! It was very clean and open and a very nice use of space. The price was great for the updated space. We had everything we needed and the kitchen seemed well stocked with basic kitchen needs. There was a heat wave of 100 degree weather so the living room and kitchen got a little hot the first few days but the bedrooms stayed cool with the AC units. Overall we’d go back and appreciate Christian sharing his apartment!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great find! Close to town, cozy, nice neighborhood. We felt like we were home. The details that were put into the place are amazing. All the kitchen gadgets, everything you need to cook & we did! Large living room window that was beautiful to watch the sunset at 9pm looking at Winnemucca Mountain. The portable air con worked great for my son. Walking distance to the Martin Restaurant and the Uptown market. Close to the Golf course. I’m trying to re book at this time but its booked out so book it if you find a week! Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christian’s place was really lovely! It was just as he described, and very clean and comfortable. It is very close and walkable to the main part of town. A must stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here for one week while working remotely. The internet is totally fine. There's several places to work from. This particular unit is a two bedroom. There's a full kitchen minus dishwasher and I was able to make pretty much anything without having to bring stuff in like a colander. It's actually in a very old style rural apartment building, so there's some hall noise but I am a very light sleeper and it never bothered me. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rooms was very clean, overall a great place to stay would recommend to anybody looking for shelter"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Overall good stay and good value.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice place to stay for a great rate. I had no issue extending stay and contacting Christian.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable, well thought out apartment. The beds are comfortable, the decor is pleasing, the kitchen well outfitted. Christian was extremely responsive, no matter the time of day. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room was super clean and well kept! Very reasonably priced. The one tip I have for future people staying is that when you need to lock the door, hold the # key for three seconds and it automatically locks!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Good communication with host.
Clean apartment.
Great location.
Beautiful furniture, new appliances, clean, organized, stocked.
Loved my stay here! I will definitely come back and stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place 👍
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Christian was wonderful to work with and apartment was perfect. Location is good and it is well equipped.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice, cute, small remodeled apartment. It is upstairs on the 2nd level so keep that in mind if you can’t take luggage upstairs. It was a great place for the night to break up our trip."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute apartment with all the amenities of home. Close to all of the downtown restaurants.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place isn't super nice clean definitely come back the hosted it's nice person
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Wonderful peace sleep, the bed was so comfortable. We would use Warren's place again. It's a ranch vibe, and we were told to freely walk around. Potato was a sweet doggie that accompanied us on the property. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🤠"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very Quiet , Great night sleep."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the 3rd stay on our way home from our visit in Arizona from Oregon. Smack fab in the middle.
Great hosts, great ranch, quiet and comfortable. We hope to return in June."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly a wonderful place, host, and hostess. Our second time. Both times were perfection."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,value was unbelievable for an amazing host. treated me just like family
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I needed a place to crash after a long day of driving and I was so pleased to have found Warren’s place! I was immediately very comfortable and I loved how casual it felt. Warren and his family (including the dog!) are great.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place to stay the night! We got in late and had to leave early so we didn’t get to check out the ranch, but we love their dog Potata."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying here for a night while passing through. Everything was exactly as described and our toddler loved seeing the long horns and playing with their friendly dog. It was exactly the kind of break and rest we needed for our long drive. We got fresh air, a great conversation with the hosts, a comfortable place to sleep. I would recommend this over a motel any day."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what I needed - a quiet, clean, comfortable place to overnight in the middle of a long road trip. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean,quiet, friendly, private & Comfortable. Will stay again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It’s a fair place to spend a night at.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a comfortable home away from home in Winnemucca area, look no further! Warren's place is perfect! I'll definitely be making it my new stopping place for road trips between Idaho and California. I felt right at home and got a great night of sleep both times I stayed. And I loved being able to walk around the beautiful property to stretch my legs before getting back on the road!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,The property is peaceful and beautiful!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great and convenient stay for our road trip!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great day at Warren’s. I loved his dog, Potata. Amazing value. Would recommend"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The ranch is very homey. Jason is a great conversationlst.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Warren is an incredible host. I don’t know where to begin. If you have a choice to stay anywhere in Winnemucca you should stay at Warren’s just to be at a peaceful place, listen to his stories about the ranch as well as his life experiences. I was thinking what to write in this review but when one thinks of travel one thinks of a place to stay but it is so much more. To meet Warren enriches your travel experience. His story about being on a World Champion mining team is fabulous. I wanted to take Warren’s dog (Potatoo) home with me. What a cool dog. He’ll walk with you down to see the Texas Longhorn cattle that Warren has on his ranch. His generosity allowing you to use anything and everything in the kitchen as well as having your own fridge for your personal items is so nice. Finally, if you play foosball against Warren in the home you better bring your A Game. Even with a 50% lead that he’ll give you he’ll still end up winning! 5 Stars to you Warren and your place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very thankful to stay in here. Easy to find, lighted entryway to driveway. Easy parking , nice and warm when we arrived"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a cozy place to spend the night. I was travelling from Reno to Salt Lake to make it home for Thanksgiving and this was exactly what I needed to break up the drive. Friendly hosts and clean, cozy place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren and Emily were friendly and welcoming. They were very relaxed and easygoing. I enjoyed chatting with them and getting to know them a bit. Their dog, Potata, was very sweet too (once I got the seal of approval—that is, once my hosts got home, a couple of hours after I arrived, and Potata could confirm that I wasn't an intruder!) 😝
Warren & Emily live on a ranch and it was fun to ride my bike around and explore it a little. Their place is casual and comfortable. If you're used to staying at the Ritz, you may not find it suitable, but if you're as relaxed as the hosts are, you'll fit in just fine and enjoy yourself!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Warren and Emily are great hosts and the location of the ranch is exceptional. Lots of good walking and picture taking opportunities and I wish I had had more time to stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was very homey and our hosts were super sweet! They made us feel right at home. We took a dip in the hot tub and had plenty of privacy the whole time, too. We would definitely stay again! Sweet animals, too!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,it's a great place to stay for the price. Warren is easygoing & the ranch is great for the price. I'd stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying with Warren and Emily for the annular eclipse! We had no idea what to expect, as we have never done an ‘in home’ airbnb before. It was terrific!! As another poster said, it was like visiting a friend’s house. We had plenty of privacy in our bed/bath area, a pot of hot coffee was ready for us in the morning, and we had loads of fun conversation with our hosts. If you stay here, pay attention to the ‘under the freeway’ directions (maybe preview the route before you go so you know what that means) and for sure walk around on their beautiful ranch property and meet Iron Maiden! Thanks to Warren and Emily for a fabulous stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious home in a cozy town with plenty of closeby attractions and restaurants
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Casandra's. Our go to spot when we are in Winnemucca. Thank You for a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very easy to find, just up the road from city hall. The home is older (guessing 1940's) with basement (that's where the laundry is). The master bedroom has a large tv on the wall. Master bath is all original. The second bathroom is as well original (we wouldn't use the shower if you paid us). Kitchen was 90% original. Oven worked, but stunk and was slow to cook. Train track (and Amtrak station) is a block away. Yes, you can hear the train but you can hear it all over town. Found really odd was that there was no smoke detector anywhere in the house. Definitely needs to be added for safety. Good place to for a night or two."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. cozy and comfy. Definitely recommend staying.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,great place to stay . The host was great
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for two nights while our son was participating in a Boy Scout event nearby. Originally were going to be a foursome but the other couple backed out last minute. Less than 500 feet from the Martin (fabulous Basque restaurant) and less than 1000 feet from the Amtrak station. Several trains did run through town at night but it was not that noisy, the house is well insulated. Even if the interior to some guests might appear to be dated it’s like stepping back in time to an old relative’s home. Everything was there that we needed and everything worked. Walking distance to downtown bars, casinos, restaurants, and the supermarket (although that was easier by car). Even if you didn’t whoops and holler it up with a party and music two couples could really enjoy the time there. Very cozy and comfortable, it was just right for a winter getaway."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great, had everything we needed and was exactly as described in listing. We would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house. Great beds. Everything a person would need in the house as far as essentials go. Centrally located in Winnemucca. Cassandra was a really nice host and easy to work with. Highly recommend her places.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great gem! Lots of living space in the dining room, living room, spacious kitchen and a card table in the open sparse basement. Outside was a whole yard that would be great for a gathering (although they do not allow gatherings). I was surprised to find no outdoor grill, but nothing was mentioned in the description about a grill. There is even a third bedroom in the basement - not described in the listing. That worked out perfect for us.
The neighborhood seemed safe, but there is security and video cameras in the driveway. We had a lot of expensive equipment with us, so I appreciated it, although the alarm was annoying as it loudly announced every time you opened any outside door.
I had wanted to host a dinner party, but there is a rule against that. The place is big enough - with lots of space outside. But I do understand not wanting to let renters throw a big party. I did not ask if I could - I just stuck with the house rules.
Overall, this was better than described."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a quick stay in winnemucca, Cassandra’s house is just fine. Be wary of the trains that come through all night blowing their horns, but I’m not sure there’s any place right in winnemucca where you can escape this."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful, Will for sure rent again 😊"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! Everything was perfect.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very well furnished house with a fully stocked kitchen. Great for a family or a group for longer stay, felt right at home. Nice work from home setup including a monitor. There is a sweet apricots tree at the property which the host suggested us to pick some. Very kind, generous and friendly host. We had a wonderful stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful house with nice touches, walking distance to nice restaurants. Highly recommended"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great Air BNB. The house is well equipped and very comfortable. Any questions I had Casandra was quick with her response. Thank You for a great stay!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely home, it feels very cozy and well appointed. Lots of space, the living room and dining room are very large, bedrooms are also large, with a very well-appointed kitchen.
We definitely will stay there again, and highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a comfortable home away from home.
Cassandra was very responsive and friendly, and we appreciated her checking in with us several times during our visit!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cassandra's Airbnb on Malarkey was my favorite Airbnb I have stayed in to date. The house was so sweet, cozy, and welcoming. Kitchen was well stocked with cooking essentials, bathrooms had choices of soap, body wash, lotions. Everything was clean. We come to Winnemucca a couple times a year and I hope to stay again. Loved it! And Cassandra was quick to respond to questions and very accommodating."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our work trip to Winnemucca!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,great host. the house was bigger then the pictures seemed. the fenced yard was beautiful. we stay at a lot of airbnbs on our travels and I have to admit we are picky about having a comfy bed......the bed was VERY comfortable. highly recommend this house!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was as described. Communication was great. We had a great one night stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this airbnb is HUGE. the pictures do not represent the scale of the rooms as they are. the cooking ware, utensils, laundry and other supplies you may need are well supplied. the yard is wonderful kept and more than expected for this house. Cassandra replied rapidly and everything was very user friendly. aside from the functionality, the asthetic is fantastic. every table, chair, light fixture 🤌 much praise to whomever made the decisions. my family will not stay anywhere else in the future when we visit winnemucca."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice house that worked great for our one night stay as we were on our way to Twin Falls. Very spacious and comfortable.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is awesome. It far exceeded our expectations. The period wood and gigantic kitchen made this a home away from home. Super comfortable furniture and beds. Everything very clean and well maintained. Can barely wait to return on our next adventure to Nevada.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in many AirBnb's and this is one of the most comfortable and comforting. You can walk to a terrific restaurant a block away otherwise in a residential neighborhood. The drive to fabulous diners, The Griddle and Sid's Restaurant is 2 minutes. This is s terrific home to stay when away from your own home."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and nicely appointed bungalow right in town. It was super comfortable and heated and a nice respite after a long drive. We especially loved the metal yard chicken👍

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is GEM of a place to stay in Winnemucca. 100% recommend. It was convenient, comfy, and so enjoyable! Super comfy beds, great places to lounge and have a meal at and a huge kitchen area with lots of counter space. Fenced in yard. Just a really great space!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very homie and awesome location! Will be staying here again next time I pass through!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely recommend this home to anyone passing through. We usually stay in a hotel but with a new baby and a toddler needed something a little more comfortable and homey. We were very happy with our stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is spacious and comfortable. It is conveniently located and has everything you need
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great weekend at the rooster house! Thanks Cassandra!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a comfortable and convenient spot for our one-night stop. Note that the train goes by at close distance, which could be an issue was light sleepers."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a quick stay in Winnemucca, this is a great little house for short term and long terms stays. Cassandra was awesome and the place has everything you need! Would stay again and would recommend to anyone."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great house to crash for a few days.
It looked like some areas of the house have missed a few deep cleans; mainly the shower and kitchen sink and the front window sills (pet hair). For a house advertised as “No pets” I sure saw a lot of pet hair on the couches and recliners and stuck to my clothes. If you’re allergic, take note of this.
Otherwise a very cute home and was a better choice for us than a hotel."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,This is an older house but it has been well maintained. The house was well stocked.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying with Cassandra!! She takes immaculate care of her rentals and I love when she has availability when I’m looking :)
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful & spacious craftsman style home with original details. Well furnished and well appointed, with everything you could need. Great location within walking distance of downtown attractions. Some noise from the train nearby, but I imagine most places in town are within earshot. Would definitely stay again."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,A clean and well equipped house with a friendly host. This house works well if you are into older houses with a presence of history and days long gone.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious, Comfortable and clean. Everything was as advertised and Cassandra answered our questions very promptly. Would stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is truly a beautiful home, and we loved our stay. In particular, the king bed was amazing, chairs in the living room were super comfy, and my husband loved the flavor of Starbucks coffee in the kitchen. The size of the washer and dryer were perfect for a cross-country-traveling family, too. (To my amazement, it all fit in one load!) Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was both beautiful & comfortable, we felt very relaxed & refreshed from our stay.
It was a great way to start a marvelous day!"

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great home, close to anything you need in Winnemucca. We had a minor issue with the A/C, but the host was very prompt with getting it taken care of quickly. I would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you find yourself in Winnemucca - we did on a trip to southern Oregon - Cassandra’s home is a comfy home away from home. The hardwood floors and original woodwork are impressive. The kitchen is large and the dining room table is built for good food and conversation. And Cassandra is a wonderful host.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cassandra’s place is literally the best place to stay in Winnemucca. The home is amazing, the location is great, and the stay was wonderful. I would so highly recommend. It is incredible."

Plenty of room to feel like a relaxing stay and a wonderful yard and porch to enjoy on those great Winnemucca nights. Stayed with 4 adults and found space, beds, and amenities to be quite luxurious.

This place is a total gem, and it was a perfect stopover for a day on our road trip. It had a dual desk setup with office chairs, good wifi and it was a charming home. Clean, and very well decorated.
Cassandra herself was helpful and responsive. You couldn’t ask for anything more. The perfect stay! The kind of place that makes you glad Airbnb exists."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space in a small town, and bang-for-your-buck, you get an entire home for a decent price."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gorgeous house! Passing through, Cassandra, responded quickly to our last min booking request; when we couldn't find a decent hotel room in Winnumucca. This is a gorgeous craftsman with amazing space and amenities. The house is much bigger than the pictures reapresent. check in was easy and the house offered a nice bit of security for our little trailer. the gas fireplace warmed up the house fairly quickly. A block away from a Basque restaurant and only blocks from the others this is a perfect alternative to a hotel stay in Winnumucca."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect for my family of 8. Beautiful home, had everything we needed. definitely will be staying again next year."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For the last three years, we've come to Winnemucca for a car racing event, and Julie's house was a great home base. We would stay here again next year. The house looks exactly like the photos. The bedding was soft, and the plush carpet in the living room felt great after a long day standing on my feet. The kitchen had lots of items, and I was able to make my morning coffee in the Keurig. Thank you for letting us stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice remodeled older home. Lot's of space and really nice fenced in yard for our little fury dog to roam around without worrying about her getting out. Only negative would be no tvs and no shades in the living room. I'm sure they are on the list of things to get done yet. Wasn't a big deal for us.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed staying at Julie's place. It had everything that we needed and was conveniently located. Would recommend.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is conveniently located in Winnemucca close to everything and yet on a quiet street. It is very clean and well stocked with everything you will need. We loved the big living spaces to relax and enjoy family time . It is a perfect place if you have kids and they even had some toys which made my grandkids very excited . We loved How the bedrooms were privately located away from the gathering places. The house was beautifully and comfortably furnished as well! A very fun, relaxing , and peaceful place to stay. We would highly recommended it and if we come back to Winnemucca we will stay there again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Susan’s cozy cottage for the final leg of our trip (second time in two weeks). Her home is comfortable, walkable to many restaurants and peaceful. We had a restful stay. Highly recommend for anyone staying in Winnemucca!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed in Winnemucca overnight on our way to Moab, UT. Susan’s place was comfortable, homey, and quiet. I loved the vintage touch of the decorations and the piano. The bed was comfortable and we so appreciated the snacks and water. The home is walking distance to many restaurants and downtown. This is the place to stay if you plan to stop over in Winnemucca overnight on a long road trip. We will be gladly staying here on our way back from Utah."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a charming house. We wish we had stayed more than one night. You can tell the house has been given a lot of love and consideration.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan's house is spotlessly clean and a great place to stay with children. She had toys, games, crafts, and an arcade. Another thing is it had the best amenities of any place we've been. There were extra toiletries, bandaids, fans, blankets, humidifier, pretty much everything and anything they had supplied it for us. We definitely plan on staying here the next time we are through Winnemucca. Thanks again Susan for everything!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed for a pass through on a long roadtrip. The house was clean and the snacks were a nice touch.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice little pad in a very isolated area of Nevada! Perfect if you want to get away from it all and be surrounded by a wholesome and friendly community. I especially liked the amount of space I had, and the Pac Man Arcade game in the living room was a nice touch! I would recommend this spot to anyone visiting this very understated town."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a comfortable, open space, with soft sheets, tasty snacks, and mints on the pillows. My teens particularly loved the Ms. Pac- Man arcade console and wanted to stay longer."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot, down the street from my favorite Winemucca bar."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Susan’s place was so cute and just as described. Totally easy to find and the house is on a dead end street so no traffic noise…except there was some train noise but very background. Met Susan and her husband and they were as nice as can be. Would both recommend and stay there again.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This little spot was perfect for my overnight trip with my daughter. This cottage was literally no more than 3blocks away from where my maternal grandparents met generations ago. I had no idea, and not until I sent my own mother a photo out the bedroom window the morning I awoke was it revealed. This trip was perfect, and Susan’s friendly and welcoming pad was a huge help and comfort to travel down a memory lane of sorts. Thank you to the entire town of Winnemucca, so warm and inviting. Will travel here again! Thank you times a million!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay. ho
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our one-night stay at Susan's house was fantastic. The place was beautifully decorated, creating a warm, homely atmosphere. Susan's thoughtfulness was evident in the snacks and bottled water provided, a welcome treat after our journey. The beds and recliner couch were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful sleep. A special mention must go to the ready meals in the fridge, a thoughtful touch for our short stay. Susan's hospitality was outstanding, making our brief visit memorable. Highly recommend for a cozy, caring stay!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We drove up from Reno to see the annular eclipse and wanted to spend the night after an early morning and a long day of taking photos, and Susan's place was a perfect place to relax. I love the way the place was decorated, it felt more like a boutique hotel, than someone's home, or regular hotel. A huge bonus was a little arcade machine in the living room, I played Galaga for a bit before taking a nap. :)
Susan was super responsive and even accommodated a slightly earlier check-in, which was much appreciated, because we desperately needed a nap. The house was easy to find, it was on a quiet street, filled with beautiful trees in their Fall colors. There were snacks in the kitchen, the beds were super comfy, and the pillows were SO comfy - which is rare!
We had a car, but the neighborhood is totally walkable and just a few blocks away is a bowling alley and a few restaurants. We had never been to Winnemuca before but we definitely want to go back and would love to stay here. :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely great place to stay to get some quiet rest! We felt right at home and would definitely stay there again when we are in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's Quaint Cottage is a nice 2 bedroom 1 bath house on a quiet residential street in Winnemucca just a short walk from the small downtown area. I stayed two nights on a road trip through the area, and the house was pleasant and spacious for a short stay. The kitchen has full-sized appliances (and Susan provided snacks!), the bathroom looked as though it had been recently remodeled, and the WiFi was fast during the day.
Susan's AirBnb is a good alternative to the casino hotels in Winnemucca. I would stay here again if I pass through this area of Nevada."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a great stay at Susan’s house. The house was clean and comfortable. Thanks so much Susan!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a one night stop on a long road trip but I left wishing we could have stayed longer. Great location, a beautiful cozy cottage with a vintage vibe that made me feel right at home. The backyard was a highlight, plenty of seating to sit and enjoy an usually cool Nevada night. The trees made it feel private and was a little oasis of calm after a long drive. Enough about the backyard though! The home itself was stellar! Well stocked and had a few pleasant surprises. I can't remember the last time a hotel was as well put together and you cant beat the price to space ratio! I've only stayed at a few AirBnbs but Susans cottage will be hard to top in regard to both hospitality and the home itself."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall a good place to stay. Lack of lighting. Important, which is clean. The hostess was accommodating in the beginning and even waited for us to help open the door because of the lock issues. But I didn't respond on the day of departure."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a stopover during our road trip. Old, quaint, close to restaurants and in a seemingly peaceful part of town. We were greeted by Susan’s mother who lives next door. Appreciated the sweet extras; personalized welcome sign and snacks. Our kids loved the arcade cabinet. The house did have a musty smell that reminded me of my grandma’s house which was particularly strong in the kitchen. People we met in town were super friendly."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely I’ll am going to stay again there in my next trip
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice big place with full kitchen and backyard grill. Comfortable bed and good shower. Carpet throughout most of house. Effective AC units, although the main room one is pretty loud. Nice place to stay to avoid the casinos and janky hotels."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Susan's home. It was spacious and our kids had a blast with the board games and arcade-style video game. The place was clean and Susan was so friendly and responsive. This will be our first-choice when staying in Winnemucca!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could have stayed more than one night! Susan’s place was perfect for a stopover on a long drive: conveniently located, safe, comfortable, and filled with thoughtful touches like snacks and a white noise machine. I would absolutely stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here one night on a road trip, and it was what we needed. Soft beds, snacks, and space to relax before we hit the road again. Check in and out was easy, house was clean, and I was worried about getting too hot but I actually got cold at night with the two coolers on! We will look to book here next time we are going through."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb stays we’ve had. Easy, hassle-free, very clear check-in, easy to find, great location, friendly and responsive host, spotless though well-loved house with lots of natural light; comfortable tv area, cute, spacious kitchen, adorable decorative accents, super clean bathroom, super clean everything, actually. Lots of little details for things we needed, like tape, matches, extra blankets, an extra toothbrush which of course one of us forgot; kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, from dishes, utensils and pans, to spices. peaceful little backyard with clean, well-working grill and patio furniture. Beds were very comfy though a little softer than I usually like, but that’s so subjective. Quiet neighborhood, even though there’s train tracks not too far away. Susan went out of her way to make our stay special. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Susan was very responsive and her place was just perfect for what we needed!

She had the shower stocked with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner (good brands as well!). We would definitely stay here again!"

I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Winnemucca!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Susan’s home is a wonderful, vintage style little place, located in a quiet neighborhood, yet close by to everything we needed. We were able to cook dinner and breakfast and save money on eating out. A train does pass by several blocks away, which we did not mind. Susan provided ear plugs and white noise machines for those who are light sleepers. Overall, we were very pleased with the house and would not hesitate to stay there again when we’re in the area."

The backyard was set up beautifully—complete with a seating area, grill and fire pit. With our one night stay, we were unfortunate in not being able to enjoy it.

My daughter even sat down and played the piano. The beds were super comfortable and the towels incredibly soft. We did my use the kitchen, dining room, or even sit on the sofa in the living room. We got in after 1:00 am and had to be ready to leave early the next day for a funeral 45 minutes away. Our stay was short, but the house was fantastic. I just wish we could have stayed longer. I did accidentally break one of the shower curtain hooks. I spoke with Susan and offered to pay for it. She said it was okay, they expect little things like that to happen. I appreciated an understanding host, but am still willing to replace it.

2021-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"We spent one night at Susan's on a super hot day (100+ degrees F). The posting said there was AC, and there was a box unit in the kitchen. But, as someone who is not typically hot, on this very hot day, I was uncomfortable in Susan's house. The box unit could not keep up with the extreme heat. My partner and I decided to sleep in different beds to try to stay cool, windows wide open. A very loud and startling train woke me up in the middle of the night. Overall, while we found Susan's place to be comfortable, spacious and affordable, we probably would opt for a hotel if staying in the area during a heatwave in July. Susan was super communicative prior to our check in and we appreciated the snacks and waters she left for us. It was, unfortunately, just too hot to enjoy it - and, we found the post about AC misleading."

Having a piano was so unexpected and such a charming addition. I only wish they had more time to spend. Should they decide to take another trip however, we know exactly where to stay!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Susan's place was a great spot to stop on our way from SF to Bozeman. She was kind enough to leave out some toys for our son, which really helped make our stay easier. She also left out some snacks and coffee supplies, and we were very grateful. It's very clean and there's a cute backyard, too!"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Cutest little place!! I felt right at home while on vacation. The sheets on the bed were extremely soft, everything was very clean and all the amenities in the bathroom was great. We really enjoyed all the board games that were available to play and the coffee station was a huge hit! We all really loved the place 🥰"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Comfortable and clean house in a convenient location. Worked great as a road trip stopover.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great host! We experienced such great communication about our booking - good info prior to checking in, fast responses, and such a friendly and warm tone to the messages. The place is spacious and wonderful with the amenities provided. We especially liked the corkpin map showing where the other guests hailed from. A note to light-sensitive sleepers: one of the bedrooms faces an apartment building with a bright light that is on all night. It didn't keep us awake, though, as the bed was comfy and each of the rooms has its own heat/ac unit. :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was great fit all are needs
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is the absolute cutest!! It is an older home that has been recently updated. The interior is beautiful and SO clean! Everything was wonderful, and the extra thoughtful touches Madison put into it are perfection! She was super communicative, both proactive and responsive. We gave one suggestion on improvement, and she immediately addressed it. 1000% recommend staying here. We look forward to staying again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Madison place was impeccably clean throught. all the color themes and furniture all come together beautifully to invite you in. we simply stayed in to relax from being on the road but it's centrally located. absolutely 100 positive experience with extra touches not often seen like extra phone chargers in the rooms. beds were amazing and the peace in the home was amazing, felt like I was talking to a friend. wouldn't hesitate to recommend her place"
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"We weren’t there long, but we enjoyed the home very much. We would stay again. Madison was awesome!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was very comfortable for our needs, easy to get to, clean and all you need for a comfortable stay. They made it possible for us to park our two pickups and trailers even."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cozy beautiful home! perfect for what we needed! loved that she provided items that could have possibly been forgotten. Love the fact that items in the home could possibly be for sale if we would have had the room there were definitely some items I would have been interested in! Would definitely stay here again if we go back for a visit!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Poppy's Place was our home away from home on an extended road trip. The recently updated home is very clean, comfortable and conveniently located located within walking distance of the downtown. Madison is very responsive and was eager to make sure our stay was top tier. We hope future vacations take us to Poppy's Place in Winnemucca."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Poppy’s place was great! Madison was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely consider staying here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay (6 nights). Madison was very responsive to our questions and helpful. Her place is clean and updated and has all of the amenities needed and some extras. It is near downtown and easy to access. She is continuing to renovate this cute little house so it will only get better and better!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for your kind responses, consultation, and answers. It was the best location in San Jose for a stopover for the Salt Lake City volleyball tournament.
I had a nice stay. Thank you."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Hoping it’s available the next time we are in town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Madison was great. The house had everything we needed, was clean and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect. Wonderful location right in the center of town. The house was pristine, adorable, incredibly comfortable, and the host was just as amazing. Madison was so incredibly kind, accommodating, and truly the most thoughtful host we have ever experienced."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Felt right at home, Madi had so many amenities to make our visit easier. Very responsive. Highly recommend"

Great accommodations compared to local hotel rooms.
Will definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place, and she’s a great host!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren and Emily's home was a great spot to stop and rest. Both, super kind and engaging and made us feel right at home. Was peaceful to drive down and watch the sunset while visiting their long-horns! Waking up in the morning was also lovely to watch the sunrise with a cup of coffee. Definitely hope to make our way to Nevada again, this would definitely be our preferred location."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Felt at home and they were extremely kind !!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Emily welcomed us kindly after a long day on the road. We were just there for an overnight on our way to CO. The bedroom was pretty basic- no frills but a good place to stay for the night. Comfy bed and clean bathroom. We enjoyed our walk to the river on their property with their cute dog, Potata. We had use of the kitchen and fridge. Overall, the space was as advertised and definitely worth the very reasonable price."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home, clean, private quarters, lovely hosts. I loved my stay here! highly recommend!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would definitely recommend staying at Warren's place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable bed, quiet house, great for a 1 night stopover. Tip for finding the house: If you're navigation takes you off an exit where you go OVER the freeway. That is the wrong way. Turn around and go back over the freeway and turn left onto the road. I was lucky and my navigation corrected as soon as I went back over the freeway."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recommend 100%, Warren has a wonderful dog for that. If I'm ever around, I'll be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Couldn't recommend Warren's home more!
Beautiful skies and mountain views, the cows are an extra cool ""amenity"", and the room and private bathroom are big and well stocked.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat next time I'm passing through.
Do not listen to GPS, only follow Warren's directions :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for sharing your home with us
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were welcomed right from the start. We attended a wedding at his ranch and we highly recommend his venue. Warren and his wife Emily were busy making sure everything was going smooth and was always around to help. As for his house, we were made to feel right at home and we had no problems whats so ever. Great ranch but even better hosts!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved it definitely want to come back again when we are doing a road trip.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a nice and comfortable stay. The room was clean, comfortable, quiet and private. I enjoyed walking around the property and the view of the surrounding mountains was beautiful and serene. All the accommodations were as described, and I felt at home and welcomed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Was so fun and such a great vibe very friendly people!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space good privacy. Welcoming hosts and cute animals. Everything as described
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We really loved the ranch and Warren and his wife are super friendly. Would definitely come again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had the absolute BEST stay at Havens Ranch. I booked the trip last minute and was lucky to have found this listing. The location is absolutely stunning. Despite being so assessible to i80, you feel immersed in the characteristic topography of Nevada. There is a 5-minute walk to the wedding venue and exploring the property made the trip really special. My dog loved it. In addition, the host, Warren, made me feel so welcome and comfortable in his home. I would highly recommend this place to any AirBNB guest or people looking for a wedding venue!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great visit in rustic beauty. Very kind and hospitable host. Appreciated full use of kitchen and living room. Sweet dog! Nice walk on the ranch and seeing the wedding venue.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Incredibly friendly, welcoming, and accommodating host! My dog and I stayed for an extended period and immediately felt right at home. Warren even provided me with my own mini fridge and cabinet space. The bath and bed rooms are in a separate, private part of the house so I had my own space. The rooms are clean and very well kept. The property is beautiful and there's plenty to do including walking along the river, visiting the longhorn cattle, and playing card games. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"good place off the beaten path, overnight stay was convenient, liked the made coffee in the morning...."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,It was lovely affordable place to stay a night.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Felt right at home. Thanks
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent people. Wonderful stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I just needed a place to sleep so Warren's place worked perfectly!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time! Definitely planning to return within a year.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are sleepers, and this was the perfect place for us. excellent directions, communication, space and a terrific value."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place to spend the night. Clean and comfortable. Just the way I like it. I will definitely stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great quick stay! Super nice hosts and wonderful sunrise on the ranch. Bonus: very sweet pup!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed for one night on my cross-country drive. The ranch property is beautiful and wish I could have stayed longer! I was pretty delayed getting in and Warren was super accommodating and communicative. And their dogs and cat are the sweetest! Just be aware that cell service can be spotty so make sure you carefully read (and maybe screen shot) his directions on getting to the property well before you exit the highway.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect place for our stopover from Yellowstone to California. Great host, and a great experience staying on a ranch. The long horned bull is a must see!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was supposed to be just a stopover on our trip, but it became a highlight! Warren and his family are so friendly and accommodating, and made it so wonderful for us. The property is beautiful and sunrise and sunset are amazing to watch from there. The rooms are spacious and clean. It's cool to see the sheep and the longhorn cow. Very fun for kids too! Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had such a nice stay here, and I had so much fun talking to Warren and Emily. The room was very clean and comfy and they sent me off with fresh veggies from their garden. If you stay, make sure to hang out with them!!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our visit and appreciated the hospitality!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is fairly isolated and interesting. The host is friendly and the rooms are clean. I would recommend to everybody.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall we enjoyed our stay however our room was quite warm which was a little uncomfortable but was not a deal breaker.
Our room was on the other end of the house which was nice for some privacy.
He has the cutest dogs who greet you in the mornings.
Warren was very nice during our small interaction. The bed was comfortable and the room/bathroom was clean.
The house is definitely lived in and it made it feel more “homey” which I didn’t mind at all.
Thank you for letting us stay! We will stay again when passing through."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were great. The rooms were very nice. The property was very interesting. I would definitely recommend this place.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Just what we needed for a one night stop in Winnemucca. The bedrooms and bath were very clean and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! Very quiet and charming. We’ve started there twice and hope to return again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique place close to the ranch. Very interesting experience for a European family :). First you have to believe that you are in the right place but then you will feel like home
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very quiet. Had the place to ourselves. Didn't meet our host.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Warren seemed like a very nice person. His property was hard to find in the dark, a little bit scary to drive up to with all of the abandoned vehicles along his driveway- and the house was not especially clean.
That being said, if you’re looking for an inexpensive, very basic place to crash en route to someplace, this might be a good choice tor you."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,Great value for a place to stay the night. Unfortunately we didn't stay long so I can't say anything about the rest of the property pass the house.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful and quiet place outside Winnemucca! had a great stay
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a unique stay on a working ranch. Loved it!
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Dave G.'s review was helpful for us to have additional information. It's noted smoking is allowed, but this is only outside in case you have a question about it."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, really enjoyed getting to talk with all of you"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Convenient stay on a lovely ranch! Booking and check in was painless, and my dog loved romping around the ranch in the morning. Awesome views in all directions! Warren responded quickly to communications and was super friendly in person."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is an amazing place and It lives up to the name Heaven's Ranch. Warren and his son are quite amazing. And his dogs, so so cute. It's a place to get away from it all. You have your very own part of the house, with a bathroom - very private! Warren makes the stay perfect."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Warren is an awesome host. His home is beautiful and he was so welcoming. He made an effort to get to know us in a way Airbnb hosts typically don’t. We were so appreciative of our stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren was very responsive with communication
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Passing through the area on a father -daughter trip, we booked Warren’s place last minute. It was a perfect spot overnight and great cultural experience to be on a ranch. If you don’t like dogs and cats around, don’t stay here because they are the welcoming committee and really want your attention. We thought it was entertaining. Really nice separate bedrooms with great beds. It was a really great value for the price and I would be glad to stay there again in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you enjoy the nature or love animals, Warren's place is a jem! Thanks for a very pleasant stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great host, gorgeous ranch. Wonderful dogs! Room is lovely and it’s a great value"
2022-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,If you are looking for squeaky clean this isn’t the Place for you. But for a one night stay the place works just fine. You can make coffee and even cook breakfast as long as you bring your own groceries. If you follow the road past the house you can go and view the Longhorn cows that he has and there is a grassy Area where you can play with your dog frisbee etc.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay here. We stayed on our way to our destination, and again on our return trip home. Very private, safe, and comfortable bed for tired travelers. The host is very welcoming and gracious."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place to stay. Hope to do it again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Warren was very friendly and accommodating. His place feels very homey and welcoming.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very unique setting. Off the beaten path and a little remote. Not your typical place, it’s a little rustic. It’s an adventure, and it was fun to walk down to the Longhorn cattle with the host and hand feed them treats. There’s a sweet farm dog, new puppy, and kitten. The room is quiet and in a wing at the opposite side of the living quarters. The host is very friendly and we talking with him."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was leased by my company to host my crew for a job in Winnemucca… They reported that it was clean and a lovely experience!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So happy we found this amazing gem. Last minute trip to visit family and decided to give Airbnb a try... Warren's ranch popped up and we are so thankful for this. Traveling with 2 teenagers and our 3 dogs can be a bit of a hassel, as well as costly, but here we found the perfect soot. The kids had a room and so did we. And our pets were welcomed. Unfortunately, we didnt get to explore the property like we had wanted, due to such a short trip, but we are looking forward to hopefully retruning one day. It takes an amazing person to open their hime to compmete strangers and to do so like they are old friends. Because thats how he treats you. Traveling can be as overwhelming as it is enjoyable, but having a welcoming and comfortable place to stay makes it that much better. Its like a home away from home."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly incredible. Working ranch. Read the profile and then take the plunge.
Best of the best."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Warren is very generous to open his home to weary travelers.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay in Winnemucca. Easy arrival, friendly host (plus tomato, the cattle dog), and the scenery in the early morning is serene.
For more specifics, it’s clean, has newer mattresses and the rooms are on the far side of the house from the host. I would, and probably will stay again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place Awesome host Probably the best in the area if I had to guess
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this stay. Welcoming hosts. And goats met us in the morning at the livingroom door! As it says in their description, this is not the spot for an clean freak who wants a spotless stay. It is a working farm with real animals, and the sweetest old dog ever. So not the place for everyone, but we loved it! Oh, and did I forget to mention the views...wow."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Warren was a fabulous host! He was very welcoming and accommodating to me and my dog. We had everything we needed including a clean, cozy room with our own bathroom and lots of privacy. He also gave us a tour of the farm. So cool!!! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a quirky, comfortable place to stay. My bedroom had an amazing mattress, and a couch which was a nice touch. Warren was very nice and had great communication. It was pretty easy to find, even in the dark. It is a great value, but as the other reviewers noted, read about it to make sure it's a fit. The ranch doggie is adorable. I will be going back on my next trip if it is available."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved it !
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,be sure to check out the event area restrooms near the longhorns...
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"First off, let me say that Warren and his young son are a delight. Watching them interact was a great reminder that there is a lot of good left in this world and reason to be hopeful for the future.
When considering a stay at Warren's place, I would encourage you to think of it more along the lines of a close friend who invites you to stop off at his place on your way through town; instead of a traditional Bed and Breakfast setup where the host caters to your every need. Warren's a hard-working father who is extremely busy trying to keep food on the table and spend some quality time with his son. The guest wing of the house is very well-kept and prepared for your stay, but the living and kitchen areas you pass through on the way to the guest rooms are clearly the domain of Warren and his boy. Going in the front door, you're greeted by a collection of work clothes (big and small), a kitchen with well-used appliances and a multitude of toys scattered under the big-screen T.V. Warren invites you to make free use of the living and kitchen areas, but you need to understand this is his home, not a resort.
The guest wing is off the side of the living area and includes a full bath and two bedrooms with comfortable king-size beds. There's a sofa in one room and a glider in the other for additional sitting options. The bath includes plenty of clean towels and other necessities (just be patient while waiting for the hot water to arrive, it will get there). You can cook in the kitchen and watch T.V. in the living room. The T.V. has a good selection of streaming services (Netflicks, Prime, etc.). Warren and his son often move into the private wing of the house to allow guests time in the common areas. Overall, the house is comfortable and fully functional.
The location is about five miles west of Winnemucca just north of I-80. The house sits about 400 yards off the road and overlooks a high-desert valley to the north and imposing mountains in the distance. You have to weave your way through some equipment and machinery parts on your way to the house, and you'll likely be greeted by Warren working on a tractor or truck in front of the shop as you drive in. He just waves and tells you, ""The house is open."" In front of the house is more evidence that a young boy lives here and his father is too busy to worry about making the place look pretty. For that, you'll need to walk down the hill.
Just north of the house is a lane leading down the hill to a wonderful collection of old corrals, outbuildings and a grassy area set up for picnics and group events. The corrals house several long-horn cattle and off the side of the parking area is a great sand hill where the kids can play with trucks and other toys generously left by Warren's son. My dog loved stalking the pigeons perched around the corral, and the adjacent fields provide a perfect place for both dogs and people to stretch their legs. It's in this area that you get a true feel for the ranch.
For anyone looking for a place out of town and away from the casino/restaurant areas in Winnemucca, Warren's place is perfect. It's quiet and the views of the mountains and desert from the two guest rooms are spectacular. You just have to understand that this is his home and a working ranch. Also, Warren's old dog moves freely in and out of the house, so keep your dogs on a leash or they're likely to follow the ranch dog through the pet doors and take off to explore."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful accommodations, just like the reviews say! One thing, when you get off the freeway, make sure to get on the road that points towards the airport.
If you dont you’ll end up on a random dirt road."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were surprised with the privacy we has since the price was so reasonable. Out room Wes at the back of the house so we felt like the only ones there. We’ll definitely stay again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great overnight stay! Exactly as advertised, would stay again and would recommend."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My car broke down and I had to find a place last minute. Warren’s place was in my price range and I was able to reserve it the evening of. Warren was very hospitable and nice. I didn’t eat all day and he shared his food with me. His son is cute and social. Place is very clean and quiet. I didn’t get the chance to see the rest of the land bc I had to leave early in the morning.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing host, place, and service. Our car was stuck in the snow because we went on the wrong way to the house, and Warren came immediately with his pick-up truck 10 miles away and dragged us out. It was really nice of him.
The house is at a large ranch with beautiful Mountain Views all around. The rooms are very comfortable, and there’s a foosball machine. We had really nice conversations with Warren too.
Highly recommend for folks who are passing by. You’ll have a wonderful impression of Nevada."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just as expected based off the pictures and other reviews. Greeted by the dog each time we’d arrive. The property was fun to explore in the snow. Temperature was low teens outside but very comfortable inside. We’ll likely visit again next time we pass through.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We were headed though and needed a place to stay that was affordable and this was it! Warrens description is accurate and the place was perfect for our needs. Would definitely book again if headed through.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious place, comfortable beds, a short drive off the highway, just make sure you go UNDER the highway as described by Warren"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were greeted by an adorable kiddo who told us, ""If you're kids, you can play with my toys."" To bad we aren't, because he has an impressive toy collection! Tomata, the sweet old dog, showed us around. Warren made a brief appearance but we were mostly left to ourselves. The house is definitely lived in, but the guest bedrooms and bathroom are noticeably cleaner."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren and his place are great. A short drive to Winnemucca if you have any plans there. Perfect for those just looking for a nice, quiet, clean, peaceful spot on your trip across Nevada. He even offered me a beer when I got there. I would have been happy to have one if I didn't have some things to catch up on. Will definitely check on availability here next time thru. And hopefully have time to have a beer;)"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very responsive host and no problems at all. The ranch house is a bit lived in and rustic. Clean rooms, clean bedding, comfortable mattress and a spare blanket. The house is kept at a lovely temperature so you stay warm all night. Your hostess is a lovely old Labrador who is so happy to show you your room and help you prep, cook, eat and clean up after your meals."
2021-12-01,3,Stayed one night,Safe and comfy home to rest my head
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as shown. Great place to stop and stay at.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren is a great host and his place is a great value!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very friendly and accommodating ! Love his dog and cat too. :)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Warren was so nice and welcoming—offered us cold beers, let our toddler play with his son’s toys, and allowed us to walk around the property. Our toddler loved the Longhorns and land to roam around. Such a gem of a place and person"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as listing says. Great place to stop on roadtrip for the price! Thank you!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warrens place was beautiful, comfy, and a safe place for me to lay my head for the night"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to chill and relax
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay! Clean, comfortable, and quiet!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay on our road trip! The home is exactly as advertised, with comfortable beds. The property is even better than advertised, watching the sunrise over the mountains with alpacas and other animals around was truly special! Truly a great value spot!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren was absolutely great. He was super hospitable and welcoming, I really couldn’t have asked for a better host. The ranch was beautiful and calming, and carrot the cat was the best welcoming committee I’ve ever had! I highly recommend Warren’s Airbnb, I would stay again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and Warren was very welcoming. Couldn't ask for a better price for one night stay while traveling on.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my second stay at Haven Ranch. The first was with my mom and this time with my husband who liked it as much as my mom and I. Warren does a great job of providing a good sleep at a good value. Please read his description carefully as this may not be the place for everyone. However we will try to book again if we are ever in need of sleep in Winnemucca!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect for us for the second time.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Worked out very well for us. Apple Maps worked great, the cars GPS didn’t, but thank goodness we had both. The only regret we had was not having the time to check out more of the property, but we certainly will next time."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Warren helped give me instructions for the gate even though I got there at 8PM. Didn’t get to meet the host but found the room easily.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not a bad spot for a cook-out with friends, and a quiet place to rest for a few days. I encourage whoever has the $$ to spend some time at this location. Plenty of parking and a TON of toys to play with if that's you're thing."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a one-night stay in my dad and my way to our Oregon deer hunt. Warren provided clear directions, expectations and a clean room, clean and very comfortable memory foam bed and hot shower with shampoo and clean towels. Warren’s place is so quiet, we slept great"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value. The place is accommodating and the host is friendly and hospitable.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet location, comfortable bed and responsive host. Thanks Warren."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stop for us. Totally enjoyed the Ranch experience.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Try and get there before dark! The apple map app stops giving directions at a certain point but the direction given by the host in the check-in portion of airbnb covered the gap of instructions. We arrived very late and had to drive around a lot of equipment and spare parts that would have been easier to see during the day. We realize this is a working ranch not a Hollywood ranch and are unbothered. It is an excellent value. We had enough parking for a uhaul and SUV. Door was unlocked and we were greeted by a kind sleepy older dog and followed the check-in directions to our rooms or we might not have been able to find them. We went straight to bed which were clean and comfortable. We found the towels folded and stacked under the sink but decided not to use the shower and get going. Didn’t use the wifi even though it was available. Host was easy to contact.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stop off at!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay on our way to California. Clean bedroom and bathroom.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great option for a fun, affordable, ""off the beaten path"" stay. The long-horn steer and backyard goats were so much fun for this city girl and her dog. Warren and his young son were kind, accommodating, and friendly. It's a working ranch, not the Ritz hotel, but he is clear about that in the description, and the room and bathroom were clean and quiet. Lots of beautiful views of the mountains around the property. My dog got along fine with their sweet dog Tomata. I would stay there again if I was in the area, and would recommend them to anyone traveling through on a budget and looking for a different type of experience!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"A Clean room was just what I needed on my cross country roadtrip. There is an interesting and eclectic bunch of miscellaneous equipment, vehicles, and such on the land. I did not get a chance to check out the longhorns and such. The house (outside of the clean bedroom and bathroom) was kinda messy, but I have seen worse. Our interaction was short, but he seems really nice."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean, relaxed homey ranch house near town. A great value. Comfortable mattress. Excellent instructions: follow them from the airport access road. Only the driveway is dirt. Next time we want to go see Warren's longhorns!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’m very happy with my stay at this Airbnb. The host responded in a timely manner, and was quite flexible! Totally worth it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had no problems finding the place with Waze, and it was scenic and homey, as advertised. We loved meeting the cows!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice quick stay.
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,Easy stay
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Warren’s place is as described: nothing fancy but our room was clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed visiting the longhorn and was a good place for one night on the way back to Idaho.
2021-08-01,3,Stayed one night,I had difficulty determining if I was in the right place because it was about 1/4 mile off of the main road and there wasn't an address on the front of the house.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Quiet and restful (nice after a long drive!)
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Warren was very accommodating to our needs while we were there. Very responsive to messages and just let us be us.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed meeting Warren and his son and meeting their dog Tomata.
Our room and the bathroom was super clean and we got a great nights sleep (super quiet, comfy bed). Great value for money!
The main living area of the house was well 'lived in', just like any other home where a four year old boy is being entertained while at home (during the school holidays).
It was great to share a beer with Warren and hear the story of the farm and the great venue space he has developed down the hill. Go and check it out while you are there.
TIP: if you really want to make Warren happy challenge him to a game of fuzeball... but don't beat him like I did, as he just can't take losing at fuzeball! ;)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great farm! My pup loved it too!
Hope to be back some day."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was midnight. We followed the GPS until it stopped. There was a ranch there, but the address was wrong. We should have read the reviews entirely then we would have known the GPS gets spotty. We continued down the road looking for the correct address. We drove in someone elses driveway, turned around, and continued down the road. Then, we found it! Haven Ranch. We turned on the dirt driveway and drove until we came to a gate. As a country girl, I knew what to do, and hopped out to open it as husband drove through. I closed the gate and got back in the car. At this point I was feeling excited. We parked in front of the house, and the door was unlocked. I went in. I looked around. I didn't know were to go! I called the number for the host on the app. He answered.
""Warren?"" I asked.
""Yes"" he answered.
""Am I in your house?"" I asked.
""Yes"" he answered.
""Where do I go?"" I asked.
""Go through the kitchen and go left"".
I apologized for waking him and wandered through the kitchen and went left. We chose from two rooms. It was very clean and cool. We slept and left in the morning without meeting Warren. We will hopefully be back!"
2021-08-01,3,Stayed one night,Got a decent night's sleep.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I was not able to stay at Warren's because of a family emergency on the day of my trip. His quick communication and assistance was greatly appreciated in my time of need. I would book this place again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cost-effective, minutes away from restaurants in town. Clean room. Worth the price."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, friendly, communicative host and excellent value!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren’s place is exactly as described. Our room and bathroom were nicely cleaned, and quite comfortable! It is in a lovely country/dessert setting with horses, cows and goats around, as well as lots of working tools and toys. His dog was so sweet! And it is always appreciated when hosts welcome dogs… ours loved her stay too, especially playing with a spare tire as a frisbee out front! We would definitely recommend this place if you don’t require a fancy stay, but just a great, clean & comfortable space to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, quiet, clean room with a super comfy bed. It was the perfect way to break up my drive from Idaho to California! Next time I hope to stroll about the grounds!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren’s place was perfect! Just as he described in the listing, it’s a cozy space in his home that’s right off I-80. I just needed a safe place to stay the night on my way from the PNW to Tucson (with all my stuff in my car!), and Warren’s prompt and kind communication made it clear his place was the best option in the area. As other reviewers have mentioned, GPS apps will likely take you to the wrong house on his street; keep an eye on the lot numbers (easier to do in daylight) and watch for the sign out in front, and you’ll be right there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Beautiful ranch, Warren is really friendly and helpful"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Inexpensive, clean accommodations. Very easy to access"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful landscape and really sweet animals. Especially enjoyed sitting out back with the goats and dog and checking out the paintings in the hallways. We were there for only a night and didnt cross paths with Warren (too bad! After seeing such warm reviews from other folks!) Grateful for space to relax and roam freely. Wish we could have stayed a bit longer
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was lovely! Friendly host and lots of space. Our room was perfectly clean, but the living room was a little more lived-in, as to be expected. Overall, a great stay and we'd definitely come back again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Warren's ranch is exactly as advertised. No problem finding the place, but I recommend dropping a pin on his place on Maps ahead of time and then get directions to there. Shouldn't have any problem finding it."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great awesome experience. Warren was very accommodating. So much fun with the ranch and the animals
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren is a very welcoming, chill guy. He was so kind to offer me an arrival beer and give me a tour of the very beautiful land. Wishing you the best Warren!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super beautiful, I only needed a place to sleep for a few hours, and Warren was super accommodating! The room is clean, and super comfortable, and it’s in a beautiful spot in Nevada. Will definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, no fuss, beautiful land and a kind host. It’s a private back section of a big home and the kids and the pup and I were all very comfortable. We met the Longhorns and the goats in the morning which was sweet. Definitely recommend! Thanks Warren."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great price for a comfortable stay in a ranch!
Good directions helped us find the place at the night. (The GPS took us to a wrong address.)
Easy check in & out. Warren was cool. He has a sweet dog."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot to stop for the night on our road trip. Warren is a great host!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The private rooms and bathroom are clean and a good size. The rooms are kind of in the back of the house so you have to walk through the living room and kitchen to get back to your room.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly what we expected
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot to stop for night. Exactly as advertised - not spotlessly clean, but clean beds, great host. It felt like staying at an old friend's house. Google maps is a little off, just watch for the correct address and watch for the sign in the picture Warren provided."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stop and crash on a road trip!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Perfect stop to sleep and relax. Enjoy the great views!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place and great location, you get the vibes of real ranch at this place"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,This is a convenient location off I80 for sure. The location is as described and did the trick for us.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, really cool vast land with longhorns to see. Exactly as advertised, low key and very easygoing 👍 appreciated my stay here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value for the money.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect pit stop on our drive from Portland to Las Vegas!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Warren’s listing is the perfect place to crash for the night. We were on a 12 hour drive to Oregon from Utah, arrived late at night with our two kids, and left first thing in the morning. Warren’s place is REALLY hard to find at night, so beware. We are very grateful he took our call at 11 pm and helped us find it even thought it was very late. The farm was super fun for our kids to explore in the early AM- they even got to feed the goats! Rooms were super clean and just as described."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Warren’s place is a lovely alternative to staying in Winnemucca- it’s a titch out of town but worth it. You are staying on a farm, so expect a comfy clean room / bathroom AND the view from the front to include a lot of outdoor & farm equipment. Will gladly stay again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a cozy bed to rest your head, Warren’s place fits the bill. The shared spaces were dusty, as indicated in his description, but overall, it was a very cozy stay for two weary travelers. We enjoyed walking some of the property. The Longhorns were impressive, as is the entire property. Unbeatable sunset. Thanks, Warren."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"It’s an interesting place and as you drive in, you may think you’re in the wrong place, but it is it! Warren was friendly and welcoming! You just go right in and walk through the kitchen and game room and then it’s a little hallway to the rooms and you feel like you have your own kind of place. The rooms and bathroom were clean and showers were warm and refreshing. A good stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great value for a great nights sleep; everything is just as Warren described!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Warren is an amicable person who will do anything to accommodate his guests as best he can. We had a great time hanging out at the ranch with him and his boy. He also generously let us use his washer and dryer all evening. Common areas weren't so clean, but the Airbnb section and our own room/bathroom were perfectly clean. Know that Warren has clear arrival instructions in the app (which I didn't at first, and without them we first couldn't find the place). Definitely recommended if you want an authentic experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay for anyone traveling down i80. Fun area to explore and take photos.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren’s place was nestled on a vey plot of land. Check in was super easy and his directions to his house were very helpful. The bed was very firm but all the essentials were available.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy little place. Warren helped us with our flat tire the next morning too!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"On this large ranch with lots going on, my Mom and I agree that you will find inside the ranch house comfy beds, a warm inviting, interesting and industrious host, a friendly canine, a relaxed atmosphere and a clean hot shower. If ranch dust seeping through windows or many projects in process on the ranch or the joy of a child’s toys on the living room floor would upset you, please do not bring your upset to this delightful home. If you do, you may miss the beautiful vistas, wedding venue, cute goats and impressive longhorns. This is on my must stay again list!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren is a great communicator. Pretty rustic. Tricky to find. Very quiet, comfy, clean."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy stay for budget traveler. Warren was very hospitable during my stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren is the real deal--a ""cowboy"" with heart. With Warren it was way more than making money or about business. He's actually offering an ""experience"" and what I love about Airbnb (which seems to me is increasingly harder to find.... lot of people offer you a place to crash and nothing more). Warren opened up his home and made me feel like part of the family. I was traveling by myself and I really appreciated meeting his cousin/friends, too--everyone making me feel comfortable. He's the kind of guy who offers you a beer, burger and laugh. The kind of guy who is curious about the world around him, while also loving his life on the ranch. The whole experience was a breath of fresh air and exactly what I needed. I hope to be back again soon."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren's place is a working ranch. No pretense, just a first hand step into ranch life. My room was clean and the bathroom was right next to it. There are lots of animals to meet and spectacular skies to enjoy!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Most comfortable beds, hospitable, nice to walk around in the moo"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. The host was very accommodating and friendly.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,we loved staying at the ranch! what a view of pretty farm land. we were so tired from our long drive and Warren was a great host. from dinner recommendation and some peace and quiet with we needed. loved the longhorns and got to pet the goats! if we are ever passing through again we would definitely stay again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great room with a comfy bed right off I-80, with a fun bit of property to explore."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great nights sleep here, would definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Description of this property is spot on. You are sharing space on a real working ranch. The sunset from the house is amazing and the night sky is lit up with thousands of visible stars! Comfy bed and a decent place to lay your head. The communication with Warren was a breeze. We will definitely book Haven’s Ranch again
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome stop on our journey. Warren and his son were great company and it was fun to explore the ranch.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We slept so well! Perfect private side of the house. The kids had fun with their dog and cat and the toys outside after a long drive from Boise.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and comfortable stay for passing through town. Warren was very accommodating and kind.
2021-05-01,2,Stayed one night,Warren's place was ok..we too live in rural Nevada..we were expecting quiet..it was very close to 80..we heard road noise all night. also..it was advertised to have a TV. yes there was..but the only thing you could watch were kids videos..it also was advertised that it had a washer and dryer..we were on the road and that was one of the reasons we chose it..he had clothes in the washer and I didn't want to move them..I did send him a txt pretty early..but didnt get a response until the next morning..by then it was too late. the beds were not the ones in the picture..and they weren't really comfortable. that being said..it was only 50.00..soo..I guess you get what you pay for.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Warm and very inviting. Great host. Beautiful views. The kids loved feeding the long horns. I would go back a thousand times over. Way better then any hotel you will find around there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"FABULOUS!!!
Warren is a first class host. We highly recommend his place. He was quick to respond to emails and is an honest businessman."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Warren’s place was in a convenient location and very clean. His dog is extremely friendly and the ranch was cool to explore. We really enjoyed our stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Convenient and fun place to stay. Warren could not have been more welcoming
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were beyond impressed with how awesome Lisa’s place was! Kids and I felt totally at home. Would love to be stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was very friendly and always responsive. Left us a nice bottle of wine and some snacks that was awesome! Very homey and nicely decorated. Extra toiletries and any needed supplies. Backyard and patio perfect for BBQs. Would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and quiet
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is adorable and well put together! Fluffy towels & quality beds. Lisa was responsive, helpful and kind."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Like coming home as you walk in the door. Really clean, tons of extras, snacks, breakfast bar. Everything you can ask for and more just bring your clothes. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara is a great host and has a very well equipped travel trailer with plenty of room for my wife and me.
Very clean and comfortable property. We enjoyed our time there and enjoyed exploring Winnemucca. Barbara left us great advice and her instructions were quite clear. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Winnemucca. Highly recommend host and property.
There is an authentic Mexican food restaurant (Marisco Del Rey) nearby which added more charm to our visit. Delicious food."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,cute little RV that was super spacious. away from traffic or lots of lights. plus seeing the night sky was beautiful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our first stay in an RV, so it took some getting used to, but overall very comfortable, bathroom is small, but adequate. Very good value for the price!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"it is great experience for me to live in RV and I had a wonderful communication with Barbara about travel and city Winnemucca, NV."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara and her husband were so kind to us! Peaceful, quiet, and we could see the stars. There were lots of sweet touches like great coffee, bacon in the fridge, and delicious jam, it was also extremely clean and we felt right at home! This was a great stop near the highway and we will definitely be staying again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet place to spend the night. Just passing thru town while working a local event, and was just right for what I needed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly what we needed. We will definitely come back! thank you
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place to stop on our roadtrip! It had a beautiful view of the mountains and a cute outdoor area! I really appreciated Barbara’s thoroughness with instructions and recommendations!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and quiet.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot to stop for a night! Very clean and cozy with an attentive host!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with privacy, views, and proximity to grocery, hiking, etc"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s place was perfect for our weekend getaway to Winnemucca. The space was very clean, the towels were fluffy, the bed was very comfortable. The private backyard space was great for relaxing and watching sunsets. The breakfast items and snacks were above and beyond what most hosts provide. Barbara is a very kind-hearted host who pays attention to every detail to ensure her guests’ comfort. We would most definitely stay here again the next time we visit Winnemucca."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I needed a comfortable place to sleep during a long drive from California to Colorado, and in that respect, this place more than exceeded expectations.
The host also left the fixings for a wonderful breakfast (bacon, eggs, cheese, etc), and delicious homemade marmalade for the toast. I wasn’t expecting such dedication to the “breakfast” part of the AirBnB name, so it was a very pleasant surprise.
I don’t mind the fact that it was in the middle of cow country, with associated aromas. My dog enjoyed sniffing around."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s place was an oasis in a hidden corner of Winnemucca. It was inviting and quiet! She had a private yard for guests that she put a lot of care and thought into just as she has her guest quarters. Thank you!! ❤️
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I hope to stay here again when I migrate south for the holidays!
I absolutely love the view out from the breakfast table!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Super nice people
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is simple and perfect for what we needed. Barbara was very responsive and flexible with our late arrival. The place is just as listed in the notes. Directions are easy to understand if you read them while looking at the map of the location. The neighborhood was very pleasant and peaceful. Breakfast was delicious.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay at the last minute. Barbara responded quickly and gave us perfect directions to her place.
The kitchen was nicely stocked with beverages and pop tarts in true bnb style.
We appreciated the view of the mountains and sunset across the valley. The view out the big window in the rv is restful. We found the neighborhood quiet and restful.
There is sleeping space for three, a double bed in the bedroom and fold out ""Click-clack"" couch in the living room with a futon mattress."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! So peaceful and private. Great view of sunset. Generous breakfast food. Would stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly what we needed! Absolutely will stay here again. There were so many fantastic small touches, truly a great experience. Thank you Barbara!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our quick stay at Barbara’s. The mountain view from the kitchen table was beautiful. Very clean. We would stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,just amazing spot. The trailer is just amazing. My sons loved it so much as did I.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a short, lovely stay as a way to break up a long drive! The place is very peaceful, clean, and comfortable and I loved the coffee and breakfast options provided."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and cozy RV. You can tell Barbara puts effort into making this place welcoming. I would stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was such a peaceful calming stay at Barbara's RV. I enjoyed my own private fire while I watched sunset behind the mountains in the distance. I slept like a baby and easily figured out how to use the camper's features having never slept in one before. Barbara was kind and highly responsive. I would absolutely return here when I am visiting again and would recommend to anyone traveling through Winnemucca. Thank you Barbara :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay, would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara is responsive, friendly and made us feel very welcome. We loved our stay here. We enjoyed the view while playing cards, it was really nice. There are several games available as well as a TV, DVDs etc... I really recommend this airbnb and we would be very happy to come back in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a delightful surprise. The setting was nice: a rural feel but actually in town. Enjoyed sitting outside as the day faded and the stars came out.
Inside had all the comforts of home, plus thoughtful and delicious food supplies (farm fresh eggs and more) for breakfast. Very reasonably priced. We will definitely stay here again when in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stop on a long road trip. Comfortable for the night with lots of space. Would stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place with lots of privacy! I slept so well! 🤩
It was a nice surprise that I had the whole place for me!
Everything was perfectly clean and organised!
Had I bought food to prepare, I could have cooked, cause the kitchen was fully equipped!
Barbara leaves lots of small treats, like capuccino sachets, coffee, oatmeal sachets, etc!
She’s dog friendly and my dog was welcomed in her place, which was so nice since some people here at Airbnb don’t like dogs :/
Outside the motorhome there’s space to sit down and relax or even a barbecue, for those who likes it :)
Great host and a great place! 🌹"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our short stay at Barbara's RV. It had everything we needed to be comfortable and relax. We had dishes for all our meals and kitchenware for cooking. All the amenities worked well including wifi. My son loved the games and dvd player. It was a little cold for us to use the firepit but we look forward to returning again and so we can roast hot dogs and sit in swing.
Her directions were spot-on and we found it easily. When i messaged her with questions she responded quickly. She had sets of towels and bathroom items provided so there was nothing we needed to bring. No noisy neighbors and we had plenty of privacy.
It was a lovely visit and we recommend it for anyone traveling through Winnemucca."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome sunset!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect! Very cozy and private. The view was amazing during sunsetting hours. I wish we could’ve used the fire pit and enjoyed the place a little more, but we arrived late and needed to leave early the next morning"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara had everything you would need. Things to make breakfast with, games, books, movies, extra blankets and pillows, clear instructions. Make sure you follow her instructions since GPS will take you to the wrong place. Her instructions are easy. Will be back again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I'm on a cross country road trip and this was my first time staying in an RV. It really exceeded my expectation. I followed the instructions Barbara provided (as stated do not use GPS) and it was very easy to find. I was able to meet and chat with her briefly before checking myself in. The space was bigger than I envisioned. All clean and very cozy. I felt right at home. Having the private yard was nice, and the RV was set back so it was a totally private space. It was a quiet neighborhood and I was able to walk my dogs around no problem (we saw some goats along the way). The bed was very comfortable. It was completely quiet and I slept well. The hot water lasted long enough for a great shower. I would certainly stay here longer. Truly comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great little pad with a good view of the area! Barbara was friendly and helpful, and we only had pleasant surprises. It felt very homely - thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a gem. Super cozy place and secluded with privacy. Barbara had homeade breakfast ready to cook in the fridge and check in was very easy. She accepted me on late notice and I was super grateful for that. I will definitely be back when I come through town again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara's place had everything needed for a comfortable and quiet overnight stay. She even had breakfast items and other condiments. It was very peaceful, quiet and beautiful view of the distant mountain. I would stay again.
Gianna"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Barbara's place is a stunning and roomy RV with ample private parking.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, safe place to stay in Winnemuca. It was easy to find from Barbara's instructions (the gps takes one around the other way where the street is blocked).
Clean, comfortable and very nice trailer. We enjoyed our stay"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great clean place to stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay! If this location is open it is now our #1 go-to for staying in Winnemucca.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara met us when we arrived, she is a very nice person. Wanted to make sure we had everything we needed and made us feel at home. The place was clean and had a nice and comfortable layout. We liked it, and our puppies did too. We would like to stay there again when we come to town."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"The place was decent, was just passing through on my way from Oregon to Las Vegas. The gps/map didn't match, so it took me about 1/2 mile away from actual location. Same thing happened for the door dash delivery driver. Here is where it got interesting (I share this to hopefully avoid a bigger situation for future guests) - I had to walk about a 1/2 mile to meet the door dash driver - while walking up the street, I encountered a beautiful brown doberman, that was outside, up the street on left side, and not in a fenced yard (probably weighed about 70-80 pounds) and I was on the opposite side of the street, but it rushed me twice getting within a foot or two, and luckily backed down. Had I gotten bit, which in retrospect seems like a very real possibility, I was 300 miles from civilization and it could have been quite dangerous, had I been bitten."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little RV. Clean and private. Ridiculously comfortable bed and an awesome host who provided a light breakfast and a well stocked kitchen. It was a relief to have a place to stop with or dog that was truely dog friendly.
A note on the neighborhood - it is a very standard Nevada neighborhood, with the addition of a goat farm! So my best suggestion to other guests is to not let the rural environment surprise you when you arrive, and it should be common sense not to let your dog off leash, or walk them, close to working properties.
We felt very safe during our entire trip and will absolutely hope to stay again as we do this drive several times a year."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Literally one of the cutest places Ive stayed. Barbara is an awesome host and left little treats for me and my fur babies ❤️
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara made check in painless and had extra amenities for dogs, patio was great with a nice view and fire pit."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so grateful to find a clean peaceful place to rest after being on the road. The shower was nice & hot and the trailer was toasty warm on a cold winter night. The coffee was wonderful and the breakfast she provided was very nice. There were many thoughtful little extras.
Would stay there again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The RV/ trailer was very clean and homey. It was such a great place to relax and she also left chocolates and boiled eggs in the fridge which I really appreciated. At the back of the trailer there was also a beautiful view of the mountains.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,was very comfortable. just spent the night and was raining so didn't get to take advantage of some of her amenities.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved my stay at Barbara’s. The RV was super spacious and clean. I only popped over for the night on a roadtrip, but it was the perfect place to lay my head and was worth the price. I’m sure I will be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara's RV was the perfect resting place for a late night checkin on our road trip. We were delighted with the homemade cheddar biscuits and gravy that was left for us, which we happily enjoyed before leaving in the morning. It felt like a very safe place to park and stay, and was easy to check in after a long day of driving."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful recommended traila
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable setting, clean RV and comfy bed. Really enjoyed the outdoor swing while watching the sunset."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved my experience there. Looking forward to returning.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Barbara’s RV was a great deal with a great bed and super clean. Barbara was also quite friendly and responsive. The RV is large and well laid out and Barbara stocked the fridge with different food items and also had a big Tupperware container with cereals and other food items. Really sweet. Note that the RV is not within walking distance to anything as it is up a road in a quirky, seemingly hard scrabble neighborhood of double wides. The rental includes a side yard with a fire pit and also access to a bbq. It’s very private and relaxing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Actually wished we could have stayed longer but we were just passing through so it was a quick overnight stay. Comfy bed, quiet location and owner provided a wonderful selection of breakfast options and coffee. Would definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the second time we have stayed with Barbara.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderfully lucky find!!
As weary travelers it was wonderful to find this quaint place to relax and enjoy the clean, restful and thoughtfully stocked RV.
Away from the hustle and bustle of town, the area felt safe and peaceful. There was plenty to enjoy as the kitchen was well stocked with morning breakfast and snacks in the refrigerator.
The RV was clean and comfy and spacious enough for a couple to relax and enjoy some evening TV watching or sit outside and light the fire pit during the cool evening.
For us this was a lucky find, one that we hope to enjoy again, as we had a deliciously restful night, the best sleep in a long while.
Thank you Barbara"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay for us on our trip through Nevada. We got the chance to rest and recuperate before heading out once again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Very clean and comfortable. I'd stay again next time. Thank you very much.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Barbara was an available and responsive host with a wonderful smile. Very comfortable and cozy RV trailer. Private. Beautiful nearby hike. Pet friendly. Will definitely return when in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable. The bed is great too. A great little spot for a quick overnight
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara's RV was a perfect stay! On a long and difficult cross country move, Barbara was kind enough to accept my request last minute and we were welcomed with all the small necessities one would need; bread, coffee, cream for coffee, snacks, etc. It felt like a true home away from home. I have stayed from the south western USA to France and Australia and out of all the places Ive stayed, this RV was honestly one of the best and most comfortable spots!!! I hope to return some day and enjoy Barbara's RV again:)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This RV was a better choice for use, traveling with a dog. We didn't know what to expect. If you are good with a double bed, this is a good alternative to a generic hotel room.
Barbara, had breakfast waiting for us in the fridge. We enjoyed the hospitality, this will be our destination stay when we visit Winnemucca, which is a couple times a year."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,She is an amazing host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Barbara and her husband have a really lovely RV in a quiet part of Nevada, but in an area off of 80 that is in dire need of hotels and places to sleep for travelers like me.
This space was clean, stocked, and even had a breakfast bin. My cat and dog liked it. I slept with the windows open and the cool desert air was very soothing. I could have had a little bonfire in the space provided, but I was so tired from driving.
Minor issues: Maps doesn't seem to understand how to get to their house. It wasn't so bad to figure it out, but don't trust G Maps.
Also, walking my dog past the livestock dogs down the road caused all the dogs to bark. Both are out of Barbara's control, of course, but future folks might want to keep these things in mind.
I will definitely see if this place is available again on my roadtrip back.
Careful, don't lose the RV key like I did! 😅"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The problem I had finding the place was of my own making, as I hadn’t thoroughly read the welcome letter with instructions. Read them! But if you want an authentic experience with lovely people & the sweetest dog imaginable, this is the place!
Also important to read the description fully. They had me at “ranch.” And that it was. Amazing clear, starry night skies, cattle wandering through the yard, jack rabbits surprising us in the multicolored grass. No other units besides ours, which had a comfy bed, lots of space, wee fridge and great setup up for coffee in the morning. What it lacks is a shower (which is noted in the listing), but don’t let that put you off. This is a true find in Winnemucca."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in this suite! I felt very safe with a car packed full of stuff as we stopped during a move. The property is beautiful and we even saw the longhorns way off in the valley. Comparable pricing to the hotels in downtown Winnemucca, but a way better deal. Rent this!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a treat. Exactly what I was looking for. Privacy, vistas, sunset, stars and sunrise. The place was clean and I was quite content."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfy little suite. Easy to find and the bed was not as short as other reviews mentioned. My six foot tall husband fit just fine. It was a nice little place to stay while passing through.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,well
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the ranch. My son loved the Sandy playground and tractors all around. It was a fun experience for us.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a clean, cozy place to rest while traveling through. Loved the sunrise, the fresh water, warm heater and blankets. Smelled good. Welcoming."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Warren in an excellent and hospitable host who responded quickly and did everything to make us feel comfortable and welcome. The tiny home is a bit smaller than I expected and the one bed shown is also a futon, so the only sleeping accommodations are those. Definitely a “glamping” type place that was conveniently located off the freeway and great for someone driving thru."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, secluded, private and unique.
One of a kind."
2024-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described, though the pictures were deceptive (made it look bigger than it was). Unfortunately I was in a rush and didn’t read through everything when I booked it, so was surprised that there was not a bathroom in the unit. Also the insects were a little concerning to me.
If I had been expecting to be roughing it a bit, it would have been fine."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place off the beaten path. Exactly as advertised. Well suited for those of us who arrive fed and seek out firm mattresses in quiet places. Especially enjoyed the bird and coyote songs in the afternoon. Don’t miss nearby Thunder Mountain Monument!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"The tiny house was nicely done up, but the lack of running water was unexpected as there was a sink in the pictures. The description said no WiFi connection and this made it difficult to communicate through AirBnB as instructed. It is peaceful as I really love being out of any city lights, at least until rain hit metal roof so loud I could not sleep. It’s like going camping really."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks for hosting us, those stars are incredible!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great little place. The sink didn’t work, I guess cause the water would have to be turned off in the winter so the pipes don’t freeze but that wasn’t mentioned in the description. And the railroad tie building bathrooms in the description were actually locked but there was a port a potty nearby instead which was very clean. Clean and quiet little place in a beautiful setting that served its purpose. It was very cold. The building is not well insulated so the little heater just barely kept the frigid chill down but I piled on all the blankets and slept just fine. The bed is actually a futon and the cushion is pretty thin with a hard frame that you can feel supporting it and cold air kind up seeps up from below. It could use a mattress pad both for comfort and warmth. All in all though it was a good stay. I’ll bet in the summertime it would be amazing."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The surroundings were beautiful and the host was so helpful in printing off my parking pass for me and left it in the room for when I got there! As the other reviews say I would recommend bringing layers/blankets for if your staying in winter months.
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"I loved the location and the views from the windows. When I got there it was 16 degrees so the water was off so only the out house for toilet, which was fine with me. There was drinking water in the room for drinking and coffee. It was cold with only one heater in the room so if you are going in the winter I would request another electric heater. Other than that I would go back again. I was lucky to have a full moon."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was a great little tiny house , loved that i could keep my horses there. the only downfall is no shower. if there was a shower this place would be perfect. we had friends in town luckily to shower at . but over all it was cute and quiet and a beautiful scenery."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren was so accommodating and welcoming, as we tried to book one of the rooms in the house at the very last minute, but someone beat us to it as we were exchanging messages with Warren. Warren then mentioned the other option, the bridal suite, which we jumped on as we were tired and needed to stop for the night. The ranch was easy to find, as was the cottage. While it was very cold outside, the space heater warmed the place up pretty quickly and there were extra blankets available for use. The fridge wasn't plugged in, so we kept our food in our cooler which was not a big deal. The short distance to the rustic and really cute bathrooms was quick and easy, and a nice couple who were camping on the property had a fire going in the firepit near the bathrooms, and invited us to join them if we'd like. It was great to wake and look out the window to see Iron Maiden (LOVE the name!) in the field next to us. What a beautiful wedding facility and great place to overnight. Thanks, Warren!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great star gazing spot!
Couldn't find the showers but also didn't ask much since we were on our way!
Warren accommodated extra sleeping arrangements in advance which was much appreciated!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Warren’s “Haven” was a slice of heaven for us. We had always wanted to experience a stay in a tiny home, and we also wanted something rural and peaceful. This fit the bill perfectly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Simple and just what we needed after an exhausting day of travel. Also, gorgeous area."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"This stay was very nice and secluded, but close to town where I could get food and cell service."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we drove in late and it was easy to find with his instructions. We woke up to a nice view . private cabin but wish the door had a lock . the futons are very small but we slept great.
