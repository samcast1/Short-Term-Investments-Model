2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the second time we've rented this place and I'd like to go back to every visit I visit to California. Certainly I feel at home and the owners are so kind and generous. Highly recommend this beautiful and warm place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great, comfortable space - plenty of amenities, convenient- couldn’t be better."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carol very attentive and helpful loved the place and location
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about how pleasant our accommodations were. The host was wonderful and feels like a new friend, the yard was gorgeous and very relaxing, the kitchen lovely & well equipped, the bathroom perfect,the beds comfy and clean. The neighborhood was lovely and convenient to all I needed. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay. Was able to have a cooking night with some friends — fully stocked kitchen. Couldn’t manage to find a cutting board but had literally everything else. Definitely worth the booking. A nice space to stay at and wonderful garden area too!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Carol’s place! We were out and about often, but when we were in the space it was very relaxing, clean, and private. Beautiful little back yard/patio and a great deal of closet and kitchen space."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute little house, very private and comfy!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Carol's AirBnB. It truly is a Beautiful private guest suite! It is clean, comfortable, and has everything we needed.
The kitchen is large, well equipped, and very clean. This is the first AirBnB I've stayed at where I was comfortable eating off of the dishes without washing them first. I washed a few the first day, but realized it was not necessary, because the dishwasher works well and I never found any residual dirt.
The beds were comfortable and it was quiet. We slept well every night.
The bathroom was clean, had a nice shower, and everything worked well. I especially liked the way the toilet paper dispenser was installed. Most people probably would not even notice, but I thought it was unusual at first until I used it. Then it made sense. The unusual way it is installed makes it work better! You'll have to see it and try it to understand what I am talking about.
Thank you Carol!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol’s place is looks much better than the pictures even! Very clean and beautiful.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and our dogs and I had a lovely stay at Carol’s. The place was very comfortable with lots of seating (as you can see in the photos). I was happily surprised to see they provided bottled water as not all stays do. Our dogs enjoyed the backyard. There was a gap under one of the doors in the enclosed backyard but the hosts proactively put down blocks so our small dogs could run around the backyard without escaping. One of our dogs got to meet their dog, Luca and they got to play together which was cute! Truly one of the most dog-friendly stays (and we travel with our dogs a fair bit)! If we’re in the area again, Carol’s place is at the top of our list."

If I were in this area again, I'd definitely rent here again."

Our only concern was communication - we had a couple significant questions that went unanswered over the period we stayed. Carol resolved to our satisfaction a major snafu on the last evening of our stay. We would recommend this place to others - despite the communication problems."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed at quite a few rental units in Riverside in the last couple of years and Carol's place is by far the nicest place for the money. Everything in the apartment from the appliances to the cabinets to the furniture is almost brand new. Having your own outdoor space is great too!!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most comfortable and spacious BnB that I've stayed in recently, and it was as neat as a pin. The kitchen options were impressive, not the least of which were the real coffee machine and dishwasher. The place felt like part of a home, not a unit fixed up just to serve as a BnB. The hosts responded quickly to my inquiries and were there right away to help when I couldn't open the lock. I would have loved to lounge more on the beautiful, private patio, had my visit been on less windy days."

Carol has a designer’s eye for detail and we were in want of nothing during our weeklong stay - from plush towels and pillows to the well appointed kitchen and lovely little garden in back this place felt cheerful yet refined, and met all our needs. Her choice of colors throughout and the airy, light-filled rooms were super appreciated, as well as the mix of antique and contemporary furnishings. Highly recommend and hope to stay here again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carol was an outstanding hostess. The place is PERFECT for two/three people but as her ad states, not particularly child proof. However our small dogs (we came for a dog show) and my daughter and I were well received and all questions answered promptly. We had a sweet visit with Carol face to face so she could meet out pups. We will forever search her out when we come to the area"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Carol’s place for a few days, it is just as described!! She has great communication. Location was perfect for what we were there for. The beds/pillows and sofa are comfortable, the unit was clean. We took time to enjoy the back yard and relax in the warm California weather. This place is welcoming and so was Carol and Luca!! If in the Riverside area we would most definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay with Carol was very pleasant. The space was clean, spacious, and very open. I booked this place for a spot to rest after work and it provided that and more. The way everything is setup kind of inspired me to rearrange my own place a bit 😆"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Carol has great ""in-law suite"" to share with you! The neighborhood was quiet and it felt safe - and the neighbors we saw were friendly, too! It also has a central location to everything we wanted to do in Riverside. There was plenty of free parking on the street in front of the house and the furnishings were excellent. The private entrance along the side of the house was a big plus for us. The bed was comfortable and it was nice to have an outdoor patio space to hang out in, even though we didn't use it during our short stay. The internet was excellent and the appliances were high-quality. We were aware that Carol was on property during our stay, but the space also felt very private. Overall, the quality of this space was top-notch and that made it a great stay for us! We recommend that you try Carol's space when visiting Riverside! I hope it's available next time we are in the area, for sure. David & Brad"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My friend and I along with our kids stayed here while we attended their parkour finals in Moreno Valley at Firestorm Galaxy ~15 minutes away. The cozy cottage is tucked away behind the main home with a backyard full of lovingly cultivated fruit trees. It is located within walking distance to downtown Riverside, but far enough away to feel safe leaving the windows and French doors open for natural ventilation while we slept. We especially enjoyed relaxing on the patio with cold beverages, a full belly from cooking a meal in their well-appointed kitchen, and friendly dogs, Norman and Annie, welcoming us after a long drive from Northern California. Jennifer and Ken were excellent hosts! The instructions to check in and out were very clear. Inquiries were answered quickly. We'll definitely stay here again if our kids qualify for the finals next year!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is so so cute and the outdoor area also very well kept. This is an excellent choice! I stayed here with my mom and kids while I attended a conference.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay at the cottage! Our daughter loved the dogs right outside and the push car Ken let her use during our stay. We were able to make dinner easily with the kitchen set up and the room had dark out shades perfect for our little sleeper. We will definitely come back when we are in Riverside again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at The Cottage before but this was the first time we stayed in the spring/summer time. Jen and Ken have truly created a lovely place to stay and the outdoor area is beautiful - trees, flowering shrubs, roses, flowers. We loved eating and enjoying a glass of wine outside in the beautiful surroundings. The cottage, of course, was up to its usual high level of cleanliness and cozy decor. We'll be back!"

The fruit trees in the yard were a fun extra."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer, Ken, Annie and Norman were all a delight! It was easy to find the place and the landscaping was gorgeous. Jennifer and Ken met us as we arrived and showed us around the place, explaining the rules and showing us about their beautiful garden.
My friends and I were in town for Coachella, so we weren't there very often, but it was very comfortable for sleeping. We made a few meals and even used a lemon off the tree in the garden. Home was clean and came with basic needs like cutlery, plates, and pans.
Our stay was very pleasant and I would highly recommend this stay to anyone in the Riverside area."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another excellent stay at The Cottage! Since this was our second time booking with Jennifer, this trip felt more like a visit with family rather than with an Air BnB. Everything was exactly as we had remembered, perhaps even better. She may have added an extra luggage rack and blackout curtains since the last time I visited. She was proactive in reaching out the day prior to check-in, and was nice enough to turn on the heater so that the space was warm upon our arrival. There is so much storage space and all the amenities you could need. Her and her husband are both very friendly and hospitable, even offering us fresh fruits from their trees. By far my favorite Air BnB listing, and we look forward to returning again in the future!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Ken were great hosts! We drove from Colorado to move our son into college and we wanted something comfortable and something that felt like home while we went through this big transition. A hotel just didn't seem like the best choice. When I saw ""cottage"" I just knew this was going to be the right place and IT WAS!!! The photos don't do it justice. The backyard with all the fruit trees is so relaxing and Jennifer and Ken were so welcoming. We enjoyed good food at the Food Lab and a memorable beach day at San Clemente. When I say home away from home...this is the place."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've been using Air BnB for about 9 years now and this was by far one of my favorite stays ever! Every aspect was just perfect, we couldn't have asked for more. Jennifer was easy to communicate with before and during the trip. She was sweet and hospitable -- she greeted us upon arrival with a quick tour of the guest suite, which is as lovely in person as it is in the photos, and she also bid us farewell on the morning we left. All details of the listing are accurate. We were in town for a music festival at the NOS center, which was a quick 15 minute drive away. Every little detail made our trip perfect, from the blackout curtains over the bedroom windows to the automatic outdoor lights that would light our path to the guest sweet when we returned from the concert late at night. We didn't have trouble finding street parking. In fact, we hardly saw any other people in the neighborhood, which was very quiet and peaceful. We truly look forward to booking again in the future!"

Checking in was seamless and Jennifer was very prompt with any questions/communication. There are multiple restaurants within a 2-3 minute drive of their location, which was particularly convenient for us given our busy schedule. Street parking is not an issue as it requires a permit, which Jennifer provided to us upon arrival.
The Airbnb was very clean and has a full kitchen. There are two beds, one in the bedroom and one futon in the living room. Both were very comfortable for us and there were ample blankets, sheets and pillows to ensure comfort. We had no issues with any amenities during our stay and were very comfortable.

It is not possible to see the cottage from the street, so it is very private. The yard is like a small botanic garden with lots of very interesting plants, and trees. The hosts are knowledgeable about the area, and were available, but they also respected our privacy. Literally, a few steps away from the cottage, is the entry to the wonderful Mt. Rubidoux trail. We highly recommend this property."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay and amenities. The outdoor patio is gorgeous and parking is convenient. Jennifer and Ken were super kind and they had a cute and playful dog named Norman. I would recommend this cottage for a great stay!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Ken’s casita is an awesome place to stay in Riverside. We stayed five nights and loved every bit of it. The casita is perfect and is exactly as described. It was immaculately clean, bright and totally comfortable. The location is also great with walkability to downtown and the many shops and restaurants. Jen and Ken were wonderful hosts and provided suggestions for daily excursions and restaurants in the area. I appreciated that Jen and Ken were very quick to respond to every communication. We would not hesitate to stay with Jen and Ken on our next visit to Riverside."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Cottage is a charming, special oasis of lush fruit trees and landscaping that is located conveniently to goods and services and for exploring the Inland Empire.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer and Ken are the most thoughtful airbnb host. Upon arriving we were greeted with freshly baked blueberry muffins and homemade granola and yogurt. The location of the cottage was walking distance to everything! We grabbed food at Downtown Riverside and hiked the Mt. Rubidoux trail within the comfort of only walking less than a mile. The space had all the necessary amenities and extra special touches throughout the property that made the stay enjoyable. Highly recommend this location if you are you planning to stay in Riverside.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was spotless and in a charming location. Located at the hills where there are lots of trails and gardens to walk around. A short walk from downtown and just far enough away to have a peaceful weekend. Recommend this stay to many!

2024-04-01,3,Stayed about a week,"I Don’t want to complain, but I got there. The Wi-Fi code that they showed on the plaque did not correspond with what the Wi-Fi code was.
The sheets were polyester, and the bedding was not very comfortable
The kitchen didn’t have any potholders
The noise from the house being connected one night there was a young kid crying and screaming another night, a Chihuahua was barking. early morning, cupboards, opening, closing, and clanging from the people who live in the Connected house, the gentleman that lived in the house was running an air ratchet in the garage, which was the wall off of the guest facility
All I was disappointed with the noise factor that you could hear everything that was going on in the house. I didn’t go to stay with the family. I want to stay alone and I did not realize how loud it would be everything that happened in their place, I could hear.
If you’re looking for a quiet location, don’t stay there if you’re looking to stay with the family then stay there"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,The house had lots of fun games and entertainment for the family and we felt right at home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. I can honestly say everything was extremely clean and well kept. The backyard was our favorite, it was relaxing and had a lot to do. The master bathroom was amazing! It was large and had a huge tub that was just relaxing, great for a long day.
Only thing I would point out is that the house is not as private, you do share the property with another one as well as parking, but it's made in a way where it's not a hassle. The house is not as big but the backyard and the coziness of the inside makes up for it. I think the biggest request would be for T.Vs in all rooms because the only T.V is in the living room. Honestly these are little things compared to the comfort we got from this place. Overall I would recommend this place and would love to book again with Edder."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved this air bnb ! It was so clean and smelled wonderful. There was plenty to do at the house as well .

We easily found Edder's place in the AirBNB search as it had the number of bedrooms we needed and was close to the CBU Baseball stadium and we were in town to watch our nephew play. The backyard gaming area was fantastic and a great place for our family and friends to gather after the games. We appreciated the clean, newly remodeled bathrooms. It was an easy choice and at a rate that was similar to a single hotel room. Plenty of parking in front and also on the side street. Easy walk to a really nice park, which my teenage boys enjoyed as they were able to play catch without crossing any busy streets. Thank you for hosting our family!"

Other than that and the noise of the cars from that main road everything else was great. My family would book again.

The location wasn’t to far from restaurants or shopping and the neighborhood was quiet . I loved the privacy in the back yard and the amenities set up if we wanted to just stay at the location and relax. I would definitely recommend for others and maybe visit again if available when we return."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Decent place to stay and visit the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not hesitate to book this property—it looks and feels just as good in person as in the photos. We came with our 7 kids (and 1 cousin) and we all were very comfortable. The TV, the appliances, the bathrooms and, my goodness, THE BACKYARD make this place a paradise. Whenever we had downtime the kids were outside playing pool, connect 4, and ping pong. We grown ups didn’t have to deal with boredom from the children as much. Just as importantly everyone was still able to stretch out each night and sleep well.
There is a wonderful Mexican restaurant 2 miles away (Olivia’s—they’ve been around 45 years) and a Food 4 Less grocery store (Kroger brands) just around the corner. California avenue is a rather busy road but i don’t remember hearing road noise from inside.
The hosts are extremely responsive and work hard to see that everything smoothly.We had a slight mishap while we were there and they were very responsive and ultimately very fair in the resolution.
Will book again!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The outside area was a gorgeous place with strung lights that allowed both adult and kids to interact together playing ping pong, foosball, connect 4, and bean bag toss. The gas fire pit was strong enough to heat those gathering around. It was nice to have separate lounging, dining, and game area for all.
The master bedroom was spacious with a comfortable rocking recliner as well as a beautiful bathroom. The living room was also another comfortable gathering area. We came as an extended family of 7 to celebrate a graduation at UCR and it was perfect! If you don't mind doubling up on a bed you could easily sleep 10.
The host was responsive and the stay went without a hitch.
Will definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This house was absolutely beautiful. I loved everything about it. It was very clean and had everything we needed.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"I had an amazing stay!! The host was so friendly and quick with fluid communication. Everything was as described, and my god the backyard is beautiful. Although the description says no parties, I asked the host for permission and they very graciously let me host a 17-person grad event here last night for an additional fee— and it was a BLAST! The beds were comfortable for the few who stayed the night, space was so clean, and house rules/information were clearly laid out in a binder in the living room. If you want a small get-together with friends to just chill, have a quiet getaway, or what have you- this Airbnb is perfect for that! :) definitely will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great stay! The host is very nice and the home is exactly like photos! Would stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,It was a perfect stay! Exactly what we were looking for in the Riverside area. Close to everything a person could need but remote enough to feel like a get away.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a WONDERFUL stay at this rental! Edder was a very professional host who communicated quickly, he had clear house instructions, and he was very friendly.

We will gladly stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was an absolute pleasure staying here. The host was extremely responsive. I needed a printer to print some documents for work and, they even dropped the printer off to us. He was always proactive to accommodate anything we needed. The house felt like home. Plenty of games to play and enough space for our family. I cannot think of anything they should change. We appreciated every day we spent at the house. So grateful for good people who make this world a better place. Worth the money we spent for sure. We will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! We enjoyed every inch of this place! Living room was so comfy and nice! Tv came with Netflix, YouTube! KITCHEN WAS A DREAM! We got to cook our fav meals and enjoy them as a family. Kitchen is full! Plates cups pots pans and silverware all there for us to use. I loved the Keurig with sugar and creamer all in one spot. All rooms have Queen and king size beds! We slept so goood! Bathrooms had makeup towels and shower towels. Nice shower and bathtub! The host knew what he is doing! Super communicative. Edder responds fast! And he is super kind and helpful! The best part? The lounge and play area in the back! WHOEVER CHOOSES TO STAY HERE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! We loved playing pool and all the games offered. The fire place was easy to turn on and feels cozy! They even provided lighters! Like what!? Haha all appliances were nice and worked well! We would definitely stay here again. 5 star review all around! Thankyou Edder for everything! This is truly an amazing home!!!"

My party and I were amazed by this place because of how clean and nice it was. All the amenities included is definitely worth every penny. Loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely home and great hosts!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m short, this place is nice but I feel there are some things that can be improved. I stayed here for my wedding and while my wife stayed a few miles away at a more affordable place. The addition of the fire pit and game tables was great but out of the multiple pool cues available, only 3-4 were in shape to be used. There was a dart board with more broken darts so we avoided even playing that. Likewise, there were more broken ping pong balls than good ones so, again, we avoided playing that too.
The reason why I mention my wife’s bnb is because their host stocked the fridge with snacks and beverages. I had a long day and didn’t get into this bnb until midnight and something as simple as a couple waters would have been so great! For paying nearly my month’s rent for a few nights, something little like this, and well-maintained game equipment, would have made this feel so much more worthwhile and worth my dollar."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay and had a great night ! Affordable price for what it is !
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Edder was the perfect host, professional, friendly, and welcoming. His home has great indoor and outdoor amenities and made a great staycation. We would love to stay at his home again."

My girls and I felt safe and stayed outside really late to enjoy the space.
The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to make a nice meal.
The TV sitting room is so comfy and perfect for movie watching.
The other safety measure he takes is the door entry. He does something special so you ABSOLUTELY KNOW the code is specific for every guest and it hasn't been reused.
The mattresses are top notch! such a comfy sleep!
This is a great GREAT STAY for a large or small group!!"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,This Airbnb was great. Very clean. Host was responsive. One thing to note is that they have roosters right next door so you’ll be able to hear them pretty easily in the morning. I had earplugs so it didn’t bother me.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,super nice place great for parents with teens
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Cont.-The other can be converted into a pingpong table. It had a corn hole game and connect 4. It also had a nice-sized couch with an electronic bonfire and a long table with a long table where you could dine and use for whatever reason. We set up our Thanksgiving table there with the intention to eat there but it was too cold. It’s all good. We still used it in the morning and hung out there at night. The chilly night was not really a trouble because whenever we felt cold, we just hung out near the fire by the couches. It’s such a friendly, entertaining place. My elderly parents want to go back already and we would certainly will. His place is also close to Mission Inn that had ongoing events like the Festival Lights. We wanted to go but we were having so much fun at Edder’s place so we just ended up going after check out. I’ve been to MANY bnbs and this certainly is my absolute favorite for my family - like a weekend spent with my folks and my siblings. Thank you, Edder and family!💖"

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Edder’s home was an absolute treat! We had our thanksgiving there. I was able to cook a feast for my family because of the spaciousness of his kitchen. It had basic tools available. I brought some of mine because I need a bigger pots. We were able to buy these and essential things we needed because stores were really accessible nearby. It was a smooth experience from check in until checkout. Eder was a very, very good host; not the prying kind. We were able to enjoy or stay without feeling like we were walking on eggshells. More importantly, the place was immaculately, clean new and modern looking. The rooms were spacious. The beds were absolutely comfortable. The masters bedroom was huge and so is its bathroom. It was six of us in the family, but I believe that it can absolutely accommodate way more. Our favorite part of it is it’s backyard. It’s a large spacious entertainment backyard that had well-kept facilities. The pool table had complete items, and there were two of them."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great host!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for hosting! The place was prefect for our 10 people. The backyard was a great place to gather, eat, make s’mores and have a cocktail or a few bottle of wine.
Outside game was pretty cool! The home was very cozy . We were there for a funeral @ Riverside National Cemetery and the location was 25 mins away. Alot of restaurants/grocery stores on the main street (Van Burden Blvd).
I have a very picky family.. their only complaint was no tv in the master bedroom, but i can see that is in the works. Oh, and no can opener (lol) .
The couches was great to lounge and nap in. Beds were nice and comfortable.
There was more then enough towels/wash cloths (thank you!) w/shampoo/body soap.
You have included everything we needed in our stay, including coffee and nice selection of tea!
Easy check in, with easy to remember passcode for the door.
I am so happy I found this gem and it was available for our stay. Thank you again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Edder was a fantastic host and we couldn’t have enjoyed our stay any more than we did.

The apartment was a great size, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The location is also super walkable to downtown Riverside: we didn't need to move the car once we got there! Mario was incredibly helpful and proactive in communicating with us. He had some good recommendations too! Would recommend The Jazz Room! :)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my very first Airbnb experience, and a great one at that! A beautiful and dynamic space adorned with a very cool jazz loungue theme. Had the feel of an apartment; living room (w/ kitchen), bathroom, bedroom and walk in closet all neatly separated. Mario was indeed a kind and gracious host. The only quibble I had was the sound of the train horn every few hours. Otherwise a truly wonderful place at a reasonable price!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mario is a great host 👌🏼
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute loft in a great, walkable location. It’s about a 10 minute walk to the shops and restaurants, and it’s a super pleasant walk mostly through neighborhood roads. We had a bit of trouble sleeping due to a nearby rail line and train crossing, which I only mention because we didn’t see many other mentions of this. Mario was super friendly and accommodating."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Mario was very friendly and helpful! His place was very neat and clean. My boyfriend and I loved our stay and will possibly come back!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jazz room was a great place to stay. Mario was very nice, quick response time. The mini suite itself was very quaint. The place was clean and comfortable. Like the decor, felt right at home, comfy bed. The place is walkable distance to downtown. I chose this spot because it was close to the concert venue at the Riverside theater, which i walked back from. The only thing that I can say about cons was the train that woke me up, pretty loud. If I need a place to stay again in downtown Riverside, I would stay here again, for a quick one nighter."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Mario is friendly and offered helpful recommendations, he checked in by text to make sure all was well. The space was very clean and you can tell he takes pride in it. He shared delicious grapefruits he grows right on his trees. It is clear why Mario is a super host. The kitchenette has what you need to make simple meals. The room is private and quiet. It is a great place to stay for longer stays, for business or leisure. It is in walking distance from downtown where there is plenty to do and a farmers market every Saturday."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Mario was such a nice host. The bed was comfortable and the linens felt nice. The A/C was perfect and the fans on the ceiling were also a PLUS! I loved that the floors were not carpet and neat. The fact that the place has a fridge and a freezer were great for a hot summer at Riverside. I saw no bugs at the place which was great. I would come again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I spent the day with my girlfriends at the spa so my husband and I decided to stay close by and explore Riverside. This place is perfect for a couple!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at Mario's! First of all, it is so rare to find an air bnb these days that is hosted by an actual person who you get to meet! Not a company or something! Mario came out and helped me carry my bags up to the suite! It was so nice. The apartment itself was sparsely decorated but had everything that one would need and wasn't cluttered. I had a lovely time there and slept well. It is near the train that runs right through riverside so bringing a pair of ear plugs might not be a bad idea. It is within walking distance of downtown riverside through mostly neighborhoods and there were so many flowers blooming, it made for a lovely walk. The apartment is very spacious, I was there a lone and it was more than enough space!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful peaceful home with a lot of things to do in downtown riverside would recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, safe and quiet. Stayed for a week while commuting to UCR. No complaints."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Jazz Room was super cool! The decor was all fitting to the jazz theme. Mario was super welcoming and accommodating, he sent daily check ins to make sure we were settled. It was a nice space, I think a transformed attic. It had great central AC/Heating and lots of storage space. The cats in the neighborhood were super cute too!! The only downside would be that the towels and other amenities seemed noticeably used which gave a bit of a bad taste, but not a huge deal. It was overall a great stay!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive and helpful. Place was in a nice neighborhood close to the convention center which was why I was in Riverside. Great recommendations and very easy to work with. Enjoyed being there over a hotel and the price point was perfect!

The listing was walking distance from the Festival of Lights and we had plenty of parking available to us. The listing itself was clean and had plenty of amenities for my guest and I to use. For the location and price, it is truly a hidden gem for anyone looking to stay in downtown riverside :)"
2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,Great location. The place was as described however the furnishings and amenities were the bare minimum. Couch and bed were uncomfortable in my opinion.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Very clean and enjoyed my stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The suite is very conveniently located in a quiet downtown neighborhood. Mario gave me a friendly welcome on arrival and wrote back quickly when I had questions. I was able to do some remote work while there thanks to a strong Wifi connection and separate desk area in the larger room. Would stay there again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my second time staying with Mario. I used to live in Riverside and it's great to stay so close to downtown.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mario's place was lovely! this little apartment had everything you needed and was very spacious. It was very clean and comfortable.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a wonderful long term stay at Mario's home! I appreciated all of the amenities including centralized AC (perfect for Riverside hot weather), kitchenette with a fridge, and ample street parking. Mario was a wonderful host and gave me food recommendations and even some of his homegrown grapefruits. Two things to note: there is no washer/dryer, and the home is located close to railroad tracks so you may hear trains at night. Overall I would recommend this stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is on a quiet historic street and was the perfect location for a work trip where I needed to be close to downtown Riverside but was budget conscious so wanted a more reasonable price than hotels. The unit has it’s own A/C control which is great especially with the hot weather plus fans. Lots of restaurants within 6 blocks walk or a quick ride. Mario was very personable and kind enough to share some delicious grapefruits from his tree. Bedroom is very spacious, bathroom had plenty of room and living area just right with a kitchenette, fridge, freezer, stovetop, etc. Street parking was plentiful."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay was the most convenient and comfortable stay for a quick trip to the city! Mario was very kind and recommended a pretty nice attraction happening the night we stayed. I would stay again!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mario is quite possibly one of the coolest guys I’ve had the pleasure of meeting! This was actually my first time booking an Airbnb and I was nervous, but I no longer am after staying at Mario’s! He is a very accommodating and hospitable host, very respectful, always responds in a timely manner, and overall a great guy to talk with. He gave us a mini detail tour of the space and told us about “hot spots” around Riverside. Overall, it a wonder experience and I will definitely be looking for Mario’s spots when I go to Cali again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There’s no catch here folks; We stayed for such a cheap price during the 4th of July. Mario was a very social, communicative, and not to forget; a GREAT host. The suite itself was amazing. We had everything; TWO refrigerators, a kitchenette, a nice mini dining table, and a comfortable bed to top it all off. The decoration was superb. I’d love to stay here again. It’s worth the bang for your buck."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Jazz Room was almost unbelievable in its location, relaxed vibe, and style!
TWO fridges, the biggest TV I’ve ever seen, linens that ushered me off to sleep as soon as my head hit the pillow and an absolute WONDERLAND of a neighborhood (fans of architecture, take some time to walk around, there are MidCench, Arts & Crafts darlings, and regal Victorians within a single block!) full of shady whispering trees and NO high traffic street noise. Stable WiFi, good water pressure and temp!
I don’t know what one could possibly ask for above what this place has, but it was everything I needed and more!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay. The host picked us fresh grapefruit from his tree. Was so good! He also has an avacado tree across the street, but there wasn't any for picking. Very close to downtown. We walked and it was no problem. Mario was a very nice guy would stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Great host! Highly recommended 👍

Mario was very insightful in suggesting some of the best places to eat! (none disappointed!) If you need a good suggestion on what to eat or see in Riverside, Mario will offer some great suggestions!
We also received some of the best avocados from Mario you could ever eat! (Better than what was in the store)
Overall, we highly recommend this stay and would recommend it to anyone’s first time in Riverside!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mario’s Place was in a super convenient location and great if visiting mission inn or working in the Riverside area. Looks exactly like the photos also. Completely Private. Mario was fast at communicating and the avocados and grapefruits were a huge plus.
My only negative would be you can hear his family from your apt although they’ll try their best to keep the noise down. Not always great for night shift workers .
Mario was a great host! Would recommend his place for short or long term stays!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a beautiful apartment and loved everything wish I could stay longer I would go back again and again it makes u feel like your at home . Thank you to the host Mario made us feel so comfortable thank u once again

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mario is the best host we've met. He's a genuinely hospitable and jovial person who knows how to make his guests feel welcomed. Music is a huge part of his life and that's reflected in the theme of his house, with superb pictures of performing Jazz artists adorning the rooms. He took those pictures himself and each one has its own story. Additionally, Mario's fascinating anecdotes about his experiences and accomplishments in the music scene make for engaging and intriguing coversation. It would be remiss of anyone who's in need of lodging to overlook his place in Riverside, CA."

A private entrance leads you to a nice living room area with a large TV and couch, plus a dining area with a mini fridge. Then there's a private hallway to a renovated bathroom and a spacious bedroom with a large closet. I would love to stay here again in the future."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mario was a great host! We spent quite a bit of time talking with Mario the next day after a very long trip from Missouri and checking in very late the night before. His apartment was just what we needed. Clean, comfortable, roomie and safe."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only had a few short hours to stay in the area but the absolute highlight for us was getting to stay at The Jazz Room. Great location. The whole neighborhood is very charming but The Jazz Room in particular feels like a home on its own. You can tell that a lot of care was taken in creating and maintaining the space. We even got to meet our host Mario and try some of the grapefruits from his garden! We could not have had a better host or a better experience this weekend. If you have the time, we highly recommend to stay here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow this place was way bigger than we thought and was perfect for my boyfriend and I to work in. Mario is a photographer and has many of his photos in the unit which is very cool. We had such a nice time and will definitely be back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We're happy we have chosen Mario's Jazz Room for our stay in Riverside. Firstly, we liked the apartment, which was nicely decorated, tidy and quite conveniently arranged. The bathroom is huge and in the kitchen you'll find everything you need for some basic cooking activities. Secondly, we liked Mario himself. He was super quick to respond, always helpful and friendly and up for a chat. He even supplied us with some fresh grapefruits from his garden, that was awesome. The location of the apartment is quite good; very close to the city center. Parking is easy as well. We can definitely recommend The Jazz Room and hope to be back when the avocados in the garden are ripe..."

I might have read the description wrong, but didn’t know the vanity and bathroom and shower was shared with another guest. This meant I had to wait in my scrubs after a long day at the hospital for over 90 minutes to use the bathroom and shower!
Bring your own shampoo and conditioner. Options weren’t great and bottles were almost mostly finished.
You’ll love the bed if super soft mattress is your thing.
So glad her place cut my drive to half though this weekend :)"

Overall a great experience."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here as a solo traveler for eight nights in the winter. This was a clean and comfortable cottage in Riverside, near CBU. It’s in a quiet, residential neighborhood with easy access to highway 91. It is well-designed and managed. Kitchen was appropriately stocked and had updated appliances and amenities. I especially appreciated the provided laundry supplies and coffee. It was a great stay, and I was so happy I booked here instead of a similarly-priced hotel.
A few items to note: the driveway, when another car is parked, can be a bit of a squeeze if your car isn’t compact. It’s doable; just takes extra caution. Secondly, the cottage is on a property that is shared with two other cottages (possibly other Airbnb guests), so the porch and yard are not private spaces.
Overall, I would recommend this place to others and would book again given the opportunity."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was just as nice as the pictures, Nicole was very helpful and friendly. We really liked the area, the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. Close to restaurants, easy check in and check out. I would definitely stay here again."

The layout is thoughtful and the interior is pleasant and comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied with dishes, cookware and utensils. The wifi was secure and strong. The studio sits well back from the street (which is a quiet residential street) and I had a quiet private stay even though there were guests in the other two places most of the time I was there. The parking is a bit tight but Nicole's arrival instructions are clear and helpful. It was a great 'home away from home' while I had to be out of my house.
Nicole responded to my inquiries very quickly each time I contacted her. I would certainly stay with her again."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nicole's studio is an excellent space. It has everything any traveler would need (TV, wifi, laundry, off-street parking, stove, microwave, frig, household supplies, etc.). Located close to various shopping options if needed as well. Just a very quiet, safe space for a short term or longer term traveler."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved everything about the stay!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space w wonderful communication
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stayed at Nicole and Anthony's place for an entire month. It was a very pleasant experience. I was especially impressed by:
1. Stylish and modern interior decor: from the color matching furniture and beddings, to a 55 inch hanging smart TV and a QI wireless charging alarm clock, you will be pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful designs and the amount of technologies contained in this little studio.
2. Attention to details: you will find that every switch /cupboard inside the studio are clearly labeled. It is obvious that the hosts have thoroughly considered all aspects of a guest's needs, at least it has everything I needed during my monthlong stay. For example, on-site washer & dryer (with detergents), a full-size kitchen (with cookware utensils and even ingredients), Keurig machine and pods, cleaning supplies, and even spare linen/towels!
3. Timely and clear communications from the host: although I did not meet either Nicole or Anthony, but they were always available to answer my questions during my entire stay- usually within minutes.
4. Conveniently located and great value: within 5 minutes of driving you can find grocery stores, Walmart, restaurants, banks, and medical clinics. It is also very close to the highway. Although it is not located right in downtown Riverside, but the neighborhood (Arlington) is safe, quiet and just a 10- minute drive to downtown Riverside. You cannot find a better deal in this area considering the amount of amenities this place provides.
But do keep in mind that it is a small (but functional) studio, and can get quite warm during summer months due to poor ventilation. You will not likely to enjoy this place if you cannot tolerate living in small spaces, or cannot stand air-conditioning being on most of the time. Lastly, it has a full-sized bed. So if you are taller than 6 ft you might wish to find a place with a bigger bed. All in all I would 10/10 recommend this place to any travelers, and I will most definitely stay at Nicole and Anthony's place again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely would stay here again!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Clean and very good hosts.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Very clean, easy to access, with beautiful views! Only con was lack of hand soap and limited toilet paper, but we were able to pick some up. Provided many other things like bowls, pots, pans, blankets. Accommodated 25 people relatively comfortably, although mattresses were a bit firm. No issues! Would definitely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"10/10 We had a basketball team with 5 families stay here. Everything was excellent. Tons of room & pics don’t do the view justice. It was a beautiful home!!
Tip: bring extra trash bags, hand soap etc. it was very limited. When I inquired, They offered to bring us more, but we just went and bought it. With 16 people we couldn’t wait. (Trash bags were paper thin )"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as described. Only con for us was parking. House is in a cul-de-sac and the neighbors are very stingy with the spaces in front of their homes.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect for two. Plenty of space in master bedroom. Kitchen was great for cooking. Living room and dining area worked great for us.

Would definitely stay there again if we are in Riverside."
