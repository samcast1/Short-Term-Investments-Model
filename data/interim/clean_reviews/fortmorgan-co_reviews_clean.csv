Property isn't fully fenced so if you have pets you'll have to walk them on a leash. The unit itself is decent. Comfortable beds and a lot of natural light comes in which was nice.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place
Secluded and peaceful
Easy to get into and the bedding smelled freshly washed.
The rain prevented us from staying the full night since we couldn’t heat the place up with the gas put inside the tent. But overall, we would love to come back and enjoy it during the summer! Horses and beautiful views all around!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a unique and fun spot! Just as pictured and peaceful. Even though temps dropped down to 50 overnight it stayed surprisingly comfortable inside!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, would recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at this location. While a storm prevented us from being able to use the outdoor fire pit we were able to hang out on the hammock for a while before retreating inside. It was very cozy and the indoor fire pit was easy to use and kept us warm. It was comfortable and clean and very peaceful with the occasional sounds from the horses or roosters nearby. We definitely enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a perfect pick for a last minute overnight getaway to celebrate my wife and I’s 18th wedding anniversary. The campsite was clean, ready and exactly what we were looking for. This was definitely a hidden gem only 45 min from home. We will be back for sure!
As a bonus, I woke up early to hear the faint sounds of lions roaring in the distance. Yes, I forgot it would be close to the wild animal sanctuary in Keensburg. I felt like we were literally waking in Africa this morning. We had a good laugh and yes actual went to the sanctuary the next day to see who was calling! Just added a little more excitement to our TeePee glamping experience! Thank you Ted and Erica for everything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. It even rained heavy on and off and it was honestly even better! The sound of the rain inside the teepee is magical.
I was worried about airplane/highway/work on the ranch noise being an issue but it was not at all. Perfect getaway. Would 10000% recommend and have already shared the unit listing with friends. Thank you for a perfect night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Teds place was adorable and a great little get away from the city! Nothing will beat the sitting around watching the stars all night.
2023-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful and very relaxing. We were prepared for bugs & outdoors, not a big deal for us. We love the outdoors!
The winds were VERY high that night which caused issues with the tent. It wasn't tied down enough so began to lift and move from winds. We had checked weather before booking but didn't say about winds. Ended up sleeping in our car.
If you book, just make sure to check the weather.
Otherwise definitely recommend staying for the experience and how beautiful creation is at the place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great experience, I'd like to come back. Beautiful location and a lovely teepee. During my one night there was an awesome thunderstorm but I was perfectly dry and warm in the bed.
A word of advice to travelers: the mosquitoes can get inside at night time, though they weren't too bad. Also, planes can pass quite close even in the middle of the night so light sleepers might want to bring earplugs."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little teepee! Bring bug spray

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful space. So cozy and peaceful. The whole area that you’re given is everything you need to disconnect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 10 year and I came a night while visiting some friends. It was a great experience to sleep in a teepee. It was very clean, and the bathroom was spotless. My only wish is that there was another one, so my husband and older son could share in the fun."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique experiences I’ve ever done. It was so cool to stay in a tepee! The rain against the teepee made it all worth it despite the weather, along with an amazing lightning show after a sunset. Dozens of horses to pet nearby and it felt very welcoming. You get all sorts of nature sounds and a camping feel with grilling and a fire."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super fun
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deko ranch is located not far from Denver, but you’d never know it. We were surprised at how quickly the bustle of the city faded away, giving way to vast farmland, beautiful homes, lots of cows, and the last stretch of the drive was even on a dirt road (but well graded, easy for any vehicle). The ranch has easy signage pointing us to the teepee. We didn’t see the hosts, but the privacy was nice. We had our own little access to the creek, fire pit, hammock, and picnic table. The weather was perfect, even when it started raining after sunset. The patter of droplets on the canvas was so peaceful and we drifted off to sleep in the cozy bed."

BBQ, hammock, outdoor fire pit, indoor fire pit was the best addition, very clean bathroom with lights for night, tiki torches! We loved visiting the horses and enjoyed the stars. It is in the flight path of DIA so we did get some airplane traffic all night but did not deter our stay! The teepee is decorated so cute! Quick trip from Denver, it made for a perfect quick get away!"

Exactly as advertised, they literally have all of the essentials for you (just basic stuff though, like a grill, plenty of wood for the fire, the cleanest porta potty I’ve ever been in AND you can wash your hands in a tiny built in sink) we did bring coolers with drinks and food. But overall it was a perfect dreamy romantic getaway. definitely booking again in the future ❣️"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great quiet getaway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted has an incredible property. You drive directly through the barn seeing all the horses and cows. We strolled through the barn area at sunset to say hi to the horses before coming back to start a fire and cook dinner. The teepee was spotless and cool at night. You will want some warm clothes late at night/early morning. Although it didn’t matter to us, the creek is very dirty and smelly. We discovered this after our dog tried to jump in. Overall, the stay was absolutely perfect!
We will be coming back. Thank you Ted!"

The horses on the property were very friendly and the hosts were kind enough to let our kids pet them (several times).
There was a porter potty behind the TP which was very clean and convenient. No outlets of course so if you need a charger bring a portable one!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A slice of country heaven! This place is pure tranquility and nostalgic. I will absolutely be coming again.
Thanks for the opportunity to unplug!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my second stay and I really enjoy it. You are definitely living in Indian country with some upgrades :-). The bed was soft and the indoor fire ring kept the teepee warm on a chilly night. I will definitely stay again.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great! Ted was responsive and kind. The place was in a great location and the pictures are a good representation of what the place is actually like. Fire inside was incredible, deck was great, and the fire pit outside with the picnic table was perfect. Overall, it was exactly what we were looking for in a night away and I will absolutely come back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome staycation
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful couples get away! Great sunset and perfect for quality time together catching up and unplugging
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying at this secluded teepee! It was super cute and clean! We enjoyed being able to look at the horses nearby and lounge on the deck. Would definitely recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our first time staying in a tipi and it was amazing. Ted and Erica have created such a comfortable stay that you don’t even realize that you’re “camping”. You have everything you need and more. The horses and cows were close by so we made sure to pay them a visit. The farm is a perfect getaway. We wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome little piece of paradise. Will stay again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous Property!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to spend the evening, arrived very late and left very early in the morning and were accommodating. Very helpful and ready to answer questions. The teepee was in a great location far enough away from the owners house and the road. Very comfortable bed and place to spend the night."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay at the teepee was an amazing experience. We had such a relaxing and unique experience. Everything was clean and comfortable. The animals were all beautiful and every person we met was super friendly. We will definitely be back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Need bug spray!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,expect to have a good time
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun place to stay! The location was great, very quiet and secluded. It’s far enough away from owners home that you don’t feel too close. Loved hearing the animals and lounging on the comfy bed. They had a very clean portapotty behind the tipi so there’s not a long walk to the barn bathroom. Super fun!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tipi was a super cool spot! It ended up being too warm for us to stay and would have been nice to have a fan of some kind. We knew we were signing up for ""glamping"" though! In the cooler months this would be an amazing and cozy spot! The hosts were great to communicate with and very understanding."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place! Wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fun experience for one night.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique and peaceful experience here. Comfortable bed, lots of amenities inside, and so cool to see the horses nearby on the property. We came in the summer so the little stream nearby wasn't really moving at all, but it was still a very relaxing atmosphere."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Teepee! It was great waking up with the horses and the birds. I would recommend staying at the Teepee!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was so beautiful! Not far from Denver and a lot of other great attractions too.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time!! Coolest air bnb we’ve been to yet!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,AMAZING! We loved staying here and will be back again. Such a relaxing night !
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great!!!! It’s not enough space for 4 ( was 2 adults and 2 kids) but if it 2 persons it very comfortable. Thank you
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything as advertised the perfect peaceful getaway!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful. You are nowhere near anyone else camping or glamping. Loved the baby bull!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical glamping experience! Very peaceful and private atmosphere by the creek.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted’s place was great! It was 100 degrees when during our stay so if you’re staying in the summer, a battery operated fan might be nice to bring! Great location. Near stores, gas stations, restaurants, liquor store etc. stars were beautiful at night."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous property & only 15 minutes to Barr Lake and Brighton. Sunrises and sets were our favorite parts. Can’t wait to stay again!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The teepee is set apart from the ranch so is very private, and looks amazing. The interior is as shown in the pictures - very instagramable! We didn't have enough firewood so Ted very kindly brought us more as well as extra gas for the inside fire. Having a campfire in the middle of nowhere was great, and we really enjoyed seeing the animals on the ranch.
The only downside of the teepee is that it has lots of places for bugs to get in - through the roof, the door, the floor etc, so we had loads of flies inside in the evening and in the morning we were woken up by mosquitoes buzzing around our heads. If you can mitigate the flies or they don't bother you then this is the perfect getaway :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the greatest Airbnb we have ever stayed at!!!! It is so incredibly cool, Ted is super cool, and so are his animals. They had some baby cows when we stayed, as well as miniature horses. Can’t describe how fun it was to stay here. 1000/10"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little getaway spot close to Denver.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The teepee was really comfy inside and stayed surprisingly warm even on a colder, rainy night. The location on the farm is very serene and we would've definitely taken advantage of sitting around and enjoying it more if the weather had been drier. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others looking for a peaceful getaway that's only a short drive from Denver."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The reviews are true! Great place. Bring a battery operated fan if your staying during a hot week though.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a must! Such a unique place and worth every penny! Super clean and unique and great amenities!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great relaxing weekend away!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun and unique place to stay. We went to the Wild Animal Sanctuary which is just a few minutes from the teepee and had a great time seeing all the animals! We enjoyed the outdoor firepit and star gazing as well!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would recommend bringing a fly swat and a lighter for the amenities and the flys that are present during the day
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was nice and quiet, everything was perfect. Would highly recommend staying there."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute place. Thanks!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As advertised. Fun way to spend a night.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This ranch is simply beautiful. The teepee is very comfortable, and was almost like staying in a hotel. Expect your the only one there, very secluded. Our first time “glamping” and we highly recommend it!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted, Erica and DeKo Ranch are such a delight. The unique stay creates a great experience but the little details and touches the hosts gave to the space, along with the location are extremely special!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A true gem that allows you to truly escape - friendly hosts, elegant teepee, serene setting."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to ""glamp,"" exactly as described!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love this property. The owners are super nice and accommodating. The animals are so cute, especially the cat! Loved sausage! I definitely hope to come back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely fantastic! Our kids loved it and loved exploring the property. The teepee was plenty big for a family of four.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a perfect get away. There are not amenities provided than you would expect. Bathrooms were very clean and felt even more open and relaxing than in the pictures. I would say to follow their directions to a T, as the GPS is not great at getting you there."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful experience! Cannot recommend this AirBnB enough. Very clean and comfortable and they even added a portapotty right behind the teepee so you dont have to wall to the barn. Potty was very clean no odor at all.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great getaway place to stay! So beautiful and very clean!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Farm is a on cute! Loved all the animals.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Ted’s teepee!!!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Really nice area with a creek, bbq, and horseshoes. The bed was super comfy and warm."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted’s place was magical! What a fun way to get away from it all! We saw horses, cows, turtles, frogs, and so many different types of birds! It was very cool to be so close to nature without sacrificing comfort! The teepee was very comfortable and everything we needed was provided - even pre-cut fire wood! I’d highly recommend staying here!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was very unique than any other airbnbs. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very easy to get to. I was hoping we would get then sooner than we did but still I loved it. I didn’t know my phone wouldn’t have a signal so the only thing I wanted to ask for was the bbq lighter so I could light the gas heater in the tee-pee but I’m sure they would have responded if I could have gotten through.
My boyfriend and I sat outside to eat dinner and watch the sunset where I asked him to marry me and he said “YES!”
After dinner it got much colder and super windy. So we decided to head into the tee-pee. Luckily we were told to pack for the weather so I brought 2 comforters and a blanket. As we played Yahtzee we could hear the wind picking up but we were surprised we couldn’t feel a thing. By the time we woke up sleeping to the sounds of nature had been so relaxing but quite chilly in the morning so it was smart for us to bring the extra blankets. Thank you Ted for an overall really successful and perfectly enjoyable night.
Next time we will definitely have to stay a few nights instead of just one. 😊"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun, memorable experience this was! We very much enjoyed our night in the tepee. There were many little thoughtful touches-- from the twinkle lights to the extra sleeping bags. It DID get chilly overnight! We went in mid-October, so be prepared with warm clothes. Top notch destination for a little getaway!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice teepee behind horse stables to get away from the city and relax.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You absolutely must see this. The tepee is beautiful and incredible. A very unique experience that I’m glad is offered. Ted is great. Fast communication and very helpful. The animals on the ranch are cool to see as well.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique and beautiful experience! The teepee is charming, with all kinds of little special touches (candles, cards, fire pit, twinkle lights). Comfy bed. Very simple and clean with a great hygge vibe. Beautiful sunset and gazing at the gorgeous horses puts it over the top. Loved it!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Such a fun and different stay then anything else. Would highly recommend!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful time here! The bed was cozy and the tepee was beautiful!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay for a couple!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very unique experience! The space was quite large and stylishly decorated. Easy to find and pretty quiet (some plane noise at night but not bad). The port a potty was super clean. It was a cold night and got a little chilly once we turned off the gas fire pit but we had extra blankets with us. Beautiful sunset over the Rockies in the distance!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful open space farm with lovely horses roaming around
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The teepee was amazing! Ted did a great job in providing driving directions and directions for how to operate everything in the teepee. My only complaint is that we only stayed there for one night!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The definition of peace & serenity. Sunrises at this farm are unrivaled. The creek, horses, and fresh air add to the calm presence of the stay. There is a warm fireplace in the teepee and board games which provides a fun detox from every day life. Definitely would recommend this experience!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is the perfect getaway from the city. We enjoyed meeting the animals, carving pumpkins, and watching the stars at night. The host was very hospitable and kind."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,nice folks. thanks.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So beautiful!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted's place is amazing. The perfect way to spend a night outdoors without the hassle of having to pack up and set up your own camping gear! My wife and I spent our 4th anniversary here and love it. The Teepee is wonderfully cozy, the bed is comfortable, bbq grill worked great, etc. etc. Highly recommend!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fun experience!!!! This place is in the cutest ranch with horses and more! The teepe is so much bigger than I thought and the fire inside was amazing! We loved staying here and the experience itself was great!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This teepee was so amazing to stay in. It was so quaint, clean, cozy, quite, peaceful, absolutely amazing!!! I love the location being out in the country with access to the mountains. The farm is beautiful, the horses are so sweet! My four year old LOVED it! I wish we were in town longer but we will be back for sure! The hosts were so informative and hospitable. There weren’t any issue with bugs, the porta-potty was nice and clean with hand sanitizer. The location was great! Not far from the airport, about 40 minutes from Boulder and 30 from Denver! I highly recommend!!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than expected! Great hospitality-went above and beyond. We enjoyed playing horseshoe and uno! The fire pit inside was super cozy. They even supplied lights and candles. It was perfect and would absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing night away!!! Thank you so much!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend this property to anyone looking for an authentic outdoor camping experience while still being able to enjoy basic amenities!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a peaceful, beautiful property! It was exactly what we needed. Everyone we spoke to on the property was so friendly and welcoming. The horses are amazing and are not shy! They come right up and let you pet them. The teepee was so cool, it was such a fun experience."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated teepee! The inside fire was nice at night to warm up!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands-down the most unique Airbnb I've ever had the chance to stay at. The teepee was warm, cozy, and comfortable. We had everything we needed to enjoy a relaxing stay and unplug for a little while. The ranch itself is beautiful and it was a joy to walk around and see all the animals."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was something straight out of a novel! The teepee was better than expected with beautiful stylish touches. It was pretty amazing our stay that we encountered a Summer Snow Storm and the tepee and surrounding area was covered in a blanket of white snow and made everything that much more beautiful! Just like a winter wonderland. I highly recommend this place for a fun and different stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded, peaceful and romantic. We loved it!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a unique experience you will never forget. If you have binoculars or a telescope bring it with. The stars a plentiful at night. The bed was clean and comfortable and there were plenty of lanterns/lights inside the teepee. Highly recommend this experience if you want to camp in style.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second time here and I plan to come back again in the future!!!! Such a fun and unique experience.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great night out of the city in the tee pee! Highly recommended
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This. Place. Is. So. Cute. Situated in the middle of a horse ranch you are in for an eclectic retreat away from the hustle and bustle. We celebrated our third wedding anniversary here and couldn’t have been happier. We spent the day playing horseshoes (provided by the host), drinking wine, and walking around the property. At night we used the grill that was provided to make a fancy dinner under the stars. The bed was super comfy and the fire pit was cozy. We loved our getaway and will absolutely be returning!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Ted's tipi was beautiful and unforgettable. We couldn't get over how perfect and minimal the structure was. Then, just a short walk away from the tipi are horses. A few things to keep in mind, and it's nitpicking at this point, is that there were a lot of flies that found their way into the tipi during our stay. Also, no service so make sure to get your messages sent before you arrive. But that comes with the territory so no worries if you're prepared. If you're looking for a unique and picturesque stay, look no further. This is the place!"
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the teepee. Even with fire ban in effect there was plenty to do and the location has a lot to offer! Definitely fun and memorable.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Spacious, Nice, clean and quiet. Everything was right. I'd 100% recommend it and would stay here again and again. If you're afraid of dogs like myself, just let Isaac know so he can keep the dog away while you are there :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice and quiet place, the house was beautiful and the room was very nice. Isaac was very responsive with any questions I had. I will stay here in the future if work brings me back into the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My partner and I stayed here for a couple weeks and it was amazing. We stayed in the basement and everything was super clean and comfortable.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Isaac is a wonderful Innkeeper!!! Top-notch, above and beyond, what you’d expect when you hear the term “stellar service”. He is there if you need him but otherwise you don’t see him. What more could you ask:)
His place is gorgeous! A beautiful refuge for rest and relaxation and rejuvenation. Plenty of room to stretch out, make yourself comfy, and enjoy the conveniences of home without having to pack it all with you. Will absolutely stay with Isaac if I’m ever up that way again."

Second, not only did we have use of a beautifully appointed cook’s kitchen, we had our own refrigerator in the basement apartment. The bed was perfect, a high quality memory foam mattress just as advertised. The gardens are so peaceful. And we were made to feel truly welcome to enjoy the upstairs and outside spaces."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Isaac was an amazing host, and always quick to respond to any questions or needs. The house was super comfortable, cleanly, and all the amenities you could need. I stayed in the basement bungalow, which had blackout curtains making it perfect for a night shifter. Also being a female traveling for work by myself, I felt totally safe and comfortable. The backyard was a nice little sanctuary for sitting outside and relaxing, also the pool and hotub was a plus! If ever in the area during travels, I will definitely stay again and also recommend to others! Thanks Isaac!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Issac's awesome and will help with anything you need. Super knowledgeable and accommodating!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Isaac was an excellent host. He was very accommodating and had most amenities imaginable. His listing may have not described it as a Four Seasons Hotel, but it was definitely one of the best experiences I have had."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Isaac's basement suite was perhaps the nicest Airbnb I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. If you are looking for a quiet night in, this is the spot for you. From the super plush carpeting to the fantastic reclining couches, the massive TV and the Alexa activated EVERYTHING will not leave you wanting. Super clean, comfy bed, nice shower, blackout curtains, this suite was filled with lovely little touches. You will not be disappointed. Not to mention, Isaac was kind enough to give us a quick tour when we checked in, showing us all of the finer points of the shared areas and beautiful outdoor spaces available to us. Awesome host."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Lindsey's tiny home. Though small the house had all the amenities we could have wanted. We loved still being able to cook with the stovetop. The place had plenty of space for our pup to run around. Being in the country there was a bit of a cow smell and some flies/mosquitos that got in but that comes with the territory. Lindsey was so responsive and left us a cute treat and some great recommendations. We have stayed in a few tiny homes but this one seemed to have the best layout as we really did not feel squished at all!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to stay while we were getting married and closing on our home in the area! What a fabulously private little retreat.
Country hospitality at its finest. Thank you for the great stay."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely host and a beautiful location. The Tiny Home is nestled in a grove of Cotton Woods. There's a lake in the distance. So peaceful. Woke-up to bird song in the morning and lulled to sleep by chirping frogs, out by the lake, at night.
The little house had everything I needed, we were very comfortable.
Amazing weekend!"

She gave me the feeling of being at home and helped me out whenever I needed her help.

The hot tub was a very nice touch and relaxing after a long drive. The only issue we had and hope this review will let others know of l, are the moths. Make sure to leave the outside lights out or you’ll have moths everywhere. Nice place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"WOW. We had the whole gigantic 3 bedroom house and hot tub to ourselves.
Checkin was a breeze with signs leading us to the private parking area.
Really enjoyed the remote location (yet a short drive to town) and the privacy was well needed for us to relax with the 2 mini schnauzers in the fenced in yard with lots of grass.
Cannot compliment the whole 2 night experience enough."

The seating in all areas was comfortable also.
The kitchen was a dream, everything you could want was supplied.
Hot tub was great. TV was easy to use even for someone who does not have a smart TV of their own.
I would recommend it to anyone who wants 2-3 beds and can share a bathroom."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shawna’s property was really comfortable, great place for my family to stop and rest during a road trip.

Would look to stay here again if we were passing through."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shawna’s place was perfect! It was so easy, from check-in to check-out everything was super intuitive. She was a great communicator, very responsive. The yard was perfect for our dogs and I loved sitting on the porch with my coffee in the morning. Not a lot of eating options close by (especially on Sunday when many are closed), but certainly enough for a short stay or cook-at-home eaters. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to go back. This adorable farmhouse was perfect for our girl's weekend. The amenities were above and beyond, the place was clean and the decor was wonderful. Beds were comfy, kitchen was beautiful and everything just clicked for us.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family was in Fort Morgan for a busy 3 days of kids’ sports. Shawna’s place was convenient and comfortable for us. The peaceful yard was relaxing after long days of officials’ whistles and excited sports fans.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is huge. I didn’t have a sense for how big it was from the pictures…I’m not sure why! I didn’t get to meet Shawna but she was very responsive, even with my last minute booking and late arrival.
The hot tub was toasty and a welcome soak after a long drive through a couple fierce thunderstorms. Overall, the house is as pictured and described."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay is excellent and super comfortable!
We loved everything our host offered."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the house and yard! Very nice house lots of goodies and extras! Wish we would've had the time to enjoy the tub! The only thing I would change would be to add a top sheet to the beds. Very quiet!!! Will stay here again!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shawna's place was perfect for us. We needed a safe place to stay for a night where we could park our trailer and not worry about it getting broken into. The home itself was lovely. It was very spacious, comfortable and clean! She had everything we needed to cook dinner and have relaxing night before we hit the road again. Shawna was so kind and helpful. She made sure we were comfortable with where we parked the trailer. Would stay there again and highly recommend the spot!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnb’s we’ve been to. Big front yard with trees, a nice little porch with two chairs, hot tub, super clean, comfortable beds, lots of towels, comfortable living room, super pet friendly, and very accommodating hosts. We’ll be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Shawna's place was a perfect spot for a one night stop on our road trip with our pups! The fenced in yard was wonderful for our dogs to stretch their legs and the house was so comfortable. We had a local Mexican restaurant deliver based on a recommendation from the host and it was fantastic. We would definitely stay again on our way through.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was very clean with a very nice remodel. Hot tub worked well in a nice private atmosphere.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an incredible two week stay here in Ft Morgan. The pictures and description match everything perfectly. The space was clean, homey, and had everything you’d need even for a longer stay like we had.
We especially loved the comfortable bed, big family room tv and tree swing. Shawna was also very helpful and responsive. Location is a quick couple minute drive to the downtown area with restaurants, grocery store, and parks. Would recommend 10/10 if you need a large and private space in the Ft Morgan area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a dream ~ exceeded expectations. There were so many personal touches and the home really did feel like ""Home away from Home""

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super helpful with directions and check in. It was very quiet and peaceful.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house looks newly remodeled. Floors wood and/or laminate, perfect for pets as was the fenced in yard for airing them. Large living room and kitchen. Good snacks, plenty of bagged ice in freezer upon our arrival. Shawna responded immediately when we requested a pooper scooper. Beds very comfortable. Outside pictures show a very nice house, which it is, but it doesn't show a view from property outward. You are basically surrounded by buildings or privacy fence. But for us, that was fine since we were in the outdoors all day at a hunting lodge running our dogs in a hunt test. But if you are looking for a view in pastureland, this is not for you. They do have an area in back that you park in and is 100% secluded and private with a nice grill and hot tub which I think makes up for lack of view."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. Everything was amazingly clean and stocked. Felt like a home away from home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, easy stay, thanks for having us."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and we will stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stopped in for one night with my wife. This place was amazing and the hot tub was a bonus. Way better then staying the night in a hotel. I would recommend this place if your looking for little place to get away. Shawna is very responsive and made the process very simple for this first timer.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay here and the owner has thought of everything to make the stay go smooth. Simple check in and easy parking. Lightning fast Wi-Fi with plenty of bandwidth for HD streaming. The house was more than expected. Large, open areas inside. Spacious bedrooms and comfy beds. Bathroom was clean and fully stocked with everything from towels to toothpaste. Kitchen was stocked with coffee, spices for cooking and bags of ice in the freezer. We were surprised to see a smart tv in every bedroom! The 65"" tv in the living room made for an enjoyable game night on the PS5 and a chill spot for watching march madness. Our pets were allowed to vacation with us and they LOVED the large fenced in yard. The yard was clean and well kept with outdoor seating and swing. Hot tub was a huge perk. Piping hot with powerful jets. The house is tucked ofo of the main road for easy access to town or a quick route to the west to check out the mountains! We look forward to returning!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"this place was perfect for us - two adults and two dogs roadtripping to colorado. easy to get to off the highway, very clear instructions to get to and into the house. it was super clean and warm when we arrived and very quiet. the bed was very comfy, soft linens, and a nice big kitchen. shawna was very proactive and wanted to ensure that everything went smoothly. highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Shawna’s place! Super clean home that was so welcoming. Easy to find thanks to Shawna’s additionak directions. Fenced in yard for our pups!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, and well-furnished place with an amazing hot tub! Shawna is a superhost and very communicative! Everything was well thought out for a comfortable stay. The home is SUPER clean!
Unfortunately none of us in our group found the beds to be very comfortable. The king mattress is super plush with no support whatsoever. The double bed is a memory foam (enough said). The queen bed is firm, and somewhat comfortable but not the best. All seemed to be very cheap beds. The mattress quality would be the biggest area of improvement for an AirBNB at this price point."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time renting Airbnb . The home was a perfect “farmhouse”. Very open large living area. Cozy fireplace with plenty of wood that was supplied. Just nice overall !
Hot tub was great. Very impressed with Shawna the host. Very prompt and extremely kind and helpful with any and all questions we had during our stay.. Would definitely rent again."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, clean and easy access to the houseS"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This awesome AirBNB is tucked away off the main road. Unassuming on the outside, and beautiful, modern, clean on the inside. A stealthy hide away. easy to find, once you know what landmarks to look for. No garbage disposal, so be sure to put all food waste in a garbage bag. Highly recommend this property and Super host."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Extremely comfortable! Beds were amazing. Great value. Highly recommend if you are passing through the area.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is perfect! Most comfortable Airbnb we’ve ever been to. Super clean and lots of thoughtful touches that we appreciated. Even though the Airbnb is at the owner’s property it is very private and we really felt at home. The bed was amazing too! I wish we would have stayed longer. They deserve more than 5 stars!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Shawn’s renovated home. Bedding and linens are comfortable, slate and hardwood flooring (no carpet) nice furnishings, fenced yard, privacy. Shawna was very easy to communicate with. We recommend this place."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous country home with plenty of room to relax and great amenities.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shawna’s place is FANTASTIC! Everything was above and beyond expectations. We only stayed one night, but the yard is a very nice size for the dogs to run around in, and the kitchen is fully stocked! Shawna goes above and beyond for her guests and I would absolutely love to stay here again if I’m the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication all the way through the process. Easier than expected to find because the pictures are so up to date and clear directions.
Great home and amenities.
My only regret is that I was only staying for the night passing through on my way home! Really enjoyed the space!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! The house is very well done with great decor. Shawna is very easy to communicate with, and the yard is great, with a treehouse and games for kids. We look forward to staying again!!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I came to town to visit my mom and we went downtown and watched some of the filming of the show Hometown Takeover. Hometown Takeover picked Fort Morgan to do a show on.
I loved the newly remodeled fully stocked kitchen. The sweet treats they left for me were nice to have. You can really tell they are trying to update everything. The owner said that new windows and a Hot Tub are on order. I will definitely be back to enjoy the Hot Tub. The yard was peaceful and very relaxing. I watched them ride their horses that evening. The yard has nice solar lights."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a peaceful and pleasant stay with our dog Ruby. The yard has a fenced-in yard and Riverside Park is a nice place for walks a few minutes drive away.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect place to chill, sprawl and relax. Super clean and charming. This is a family homestead, obvious from the arched doorways, mature trees and cool, green lawn. Modern upgrades and three(!) bedrooms make it perfect for families or groups of friends. Spent a weekend here with my husband and our dog while we were cleaning out a family property and it was the perfect retreat for the weekend. Shawna was a great host and we would definitely come back."
2022-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"the host is generous in the linens, pillows, and towels in the home. the utility room - while the first thing you see when you walk in, along with the furnace & water heater - is big & a great multipurpose room for storing travel things/coolers/shoes/winter clothing, etc. the host is quickly responsive. but this is a double-edged sword as the airbnb and her home shares a sectioned off yard with a privacy fence. she & her family & their employees drive by the house multiple times a day, so the only real privacy is in the airbnb house with the curtains closed. and they make a point of inspecting you if you are in the yard. unfortunately, this was the first time I ever experienced racism, and it came in the form of this type of drive-by inspection and then the host & her husband invading the space we were renting from them. the host also tried to accuse us of damaging the sprinkler system as the irrigation system was programmed to run in the middle of the afternoon - prime time when kids or adults were in the yard; luckily, I am a landscape contractor & know how to inspect a sprinkler system for damage (everything worked fine upon inspection except 1 low-pressure or plugged nozzle, which was not our fault). I visit family in the area multiple times a year; I will not bring my family back to this location to stay; we will find other accommodations."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! My husband, daughter and I really enjoyed the space and private backyard. Shawna was super responsive and helped us with anything we needed."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Super quiet, great signage that made it easy to find. Loved the yard and the tree house!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shawna is a great host! I had my crew in the area for a business trip and was lucky to find this great little spot for them to stay at. We will definitely be back if ever in Fort Morgan!

Great place"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved staying at Bruce’s basement apartment. Everything was very clean, and it had everything we needed: full length mirror, handheld mirror, fans, extra pillow. It was a very short walk (1.5 blocks) to the Starbucks at the local Safeway, which was highly enjoyable with the beautiful trees and birds singing at sunrise. The downstairs apartment has a specific parking place and a private entrance and a very quiet location.
I highly recommend staying here."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is compact but very comfortable and clean!!

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Good, if small, space for an economy minded traveler. Reasonably updated, good bathroom, simple but basic kitchen.
Only problem was bedding that smelled of cologne, which I’m sharing. Also, unless you are agile and have some strength, getting down the entry stairs with bags might be a challenge. It’s a squeeze, but I managed."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I just had another nice stay and have another stay coming up in a week! I like the location as it is close to my job. There are a few hotels and motels in the area to choose from but frankly don't compete. This stay is much more affordable than the hotels and way nicer than places with similar rates.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There aren't many low cost airbnbs out there, but Bruce's surely is. If you're traveling through the Fort Morgan area, it makes for a clean and comfortable overnight. Good wifi, friendly pup, off street parking. It is in a basement, so you'll need to navigate 5 or 6 steps with your belongings, but no problem -just be careful. Would stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really good price for a few nights stay compared to other options such as hotels and motels. This stay had everything I could need and was close to the St Elizabeth hospital. Which is great because I was staying in town bc I was on-call.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Barbie and Richard are new at the property. They are trying to get it updated and they are doing a great job. You need to understand that this is part of a hotel however, the suites are separate. The walls are a bit thin but it wasn't horrible and it sets on the Main Street through town. There are quite a few restaurants close if you dont feel like cooking. Unfortunately Richard was under the weather while we were there but Barbie did a great job. She was very responsive to all our questions. We would stay again."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family group really enjoyed staying here. I grew up in the area &came back to visit over the holiday. It was just like the pictures and the description. The deck was gorgeous, although we didn't enjoy it as much as we would like due to rain. The place was perfectly sized for our group.
The few things we noticed were that the beds upstairs and downstairs were very soft, almost too soft. Also, the downstairs bedroom doorknob came off along with the store room below the stairs. My sister in law actually got locked in the bedroom downstairs and had to call us to open the door. Also we thought it was very odd that per the checkout instructions, we had to clean the sinks and counter tops, replace the toilet paper and strip the beds before we left. Normally these types of things are included in the fee, We would have been happy to pay an upcharge for these tasks.
Overall it was a nice place for the 4 adults and 2 kids that stayed. But would prefer not to have to do the housekeeping"

It has an amazing wrap around patio with outdoor fireplace and BBQ area. Great for just wanting to relax outside and take in some frsh air.

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house is clean, but if you are expecting to be able to cook and eat in the house, it might be problematic. The kitchen is extremely dated, and there is no where to sit. We were there in the winter, thus sitting outside was not an option. The house can accommodate 8 for sleeping, but not for sitting anywhere inside."

We had three kids with us, 4 and under, and it was so nice to have a spacious home and yard for them to run around in and burn energy. We even found some toys and cards, which was great for them!
It was windy while we were there, so we didn't get to use the outdoor fireplace, but it was still nice to hang out on the deck and enjoy some sunshine."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed for 8 nights. It was very enjoyable, very quiet neighborhood. Brice was very helpful and kind. He is very friendly and flexible with check in and check out."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, not super impressed with this home in Fort Morgan, Co.
Home was not clean upon arrival: dried urine on the toilet, last tenants personal shampoo left in the shower, dirty/dusty floors, etc.
Some items mentioned in profile were not included/available: coffee, hair dryer, etc.
Projector setup in the main room was not functional and/or was not intuitive to use.
Home is pet friendly with a fenced in backyard, but dog owners beware - the backyard is largely unkept and full of stickers/thorns. Our dog unfortunately got injured by the thorns so we didn’t allow him in the yard.
A couple of the beds were not on bed frames, but rather box springs directly on the floor. Many of the blinds were broken. Siding was falling off the home. Broken outdoor furniture on deck.
Could be a great little stay with some TLC. Owner was very prompt, proactive and a pleasure to work with."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was not impressed with the house mostly because it was not clean on check in. urine on the floor in the bathroom, dishes in the dishwasher, and dust and dirt on the floor. The bedroom and bathroom downstairs wete not cleaned at all before arrival. Only one bed was made up for use. After speaking with the host I opted to move the bedding to the bed that was actually on a bed frame. While moving the bedding it was obvious that the space between the box spring and the mattress was not clean. I could not get the projector to work. there were no instructions on how to use it. I ended up watching movies on my tablet my whole stay. I cleaned the bathroom, kitchen counter, and put the dishes away that were in the dishwasher. The house has potential to be really cute. My stay was not ideal but it was better than staying in a hotel for a week. The host is responsive and did offer to come back to make the bed but I declined."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Brice was a great host and responded very quickly when we had a small key issue. I would book again with Brice if we're ever in the area again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed for a week for our Grandsons 1st birthday. Was so nice to have a whole house that 6 adults could stay at with a living room, dining room and kitchen. Sure beat having to spend $ on three separate hotel rooms. Bruce was easy to work with and very responsive."

2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Brice was very friendly and offered to meet us at the house. The house was very clean and the beds very comfortable. Could have had a few more items in the house but had pretty much what we needed for our stay. I would love to stay there again if we are in the area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alvina was an excellent host and very quick to respond to one or two questions we had. The place was brand new as was every thing in it including all appliances. The place had an open floor plan including a large kitchen island. We really liked this style of floor plan. There was a tv in the main living area as well as in all three bedrooms. While we did not have time to use them during our stay there is also a brand new grill as well as a brand new hot tub out on the patio with a privacy fence around it. We will definitely be staying here again when take our next trip back out to Colorado.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Alvina's Airbnb is an incredible find! Alvina is a most welcoming host, available when needed, & provides a notebook full of useful info. This Airbnb is truly a rare gem, all pros here--no cons. This Airbnb exceeded expectations in every way! It is spacious, super clean, and furnished & equipped in good taste and with top-notch, quality items in every room. All 3 bedrooms have comfy beds and luxury bedding! The king suite is huge, has a large closet, tv & a nice walk-in shower. The second and third bedrooms are also large and include more than enough closet, chest-of-drawers space, and nice tvs. The kitchen is well-equipped with appliances, cookware, utensils etc. The den has lots of seating that is very comfortable. The washer and dryer made it easy to do laundry as needed. We were in Fort Morgan to visit our grandson and new baby, and this place provided a nice space to host their daily visits. We intend to be back as often as we can, and hope to rebook with Alvina!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Alvina has been the best host that we've had so far! We use airbnb quite often for work and Alvina went above and beyond to make our time there feel like home. Very appreciative and look forward to using her again!

,,,"不要定这家，体验非常差，房东事多态度恶劣，三天两头提一些无理的要求，而且晚上房子周围很臭。
THE WORST since I used Airbnb and we have reported the host to Airbnb. We have never reported any host before. We have stayed here for one month: Jun 22 – Jul 24, 2021
1.Put our health safety in great danger during COVID-19
The host insisted on sending their cleaner (they are employing same cleaner all the time) to ""clean and inspect the house"" every week. On the third weekend, we met the cleaners for the first time and found that they were not vaccinated nor wearing masks when entering the house! The host entitled the house as ""Enhanced Clean"", but in reality, they put our health safety in great danger! What's more, after informing the host that we asked the cleaner to leave, the host asked us to find a time to leave so that the cleaner could come into the house!
2. Threatened to stop hosting us in the first week of our stay
The host threatened to stop hosting us by a text message on July 1 7:19 pm, only because they thought we were late to reply to their message. But their message was sent at Jun 30 7:11pm, only one day before. During that time, they have not sent any message through Airbnb nor have I received any phone calls. Actually, I was ill at that time but I still replied to them at 9:34pm the same day and I have to apologize to them because of fear.
3. Pay no attention to inconvenience of guests
From the first day, there is a drain issue in the bathroom, which makes us have to stand in the water (water level as high as our knees) when we are taking shower. We reported this situation to the host as early as Jun 28 5:33pm. They said they would send a plumber to fix that. But the plumber showed up as late as July 17! Only one week before our check out date.
4. Put their concern way ahead of guests
When we were communicating, they misunderstood my description about the drain issue. They thought the water was running out. So they suddenly sent me three messages and accused me of ""waited for 4 hours to reply"", made us answer their phone call during working hour meeting and said they called an emergency plumber. But after we told them clearly, they cancelled the plumber immediately, totally ignoring our need for the plumber.
5.Spy our life in the house
We found there were two video surveillance cameras facing two doors of the house. We also suspect that the cleaner did more ""inspect"" than ""clean"" as there was not much change after the cleaner came after the second weekend. The host accused us of not keeping the property clean and made us have to send them our pictures to prove ourselves.
6. Request us to leave two days earlier and check out at 8 am
The host sent text message to us on Jun 14 12:58 pm and asked us to leave two days earlier for ""next guests"", after we refused, they texted again saying that ""need you out very early Saturday morning around 8 am"". Those are very unreasonable requests.
7. Racial discrimination
The host have good previous review but they show no respect at all to us because we are Asians. They accused us when we misunderstood each other because we are non-native speakers. They can ignore all our demands but we have to obey their rules. If there is no rule, they can make it out of air, for example, they said cleaner coming every week is part of the arrangement of a 30 days stay, but we cannot find anything on the house rule."
