2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly loved this gem of a tiny house! It‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs described and pictured, but even more comfortable. The AC was kicking during the extra hot week and the bed was super comfortable after long days on our feet at graduation festivities! I had everything I needed, and more! Great deal, and so much nicer than staying in any hotel. For the value, it was truly amazing! Just my only regret is that I found it at graduation‚Ä¶ Not four years ago! Highly recommend Eva‚Äôs comfy home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inside was perfect! Very clean and comfortable. A perfect place for a single or couple - I found an amazing bakery - Italian People Bakery in town if your looking for delicious almost homemade pastries.

On my next visit, I will make sure to re-book here! üòäüíú"

Eva was very good with updates and any questions we had through being very responsive. Plenty of bedroom space and a very comfy bed.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I rented this for my dad for the weekend, he enjoyed the stay. Although the location is close to a university, the neighborhood was very peaceful. The home is close to major highways, restaurants and grocery stores, which we thought was a plus for us. Host provide amenities such as toiletries, coffee/tea, and condiments. Check in and out was easy. The home itself is consider a small home but it spacious for two. Host is very kind and tentatively."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva‚Äôs tiny house was an amazing place for me and my daughter to enjoy the weekend together. In the middle of a clean, quaint college town, there was a lot of restaurants and things to do within a half mile. Beautiful, cozy, and clean place to stay."

Wish there wasn‚Äôt a rule about shoes in the house"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was great and clean! Parking is a little tight in-front of the home (along the road), but is nothing bad. Another thing I enjoyed was the No shoes in the house rule, it ensured the floors stayed clean. Will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We used Moonville for a quick weekend getaway and to visit some friends and family and it was PERFECT! Eva was an excellent host and communicated everything necessary beforehand. Check-in was quick and easy, with no issues. The place itself is perfect for two people. We felt comfortable and loved the privacy Moonville provided. It was very easy to get on to 95 from Moonville which worked out great for both our trip to NYC and Philadelphia. We would definitely stay here again if we're back in the area and need a place to stay. Eva was wonderful and responsive. Please take her advice and check the kitchen before you go grocery shopping because the cabinets are well stocked with the basics."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Went here for a baecation with my boyfriend. Very cozy place to stay. Perfect for a couples getaway, just a solo trip, or even a trip with a friend. Would definitely recommend , had a lot of essentials in the kitchen. Everything was exactly as described and exactly like the pictures. The quality of the items in the air bnb were up to par and we‚Äôre not cheap. I loved how Eva paid attention to detail and left us with everything we needed. If you go here , there are plenty of options for food, beverages, groceries, etc. One food place I would highly recommend is Chicken Holiday only 6 mins away, very delicious! Give this place a try, it is worth it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little house with a friendly, responsive host!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva‚Äôs place was perfect for me and my husband. It is a tiny but well appointed house and exactly as described. The traffic from 31 wasn‚Äôt an issue at all, and it was very quiet at night. When back in the area we‚Äôd definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva was a great host and Moonville was a delightful place to stay.
we hope to stay again when we visit NJ..
Robin and Debra"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable. Eva was accommodating.
Fortunately this location was only 4 miles from where my son lives. I didn‚Äôt get an address until a week before we were to be there and I was hoping it wasn‚Äôt too far away. I would of been disappointed if it was way on the other side of town."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was the perfect stay to visit family. Eva was very accommodating and responsive to all questions. Place is exceptionally clean!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay - convenient, clean and comfortable!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Moonville was the perfect tiny house, home away from home. Really impressed with the Immaculate interior, from the living room/kitchen, to the bedroom and bathroom. Nice host touches with the framed instructions and reminders, placed so that just when you are thinking, what is the WiFi passcode, it is right there in front of you! It is definitely perfect for one person, two would be a tight squeeze. I would definitely stay in Moonville again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay! Had anything we could have forgotten, clean, safe& comfy bed! She went out of her way to ensure my fiancee and I had our favorite and only coffee we drink, thank you so much!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house lives much larger than it is. It‚Äôs a great setup with nice privacy and easy access to everything in the Princeton area. Would highly recommend it versus a hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was perfect for my wife and I, and we will be returning. We didn't get to enjoy the front porch because it rained, but that would have been our spot to truly maximize the space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is, by far, the cutest Airbnb that we have visited! We needed something close to family so the location was perfect. My daughter and I stayed together but Eva had prepared us for the size so there were no surprises. The small space had everything we needed - not one detail overlooked. The bed was so comfortable and there were nice touches everywhere like slippers, shampoo, coffee and even extra towels. Will stay again the next time we are in town!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely little spot! My partner and I took a short mid-week getaway and stayed at Eva's place after going to Grounds for Sculpture. It's on a quiet street, with many nice attractions just a short drive away. Everything was spic-and-span and Eva goes out of her way to provide a comfortable and convenient space for her guests. Bed & linens were comfy and the shower had plenty of pressure. Pre-arrival communication was very thorough & proactive, and the one minor question we had as we were getting ready to leave was quickly answered. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva‚Äôs place was perfect. It is small and only for two people but it was extremely clean, we didn‚Äôt feel claustrophobic at all. One of the nights there was a college party nearby like the description mentioned but we turned on the fan and that amount of white noise drowned out all noise and we slept great. Eva was so kind and highly responsive. It‚Äôs definitely a great place to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place for a short stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Eva‚Äôs - her place was very clean and just as pictured. Lots of thoughtful touches to make the visit easy. We were visiting colleges in the area so the location was convenient: NJ Transit train to NYC is less than a 10 min drive away. Eva was very responsive and helpful regarding any questions I had. I would definitely stay there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a really nice home! I loved everything about it especially the bedroom! I had to ask Eva where she got her pillows because they were so comfortable! Everything is so nice and well put together! Definitely a highlight in my weekend! Will book again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect for the two days we were in Trenton. There were many amenities prepared for our use, an extremely comfortable bed, and Eva‚Äôs prompt and helpful instructions made it very enjoyable for us! Thank you Eva!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Eva was very quick to response and reassured me that everything was ok. It was a nice size for two and very convenient.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent everything
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough great things about my stay at Eva's place. It was very cozy and clean. I appreciate how things were put in place with guests in mind. I will surely book again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, as always! I would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia was a great host. She was very responsive, and the location was safe. I came to Ewing for a week long business trip, and I was able to feel right at home. A+++++"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, as always. This time around there were others in the house the whole time I was there and Pat was a very clear communicator about all of it. Thanks!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've done 4-5 stays here now of 4-5 nights each. It's a great deal and if you're looking for a place with a comfortable bed, great host, and easy access to Yardley, Trenton, and Princeton this is a great spot. The owner is having an issue with the plumbing in the bathroom sinks, but she was very transparent about it and everything else is working great."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia has been cordial to help me settle-down in the house. The house has the old charm - shows lot about the character of people who have lived there. The location is nice. The room has lot of items - while it reduces the moving space - but makes anyone amuse looking at various collections. Had a good time overall
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Pat was super helpful during my stay! Such a beautiful home and area. Only downside is how dark is at night wish there was more lighting. From the street it was a bit tricky to see the small numbers, almost went down wrong driveway. Still was a great deal nonetheless!"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"It was a perfect location for a drive into NY for work. Although Patricia did say the bathroom faucet didn‚Äôt work, it made things difficult, added to close quarters in the bedroom which was made worse by too much ‚Äústuff‚Äù - pillows, unnecessary pieces of furniture in a small room. Stairs to 2nd floor were challenging. Patricia is a good communicator and hostess."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Second stay with Patricia. Won‚Äôt be our last. Great choice if you‚Äôre in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay again. if you need a clean place to sleep with a comfortable bed and a gracious host, this place is great."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what I needed it to be and was a very good value. It was comfortable, clean, safe, had a nice desk in the room, solid internet (which is a requirement for me), a comfortable bed (with comfortableand clean sheets). The instructions were very clear, Pat was a fabulous communicator, and was very responsive to the few messages I needed to send. There are also a number of really good food options nearby.
Full disclosure, this place is an older house and there's a lot of stuff in it. I'm not bothered by a little clutter so I didn't mind, but if you want minimalist, this isn't it. Still for where it is, it's hard to beat the value."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia left sticky notes everywhere which was helpful
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,The reason I gave an overall 4 due to the bathroom sink not working. It was a very quaint place.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was nice coming back to this location, Patricia is a great host as always."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia's place was not only cozy but well-priced and close to my work destination- the perfect combo! Patricia is a proactive and responsible host who made sure everything was in order at our stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Safe, private and fits my choice."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place to stay, quiet and peaceful location, host was very accommodating and attentive. Even our pup enjoyed his stay!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay, would stay here again üëçüèæ."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"First staying in a single room Airbnb and this was a smooth, nice experience. Everything was as described and Patricia was extremely accommodating. We will be looking to stay in the area again in the coming year and we will absolutely have this location at the top of our list."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay, fantastic host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank Pat for hosting us and our kitty on Thanksgiving day!! We had a great restful night.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great stay! We had everything we needed and felt right at home. Entry was easy, we had free parking, and the Wi-Fi was fast! Patricia is very detailed and quickly responded to any of our messages. Would recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice and quaint place~ Very close to the Princeton area and airport, which was convenient for what we had planned. Patricia was very responsive and helped a lot with everything we needed during our stay. Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Definitely one of the best AirBNBs I've visited; wish I could have stayed longer.
Cozy, tranquil and very homey..
Patricia is nothing short of lovely, with amazing experiences to share and some of the most beautiful cats I've ever laid eyes on.
I sincerely hope to return soon to get another dose of the ""home away from home"" feeling.
Thank you Pat! Until next time !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice and clean room. highly recommended.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Patricia was a fantastic host and clearly communicated everything we needed to know. The room was nice and cozy! Highly recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,My host was amazing and made me felt right at home. like how quiet it was so I cam get a lot done work wise.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing host. would love to go back again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just a quick overnight. Patricia was responsive, available and pleasant. Parking was convenient and the road wasn‚Äôt busy. The room is dark but cheerfully painted and decorated. The bathroom sink and ceiling fan weren‚Äôt working, which might be bothersome on a longer stay, but not a problem this time. I would recommend this listing."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,exactly what I needed. well laid out and an overall great space
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice quiet room and cozy bed assures a sound nights sleep, and this Ewing area has a quiet country feel at night. Very peaceful birdsong is the first thing you‚Äôll hear on an summer morning. And depending on what room you stay in (mine was ‚ÄòLemonade‚Äô) perhaps you‚Äôll hear the low happy clucking of the 2 beautiful backyard chickens!
There‚Äôs also small aircraft that flyover every so often in the day due to the Mercer Trenton airport nearby. Relatedly, 2 minutes away are pretty open fields near the airport landing area where a few deer and birds frolic around dusk, and there‚Äôs an old dairy farm across the valley as well. Generally all a serene place tied to important NJ history.
House wise it‚Äôs easy to use the clean strong flow shower and make a cup of tea or coffee in the morning. Bathroom sink pipe is being repaired but not a burden to workaround it. If you prefer a bite out there‚Äôs coffee shop within walking distance 5 minutes away (I didn‚Äôt try it but looks decent enough)."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place like last year. I am definitely returning next year! Patricia is sweet and responds quickly to all requests and her house is charming!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and simple. Very close to TTN Airport.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia is nice and the place is nice. The room is small, not really a place for much more than sleeping, but cosy and pleasant. Chickens may wake you up early. The bathroom sink did not work--had to brush teeth in the tub. Otherwise really nice. If you have trouble with strong scents, this might not be the place for you--lots of essential oil air fresheners everywhere. Patricia was really nice about removing them when I told her they gave me headaches, but the place is very saturated with scent. All in all, very worthwhile."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Thank you
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt right at HOME. I have recently had significant family losses, and I was able to sit in the back yard with the chickens in PEACE and finally GRIEVE. It was such a RELIEF!! IF I'm ever in the area again I will be looking up Patricia's place. Thank you so much Patricia, you really don't know how SPECIAL your place was, and it will be embedded in my mind FOREVER!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Pleasant stay. Cute, clean and easy access!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia is a great host! Her home is really cute!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time using Airbnb. Patricia's personal touch helped us get over the airbnb process. Once inside, it was clean, comfortable, welcoming, cozy, and everything you might need for an overnight or two seemed to be where one would expect to find it.
It really worked for my husband who is a very early riser and aims for the kitchen, available 24-7, to make his morning brew.
We were there on a holiday weekend and there were two minor plumbing problems of little consequence. It is likely Patricia is having the items worked on. It is mentioned here only in fairness to other readers.
Staying there was much like visiting family or staying at a friend's house- Much More than 'not motel or hotel like' and, for that, so much better. When visiting family in Ewing we will likely be staying, if available, at Patricia's Lemonade again."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Patricia is a very attentive host
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Private and quiet place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Warm and welcoming host.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia put a few pictures up of the place, but I assure that they do not do this place nearly enough justice. Because of COVID, breakfasts are no longer a 'thing', but there are all sorts of treats and drink items that one can take themself, as mentioned. The stairway upstairs was reminiscent of something out of The Secret Garden. The bathroom and bedroom smelled and looked INCREDIBLE. I believe that IF I lived there, I might never leave the house. We had to leave early morning to go to work, which is something that Patricia asked about (to see if we were unhappy or unsatisfied with anything, which I found to be very nice). Unfortunately, there was no hammock or chickens (it was still pretty cold out). This only means that I will have to make a trip back. Very thankful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Awesome host!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved staying here for the six weeks I was working in Trenton. It was perfect to fill all my needs, from full kitchen access to VERY comfortable bed with fresh linens weekly., laundry, etc. Patricia was so warm and welcoming and kept me well informed of anything I needed to know.
There are many dining options, grocery, and gas nearby, easy access to the freeway, and great off-street parking."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia is incredibly accommodating and thoughtful! Her home is cozy and peaceful! This is definitely one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs in the area! Looking forward to going back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice host cute cats wonderful environment!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia is a superb host with a warm and caring demeanor!
Her house is filled with snacks, coffee, a comfortable bed and a friendly tabby.
I look forward to staying with her when I'm in the Trenton area again.
Thank you, Patricia, for having an uber clean and peaceful home!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Would choose her place again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved staying here! The home has such a warm and cozy feel to it and Patricia was super welcoming and made us feel right at home! Also her cats are the SWEETEST!! I would recommend staying with Patricia to anyone and everyone!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stay here regularly when I have work in Trenton. Always clean. Quiet neighborhood. Easy check-in.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely adorable, charming, comfortable and cozy!! The kitty cats added a sweet touch to our stay, the snack area was much appreciated, the bed was comfy and the entire house was welcoming. We can‚Äôt wait to return!! üçÅüôèüèªüåª"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house & garden & lovely cat & nice host. Definitely I would like to recommend this to others. The only little suggestion is that it could be more convenient if body wash was provided.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay if you are in and out a lot. The bed was comfortable, I enjoyed using the kitchen each morning, and having off road parking. Pat is very hospitable and wants to meet all of your needs! I highly recommend her lovely place!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great value and super nice host!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, private room in lovely house."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, lovely host! Pat is a very kind soul and there is a great welcoming feeling all through the house. Quiet, peaceful, with all that you might need. She did a great job with detailed descriptions and instructions, there was no surprises and all was smooth and easy. The cats were very nice and respectful too... I really enjoyed my short stay on the go, would come back if in the area again."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Patricia's several times. Clean, cozy and peaceful place to stay at. She is very attentive to guest's needs and has a cute place in the heart of Mercer County. She is also close to many great restaurants and things to do in the area."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patricia was extremely sweet and caring. I ran an into an unexpected issue with Airbnb being double booked and Patricia did all she could to assure I was refunded. I‚Äôm very disappointed in Airbnb as they are charging more service fees than hotels. Nothing do with the host she was awesome

2019-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Old fashioned but clean and cozy room and house.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a very quick stay with Patricia. She was quick to communicate and I enjoyed her little cottage. Since I was coming for a cat relate business trip, I really appreciated the house kitties! The bed was super comfortable and Patricia was nice. Although it didn't bother me much, there were a couple things that other guests may want to know:
Patricia told me that there has been some recent crimes in the area such as drug use and theft close by, which made me a little nervous. She does seem to be on top of trying to prevent this in her neighborhood.
There are planes that fly directly over her house at night, which are pretty loud.
Lastly, there are opportunities for other guests to be across the hall from you. Patricia did ask if I felt comfortable before she agreed to accept their reservation, and I agreed. I was slightly caught off guard but didn't mind another couple sharing the space."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was extremely accessible to major roadways, conveniently located in a great township. I appreciated the small touches that made my stay relaxing such as water bottles, mints, but most especially the little notes with a lot of instructions helped get me relax because I found everything I needed right away for a short stay."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia‚Äôs home is warm and inviting. The bed and room is cozy.
The bathroom has the best water pressure and hot water you could ask for. If you are planning a trip and leaving out of Trenton Mercer airport this is the perfect place to stay."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Quiet, tidy, clean, lots lots lots of books!
And fresh eggs!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place & location
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host. Patricia was very accommodating to us and our 9 year-old English Bulldog, Ruby. Nice room with a very comfortable bed and a lovely breakfast (Eggs Benedict, on our first morning) from her chicken's eggs in her backyard. We would highly recommend staying here for business travelers or anyone looking to get away and experience all that Mercer/Bucks County has to offer for a weekend stay :)"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Patricia is an excellent host, the room is cozy and has everything you need for your stay, she also lets you use the kitchen and backyard if you want and cooks a great breakfast every morning if you wish. Her cats are also some of the most relaxed animals I‚Äôve ever met."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia is a very welcoming host. The place was clean and inviting, the bed very comfortable. We enjoyed visiting the Siamese cats."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, quiet place to stay with easy access to the Trenton airport! Patricia greeted me upon arrival and made me feel welcome.

Thankful for this find and will be using again if I‚Äôm ever in Trenton."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, very clean and comfortable place to stay. Hearty breakfast with fine company is a bonus!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were very, very, very pleased with our stay! This was one of the few places in the area that allowed pets (we brought our 8 lb dog) and it worked out very well with plenty of scenic areas to walk and since he does not require a lot of space, he was fine in his pen during the day while we were out and about. Patricia is an extremely warm and gracious hostess, preparing amazing breakfasts, patiently showing us the alarm and locking system for the front door and making sure any and all questions were answered that we had! The bedroom had a window-unit air conditioner and fan that kept us more than comfortable in the evenings and a great bed! The water pressure in the shower was wonderful! Patricia went above and beyond, taking our puppy out for a walk when we were getting back later than expected and coordinating with us to pick up some items we forgot to take with us! We cannot recommend Patricia's place enough!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia's house is very nice, quiet, and welcoming. A lot like a home away from home, (maybe nicer!) and affordable as well. She also has a vast number of different amenities to choose from. I recommend it."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Patricia‚Äôs. She was very communicative and responsive, especially regarding checking in. Her home and garden were very pleasant."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I felt like I was back in my childhood home (a good thing). Vintage 1920 construction in great shape. Patricia is an engaging host. Great place to stay.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time I've been a guest at Patricia's place, this time with a friend. Patricia is wonderful: gracious, funny, smart, unflappable. Her home is well-located, clean, and as full of personality as its host. It's an older house thus cozy and great for curling up with a book or conversation. Breakfasts are fresh (especially the eggs) and nourishing. We enjoyed our stay and hope to return."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful little home very close to Trenton and the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park. The host makes fantastic breakfasts, perfect for a hungry cyclist. Our conversations were a lot of fun as well...good food, good coffee, cool old house...great stay."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia offers a delicious breakfast and lots of snacks and tea/coffee/ beverages.
In addition she has lots of information on local sites and activities and has many suggestions.
The location is very near the PA/NJ border where there is lots to see and do."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia is a wonderful host, and it was an excellent stay! Very much a bed and breakfast feel. The food was great! Thanks again!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful and cozy place on the north side of Trenton. The host Pat was extremely responsive and we had a great conversation. The room and amenities were beyond our expectations. Oh and an amazing breakfast - ‚Äúsimple‚Äù per Pat but very delicious to us. We highly recommend staying here.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my first time using airbnb - my only other Bed and Breakfast experiences were traveling with my husband in Scotland and England. I'd say that Pat's place replicates that kind of experience very well: a private bedroom in a real home, delicious full breakfast, convenient bathroom, privacy, and conversation (at breakfast) as you like. Pat was around at breakfast time, so I could let her know my schedule for the next day and ask any questions. The yard is lovely, and the house is older but very well-kept and comfortable, and there were a lot of nice touches to make things comfortable: a pitcher of water, dried fruits, and a tea-making station, information about restaurants and tourist attractions, magazines to read, and so forth. The wifi worked great for my purposes. I was commuting every day for 9 days to a class that met at 8 AM at a fire station in Washingtons Crossing, PA, and the drive each way was about 15 minutes mostly on roads along the Delaware river. (It would have also been quite bike-able mostly on canal paths, had I taken a bicycle or rented one from Pat.) The house is also easily accessible from 2 different exits on 295, and I easily drove to Princeton a couple evenings, once on Rt. 1 and once through Lawrenceville, both straightforward drives. There are several grocery stores, drug stores, gas stations, 7-11, etc. within 5-15 minutes of the house, and Pat has a shelf each in the fridge and freezer designated for the bnb guest. I never cooked - no time - so the cooked breakfasts were very helpful. Highly recommended for an authentic bed and breakfast experience!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pat was very inviting and she offers pretty much anything you would need during your stay. Her home is uniquely decorated and very clean. She keeps up with cleanliness and makes sure towels, sheets, etc. are always available/changed. I stayed in the West Room--the bed is amazingly comfortable!
Pat is a wonderful host and accommodating. I enjoyed my stay very much!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great atmosphere, wonderful breakfasts, two very friendly cats and an other one."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a place to stay that is quite, close to everything in Central NJ or Bucks County PA this is your new rest stop. The breakfast was delicious. The coffee and snacks were easy to access and in abundance. The host was great to respect if you wanted to talk or not. Will be back!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pat‚Äôs place was great, fresh and clean and comfortable. My daughter loved her cats, and Pat let her gather eggs from the chickens. Breakfast was delicious and we really enjoyed our conversations with Pat. Great location too. Would stay here again for sure."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Me & my husband needed a little overnight getaway & staying here was the perfect space!! Pat was so kind & respectful of giving us privacy. The breakfast was awesome!! We also adored having the cats hang out with us being cat parents ourselves. Highly recommended!!

2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although the location of the house is not in a very convenient location for transportation, transportation is nearby, and you can meet Pat, the host.The people were really nice, very hospitable, and the breakfast cooked was super delicious!Very suitable for non-Americans to stay, the host is very, very patient, even if your English is very bad, it can be through body language, expression, or even google translation, it can also be appropriate to let the host know what you mean, and the host will not be impatient at all!Ë∂ÖÁ¥öËÆöüëçüëç
I‚Äôm so glad to meet a nice host. It‚Äôs my first time to live in airbnb.It‚Äôs a awesome experient to meet the host Pat.Even though you have a bad English speaking. Pat is a very very patient and nice host.Recommend!!!!!!! It‚Äôs suit a non-american to live. Because it can let you know so much in America. Not only about foodüòÇüòÇ"

2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Our room was so lovely and comfortable, there is a deep bathtub, and all the extra touches that Pat provides are so nice, like water, candles, 24/7 hot water, tea, coffee, snacks, breakfast, etc. Pat is so nice to visit with, but gives you space as well, and she is very accommodating and helpful in using the area with menus and local information furnished. A local Italian restaurant that did delivery (I think Salerno's III) worked with me for special dietary needs. I recommend them. I will happily stay here whenever I'm in the area!"

2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I reluctantly give Pat a stellar review because I am a repeat customer and it is getting more competitive to book with her. But, she is terrific, full of hospitality and deserves all the fruits of her well run business. The rooster crowing in the morning is a unique touch that you just don't get at most places. I love it...you will too."

The area is very peaceful and close to many exciting things like Terhune Orchards, Princeton, great restaurants, and even Six Flags. I would definitely come back!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Charles was a great host and the space was very nicely furnished and clean.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a weekend away to go to Sesame Place with our toddlers.
Right Away, I realized how convenient staying there would be as they have a pack n play and the bedrooms were large enough to have two in one bedroom with room to spare. The closets are huge and the smart tv in the living room was great for keeping them entertained.
The neighborhood was very quiet and there were a lot of delicious restaurants around to order delivery from.
The instructions for check-in and for check-out were very clear and easy.
Charles was very pro-active in asking how our stay was and making sure everything was above our expectations.
I will definitely be staying at Charles‚Äô places in the future. He is a great host!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, clean apartment."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,We had some minor things that came up which were promptly addressed and resolved by Charles. It was very hard to adhere to the noise policy with 4 people walking up and down the creaky stairs. The space was accommodating and I appreciated the availability of coffee grounds for the coffee pot. Owner managing the HVAC system to go no lower than 73 was very frustrating as it was over 90 degrees during our stay. The bedrooms seemed tolerable however the family room/ living room at times were very uncomfortable. My slight annoyance was being overly communicated to about the check out time being sharply at 11am.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My stay was great! The apartment was very very clean which is #1 on my list for importance, especially with little kids. It was very easy to communicate with Charles and we appreciated the early check in so that we could put our stuff in the fridge before heading out for the day. Kitchen is well equipped, shower was clean and good pressure. Beds were very comfy. The only thing I have to mention is the thermostat. We had to keep bringing the thermostat down to 73. I don‚Äôt know what happened but it kept going up on its own and overnight I was really hot and came out to it at 78.
Other than that I have no complaints and I would stay again!"

Charles responds quickly to questions and requests. During our 3 week stay we needed a replacement toaster and soup spoons and these were provided in a timely fashion. The location was great with easy access to major highways. In addition there are many interesting sights locally, and good restaurants, pizzerias, bakeries, breweries, and even a farmers market close by. I highly recommend the Gingered Peach bakery in Lawrenceville, and a hike in the Loveless Nature preserve which connects with the Johnson Trolley Line trail. Highly recommend. Thank you Charles"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great airbnb! Provided a lot of blankets, beds were very comfortable. Soap and other utilities were available, there was also a kitchen and a large TV for your needs. Location was good if you‚Äôre in the area or going to six flags! Overall, good experience."
2021-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a clean, spacious space with a quiet atmosphere and extra storage space, then this is it!
However, this space is meant for couples with no kids. They have a noise curfew, so parents with infants and toddlers be aware. The space feels like a bachelor pad which is okay because you see come across in the photo‚Äôs.
As a mom of a 20 month old, it‚Äôs hard to reply to every email I see. Receiving over 10 emails all saying the same thing is way too much. The neighborhood was decent but around the corner felt a little sketchy.
The host was great and we appreciate the stay; however we won‚Äôt plan another stay in the future."

However, that would be unfair, and besides the word is out. Denise is a gem of an Airbnb host and so is her apartment.

And, I love being able to take a hot shower with excellent water pressure. Kudos Denise. I will be back."

The area is unlike the rural setting we live in, and was a bit unsettling to our dogs initially. In the end, it was actually relatively quiet, comfortable, and everyone settled in well.
Thanks, and I would recommend the host, as well as the area too."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Stayed 4 months during training for work. Was a decent place to stay for the time being.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Pros: prompt communication with Javann, who was always respectful and courtesy; nice side and backyard for your furry family member; nice water pressure in the shower; futon bed for use in closet; good deal if bringing your dog!
Cons: sketchy area but never felt unsafe; street parking is crowded but we were able to always find a spot close by; was not a fan of the bed but I am very picky about my bed!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was really nice! I picked the locations specifically to be near my old neighborhood so it was perfect. Bed and couch were comfy. Only drawback is it has wall units for heating/cooling (itself not an issue) and it was quite cold. As a policy the units are turned on by the guest which meant it was very cold when I arrived in the evening and the bed has a quilt only, so I was very cold until I finally got the wall unit figured out.
Besides that, lovely visit."

The shower was huge and had two showerheads, and we loved that there was a heater specifically in the bathroom. It was very cold the night we got in, so it was very nice to step out of the shower and not be instantly freezing. We were also pleased to see that there were railings in the bathroom for guests with disabilities--although we aren't disabled ourselves, it was awesome to know our hosts care about accessibility in their unit. Shawn was also a very responsive host, and he answered any of my questions quickly. He was aware that we were driving up from Florida and arrived late at night, and he messaged us and offered that we could check-out a little later if needed. It was an offer he was not obligated to make, so it stood out to us as very thoughtful. The next time we are in NJ, we will definitely stay here again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect! Easy access & check-in, clear instructions, clean and functional living space. Would be back in a heartbeat!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shawn's cottage was a warm welcoming. He provided all the essentials we needed and had a list of local restaurants and fun things to do. He was quick to respond when we reached out and I fortunately got to meet him. He is such a nice family man. I highly recommend staying in this lovely inviting cottage the next time you plan on visiting Central New Jersey.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A cozy space that is well set up for accessibility needs. We really enjoyed it!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This studio cottage fulfilled all of our needs for a weekend stay in the Lawrence area. Although it is a standalone place, the driveway is shared, but there's plenty of space for multiple cars with additional street parking.
As for the space itself, it was very cozy & comfortable-- simple, and also very accessible (due to wide doors, a wide standing shower space with TWO options for showerheads, and supportive handrails in the bathroom and by the bed.) While my partner and I did not have any need for it, those little details make this a thoughtful option for wheelchair users, elderly and disabled; it would be nice to see more places with that in mind.
The accommodations such as the TV with numerous streaming options, comfy couch, FULL SIZE refrigerator and freezer, and well-equipped kitchen corner make this a valuable stay. Shawn was very proactive and friendly, at no loss to our privacy. The house rules and check-in/-out procedures were even framed! Bookmark this one. Thanks Shawn!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for a few days while I was in the area for a conference. It's about a 15-minute drive from Princeton University. The neighborhood and the cottage itself are peaceful and quiet; the cottage is compact but quite spacious enough for one or two people. I was able to come and go quietly each day, but Shawn checked in with me via message to make sure that everything was going smoothly. And the price makes it much more affordable than a Princeton hotel near the university!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shawn is a great host. The cottage looked like the pictures. The cottage was clean, warm feeling and cozy. It was easy to find. Shawn was flexible with check in time and check out timing. It was easy to communicate with Shawn. I would highly recommend staying here and I will again in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, impeccable and comfortable. was delighted."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shawn it's an absolute legend. He helped me greatly, went way above and far beyond, and was a delight to talk to. You can tell the amount of care he puts into being a host, and out of the system Airbnbs I've used, he was the best, not even close. I'll definitely be booking it again when the time comes"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, well put together little space! Remodeled considering both comfort and functionality; the hosts Luann and Shawn really made this a nice addition to the airbnb community. Hubby and I were in town to visit family, so we only stayed for one night, but if you are going to be in the Lawrence or surrounding Townships sightseeing, or on business, stay here! We even were without our car rental for the 1st day in town, and still had access via Uber Eats and Lyft to everything in a matter of minutes...very nice stay, met our expectations seamlessly!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely little studio, comfortable bed, and very friendly hosts. Huge shower and everything is completely handicap accessible."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first actually-completed stay at an Airbnb since we joined. (We had many cancellations due to COVID in the last few years.). Firstly, the hosts met us on arrival and were welcoming and super-nice. We were well informed that if there were any issues, they would be just a text away to make our stay as pleasant as could be. The small cottage had everything that one would need for a longer stay (nice kitchen, large-ish refrigerator, excellent air conditioning, ADA compliance), but since we were only staying for one night we didn‚Äôt use most of this except for the air conditioning which worked well to keep our stay comfortable given that the outdoor temps were hot and muggy. The television was great with many streaming offerings. The cottage was clean and well-maintained as was the bathroom. Hot water was quickly available in the shower. The location was perfect for us since we were attending an event at Washington Crossing Historic Park in Pennsylvania, which was about 15 minutes away. We didn‚Äôt experience any undue traffic noise, so we got good sleep. Bed was comfortable."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay, the place is just as described. The access to the backyard was a plus, since we were traveling with our 5 year old son.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice and clean, was actually bigger than pictures showed. My biggest issue was that although parking was free, it wasn‚Äôt stated that it was on street parking, and and first come first serve. It‚Äôs not told until after you pay/reserve the place. It‚Äôs a little too close to the main road for me to be comfortable parking my vehicle on the street with $30k worth of motocross gear and equipment in the back of a truck."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place I really enjoyed
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"I really enjoyed my stay here, and overall would recommend it over a similarly priced hotel. Please note that even though there are more bad things listed than good, the good has more weight! This place is probably 4/5 stars in my mind.
The Good:
- Really safe, quiet neighborhood.
- Locking building door (redundant security).
- Mostly clean rooms.
- Nice & new/clean kitchen appliances!
- Well-stocked/supplied kitchen utensils and basic pantry ingredients.
The Bad:
- Difficult lockbox deciphering- hard to tell which lockbox/key is for the room vs. the building.
- Loud air conditioning, set very warm (73 degrees).
- Window AC is unfiltered, allergy/smoke-filled air, but works well.
- Due to it being an old building, there are some marks/stains on the walls. This is okay.
- Really bad (low) water pressure in the shower.
- Odd placement of furniture in relation to wall outlets.
- Kind of gross shower floor.
- Not enough towels.
- Small east-coast style bathroom."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charles was a very responsive, friendly and proactive host. The room itself met our expectations and provided just the environment we were looking for; quiant, tranquil and roomy. Also in a great neighborhood with beautiful surroundings. Just 20 min from the PA border, it was impossible to be dissatisfied. Room was also very accurate to the pictures and experience. Very satisfied as a first time BnB user! Hope to stay with Charles again!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Charles's place was very good, central to many places we needed during our stay. However, there were a few caveats such oily/unclean dishes in the cabinets/drawers, an unloaded dishwasher also with unclean dishes, the soap bottle in the kitchen being filled with just water, a missing light bulb in the lamp, very spotty wifi, and plug outlets with loose cover panels. It was a decent stay, and we are grateful for the space outside of the few incoveniences when we wanted to use provided supplies."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a fantastic stay with Charles! I‚Äôm local to the area of this listing and needed a convenient place to stay as my hardwood floors were being refurbished.

2022-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Comfortable, clean studio, easy access to Princeton. I spent an extended amount of time here and was pleased with how responsive Charles was in answering questions and addressing any issues during my stay. I was working from the apt during my stay, internet bandwidth was good, and the neighborhood was quiet. Laundry area is easy to access and in good order. Parking is plentiful; note, you will need a car to get to grocery, restaurants etc."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fairly quite location, though not a lot of good grocery options near by. Seems strange to have to strip the bed and take out the garbage as we typically don't do that at airbnbs but otherwise is was a nice place to stay for a short period of time."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This listing was a great place to stay. the room is very stylish, comfortable and CLEAN. I would definitely stay here again."

2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Charles is a fantastic host, offering top notch customer service. Even with the few minor inconveniences faced along the way, mainly related to housekeeping, he goes above and beyond to make things right. Although he manages multiple properties, he makes you feel as though your stay is the only one he is attending to. Coming from a hospitality background myself, that is no easy feat. The neighborhood is so charming and close to major highways, and shopping and attractions. The studio is modern and updated with all the necessary amenities, yet also cozy and inviting. The bed is comfortable and the entire place is set up for a very quiet and peaceful stay. Highly recommend any of the rooms on this property, but especially this studio! Thanks Charles!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Charles‚Äô place was very handy for an event in Washington Crossing (~15min drive; ~25mins to New Hope). This is the first time I‚Äôve had the complaint of over-communication - duplicate very long cut&paste messages re the check-in process, and multiple reminders the morning of check out. Maybe they have had bad experiences in the past, but this really felt like overkill to the responsible adult. There was a small ant issue in the kitchen but Charles was very responsive and was going to deal w it when we left. Overall, a nicely laid out space, plenty of towels, soap/shampoo/conditioner/Purell provided, nice shower space but fair water pressure, adequate provisions (kitchen basics provided) to cook a meal if so inclined, a stove top kettle (we love our tea), and good value. We did appreciate the attention to quiet hours and the enforcement of recycling. Would stay again if in the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Like my first time staying at Charles‚Äô studio months ago, this time was just as comfortable and wonderful. As soon as I went in the unit, it smelled clean and fresh. Everything was spotless."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Extremely quiet and nice place. The room itself is perfect. Completed with easy access Netflix and a very big shower!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was very nice and clean. It was extremely convenient to check in and it really does feel like your own space. It is like staying at a hotel but with a home-y charm. One of my favorite airbnb experiences I have had.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Value! The property is clean, comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. We stayed on a hot and humid week in August but the A/C kept us very comfortable. A+."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable stay in a quiet location! The manager (Charles) was very responsive and got back to any questions we had within the hour.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Smooth check in, pretty clean, comfortable"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,No complaints!! Would recommend :)
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 stars in this review, I‚Äôll definitely do it because out of all my stays on Airbnb, Mr. Charles has been the best on my stay, the place was so clean, the neighborhood was safe and quiet, the price was good. He replied very fast and asked if I needed anything, you barely see anyone who host a place that puts a lot of work for someone‚Äôs stay. If you think to reserve his place, I‚Äôll recommend it, 10/10"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time in an Airbnb and this has set my standards very high. The space was comfortable and so beautiful.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was perfect! I rented it for my daughter and son-in-law to give them some privacy during a family visit. It was clean, quiet and had everything they needed. Why pay for a hotel pool and workout center if you don't need one? It's very convenient - and had a great shower! I highly recommend Charles & Launchpad Realty."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a good stay. It had all of the necessities needed for a quick trip to the area. This property is situated in a quiet and nice neighboorhood that is close to many stores you could possibly need as well. Would definitely recommend.

2021-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately when I showed up the unit had not been cleaned, with used sheets still on the bed and used towels on the sofa from the previous guest. I messaged Charles and he quickly responded even though it was 10PM at this point. He immediately provided me a refund and there was extra clean sheets that I just put on the bed. It was obviously not ideal that the place wasn't cleaned, but Charles made it right and this seemed like a fluke occurrence. Otherwise the place was as described and a decent place for my quick overnight stay."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay at their property.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nothing short of amazing! The place was a lot better than I envisioned. There‚Äôs this sort of cozy feeling to it, a home away from home if you will. Although it‚Äôs a studio apartment there is more than enough space and the places comes equipped with everything you need. Extra bedding, kitchen essentials, and a vibe!!
Thanks again Charles"

The place was very clean and immediately felt like home once I settled in. It had all the kitchen essentials, plenty of extra towels, a super comfortable bed, and also tons of space to store my belongings. Charles and Maika responded to all my questions and needs very quickly and helped me work through any problems as soon as they came up. The neighborhood is super quiet and peaceful, and I enjoyed taking walks to see all the Christmas decorations. This place is also pretty close to many grocery stores, restaurants, and TCNJ but far away enough from the noise. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to the area!"
