2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great gem of a house: late 20s/30s bungalow felt just like grandma's house. Great design & updated everything, but with antique/vintage touches too (old turntable & records to play was a nice touch). Fantastic bedding/linens, tons of amenities, stocked kitchen. Everything was impeccably clean, too. The recommendations for local eateries & such were well done. The only drawbacks were neighborhood, noise & cooling. The house is in a pretty empty neighborhood---sketchy? I don't know the area, so hard to say, but not a place we felt comfortable walking around at night. The location is just a block off the major east/west highway which parallels major train tracks, so you will need ear plugs for the noise (constant throughout the night---but they were provided). Also, there is an AC in the living room, but not in the bedrooms: if you need it cool to sleep you will not be happy. Overall, though, we loved this house & would certainly stay again on our next drive through El Paso."

I wanted a place to crash for the night while driving from CA to TX. Leaving the car overnight with full of stuff was safe."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Adorable house! Above and beyond as Laura has thought of everything you might need during your stay.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita is conveniently located in El Paso with some of the most thoughtful host touches! The space was clean, well appointed, cozy and just as described.
For other sensitive sleepers, these are not at the fault of the host, but are worth a mention. The train traffic was consistent and very audible, trash comes very early and the neighbor animals can be rowdy late and early. There are earplugs and fans if those work for you to block out noise. You would be hard pressed to find a location nearby without these downsides.
If you want a great deal with a very kind host centrally located in El Paso, this is the rental for you! We would stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Laura was eager to help my daughter and I have a comfortable stay for one quick night. Her place was perfect. There was a sweet coffee and tea bar set up.

The decorations were so lovely. Thank you Laura for being a responsive host!!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place was super cute. She really put a lot of effort into the details and made the small space very workable. We were 2 couples so it was cozy (sharing a bathroom) but still very comfortable for our short stay. Laura went above and beyond accommodating our requests and letting us have a late check out.
The neighborhood is commercial and busy, (home was super sound proof tho) a bit far from "" downtown"", if that's important to you, but close to the airport which worked great for us. We also enjoyed the ""local flavor"".........."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best place I've stayed yet!
Describe the space and experience in one word: Comfort.
Truly felt like home. If I am ever in the area I will look this casita up for certain. Casita has a well stocked kitchen and all your basics in the bathroom to wash up, even black towels for make up removal and disposable towelettes. I forgot my toothbrush and the complimentary one was perfect. The beautiful natural lighting in the day was perfect. Decor was fitting for the city and the culture. I truly wouldn't know how to improve this place.
Quiet & safe neighborhood. Having a private parking was very helpful. Really enjoyed ourselves and got some good inspo for home. Host was very attentive and responsive.
Gracias!"

The shower was aaaamazing!! The kitchen was equipped with all the essentials and more! The delicious Coffee and tea was the perfect way to start the day. Even my kitties felt at home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to El Paso for a short stay to have a procedure done for our young son. Laura’s Casita was everything we could have asked for and more. Not only was the decor beautiful and intentional, but there were so many personal touches including toiletries that are often forgotten, coffee, tea and bottled water in the fridge. Despite the extreme heat outside, the casita stayed very cool (we are from the mountains and we’re comfortable!).
The home itself felt incredibly peaceful and really felt like home, making the stress of the nature of our visit much less so.

Had a few concerns though—the temp throughout the day and evening was fixed around 80 although I had set it at 72. Laura was quick to respond and offered to send someone out to inspect the AC, which I appreciated.
Was gonna use the chili crisp in the kitchen, but I noticed it expired in 2022 so I did lose confidence in that area of the house."

We really loved the stay in this house , 100% cleanliness, with all the amenities and up to a little more … 100% recommended !!! 🤩🤩"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I were in central El Paso for a family event and were very happy with our choice of Laura's casita. The neighborhood is modest, but the house is very well built and creatively appointed. The beds were super comfy, we appreciated the amenities in the bathroom, and the whole place was very clean and tidy. The bonus is the close proximity to J & L Cafe, an El Paso institution since 1927! Parking can be tight if you're driving to the restaurant, but it's less than a 5-minute walk from Laura's. Very positive stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First, I want to say that I had an emergency and Laura was so willing to work with me for a date change. So thankful!!!
Second, her place is beautiful!!! I love her little casita! Beautifully decorated, so lovely, cozy and homey! The place was so clean and inviting! I wish I would have been able to stay longer but we were just driving through on our way home!

The space gives of the cool vibe that we all hope for in an Airbnb while still maintaining a cozy level of comfort. From the Latin records to Mexican blankets I loved all the reminders of our proximity to Mexico. The kitchen had all of the needed amenities, including spices and oils, a beautifully appointed coffee bar including a tea kettle for us who prefer our caffeine a little more mild. The beds and pillows were comfortable and the linens were divine. I actually liked them so much I checked the tags. Laura was quick to communicate and a great host. I’ll be back."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the start Laura's place in El Paso looked from the outside just like my Aunt Pita and Uncle Adolfo's house in Santa Fe, small porch, gravel yard, and even the flagstone exterior. Inside was a perfect space, sparse, decorated impeccably, down to an anthology of Contemporary Mexican Fiction that I dived into. The rooms were toasty and warm; it was especially cool at night when we stayed. Though we didn't really use the kitchen, it was appointed perfectly. The neighborhood was quiet and having a driveway to park the car was quite helpful. The beds were comfy and my son appreciated the small desk in the back bedroom. A very nice place to stay."

Don't have it. It has come out of it. It has already come up with everything. Ping pong table, billiards , and we had a lot of space for the babies. We were also 7 of a baby and she wanted us to meet some of her parents with us with some of her sergeons, among others. We told her that she is in the army and that we had not seen her. If we could have 3 friends that happened. To eat at the house and without a problem, none of them said clear to them. There are no problems. The cleanliness of that house was on the other level. They also had some bottles of water, etc., we bought it, the purchase we had and what was left over, we left a wine and the beers were made by a little wine and beers for the baby mattress and quickly did not bring them.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay. Everything was up to our expectations. Close to everyone we came to see. Backyard was nicely kept up including outdoor TV. Pool looked refreshing but too cold to use. Hopefully when we return during warmer we’ll get a chance to use it. The only negative was the traffic on Pebble Hills was loud if you were out back. But will definitely stay again. Best of the 3 houses we stayed at in El Paso booked through Air bnb. Job well done Albert!

So much thought was put into every inch of that beautiful home and ANYONE who stays there will be blown away.
1000000 stars!! I’m a local and I plan to book this place for a staycation with my kids just for fun :)
My guests from out of town made these remarks,
Comedian Alex Ansel - “this place is like a comedy club condo!”

Albert was fabulous host. He had arranged birthday balloons on our arrival knowing we were there on vacation to White sands for my wife's B'day. He was always available on the chat and checked with us couple of times to make sure everything's going good.
The home was tastefully decorated. Attention to detail is priceless! This place does not disappoint- you will never want to depart! our key takeaway from this trip is - 'when we plan on to buy a home in future , we now know a reference point to look in to as to how we wanted it to be!'"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are a regular Airbnb travelers and would rate Albert's place as one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was extremely clean, modern, and had everything we needed to feel at home. When we first stumbled upon this amazing home on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online.The rooms were cozy along with super comfortable beds and modern bathrooms. The decoration was thoughtful and hand picked touches that gave it a unique look. Finally the backyard along with the swimming pool was the icing on the cake. Hands down worth the stay!!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great 3 bedroom house with a pool (not heated) and plenty of fun things to do around the property. There’s a small pool table that turns into a ping pong table and a PAC Man game in one of the bedrooms. Very spacious home and great decor. We tried to fit 8 people, but was more comfortable at 6 (you may want to bring an air mattress for more than 6). Albert was very responsive to any questions and checked in to ensure our stay was going well. Check out time is pretty early, but overall a great place to stay and relax."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the beginning there was clear concise communication from the host. Immediately upon arrival you can see how much effort and time the host takes care of the place. The inside is spectacular and clean. The bathrooms have a speaker that hooks up to a Bluetooth that for some, maybe used and suitable for occasional long showers. The pool was amazing and clean. The back drop had a unique feel of El Paso. The back yard had amenities that were suitable for all ages, kids and adults. I highly recommend this to all.. highly worth the buck."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hector Isaiah'sAirbnb, and I can't recommend it highly enough. From the moment I arrived, everything exceeded my expectations.
The property was impeccably clean, well-maintained, and beautifully decorated. The photos in the listing don’t do it justice – it’s even more charming in person. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the amenities provided made me feel right at home.
The location was perfect, situated in a quiet neighborhood but still close to local attractions.
Hector Isaiah was an exceptional host, always quick to respond to any questions and genuinely committed to ensuring a pleasant stay. They provided clear instructions for check-in and check-out, making the entire process seamless and stress-free.
Overall, my stay was fantastic."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our vacation was perfect, thanks to Jenny! She did everything she could to make us feel welcome and get us what we needed! I couldn’t ask for a better host! Definitely would go back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is spectacular for having fun with the family. Everything was extremely clean and smelly. The pool and common areas are very cozy. Jenny was an excellent host and made the stay easy. I recommend it 100% and we will definitely be back.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! The house was even better than the pictures. The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Jenny was always quick with her responses before during and after the stay. This was not some cheaply stocked company run Airbnb. Everything at the house was made to make you feel at home. Really comfortable new mattresses and soft linens. Jenny clearly put a lot of thought into what someone would need when traveling and made sure each room had every convenience. It’s a fairly new listing but it will undoubtedly soon be listed as a guest favorite. Incredibly refreshing booking a place and having it exceed expectations.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Outstanding host. Beautiful home. Very clean. The host had great communication from the get go. We felt right at home. Definitely our favorite stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was awesome!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice home. Issue with check in code being wrong and had to sit waiting for awhile for response.
The “spa” is a jetted bathtub in bathroom, not hot tub. “Pool with 2 heaters” never got over 63 degrees. So couple downfalls there.
Bbq area and inside of home were great though."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a fabulous stay! Our kids spent the week in the backyard in the amazing pool, and on the basketball court; evenings were spent lounging inside watching movies."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cristina was the best host we have ever had. Prompt, conscientious, efficient. We would happily work with her again. Property manager Bobby terrific, going above and beyond on Christmas Eve. Our only concern was that the heat—of both showers and rooms—was uneven. Great house (particularly the kitchen, pool, and basketball court) that needs some work. In short: Cristina 6 stars! House 4."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a beautiful house to stay in. The sauna was great, so was the pool! I had a question on how to turn on a specific light and Cristina linda sent Bobby to the rescue minutes before our primo reunion in time of need. Overall great experience 🙌"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had an awesome time at Cristina’s! There is a basketball court and the pool is immaculate. My daughter loved hanging out at the theatre room watching Netflix movies. The upstairs bedroom is designed to be a 🧘 zen space. It’s so easy to get
To and a nice drive way where you can park right next to the door. Overall I would stay here again."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great area of El Paso to spend a week. Nice place, well stocked, clean."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cristina is an amazing host, she was very flexible and understood the needs I had for my event.
The chateau is incredible and just like the pictures, we didn’t have time to try the sauna, but we did use the pool and it’s amazing!! We did good use of the entire backyard.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, wonderful host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If entertainment is what you’re looking for then this is the place. The boys played a few games of basketball, we were in the pool for hours and then we finally headed inside to relax and watch a movie in the theater room! The master bedroom bed is very comfortable. Kitchen is well equipped with appliances for cooking if you’re staying for more than a few days. Unfortunately i didn’t get to use the sauna since our stay was short but one of my guest did and they said it was amazing!
Cristina is a great host and quick to respond. We’re definitely looking forward to another staycation here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great vacation stay! Entire family had a terrific time. Plenty of space for kids and pets. Home was in a convenient location. Home was very tidy and pool was huge and sparkling clean. Wonderful visit, cant wait to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was perfect, my siblings and me enjoyed so much our stay, we had room for all of us, we enjoyed the beautiful pool so much!!!. Is one of the greatest things about this house. Since we are a big family this house was perfect for us to bind and have an amazing time as a family. Cristina was so sweet and she’s on top of everything to make your stay the best experience. We’ll definitely rent this house again ♥️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"First and foremost, let me just say that Cristina was a great host. She responded to any messages I had in a timely manner. The house is just as described, very spacious and clean, and the outdoor area was great for my me and my family. I would definitely rent this house again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was as described. The theater room and the pool were the areas we spent the most time, and had the most fun. The backyard is beautiful. There were a couple small issues, such as there being a power outage around the whole block, including the whole house. However, Cristina was very responsive and very helpful, even though the power outage was out of her control. Overall, we had a great time, and Cristina was the best!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Great beautiful house. Perfect for family gathering. The host is very responsive.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is very nice but needs updating. There were inconveniences due to how the house was left by previous guests that consequently required maintenance during our stay, but Christina was always communicative and quick to respond to our requests. The house is spacious, comfortable and fit the needs of our large family, and the kids loved the pool. The housekeeper and house manager were also friendly and helpful."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This property will forever be in our memories, my family and i had the best time as we rented this property to bring family together to celebrate my daughters graduation. Cristina was very nice in allowing to do so. This property is exactly as described, beautiful on the inside and out."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cristina and her team were great. She was helpful, flexible and a great host. Lovely home, lots of amenities, would recommend to any large family looking for a private getaway."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was lovely. The kids lived in the pool. We only got the slide to work on the first day we arrived. I do wish we had figured out how to get the slide to come back on. Everyone wanted to shower in the main suite because it was so big with water coming from all directions. The host had board games which came in handy when it rained. The beds were comfortable. Maybe a few more cleaning supply’s in the house as a suggestion. Overall great experience!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, felt like home"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property is everything shown and described plus some!! Cristina was very responsive in any and all communications. The property was very clean, everything functioned as it should, easy to access, and will definitely be staying here again!!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean, the beds were comfortable, the pool was really nice on the days it was clean and the movie room was awesome. And Cristina allowed us to enter the house early to drop off groceries which was above and beyond.
There were a few amenities that didn’t work/we couldn’t use. We couldn’t play basketball since the balls were deflated. We bought our own pump but that didn’t help. We couldn’t use the outdoor shower or sound system. Per the property manager, the outdoor shower drain was clogged since last summer and the sound system was fried during a snow storm. We also couldn’t use the Tonal. No password was provided.
There isn’t a house manual either like other Superhost houses I’ve stayed in. It would have been nice to have one since there are a lot of remotes and amenities with no instructions.
Overall though it was a nice stay and my family and I had a great time."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Nicest Place I've stayed at in El.Paso. Beautiful, Roomy,Clean

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a great trip to El Paso! The backyard is amazing in this beautiful home. Cristina couldn’t be kinder or more responsive.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I rented this mansion for a photoshoot and I am gonna tell everyone that this was my home. The host was amazing and communication was excellent. Check in was so super easy with keyless entry. A code is provided. The mansion was majesty to say the least. The pool area is breathtaking. I wish I have a drone. Everything in the house is luxurious. I will definitely go back. This house was the one used to shoot Jersey Shores for MTV. We are so grateful to have this mansion right here is in El Paso. Thank you Cristina (host).

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was worth every penny. I can not begin to describe how much fun our family had. The fun had was related to house we stayed in. The kids enjoyed the movie theatre room and the pool, they were entertained the whole time with something fun and exciting. The older kids and adults enjoyed play basketball against each other on the full court basketball court and that was also loads of fun. The outdoor patio and kitchen was great for us to hang out and grill at, we did most of our cooking out there. This place was great. We had an accident in the kitchen with some broken glass and the host was super understanding of little kids and allowed us to continue our weekend. We informed them right away of it happening and ended up paying for the repair. The host is super easy and kind and their house is a great place for your family. Well worth the buck."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cristina and AJ are awesome hosts. They allowed early check-in and even offered a late checkout.

Cristina and her husband we very inviting and had great communication she was on it!! Would get back to me right away. Hopefully we can come back again. ❤️"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here for 5 days. We opted for an air bnb versus a hotel because there were 8 of us including 4 kids. We loved Aldo's place and the privacy it allowed us to have. The pool was great to have available at all times. the views of the sunsets were amazing. The house itself was great, clean, spacious, and comfortable. Aldo did a great job responding timely to everything we needed. The only details that stuck out for us were the light is the garage did not work, the propane for the grill was empty, and the door was difficult to unlock/ open. That being said, we would absolutely stay again and recommend others to stay."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aldo's place was exactly as described! We were in town for the UTEP Fall Commencement. The subdivision is new and beautiful and located in a great area of town with access to supermarkets, restaurants, and shopping. The floor plan is perfect for families or couples who like separation between the master and secondary bedrooms. The additional bedrooms are positioned to provide just enough space between them to give all guests their privacy, which is really helpful. And, although we did not have small children, the place was well equipped to host them. We would definitely stay there again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was enough space for a party of 9. There were enough beds for the whole party. We were staying next door to the house that had Christmas lights, it was great, and the kids loved the walk around the neighbor. We enjoyed the pool during the day while it was hot, it was not heated so we waited for the weather to warm up. Enjoyed the areas around the neighbor. Easy to find places to eat."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"In town for funeral, needed a clean safe place for family to stay. My granddaughter absolutely loved the kids table and kids' bed, in the master bedroom. The property has amazing amenities, pool, outdoor patio entertaining area. The house was clean and very roomy. My family and I absolutely loved our stay. The location was fabulous, close to all the places we needed to visit. Plenty of good places to eat close by. The neighborhood was peaceful. When we visited, it was Thanksgiving time, and the neighbor had set up a wonderful Christmas display, which my granddaughter absolutely loved. My family and I would not hesitate to reach out for future stays in El Paso. Thanks to the owner for an awesome experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Can't thank Aldo enough! the house was wonderful. it was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. the large living room was wonderful and all the beds were comfortable. it was perfect to have two and a half bathrooms and a washer and dryer. the kitchen was well equipped. it has a wonderful backyard with a beautiful view of the sunset, a pool, a nice shaded seating area and an outdoor TV. on a side note, we accidentally left some items and Aldo was able to send them back to us very quickly. we REALLY appreciate that (we paid for overnight shipping). we all recommend checking twice or thrice for any items left behind - especially drawers and closets 😹"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Probably the best air b&b rental I’ve ever booked. The pool was a perfect addition to the stay and the style of it was perfect if you have a toddler- large very shallow space only about up to my 2 year olds knees. Awesome view of the mountains. Plenty of cooking utensils to eat at home. Nice smart tv’s even one outside which was also great when the family wanted to be outside but my toddler wanted to chill and watch tv. All around perfect spot in El Paso for a family stay.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands down one of my favorite air bnb’s listed in El Paso. It’s in a beautiful, newer developed area with a park right in front to walk or play basketball and plenty of grass. The home itself is so big inside and is modern. The backyard has a whole grilling set-up. The attention to detail is great and what I appreciated most was the fact there are TVs in more than just the living room! You can relax in bed and watch a movie. The living room tv was so huge we wanted to stay in most of the stay just to relax and bring the movie experience to a more comfortable setting! The master bedroom bed and pillows were phenomenal. I napped so much I did not want to leave this home lol the bed is so big you can roll around comfortably too. The restroom was equally as nice. The home was so clean I walked around barefoot. The host was extremely kind and accommodating. I can’t say enough good things. I really can’t wait to go back! If you get this place consider yourself lucky 💖 It’s a gem."

The pool and backyard were the highlight of the stay for my kids. The beds were comfortable and home was warm and welcoming.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the remodel, esp. the floor. Even though we didn’t have time to enjoy it…loved the cozy backyard. Also appreciated not being required to strip the beds and start the laundry, our last Airbnb stay had us wondering why we didn’t just stay at a hotel !!! I also didn’t see as my bugs, thank you for that. I would definitely stay again if we were in the area"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Thank you again. Super cute place. Very retro style - loved it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home has so much character. I really felt as if I was at home. The bed was so comfortable I really did not want to get up. I would definitely stay here again in the future! BIG SHOUT-OUT to Victor who was able to accommodate me on an early check in at a very very late request from me!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This older house was cute, clean, and nicely furnished. It has been ""lightly"" renovated. A few issues: keyed entry isn't ideal for an Airbnb (prefer smart lock); closet smelled like cigarettes; saggy mattress; AC adjustable only between 74 and 78 ( and El Paso is already hot in May). There's a large fenced backyard, large driveway, and single-car garage (garage door is difficult to open and close, which the house description does mention). The neighborhood was fairly quiet, but close enough to the highway for constant hum. Navigating to and from the house to other parts of El Paso is tricky because of its location. Our host was very communicative during booking, but slower to respond after we checked in. However, he was accommodating of our dogs, which was a win! Finally, one tiny picky thing: some of the art was awesome (limited edition prints that looked local), but other art felt bland and random and kinda killed the vibe. Would have loved more local art!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very nice and the surrounding area is beautiful. Check in was quick and easy. Would recommend 100%!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay!!! Recommend highly!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Victor's was great for us! 2 of us were working so we used the bedroom desk and the dining room table. We had no problems with the internet while working.
The neighborhood is safe and quiet (except a few talkative dogs), easy to access I-10 and US-54, and the house is really cute and nicely laid out.
Victor was proactive and communicative ahead of time about entry instructions, which I really appreciated after driving all the way in from Tucson"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay again. Beds were very comfortable and had a good nights sleep. Overall very clean. Victors instructions were very clear and easy to follow. Really enjoyed his recommendations on different restaurants. We tried several of them and they were all good and close by.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean place, easy check in, overall great place to stop on our road trip!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and comfortable place to stay in El Paso
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful quiet and relaxing stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time staying at Victor's place. Charming beautiful spot. We had a Uhaul & trailer & appreciated the ample parking. Loved walking out to the back yard to have my morning sunshine & tea. Sound machine & work space are a nice touch. Thanks Victor!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect last minute stay for the weekend. Another booking cancelled at the last minute and it could not have been cuter, more accommodating, and convenient. Victor’s info about the Casa and surrounding area including restaurants and fun things to do was great. The area was safe and we felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood and saw a lot of friendly faces.
We loved it and look forward to staying with hi again in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay at Victor's place!! A+++
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Victor was a great host, the house is exactly as described. Nice and clean, easy to find, had plenty of space for a family. Backyard is completely fenced, was perfect for our dog to go out. Water got hot and stayed hot, clean linens and an added bonus the sound machine in bedroom! We all slept great. Victor has a great handbook and lots of recommendations for food and things to do in the area!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable and well appointed. Both bedrooms were quite nice. Slept like a baby. Nice kitchen, we had no problem making dinner, although we do travel with our own knives. but all the plates, bowls, glassware etc you could want. Fairly easy to find although big markets aren't right nearby. Easy check in and out. Enjoyed an evening of just vegging out with Netflix on the comfy couch after a long day of driving and really appreciated the great water pressure and abundant towels in the bathroom. The hosts left a sheet of recommendations that would have been great if we'd had more time but still, appreciated the effort."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had to go to El Paso for a quick turnaround trip, and only stayed at Victor's place for one night. The home was just as is described, and just what I needed. I felt safe in this area, and although I could have used the garage I just parked in the driveway. The home had all of the amenities, clear instructions, and plenty of recommendations where to eat and even places to visit. There are two bedrooms and a quaint living room, dining area, and separate kitchen. I really liked the décor as it felt homey.
Although the home is near the freeway it's in a neighborhood so you don't hear all the busy street traffic. It also made things easy to get to. There is an Albertsons about 5 minutes away by car, so everything was very convenient. I appreciate that Victor offers this home for visitors like us, and his response time is very quick."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a neat little house. The unique decorating and all of the upgrading that has been done really showed off nicely. I wish we had been staying for more than just one night. The neighborhood was very convenient with a few stores and restaurants within walking distance. It was also just a short drive over to UTEP where my weee daughters attending a concert. As I said, this would be a great place to stay for several nights or a week, especially with the kitchen having practically everything, you would need to cook meals every day. I would definitely re has a nice place to stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is perfect! Incredibly clean and so peaceful. Victor is amazing. I’m sure he is the best host Airbnb has to offer. Any time I’m in the area, I will be looking to book this home. Can’t say enough good things about staying here!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Victor's place was an older house but has been kept in good condition. It felt very private and the neighborhood felt safe. Had a one car garage but we just parked in the driveway. It was very clean and the air conditioning and ceiling fans kept the place at a comfortable temp even in the heat wave while we were there. Victor was a courteous and proactive host. Even on the 4th of July with a few fireworks going off in the neighborhood, the noise was not an issue and we slept soundly. Perfect for our one night stay.

2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Mediocre accommodation.
In a quiet area but the neighbor's dogs are very noisy even during the night.
Some downsides regarding cleanliness, accuracy, credibility, and communication."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cozy old bungalow with a retro vibe. Nicely equipped but again it's historic. Inside climate is controlled by host... quite warm in the summer. Neighbors have dogs.. be prepared for noise. While the house is beautiful and has great amenities, the outside environment may not be child friendly or quiet."
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,*review already written from my other stay*
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Terrific place. The host put a lot of effort into the guidebook for the local city.
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here on two separate occasions a week apart and both times the house and yard did not seem overly clean, such as bbq remnants left in the yard, dog poo and a cork left on the bottle opener. The neighborhood had many dogs that bark a lot, I thought it was thoughtful of the host to provide sound machines but now I understand it’s because of the dogs barking all night. You cannot step in the yard without triggering all the dogs to start barking.
Soon after we arrived at the house the host and workman were doing work on the roof which felt very invasive.
The first time we stayed there was no coffee machine which was very inconvenient as that was listed as included.
The thermostat was locked at 78 and could not be made any lower, but we were all hot, including my baby so that was very frustrating not being able to make it cooler in the house.
Overall not a very pleasant stay, luckily these were just stop overs but if you’re looking for a break from a long drive I’d find somewhere else."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Make sure to carefully read the description and the lowest the AC can be set is 75 degrees and some of the rooms feel even hotter. If you have trouble sleeping at night when it’s hot then don’t stay here! The host is not accommodating with regards to changing the temperature either. Otherwise the place was nice and clean

The water heat and pressure were excellent.
Although the freeway was close, the windows are well-insulated and the sounds were more like a distant white noise.
The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk with our 5-year old to a few nearby stores and restaurants.
On that note, an extra kudos to Victor for a very funny, thoughtful and detailed overview of the house and nearby recommendations. It made us wish we had more time in El Paso to dig into the food, outdoors and culture. We would definitely stay here again the next time we pass through."

the only mild issue we had was once we actually got to bed we found it to be a bit uncomfortable, but it was still a clean quite place to rest before continuing on our way.
I'd recommend it, if you're thinking of staying just go for it, you won't regret it."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay here was great! The house is immaculate and the decor makes you feel like you've upgraded your stay. The living room is cozy and the bedroom mattress was Marriot quality (if you travel a lot you know what I mean). ⭐⭐⭐⭐

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you just need a room because you don’t plan to be there much- this place was nice. No other cars at that time so I also got to use the driveway.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sandy is the most responsive, thoughtfulness, friendly host I ever encountered. She frequently communicates with me to ensure I stayed at her place comfortable. The room is spotless. The furniture and lighting are so well selected and placed that I felt right at home. To my delightful surprise, there are fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. Ground coffee, not instant coffee, coffee cream, oatmeal, and snacks were provided in the room. Charging cell phone is very convenience because both lamps on nightstands have USB charging outlets. When I revisit El Paso area, Sandy's place is definably my first choice of staying."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,will always stay here if available
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very clean, the place was very quiet, I recommend it 100%"

The Internet was fast and the whole house was clean and quiet. Getting into my room was very straightforward which I appreciate after a long day of traveling!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sandy was very easy to work with & responded super quickly. She provided easy instructions & code for front & bedroom doors. The house is clean, very tastefully decorated. The bedroom was immaculate, clean sheets plus spare sheets & blankets in the drawers. Although most areas are off limits to guest use, the bedroom had a tv, streaming device, ceiling light & fan with adjustable control, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, desk, chair, dresser, floor lamp, bedside table & table lamp with usb charging port. However, the usb was slow charging, so bring your own wall wart. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was nice, clean. Had double toilet paper dispenser, cute vanity with almost no counter space. Shower was perfectly clean, had spare soap/shampoo. The shower head is mounted a little low on the wall, but that isn't a big deal. It's probably at exactly 6 feet. Tasteful wall art. Check out directions could have been more clear (should I strip bed?) Thank you for great stay!"

We arrived early, and texted Sandy asking if we could check in early, and she saw us parked in front of the house and came out to talk. The space was still being cleaned, but she still was able to let us in about half an hour earlier than we arranged. We would have been fine either way, but we so appreciated her gracious response. I plan to keep staying with Sandy. She makes life so pleasant for her guests. I hope you will decide to enjoy the hospitality of this home, too."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed at Jesus’ place and we were both very pleased. Studio was set up perfectly, and most of all in a safe quiet neighborhood. Which for us peaceful and quiet area was extremely important due to us being in El Paso for my grandmothers funeral services.
First thing my daughter said was “this bed is comfortable” (just like others have said in their reviews). This bed was too comfortable that in the mornings we did not want to get up lol.
I liked how modern and clean the bathroom was (was better than pics I saw of hotels when I was looking for a place).
Kitchen was cute it literally had everything you can think of. We didn't get to cook as we were busy but every dish, kitchen appliance and countertop were very clean. No concerns there. I appreciate that there was coffee.
I only had to message Jesus once, he replied right away and within 10 min I had item at my doorstep. He was a great host through out stay. He checked in and made sure we knew to reach out anytime."

If we are ever back in El Paso we will most definitely try to book this one again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The moment I arrived at Jesus’s rental, I knew I was in for a special stay. The place was immaculate – every corner, clean; every surface, sparkling. It’s evident that Jesus takes great pride in providing a pristine environment for his guests. The space itself was beautifully decorated, exuding a serene and peaceful ambiance that made me feel right at home.
Jesus was an exemplary host – gracious, attentive, and always available to ensure my stay was nothing short of perfect. He welcomed me with a warm smile and provided a detailed tour of the space, highlighting all the amenities. Throughout my stay, he was just a message away, ready to answer any questions or offer local tips.
The location of the rental was ideal, offering easy access to local attractions while providing a quiet retreat to unwind at the end of the day. The neighborhood was safe and welcoming, adding an extra layer of comfort to my visit.

There is a BBQ grill in the back yard and comfortable patio furniture. Even though I was there in January, I spent a lot of time in the back yard enjoying the views. The host immediately responded to questions that came up. This is a good location, close to the restaurants and bars in the Cimarron area and not too far from I 10, so it doesn't take long to get to downtown or Las Cruces in the other direction. I'd definitely stay here again."

It’s very centric and your car it’s safe because you can park on a side of the house and not on the street.

There are so many nice touches that this felt like a home away from home. I was impressed there was a decaf coffee option along with healthy snacks and beverages. The bath products were great and included options for sensitive skin. The guest book was on point and included instructions for the pullout sofa. Everything was so comfortable! There is also a nice covered patio area, equipped with a ceiling fan and electricity so you can comfortably work remotely and play a card game. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rocio is an excellent Hosts; everything is well organized, clean and everything a guest may need, I felt at home. Deeply, thank you very much."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful guest house! Prompt communication from the host, super clean space, and well-decorated. The bed was very comfortable and the room had light darkening curtains. You can tell the hosts put a lot of thought into providing everything you might need.
I also appreciated that the house and yard was well-kept and didn't look sketchy at all from the outside.
One thing that might be an issue is that the doorways and ceiling are shorter than the standard. I'm 5'10"" so it didn't bother me but if you are 6'2""+ you will have to duck under the doors and watch your head for light fixtures. Just something I think about since I have tall people in my family. :)
Overall, this was one of my favorite Airbnb stays!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,From the moment you walk in you feel welcome! I was greeted by a hand written (I think this is great and a lost form of expressing gratitude) welcome card. The place is cozy and very clean and comes equipped with a lot of essentials (some of which I forgot to pack so thank you!). The neighborhood is nice and quiet and the hosts give plenty of space but are available to you whenever you need. I will definitely be staying out here again! I highly recommend

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rocio and Juan’s guest house made us feel like we were at home. Their communication leading to our stay was beyond informative. They were always interested in what they could do for us or if there was anything else that we needed. They went way beyond what they had to make our son feel right at home. He was comfortable and that made us feel comfortable as well. Absolutely stunning home and the hosts make it more memorable with the personal details. We’ll definitely be back! Thank you Rocio and Juan!

It certainly made us feel welcome! We definitely recommend staying here, as it was one of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed at!!"

The guest home is located to the back of the main home but still maintains the privacy you want. The amenities are endless. The AC worked great. The hosts reached our multiple times to ensure we were enjoying our stay. Also, the grass and seating area is so relaxing to enjoy a nice cup of coffee in the morning. I would book again and again. I felt like I was at home the whole time. Located right off the freeway we never had to drive more than 20 minutes to get anywhere. Majority of the places we went were within 10 minutes. Loved it!"

,,,"The house needs a deep cleaning. When we arrived there were many trash bags of the graduation party they had last night. The bags were on the entry side and next to the bathrooms next to the pool. The pool was super dirty of all the people that use it from the grad party. It had cups and we even saw some fake eyelashes on the floor. The shower outside next to the pool does not work. The water slide doesn't work. The labels to turn on the water slide or lights need to be replace. Inside the house the floor was not that clean, they did not mop it correctly, you can still see the stains from the party. The black carpet on the movie theatre was not vacuum. The windows and blinds need to be clean. The house need a lot of updating. My family and I were very happy to stay on the place since we read the reviews but we all agree on the cleaning, it was not clean for us. The house is very spacious and for the title it has about MTV rental the house needs a lot of improvement."
