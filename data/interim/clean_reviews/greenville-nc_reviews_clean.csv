Fresh paint, new furniture, clean, well appointed and super convenient. Peter did a great job on ensuring he checked all the boxes. He was an excellent communicator and proactively provided me updates leading up to check in. Check in day was no different. I woke up to everything I needed to know upon arrival. Id highly recommend commend his condo if you’re in the Greenville aera and want a safe, clean, roomy condo. Convenient, but far enough away that you felt like you could relax at the end of the day. Thanks for making parents weekend at ECU one to remember."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great trip to VistaPoint for ECU parent's weekend with our daughter. We originally had a hotel room but due to the rain we decided to book a house instead since I figured we'd spend more time inside (and I was right).
I'm so glad we booked Abhishek's property - everything was clean, modern, and super comfortable - great for hunkering down over the weekend. Furniture was comfortable and the kitchen was very well stocked. We've been to ECU several times now and this was definitely the nicest place (and area) we've stayed at.
Abhishek was a great host - very communicative and responsive. Will definitely stay there again."

It was such a quiet neighborhood, the view out the sliding door was absolutely beautiful at sunset. The house was so comfortable and had plenty of room. I brought two teens to tour ECU and it was helpful to have separate bathrooms. Lovely washing machine and dryer, comfy bedding, and ceiling fans in each room. Will definitely stay here again."

Unfortunately for any other Airbnb location that we may stay at in the future, that location will be measured by the experiences we've had with Abhishek's place. He's making everyone else's job very difficult. :). The place could not have been better. We will be back. Thanks Abhishek for all you do."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at the Vista Point for an event nearby and had a great experience. The duplex was as described in the listing; the house appeared new and was well kept.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Abhishek’s place during this last 4th of July holiday weekend getaway in Greenville,NC. Abhishek allowed us early check in. It's a really nice townhouse, clean, comfortable and well equipped. Flawless email communication with the host. I was not sure how to operate the door keypad to get into the house but I reached out to Abhishek and he was extremely helpful. (I would just recommend including instructions on how to operate the front door key pad.)
Thank you so much!

It was very clean and had amenities like coffee, creamer, assortment of teas, laundry pods, and dishwasher pods.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No offense to any other ABnB I have stayed in before but Four Seasons/Todd's place is THE best I have stayed in. Todd's whole package is outstanding- super clean, very well decorated, lots of amenities (even if I didn't have time to enjoy), lots of snacks available, chocolates and bottled water in the room.
Really is top notch and should be the gold standard for ABnB. If you are considering opening an ABnB you truly should come here for some startup lessons.
Todd is super friendly and communicates / responds quickly and clearly.
I will recommend this to anyone needing a place to stay in Greenville or just for a getaway to relax.
I will be back."

Other people were staying close by so I felt more comfy ."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Met Mike as we drove in to the space. He introduced himself and also got the key from the lockbox for us, very sweet.

Cabinets held necessities in dishware .Bathroom was as expected with plenty of towels,washcloths, and hand towels,soaps and shampoo and hairdryer .

I had given Mike a little private feedback and I immediately noticed he had made the small changes that made a huge difference! I will definitely be back. Perfect space for one or two travelers. Close to ECU campus but far enough away you’re not in traffic or noise. Mike is very helpful and responsive.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike was great. Very responsive and quick to my questions since this was my first AirBNB. Everything was just as it was stated. He provided everything needed and slept great.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This has become my place to stay when visiting ECU. Just to sit on the porch or inside and read is a little vacation.

The home is immaculately preserved, even down to the detail of having real china dishes to eat breakfast on! There is a wrap around porch that is perfect to have lunch or just relax.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay in the Bach Double room in The Music House, hosted by Dr. John O'Brien, a faculty member of the East Carolina University School of Music. The Music House is located in Uptown Greenville, conveniently within walking distance of ECU and the Tar River Park. The mansion was built in 1902 for Jesse R. Moye, a successful merchant, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The house is beautifully furnished and features John's extensive collection of musical instruments and a large room for hosting concerts and community events. Guests have access to two parlors in the front of the house as well as a charming wrap-around porch. Our private bedroom on the second floor included a comfortable 1860s Queen-size bed and a quaint 1920s tiled bath. Although a continental breakfast was provided, we chose to have brunch at two excellent restaurants nearby. John was a gracious host and welcomed us into his home. We would definitely stay there again."

The wrap around front porch was perfect to sit and unwind at the end of the day. Can't wait to go back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our quick stay at the Music House. Met John and enjoyed learning more of his story. House is beautiful. Great wrap around porch. Room was nice and bed was comfortable. We will be back in a month for a two night stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John's house is a treasure! The room itself is beautiful and clean, with a small but amazing bathroom with gorgeous tile and not just ANY bidet but one with all the bells and whistles. Was able to use a small desk antique desk in the room. There are plenty of opportunities for making coffee/tea, getting snacks, using a small mini fridge, and breakfast is superbly appointed in a dining room fit for visiting royals. This is not to mention all the musical instruments adorning the hallways and music hall, where John was happy to indulge my curiosities about his musical background. Been to many unique Airbnbs, but the interior here is certainly one of the most memorable - don't miss a chance to stay here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second week long visit (first time for my husband) and once again John did not disappoint. John’s hospitality, his awareness to detail, and his thoughtfulness to make sure our stay was the best it could be did not go unnoticed. Almost every night we sat in the parlor and just soaked in our surroundings and on two of those nights we were able to enjoy the beautiful sounds of music being played on the piano. This Airbnb is definitely one of a kind and you won’t be disappointed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,John texted back immediately when the web site wasn’t working correctly and sent me the link to get booked. He met me at the front and was very friendly and welcoming. It was walking distance to all the 5th Street action which is hard to find in the ECU area. The room was comfortable and I would definitely stay again. John was a great host.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Immaculate. I came to see ECU and it was an easy walk. Bed was so comfortable. Furniture and accessories were beautiful and there were many touches of luxury such as heated toilet seat and floors just to name one.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about my two day retreat at the Music Box was perfect. It literally is like stepping back in time, and each time I entered the foyer or walked into my room, it was like a welcome home hug. I was continually finding new delights to enjoy. It truly is amazing how many upgrades and thoughtful conveniences John has provided for his guests. For example, a small table right by the door for your keys and glasses… A coffee table with granite top, so I was not worried about putting a hot mug or dripping water on it… a little teapot so I could sit in bed with a book and enjoy my own little tea time…. Snacks and fresh fruit at any time of day… Plenty of towel rack space…. Hangers in the armoire… good lighting… instructions on how to properly close the curtains so the room was blacked out… not to mention the quality of the curtains (gorgeous and heavy)… multiple pillow choices to choose from (hard/soft)… heated tile floor and toilet seat in the bathroom! John’s responsiveness: 10 stars!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I think this was our 4th stay with John and it was just as advertised. John is great with communication and the place is charming and most important for us is within walking distance of downtown Greenville where our son is a student.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have asked for a better experience. John communicated immediately, and met me for a quick and easy check-in. The house was spotless, and my room was a precious clean and comfortable space to relax after a long day. I’ve never stayed anywhere like this before. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in away from home, and the bathroom was nothing I had ever experienced. What a treat! Highly recommended and I cannot wait to stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure staying at John’s.

We ❤️ this place so much!"

So many little touches around the house, with beautiful instruments everywhere. Bathroom with heated floor and toilet seat, plus a beautiful shower! Will definitely be back next time we are coming through the area. Thank you for a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's like stepping back in time! Charming home with thoughtful touches and very comfortable! The host, John, is attentive and quick to respond. After finding out I'm a coffee lover he made it a point to have my favorite, dark roast, and a small coffee pot in my room. I had forgotten about the heated bathroom floors and toilet seat, and it was surprising how these amenities made my stay just that much better. The Music House is an amazing Victorian style home that is rich in local history with original woodwork, period pieces, and musical instruments everywhere you look. But, it can also be a little chilly! Room and bed very cozy - and not being cold when you step out of the shower in December? Priceless!! This will be my choice anytime I'm in Greenville. If you want to unplug and relax this is the place to stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredibly unique AirBnB rental. John is responsive, friendly, and helpful."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a must place to stay .
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Come, if for nothing else, to see the staircases!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything positive written about John’s BnB is true. When you walk in the entryway you’re immediately taken back to the Victorian era. My experience during my stay can never be duplicated anywhere else and I’m so happy that I chose his location.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay. I wouldn’t change a thing except to try to stay longer next time. John is a perfect host and the house is an absolutely beautiful place to stay in the heart of town. Thank you for all the thoughtful details and warm welcome!

It is so lovely and peaceful; we will definitely plan to stay here when we visit Greenville again.

We will be staying again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I want to keep this unique gem hidden and available for my own stays in Greenville, but would feel guilty not to share. Anyone who pays a higher nightly cost to stay in an anonymous hotel as opposed to staying in this luxurious, beautiful, peaceful, unique, and relaxing historical home is a fool in my opinion. John’s stately, gorgeous, restored in period perfection, fully functioning, Victorian home is like staying in a late 1800’s interactive museum, but with modern climate control and air quality, and the most pampering coffee, snack, and bathroom Amenities you could want for. I will always check for room at John’s Music House before staying anywhere else. Don’t think twice - book it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re spending time or just passing through Greenville, stay at The Music House!
John is friendly, kind & helpful & the lovingly renovated Victorian home is meticulous. A living museum: beautiful, fun and still extremely comfortable.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"There really aren't words for how magical this place is. If you're a lover of antiques, art, & luxury you've come to the right place. The location is perfect for walking ""uptown"" or to ECU's campus but also convenient to the highway for arrivals and departures. The garden and porch are delightful. The check-in, rainbow bunting, security, and Covid protocols all led me to feeling very safe and welcome. The room was perfectly appointed with all the beautiful things carefully considered plus sheets and a mattress that felt like a dream. The bathroom was one of my favorite aspects of the stay with a seat warmer, bidet, gorgeous chrome vintage style fittings and under-floor heating. When I told John I just needed strong coffee for breakfast, he went out and bought some Peets especially for me. Having grown up in Greenville and seen this particular area change over the years, I believe the city owes John a debt of gratitude for the way he has cared for this architectural masterpiece. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to absolutely anyone - I've traveled the world and this is top 5 places I've ever stayed - simply perfect."

They also offer a small breakfast in the morning which is laid out on the counter or in their fridge on their ""Airbnb"" rack! We loved that there were homemade muffins out on the counter and they were a great snack on the way home.

Being seniors with walking issues, it was comforting to see the ramp to the front door. It even made rolling luggage easier. The townhome was exceptional; well equipped with anything you might need. It was very fresh and clean. We have stayed in five-star hotels which were not this nice. We highly recommend booking this extraordinary townhome. And a big plus was that it is pet friendly. If we ever want a weekend escape from our home, we will definitely book this again. If we could give Emily more than five stars, we would."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would move in tomorrow if I could. Absolutely gorgeous home and property, impeccably decorated and landscaped, every detail taken care of.
Absolutely magical. Can't wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house and property were more than we could imagine. Everything about this place makes you feel like home and with the people you love, makes it even better. Applause to the guys!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb is amazing. I cannot say enough good things about it. It's hard to express how beautiful it is in just pictures. This is the cleanest and most welcoming Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Watching the horses and cats, as well as exploring outside, was a big hit with our kids. There was everything we needed and more provided for us. We felt as though we were at home. We were blown away by the decor, which was so unique and incredible. Our only regret was not staying longer. Your beautiful home was a wonderful place to stay. Thanks a million times, Paul and Mark."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Truly the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in..like something out of a magazine!! The house is beautifully appointed and every attention to detail included..
The hosts were extremely helpful, flexible and quick to respond to any questions/concerns that we had.
We enjoyed relaxing in this gorgeous setting as much as anything else we did in Greenville..I didn’t want to leave!!
In fact, shortly after our arrival the first day I hopped on Airbnb and booked a future visit!:)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything in the house was beautiful and the amenities were well thought out. We would def stay here again!
This house is farm goals!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family and I had a great time staying at this beautiful home and property. The place is clean and well designed/decorated. We enjoyed sitting on the multiple porches and watching the sun go down. Mark and Paul had everything we possibly could have needed. I am inspired to make some upgrades to our own home after staying here.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely perfect, would do again in a heartbeat. Definitely a five star stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was beautiful! My 4 yo, 2 yo, 4 month old and husband stayed there over thanksgiving while we were visiting family in Grifton. My kids loved the chickens, horses and the friendly cats! We will be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The gorgeously appointed farmhouse is truly a home away from home, thoughtfully furnished with every amenity you could possibly need! Our family had the space and comfort to gather, as well as the opportunity to spread out in the multiple gorgeous sitting areas. It's an incredible property that is serene and relaxing. We found ourselves wanting to stay at the farmhouse as much as we wanted to be present at the events that we were in Greenville to attend! The owners were available and attentive throughout our stay. We can't wait to visit this charming home again!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Truly five star in every way. This home is elegant and homey at the same time. It's filled with amazing spots to relax: A front porch with commodious swing, as side deck and grill, a sunroom (my favorite room) and a screen porch, each decorated in farmhouse chic. The gathering spot was the huge farmhouse table. Great hosts, wonderful linens and towels, a kitchen with every amenity. This was a wonderful choice for a relaxing family weekend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so wonderfully located and relaxing, that I almost don't want to tell anyone else about it for fear of it getting too booked up! The hosts were very responsive and accommodating throughout our stay. The house is extremely organized and clean. From pulling up to the gate and seeing the 2 horses, to the minute you drive down the gravel driveway, you will be transformed into what seems like the set of a romantic and whimsical movie set. We had a few friends over for a small bbq during Family Weekend at ECU and I won't be surprised if everyone took some design tips from their beautifully decorated house. I felt blessed to sit on the front porch swing and sip my coffee each morning watching the chickens, ducks and adorable farm cats (Finn & Tink). I didn't want to leave the tranquility and I'll definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wow - easily the nicest and most unique AirBnB we have ever stayed in. The house is pure charm. We were truly lucky to stay here. Mark and Paul are fantastic hosts!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! The is one of the best Airbnb place that we have ever stayed in. Our host were gracious and very nice. The house was very clean. I will stay here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible experience— the best Airbnb place we’ve ever stayed! We loved every moment in the farmhouse. Our hosts were gracious and available for any question. The house was spacious and the rooms beautifully arranged and decorated--someone has a serious eye for detail! It is quiet and peaceful but a quick drive in to town to 'do things'. If you are an early riser you can catch a family of deer on the lawn or a great blue heron on the pond. The cats (Tink and Finn, we're sending you virtual scritches) went a long way towards helping our kids with missing our own kitties."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing property! From the moment you drive through the gates you will be impressed. The property is completely private and tucked back away from the highway. The interior of the home was tastefully decorated and well appointed. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the wrap-around porch in the afternoons and admiring the gorgeous landscaping and beautiful scenery. Everything about this home and property was beyond our expectations. We traveled from CA and found the property to be centrally located to Raleigh-Durham and the coast. We will be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This lovely home was such a treat to come back to each day while we were in Greenville moving our daughter. The master bed is super comfy and the master bath is a wonderful retreat. We mostly enjoyed the many porches and the gorgeous landscaping and view of the property. We will stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! Truly, I felt like I had stepped into a magazine. The home is beautifully decorated yet so welcoming at the same time. We stayed here with our children, who loved the farm cat, horses and chickens. What a special place! Would definitely stay again. Thanks so much for sharing your home!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! It’s beautiful, incredibly clean, the hosts are responsive, and it feels secluded but you are minutes from all the fun Greenville has to offer! All of the little touches in the house and yard are so well thought out. It is obvious that you are staying in a well loved home. This is hands down the best AirBNB I have ever stayed in!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This house is above and beyond beautiful! The thoughtfulness that was put into every room and the details go on and on. It is truly an experience to stay in this wonderful farm house.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful hosts; awesome property. Better than described; words and pictures just can’t do this place justice.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Paul are amazing host. They ensured we were able to get in okay and made the check in process very smooth. Anytime we had a question they were quick to respond. The home is beautiful and so welcoming! They have everything you could need and more. Great small touches everywhere. Plenty of place to spread out and enjoy time together. The place is just a couple miles away from town but feels like you are getting away from the hustle and bustle. We thoroughly enjoyed the all the farm animals and hope to visit again. Thank you for sharing your home!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was gorgeous and clean. Beds were super comfortable and the toiletries were top notch. My toddler loved the orange cat and all the friendly farm animals. Great location- you feel like you’re in the country, but doesn’t take long to get anywhere in Greenville/Winterville: Would definitely stay here again and 100% recommend to others."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have always had luck staying at one of Becky’s properties. If I’m ever looking for places in the area to stay, seeing one of her locations is available is a determining factor. I know they will be clean and as described. This was a quiet area with a really nice back patio for morning coffee."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The essentials were fine...cleanliness, comfortable beds and location. These are by far the most important things, but I feel I should provide some other insight. It is hard to imagine that a real architect designed the townhouse. After taking in a tight downstairs layout we headed up steep steps and were surprised to find two very spacious bedrooms. BUT the master bathroom was absurd. It too had a spacious footprint but the toilet ""closet"" was so crammed that no one could possibly sit on the toilet with the door closed. This left you exposed to the entire bedroom because there was no door to the bathroom area. And the shower stall was literally phone booth size. That being said, one could just go use the very normal private bath off the guest room...if you do not have guests. Also, we never figured out how to effect any change in the household temperature as it had some sort of lock on it. The info book on coffee table gave directions but I guess we just did not understand."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a awesome
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location in a quiet neighborhood. Great host!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I came to Greenville to take a medical board exam. Picked this spot for convenience to testing center and space to get comfortable and study for a few days before. It was the perfect spot for me! Could not have been better. Large bedrooms, lots of open space. Very central to the medical centers. Tucked away and peaceful, quiet. Definitely would stay here again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice accommodations. Would have liked a vacuum cleaner.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here while visiting my family. The place is close to main roads, but not on a main road. The real plus was the back of the house faces on to a forest and has a little patio, surrounded by a fence, where I sat in the mornings and had my breakfast. The Master bedroom also has a roomy bathroom. It also faces the back, so it was quiet. The other room, with its own bathroom, was not used much but was a real plus for a short visit from my son. This room faces the parking area. I can only recommend this place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was very clean, quiet, and conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and other stores. The townhouse has two large bedrooms with large bathrooms. The WIFI worked just fine for working from the house. I would definitely stay in this home again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"i’ve visited north carolina and some of the airbnbs over there and this one was really cozy! Just felt at home. Everything was really comfortable and super clean! Although the shower/toilet in the king room is so small, we ended up using the other bathroom upstairs in the guest bedroom which was roomier and cozy! I would definitely stay again !"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky's place has plenty of room, and the ceiling fans in each bedroom were a great addition. I didn't use it, but there's a nice patio off the kitchen/dining area that would be great for an outdoor gathering."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a second time I've stayed at Becky's place. It's a great place to stay. Next time I'm in town I will look to book her place.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay. I loved the jacuzzi tub. We had some light bulbs out in the bathroom and a couple slats missing from the curtains in the living room. I let them know and they were responded immediately and fixed the problem. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky was great to deal with. The apartment was cozy and warm, and had all the amenities needed for the weekend excursion. The king bed in the master was very comfortable. I would rent this apartment again without hesitation."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay at one of Becky’s townhouse’s this time. Great beds and all the conveniences of home! We’ll be back!🌺🌼
2021-10-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Super convenient for traveling to and from the hospital. The townhouse was a bit less clean than the pictures suggest (i.e. rusty pipes at toilets, broken blinds in kitchen slide door). The layout of the master bathroom is so odd. There’s no separate door to the bathroom from the bedroom and the water closet only has room for the toilet/not your legs. It was uncomfortable but it was great having the other bathrooms as options. The water temperature wasn’t always consistent but it worked. This location was great for my husband’s work month. DoorDash was his friend and offered plenty of great options in the area. He LOVED the comfy master bed which was a great place for him to rest before heading to work again. Becky was easy to talk with and helped guide us to finding some things during this trip. Thank you for this bnb Becky."

My only very very minor suggestion would be that there be a few more bathroom towels.
Will definitely recommend to others!"
