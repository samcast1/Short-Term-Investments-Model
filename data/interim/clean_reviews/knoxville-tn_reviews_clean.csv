2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen’s place was amazing. The interior was so well decorated and welcoming. He provided all the extras you could need from kitchen tools, to shower essentials, even contact solution which I desperately needed.
The outside was warm and welcoming, with cornhole and a fire pit with an incredible view.
We’ve stayed in dozens of bnbs and this was one of our best experiences yet. We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen’s historic home exudes timeless elegance and charm, with a charming porch that offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Knoxville! It’s the perfect retreat for a weekend getaway filled with historic ambiance and natural beauty. When in Knoxville, we will definitely stay at Stephen’s home again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My dogs and I loved our stay at the cottage home. It was very peaceful, clean, decorated nicely, dog friendly, had the amenities as described, and you would never know it's a very short drive to everything in the area. I definitely recommend the home and would definitely stay again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tiny little 1 bedroom home with all the necessities and a giant yard for our dogs to play. Squeeky clean, cumfy beds, nice neighborhood. Fit our needs perfectly!!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fine place to stop overnight on our cross country road trip. It was decorated nicely and the bed was comfortable. However, the air conditioner smelled musty and has been installed in a plywood square in the window with gaps, which made it a bit challenging for allergies during pollen season. There is not a ton of privacy when showering at night (the window is sort of see-through with no blind). There is no shower fan in the bathroom. Overall it was great for our purposes of a one night, in and out stay. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a nice stay here. It was close to downtown Knoxville but far away enough that we could enjoy the scenery. It was also close to come very good hikes and a state forest to hike in. We definitely recommend this place if you’re staying in Knoxville.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good location and off the street so we felt safe especially with our cars filled to the brim as we are moving across the country.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, quiet getaway with plenty to do around the area. Because we were there for a National Specialty, we weren't there most of the day, so it suited our needs as a quiet place to rest between all of the activities. Our dogs appreciated the quiet too, and large yard to exercise. Perfect little airbnb. Thank you for having us!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet beautiful place with a lot of local things to do and very peaceful
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was cozy and comfortable. The memory foam mattress was amazing! The entire house was clean. The bath towels and washcloths were very soft as well. I did have to purchase a skillet and a few storage containers because I like to cook. There wasn’t a wide variety of cookware. Plenty of silverware, bowls, plates and cups, other than that, I would stay there again. It felt like home away from home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay while we were in town for Big Ears! The host was very responsive and accommodating.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great host nice spot

Everything was clean and well decorated. It had everything we needed. It was very peaceful yet close to anything we wanted to do.
Nathan was very pleasant and accommodating. We are grateful to have had this experience.
Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay here. Was perfect for our weekend stay. Even spent a day in Gatlinburg. Host was very helpful and welcoming. The place is very peaceful and quiet, had everything you need for a weekend stay or a long stay. Would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Another great stay! Nathan is an awesome host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan was a very responsive and helpful host. The house is perfect for a couple to get away to the smokies! Very clean and had all the odds and ends you could think of (pots ,pans condiments, seasoning) all I would say is it is more of like a 40 minute drive to peigon forge( the tourist area). But it’s great to be away from all the tourist and congested areas. All and all amazing experience and would recommend"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect house for what I needed, and described exactly how it was. I was traveling across the country and needed a place for me, my husband and our 2 little dogs. This was just what I wanted with a big back private yard and a very comfy bed and clean house. Check in was super easy, and communication very clear. If I ever need to travel by car through Knoxville again, I’ll definitely keep this beautiful house in mind.
Thanks for a comfortable stay!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan’s place was a great get away while we were there for the poultry show! It was perfect for us to stay for two nights, the place was easy to find (kind of hard at night but not too bad). We enjoy the homeyness they have there! Thank you for such a great place"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host was very friendly and responsive, and allowed us to check in with very little notice the night of our stay. Coffee maker fully stocked, adorable scrap book, functioning heater and cozy decor made this place feel very homey. My k9 loved the backyard to run in and stretch his legs after being in the car for so long. My only complaint is the cleaning fee was pretty steep, but that is to be expected with a pet friendly stay. The hosts were very responsive and helpful! Would stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect spot for us and our dogs to stay while visiting family over the Thanksgiving holiday. The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. Our dogs loved the yard space, and it was close enough to the highway to make our daily trips to Maryville convenient. The hosts were very welcoming, responsive, and kind. I would love to stay again if we're in the area."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodations for one or two people. Clean and well decorated and excellent wi-fi service. The location is only a mile from major groceries, chain stores and restaurants and about 10 minutes from Downtown Knoxville. Nathan was an excellent host - clear communications and directions."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was fine.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan's place was exactly what we needed as a soft spot to land after each day exploring the area. It was clean, on par with our expectations, and the perfect size for the two of us and two dogs. We loved the spacious back yard and their dog, Willow, was a sweetheart."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient, pleasant accomodations, and Nathan was a super-responsive host even though I just had minor questions."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd or 4th time staying in Nathan's place. It is always clean, reasonably priced and the dogs are always welcome. We have met both Nathan and Hannah and they are both wonderful, kind people--as well as gracious hosts."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Booked because it was dog friendly and central location. This host communicates quickly and we had zero issues. I would book again

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and it was just as wonderful as the first! If you are looking for a quiet, clean, home away from home, then this is your place! It is close to major highways and things to do, but also far enough away from everything in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This is our go-to place to stay when we are in the Knoxville area and won't stay anywhere else!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for what we needed. Thankfully, didn’t need to bother Nathan but nothing bad to say about the place. Located near a lot to do or within a reasonable drive. So much good food too, can’t go wrong with almost any place you choose. Nathan had great recommendations on where to go and really made it seem like he wanted to make sure our stay was as good as it could be! Highly recommend for anyone looking for an easy and comfortable stay!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, residential neighborhood with big yard for walking my dogs. A little difficult to find after sunset, but keeping GPS on and the fact that there were trash cans by the road made it easier.
It had everything I needed. Close to downtown and an easy trip to TN Smokies stadium or Buc-ee’s gas station."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great stay for my husband and I and 2 littles! It had almost everything we needed (coffee was limited) but we went out a lot.
The location was perfect for us and conveniently located around a lot of stores and close to Knoxville. very quiet and felt like you were in the country!
We would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! It's a great loaction, no more than 10-20 min drive depending on where you're going around Knoxville. Also have plenty of restaurants, grocery, and gas options a few min away. The place was comfortable and kept cool. We chose this house for being pet friendly and it definitely was. Great yard space for our pups to run around and plenty of indoor space for their crates."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute house super quite
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny “cottage” or “tiny house” feel was just what I needed after driving 10 hours. The property was very relaxing and safe for a single woman. Just off a main road and close to gas, food store etc."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Decent little place, but not ideal if you plan on doing lots of cooking"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,amazing little house that was perfect for Two people to stay and enjoy the calm while also being close to everything to do in knoxville!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute place, and super close to pretty much everything in Knoxville!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan’s place had everything we needed. This little house is perfect for a couple or a small family, but I wouldn’t recommend for couples as the only bathroom is in the bedroom and the door to come and go is also in the bedroom. There are DVDs but no dvd player, but they do have a smart tv for streaming."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot with easy access to all things Knoxville. For a small house it felt rather spacious. Kitchen was well stocked with pots/pans and utensils.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan’s place was great! Very clean, private and close to everything we needed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were in town for the high school crew Nationals and this was a great location for us. It was also super convenient to bring our dogs so we didn’t have to figure out last minute where they’d go. Highly recommend for this area!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This home was very comfortable and had everything you needed. Location is beautiful and close to everything. If in the area I will stay here again.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice private parking and set back off the main road. The space was described well with plenty of space.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very roomy space for two, we felt right at home! We loved the privacy of the separate little house and parking. We also really enjoyed the peace and quiet of the location while still only a short drive away from downtown. It was the perfect little getaway for my husband and I and our pup. We would definitely stay here again :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Look forward to next time!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"i thought it was amazing, very clean and tidy. I'll request a stay later"
2023-04-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,First of when we arrive the place it was nice inside and outside. The toilet broke after I used it. I try to use the plugger but didn’t work so I call him to come to fix it. He tried and tried until got it fixed. I wouldn’t recommend use the toilet at all so we go to restaurants to use the restroom. The bed was too super soft. We couldn’t sleep at all. The couch has pull out bed is bad when you are seating down and the cushions is super soft too. Seating down to the metal frames making us uncomfortable. The internet is weak or bad connection. The lighting inside the house is bad. Hard to see around the house at night. I’m glad they have table trays so we can use them for our meals to eat.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect stop during our cross country drive north! The bed was super comfy and the layout of the space was very well done! Would stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was perfect for the two of us for the week! The home was very clean and it was very peaceful!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I had a fantastic stay! Everything is as described, great accommodations, private, and peaceful. Will book again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a very cute little place. It was the perfect size for my family. The back yard really sealed the deal for our happiness. Our pup LOVED all her room to run. The neighbors have barking dogs but after a minute of being outside they settle down. The bed was amazing, I would definitely come back and stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay not too far from downtown Knoxville! Cute, clean 1-bedroom apartment with everything you could need :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place for a quick weekend getaway with our furbaby!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The proximity to my friends was great. And so many restaurants and shopping close by. Hope this place is available the next time I'm in Knoxville.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's property was a great stay for the weekend, especially for the good price. He was a great host by being helpful and responsive."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean and brand new. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The kitchen had all the supplies to make our coffee and breakfast in the morning. There was a quiet little backyard area. Easy to find and very close to grocery stores, gas and the interstate. The drive to the smokies/pigeon forge/Gaitlinberg was close, less than 50 mins and downtown Knoxville was about 10-15. The house is in a quiet, residential area. We felt very safe and right at home. We had a great stay, thank you!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! The home was conveniently located, comfortable, and the host was very responsive whenever issue arose. Would stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was as described! Very clean and had everything we needed and more for an overnight stop with our 2 dogs. Very comfortable bed! We would stay here again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Nathan’s very much. After reading all of the reviews before we booked, we were convinced. He was very responsive and helpful. Even, told us about the barking dogs next door; which didn’t bother us at all. Nathan’s home was clean and clutter-free! It was private and quiet yet very close to restaurants and stores.
Only thing we would recommend is to let the renter know about the heaters in the walls when it’s a little cold. They are built into the walls and white, so aren’t obvious. We kept thinking the ac unit would put out the heat, too. Ha ha!
We highly recommend this quaint little Airbnb! This was our first time staying in an Airbnb and Nathan made it wonderful! Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little place for a couple! Although the road is closer to the house it’s quite and you don’t hear road noise.
Nathan is very friendly and although we didn’t need anything from them, we felt like if we needed anything they would have gone above and beyond to help!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cottage and friendly owners
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a lovely little place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great quaint place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for a getaway. Close to a lot of things without the feel of all the hustle and bustle. He made check-ins
so easy and flexible. Great for your doggies. Only downside was the yard didn't have a gate so it wasn't completely closed in to let the dogs run free. But absolutely loved our stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place to stay to spend time with family to celebrate the arrival of our third great granddaughter. We are new “parents” of our 1 year old golden retriever Tucker. And only the 2nd time we’ve traveled with him. He was perfect. He loved the back yard.
I’m sure we will be back."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a good location for exploring the Knoxville.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay and the fenced yard was great for the dogs!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time! The house was in a quiet neighborhood but only 15 minutes from downtown Knoxville. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location, perfect size, perfect check-in, perfect communication, perfect everything! I will be back and certainly hope this is available. There are not enough great words to say. Thank you for a relaxing long weekend. Oh, did I mention perfect?!?"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan’s place was great! Very comfortable, cozy, and had everything we needed. The perfect spot to rest for the night."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to stop for a quick overnight stay during our holiday travel. It was comfortable, clean, and easy to get in and out of. The host also approved our same day reservation and had the space ready for us within just a few hours. We would definitely stay here again!
If you’re traveling with dogs - one thing I would mention is that the neighbors on both sides of the property have several (seemingly friendly) dogs. There is a chain link fence and quite a bit of space separating each neighbor from the rental, but they are very vocal when seeing you and your dogs. One of our dogs has anxiety so that was a little difficult for her. If your pets are reactive or nervous, I’d recommend planning for whatever comforts they need getting in and out of the rental/going potty/etc. That’s no fault of the hosts and not something that was bothersome to us during our stay, but we would have planned a little better if we knew to expect such a warm neighborly greeting :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Overall great stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very short stay but found the entire place to be very clean and comfortable. Got a good night sleep in the comfy bed! We had all the amenities we needed for our quick overnighter. Appreciated the coffee that was provided! The rental is relatively close to the hosts home, but we still felt private."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's place was just like a little home away from home. It was super clean, and had everything we could have needed and more! It was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to have a quiet getaway for a few days. We would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Knoxville area!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean; comfortable; convenient location; quiet (except for the neighbor's obnoxious dogs that barked every time I went out with my dogs). Large yard was great for the dogs; it was fenced (except fo the driveway) so I could let me dogs wander. Nathan was very responsive. I would stay here again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely spotless. Perfect for our overnight stay. Couch and bed extremely comfortable.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We spent a few nights here during our trip to Knoxville. The place was clean and such a good value. Not extremely far from everything and the neighborhood was peaceful. We will definitely consider Nathan’s place when we return!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect spot for a stop over during our journey. The accommodations were excellent - away from the hustle and bustle of Knoxville, but close if you wanted to explore the city. Also a short trip from their to Pigeon Forge. A great place for our pups to get out and stretch their legs. Bed was extremely comfortable and a very good value for the money. We would definitely stop there again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay you are only 40 minutes from pigeon forge/Gatlinburg. There is plenty to do nearby. It is a nice place and worth the stay. Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quick overnight on a cross country stay. Easy check in and comfortable lodgings.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan’s place was great! It was only 10 minutes to downtown Knoxville which was very convenient if that’s what you’re in town for! Keep in mind it is a bit of a drive to Pigeon Forge at times only 40 minutes but with traffics could be longer. Nevertheless, the unit was extremely clean and well equipped with everything you could need! Being able to bring our pups is always a plus! Thanks Nathan!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location and a great host!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cutest, quietest little home. Comfortable bed and pet friendly!! Close enough to our daughter/granddaughter without being in a hotel. Will definitely use again when visiting."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were passing through the area for the night and Nathan so graciously allowed us to book late in the day for just an overnight stay.

Being from New Jersey, we live in an area where it's rare to find a place for our dog to have the outdoor experience he needs, so it meant a lot to us to watch him enjoy their land and play to his heart's content. the interior of the house is decorated so well and the touches made me feel at home. they provide condiments in the fridge, cookware, hygeine products, etc. my favorite touch is the local guidebook that was provided to us... it made me feel so welcome in knoxville. thank you both for all of your suggestions and for hosting us!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved being away from the city, but not too far away (who knew a 10 mile trip would only take 16 minutes?! Not this Atlantan!). Quiet, unless you hear a chicken cluck (their scurry is cute when the dinner bell gets rung). Relaxing time away."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nathan's place provided everything my family and pets needed for our trip to Knoxville. The house was exactly as described and conveyed in the pictures. While the location itself was on a somewhat busy road, you wouldn't know it with the semi fenced yard behind the house. Willow was the chillest dog ever and feeding the chickens was the best part. We definitely felt welcomed and will definitely be back. I highly recommend Nathan's Airbnb. The location was close to everything Knoxville and not too far from Pigeon's Forge."

The place is very clean and inviting and we’ll absolutely have ourselves another stay in the future.

We couldn’t have asked for a better location or value. Highly recommend!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here! It was very close to things while also feeling like you were kind of out in the country. The purpose of our trip was to tour our wedding venue so we much appreciated its proximity to things. Nathan was always quick to respond if we had any questions and was very hospitable. We were very impressed with how clean it was! This was probably the cleanest place I have stayed at. It was neat seeing the chickens out in the mornings and their dog is very sweet.

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This basement apartment is cute and stylish. It felt very spacious for our group of 4. Very easy to get downtown in about 10 minutes. Kroger is about 5 minutes away. The kitchen has the very basics. No salt and pepper. No ground coffee. The thermostat is located in the main portion of the house so there was no control over temperature regulation. My biggest complaint is there was a very strong odor (second hand smoke? Moldy musky basement smell?). Not sure of the source but it was very pungent and several in our group developed coughs. After returning home all of my belongings were saturated in the smell.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exceptional experience.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I ventured to Knoxville for a long weekend. We were kidless and Jennifers space was a great retreat. We specifically wanted to check out the ""Urban Wilderness"" mountain bike trails. Jennifer's house was two minutes away, on bike. to the Baker Creek Bike Preserve. The location was incredible if you want to explore the ""Urban Wilderness"" without getting in the car. Baker Creek Bike Preserve is only going to get better, with new restaurants, brewery, bike shop, etc. It was also easy to drive to downtown Knoxville for dining and entertainment. Jennifer's home was very clean, she was very responsive, and there were great amenities like laundry etc. The location was quiet, quaint, and peaceful. Great get away spot with a great overall value. I would recommend this place due to the hospitality and responsiveness of Jennifer."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very lovely, located very central to most things to do in the area yet it still had the feeling of being kind of rural, and made it easy to immediately feel like being home. The location of the apartment was great for taking a four-day course at the medical center of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville as it only took 10 minutes to get there via car."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So helpful! The coolant light came on in our rental car (Avis) and it was so nice to get some coolant and water on the spot before we took off for the day! Very quiet and easy place to stay.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a quick stay for some mountain biking in the area- location was perfect, a short ride to Knoxville Urban Wilderness. It would have been nice to have more sidewalks, or have local shops/restaurants within walking distance but this is more so reflective of the neighborhood. The AirBnb had a big back yard with plenty of sunshine and lovely bird sounds to wake up to. Airbnb was fully equipped and we were able to cook for ourselves the duration of our stay. There’s even a patio and grill!"

Private and comfortable, loved the bar and being able to have a washer and dryer. Kroger is a mile away and so is a fabulous ice cream spot. Hike and explore Fort Dickerson it's 2 minutes away. Great spot to stay during Marathon Weekend we loved it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Can't speak highly enough of this place. My parents visited from the UK and the airbnb was exactly what they needed. Spacious, great kitchen, comfortable bed, tv, and the bar was fantastic! Sometimes it got a little cold in there but there were plenty of blankets, and jennifer's partner even met my parents and said if it was ever an issue to just knock on the door upstairs and let them know. The hosts were very attentive yet respectful of my mum and das space, and nothing seemed to be too much bother (they especially loved the fireplace and seating outside!).
Very grateful for this place and would happily recommend to anyone looking for a spot in south Knox."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Air BnB was perfect for our trip. Spacious, nicely decorated, comfy, clean, and in a central location. Any major store or area was within a 15 to 20 minute drive. Communication with Jennifer was smooth, we received quick responses with any questions we had and it felt as if we were home!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer's place was clean and spot on from the description. It was so close to everything downtown. Yet far enough to be quiet and relaxing. I loved reading the visitor journal! I look forward to staying with them again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This basement apartment was perfect for our quick weekend stay—super convenient to downtown Knoxville but in a nice quiet area with surrounding streets great for walking and running. Clean and comfortable.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great two night stay in October 2022 while visiting South Knox on a long road trip. The unit is SUPER spacious and equipped for a longer stay with a full kitchen, full sized fridge and laundry. I appreciated these amenties as I had been camping prior to my stay and need to wash clothes and charge up my ice packs in the freezer.
I say this because often guest suites on AIRBNB can often be more like a motel room with only a tiny fridge, no kitchen and no laundry. This is not the case with this unit. It's like an apartment. You also have access to a nice patio area near the private entrance. The unit was super clean and the bed was super comfortable.
At this location, you are close to all of the attractions in South Knoxville and a just a few minutes from downtown by car. Jennifer was a great communicator and accomodated me on short notice. Would stay here again for sure if visiting Knoxville."

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This basement apartment is generously spacious and comfortable. House sits on a large well-groomed lot in a quiet neighborhood. When you enter the key code, make sure to press the large button at the top. Kitchen is full-sized and you can certainly cook. But for your salmon steaks, bring a bit of salt and pepper. And olive oil perhaps.
Location is excellent for downtown which is just 10 minutes away."

We loved being so close to the city, but far enough away to not feel like we were in the city. The place was very clean and having the washer/dryer and full kitchen was super convenient with a baby for bottle making and cleaning (especially the dishwasher!). The bedroom had plenty of room for our sons travel crib and our luggage. It was very quiet and the home was beautiful, all of the decor made it feel very cozy. Great place to wind down at the end of the day! Only con was a queen bed instead of a king but that's just our preference. Would definitely stay again!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I gave Jennifer's place 5 stars all the way down. She has a very clean space with a private entrance. A grill outside the door with a table. I loved the bedroom, with no windows in it, you close the door and its pitch dark for a goodnights rest. She has a very roomy full kitchen with the best gas range I've ever cooked on.
Her place is nestled in a perfect location to explore the outdoors. Very close to hiking places, like Fort Dickerson. There were lots of Mtn bike trails just a half mile over the hill. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space! Bedroom, living space, kitchen, and bar space give plenty of room to feel at home in a multiple day stay. One thing I will say is that my husband and I weren’t thrilled about the smell. There seemed to be a distinct smoke smell and it did Saturate all of our clothes, bags, etc. It wasn’t unbearable, but certainly not what we expected. Other than that, we truly did appreciate the space and it was as advertised, clean, large, and full of the right amenities! The hosts are also great; very responsive and understanding."

Sarah was incredibly sweet and responsive, making our stay even more enjoyable. We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Knoxville!"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was a super friendly host and always easily accessible. Check in was easy and superbly described. Parking is possible without problems right in front of the house. The apartment is within walking distance of Downtown by German standards. The apartment corresponds exactly to the pictures.
With us, the problem was that it smelled like sewage - of course this may have been a temporary problem, but definitely unlucky for us. And it is very clairaudient- we noticed steps and chattering, unfortunately in the evening/night so we slept poorly. Therefore only 3 out of 5 stars."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly as shown in the pictures! Very individual and lovingly furnished! Sarah helped us out with helpful restaurant tips! Everything was clean and cozy! Parking is easy to get away from it all. Downtown Knoxville, with all its great bars and restaurants, is very easy to walk to!
Great recommendation for this home!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place was the perfect spot to stay in Knoxville - super close to downtown. The apartment is decorated very nicely and has everything you could need. My only tip would be that when you park on the street, you may have to hop the curb a little because the street is narrow for parking on both sides."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most wonderful stay. The location was PERFECT, and the cleanliness surpassed our expectations - it was truly impeccable. The cozy atmosphere made it feel like a home away from home, and we can’t wait to come back. Thank you, Sarah, for such a fantastic experience!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s place was as described in the listing. Close to lots of restaurants /breweries. Walkable to downtown over the bridge. Wish we would have brought our bikes. There is a small fridge to put several drinks/food items and the spot was good for a weekend trip.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute and comfortable interior. There's construction in the area, though not on the street itself. It would have been helpful to have directions, even a map, showing how to avoid it when walking into town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah's place is so vibey~ we loved the artistic choices and the cozy layout! The whole place was super clean and well maintained.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We didn't need to reach out to Sarah for anything specific during our stay, but felt that if we needed anything she would respond quickly. This was the CLEANEST place I've ever stayed at. You can tell Sarah takes care of the space. It was super quiet too!! So close to downtown, yet nestled away to feel away from the hustle and bustle too. The only downside was how small the sink was in the bathroom, it didn't really bother me, as I knew it would be small, but for someone that needs the space to get ready, it may be a little tricky! It was perfect for a quick get-away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful, spacious, 1-bedroom apartment. I used it a home base for a week in Knoxville and was completely pleased to be in such a cozy place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the old house charm. Older neighborhood, but quiet. Nearby area is being resurrected with the current industrial look with new restaurants & bars popping up. Everything was as pictured/stated on the app. Great place for a couple."

It’s also easy to walk across the Gay Street bridge into downtown Knoxville. Sarah is a very friendly and responsive host, who seems to really enjoy having people stay at her place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect spot for my quick business trip to Knoxville. Sarah's place is convenient to downtown and UT but in a quiet neighborhood.

I will stay here again the next time I'm in town!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a couple visiting Knoxville. Downtown is a short car ride away with tons to do and see. We really enjoyed the Honeybee coffee shop, which is walking distance from the apartment. The unit was clean and as advertised on the listing. Sarah was very responsive and accommodating during our stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for a one night stay in Knoxville! The apartment was clean and exactly as described. Sarah was a great communicator as well. If we’re back in the area we will stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place as described! Close to some great spots! Definitely a great place to stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great short stay at Sarah’s studio. It was comfortable and very clean and exactly as shown in the pictures. We walked to HiWire brewing and honeybee coffee; downtown and old city are walkable or a short Uber ride.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Sarah’s place! We were only in Knoxville for one night but it was really convenient and close to get to downtown. The place is beautifully decorated and has everything you need. Sarah was helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was kind enough to accommodate a late check in and check out when I came through town. She also gave several local recommendations and was pleasant to talk to! The place was very cute and had everything I needed. There wasn’t much silverware or kitchen utensils, but as a solo traveler I had plenty for one person. FYI the bathroom is fairly small but I was only there for one night so I didn’t mind. I would book here again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Loved the homey feel! Love loveed the tape player along with some great music to listen to.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet house, right across the river from downtown. Quick access to anything around, great coffee shop right down the street."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and well appointed. Also well priced. Very convenient to downtown and UT. Enjoyed a beautiful walk across the bridge to Market Square!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just stayed for a quick night and it was clean, cute and comfortable with everything I needed. Also was great that I could walk to the downtown area in about 12 minutes!"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"A kitchen was essential due to multiple food allergies making eating out too stressful to consider.
Sarah was excellent with communication and gracious in answering questions, never pointing out that the information was already on her listing. She really was very patient and considerate.
There were certain things that we found surprising with our stay. This is a converted space with NO door for separation between bed and living area causing cooking smells to linger.
The mantel portion which faces the bed area leans significantly forward unevenly away from the rest of the brick and could potentially be a problem. If repaired properly this adds a lot of charm to the space.
This is a very clean and quaint space even if the eclectic style was all over the place. We would've had no qualms in forfeiting our paid fees to stay at a hotel if Sarah hadn't been so wonderful. The neighborhood may be older but it's peaceful without noise pollution from passing traffic."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This funky little spot was just what we needed for our stay in Knoxville. We walked to dinner and a concert downtown. Sarah made everything easy, highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Met all my needs. Sarah was super nice .
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was perfect for two folks traveling! The vibes were calm and eclectic and the distance was perfect from downtown. Would use Sarah’s place again when coming through Knoxville!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was great for my fiancé and I as we were going back and forth to downtown every for the weekend. The place was very cozy and easy to get to and from. Sarah was there finishing up cleaning when we arrived, so check in was easier, but she was very kind and gave some good recommendations!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great location with easy access to downtown. Fast and easy check-in with everything I needed in the apartment. A great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Liked the walkable location!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah was a great host and quick to respond to questions.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Sarah's place during the weekend of Oct. 20, 2023 and Oct. 23, 2023. Since it was just me, the location and space was perfect. I did not have a car, and it's just a short walk (less than a mile) over the Gay St. bridge to downtown. The apartment was clean and had everything that I needed. Since my son is a student at the University of Tennesse, I hope to be in Knoxville a few more times over the next few years and will have no hesitation staying at Sarah's place. I highly recommend it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place was easily accessible quiet, clean, and near downtown. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s apartment is great and we really enjoyed staying there. It is an easy walk across the bridge to the Market Square area allowing us to forget about the car/ public transport, and find plenty of places to eat and be entertained. Spotlessly clean and slept well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks, enjoyed it."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah’s place was close to downtown right near the river! I enjoyed a morning run along the river. Her place is very stylish and we enjoyed her mixed tape collection in the vintage stereo set up! We’ll be back!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed this ground-floor apartment within-a-house. The decor is awesome, everything is clean, and the bed is comfortable.
A fun, bohemian nook in Knoxville."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah's place is extremely well located. The initial impression driving up to the house, as with many strrets around Knoxville, is nothing special. However once inside, it is just a perfectly eclectic, and comfortable space she has created. Spacious, yet cozy. The backyard is actually kind of nice, in an odd setting. Hard to explain what I mean, but I would enjoy it, myself. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Knoxville. Thanks, Sarah!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The photos don't do this place justice. It's amazing! I highly highly recommend. I wish I had stayed longer than 1 night! I definitely hope to stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is so cute!! Sarah had great recommendations for places to eat! Will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sarah was a responsive host and the quaint unit is located on a secluded street that is still walkable to restaurants and bars if desired. Definitely made it easy to explore what Knoxville had to offer!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sara was friendly and gave us great suggestions for dinner! Place was decorated very eclectic which we loved! Bed was comfortable and loved that she had a fan available!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a nice stay. Sarah was available and easy to talk to. The space was peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a wonderful and cozy place to stay! Highly recommend it if you visit Knoxville!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfectly cozy rental unit situated on the south side of the Tennessee River, close enough for a short ride to downtown Knoxville. Was a great spot to spend the night. Sarah made checking in a breeze. Would recommend if you're visiting Knoxville."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The parking was ideal but wasn’t bad either! It’s a beautiful little place to stay and the host is absolutely the sweetest! I’d absolutely love to stay again in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would for sure recommend and return
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a short but wonderful stay at Sarah‘s place!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Convenient location to downtown Knox. As described.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my time in Sarah’s studio. Super close to everything, super cute and cozy, and just what I was looking for. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for one night! Sarah communicated well. It’s definitely “cozy” as described. You can hear the neighbors talking (as another reviewer stated) next-door but we turned on the large fan as recommended and didn’t have a problem after that. We loved how close it was to restaurants, coffee shop and bars."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is CHARMING! The location is great, and the hosts made everything easy! 10/10 recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we had a lovely time, and hope to come back soon! The space is so beautiful and the art work is delightful!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place in Knoxville! Perfect walking distance, and the interior design was so cool. Sarah was so responsive and helpful, and gave plenty of recommendations! Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Sarah’s place because I was coming in town for a concert that was sadly postponed. I’d like to leave a review in regards to Sarah’s top notch professionalism and ability to be flexible with me. It’s not a host’s fault when an event cancels (or postponed, as in my case) and I didn’t expect any special accommodations or refunds because unlike chain hotels, the majority of Air BnB Hosts are just regular people out to make a living. Without me asking, Sarah found the new date of the show and offered to save her place for me since she isn’t booked at that time. I just found that to be such a kind thing to do and I look forward to leaving another review after staying at her place. ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely studio apartment close to downtown, shopping, and restaurants."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and walking distance to downtown! Would stay here again.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was cute & eclectic & in a good location. We biked across the bridge to downtown & it was not a bad ride at all. Sarah is very responsive & helpful - she’s got lots of recommendations if you’re looking for things to do in the area. You can hear the other tenants in the building, but it didn’t bother us. Very cozy little spot perfect for one or two people."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay here for 2 nights. Was our first time in Knoxville and this location was super convenient. Nice large space despite it being a “studio”. Had everything we needed- including fresh ground coffee! Would recommend for a solo traveler or a couple.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, quaint and adorable place. Very clean, felt very cozy. Host was very responsive! Would highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s place looked just like the pictures and I loved all the art/personality this place had. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is now one of my favorite Airbnb stays. I really enjoyed the layout and art decor. I appreciated the vintage elements of the decor as well. The host was thoughtful and responsive considering my ETA was delayed. The walls seemed thin but the surrounding tenants were thoughtful as well.
The location is ideal for exploring the city of Knoxville. I was able to park right out front of the Airbnb. Easy check in and very clear instructions for checkout.
If you’re looking for a unique Airbnb, I would recommend Sarah’s Airbnb.
This was a quick trip to Knoxville for us— only regret is not being able to enjoy the Airbnb longer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was a fantastic host! She was informative and responsive prior to us checking-in, and her place was absolutely spotless on our arrival. The decor matched the pictures exactly - cozy, eclectic and inviting! I’d recommend walking with a buddy if you plan to go out at night. Overall, Sarah’s place was a great, convenient spot, and we felt right at home. She even went the extra mile to drop off fresh, ground coffee for us on our arrival :) thanks again, Sarah!!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place within in walking distance to downtown Gay St. Was there for a cycling event in Knoxville and was perfect for our needs. Once we checked in we never got in the car again till we checked out. Your experience may vary but overall great stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love how the place was decorated!
Perfect place for a romantic couple. Love the old-school dual cassette with a great selection of music!
Very clean place, easy walk to many attractions!
Would definitely come back and stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Posh place. Close to downtown. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I felt super cozy and safe at Sarah's place. I was able to park right out front and the walk around the back to the entrance was easy. Everything felt clean, the wifi was great, and the artsy feel was just like the photos. I SUPER appreciated the loud fan that I turned on for white noise for sleeping. Sarah communicated well and was friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quaint place. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location minutes from downtown, UT campus, and the river. Sarah lives upstairs, so she is available and responsive almost immediately for any issues. The apartment itself is charming and comfortable - had to kill a roach on the first night of my stay which had me worried, but no other bugs popped up, and the place is otherwise super clean."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"On arrival I was unable to see a house number, so I drove past the house twice before finally finding it. The entrance was around back with a flag stone path, that was uneven and then several stairs to go up making it challenging carrying in heavy items after a 10 hour drive. I did not realize when she listed a freezer as one of the amenities it was only the tiny mini fridge/freezer and not a separate freezer. Unfortunately I had three small coolers full of food and ice packs for my road trip out to the southwest. When I contacted Sarah she at first was not very responsive, replied she didn’t have much room in her freezer and didn’t know what else I expected her to do. We finally were able to work it out. The listing calls, the kitchen, new and fully functional however, I found it very limited but fine for someone who is going to eat their meals out or get takeout to bring in.
On the other hand, the decor was charming, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning was excellent ."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a repeat stay at Sarah’s place. It instantly feels like home. It’s very charming and clean and Sarah is a great communicator.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would give the host more than 5 stars if I could! I had a last minute booking, and she worked it all out! She was so kind and helpful!! And the place was perfect... very eclectic!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Only stayed here one night but it was clean and spacious! Close to downtown and there are a few breweries within walking distance.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place with lots of charm.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible place! It is so fun and funky and they have a cassette tape player with a bunch of cassettes, that I loved playing. I would definitely return to this place! Highly, highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,lovely place and wonderful host. would highly recommend! would stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was friendly and responsive to our needs. The property was cozy with comfortable bed. Walkable to brewery, food and waterfront park. Peaceful backyard. We had a perfect stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great. Just as described. Perfect place for attending venues
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this place is located walking distance from downtown Knoxville. Sarah was very helpful with the check in progress. She also provided some great recommendations!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication and a great space. The Tape collection took me way back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah’s place is cute and clean, the bed is very comfortable! The location is good for access to the Ijams nature center and downtown locations. There’s a good coffee shop, Honey Bee, within walking distance. I enjoyed my stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah's space was clean and had everything I needed. It provides 100% the best selection of music on cassettes in all of Airbnb and probably the best artistic decor of any Airbnb I've seen. Sarah is an excellent communicator and host. For context, I was in Knoxville for a UT event. The location is perfect. It's less than 10-minute drive to the Old City, downtown, the UT campus, and Wild Love Bakehouse, all of which I drove to during my stay. It's in a quiet neighborhood away from the various noises and traffics of Knoxville. Book this place, you won't be disappointed!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Sarah’s place. It’s right around the block from some good breweries and restaurants. The space itself is so fun and artsy and feels very homey. The corner sink is small so I had to get a little creative when washing my face but it’s definitely not a big deal personally. Sarah was also very friendly and responsive. She had good recommendations and made us feel very welcomed. We even got lucky enough to meet her in person. We will definitely check Sarah’s place first next time we visit!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was absolutely amazing. She was very helpful with a list of events going on. She also shared restaurants that we should try out.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was cozy and spotless. We had everything we needed and more. This is a perfect spot for couples or singles to get away to if you’re in Knoxville. Super close to all the south Knoxville coffee shops and breweries and you can even walk to downtown. We felt right at home and would stay here again if we have the chance!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy close to everything
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The two of us spent six nights at Mimosa Studio and enjoyed our stay. The description is accurate. It's important to read through the details so expectations are inline. The studio is in an older home. In an older but up and coming neighborhood. The apartment interior is warm and inviting and had everything we needed. Small kitchen, french press coffee, no tv.... You can hear others footsteps coming up the stairs and above from time to time. Sometimes early. Its was no problem for us. It was mostly brief. Others could hear us a bit as well. That said I thought it was cool, comfortable and a great value compared to the other prices I found for our week. We are 5Oyo fyi. We walked and Ubered for transportation and I thought it was great. Comfortable shoes make sense. Biking is good too. I wasn't sure how safe the area was for walking but it was no problem at all. If you like to walk I found it to be an easy walk to Calhouns, Market Square, Old City, the Arena and Stadium."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of those rare Airbnb's that has everything you want and nothing you don't. It's one of the most nicely decorated Airbnb's we've stayed at. We met our host, Sarah, and she was very sweet and accommodating. You can walk to several restaurants, cafes, shops, and parks from here, a rarity in this town. This also seems to be the host's primary residence, so you don't have to feel guilty contributing to the housing shortage in the city staying here (especially in this area, which has seen housing prices go through the roof in the last few years). You're also near plenty of city hiking trails and parks here. We will definitely be returning!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah was very responsive. The studio apartment was spacious and beautifully decorated. The neighborhood is great, with plenty of nearby places to check out. I recommend this highly!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment was so nice and well decorated. There was plenty to do within walking distance and Sarah gave great recommendations!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Sarah's place! It's an artsy, eclectic, spacious, and sparkling clean space. We HIGHLY recommend a stay here! Sarah is a responsive host who gave us greater insight into locations in Knoxville that fit our interests. She's an artist with a business in town who knows that aspect of Knoxville. We only stayed one night, but now that we have a greater appreciation for the city, we'll be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable. No issues
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean, perfect place to stay when visiting UTK. Easy to park and easily accessible to the rest of Knoxville."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, quiet, great location for easy access to downtown Knoxville."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Super cute & cozy home close to most things. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I will 100% stay here again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, super adorable! Be aware there's no TV but if you're in Knox it's probably to enjoy the town. Sarah's helpful and friendly."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location and value was a great choice.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An original space that's appealingly furnished--not the bland, generic Airbnb style, and not the cluttered ""I live here and only left five minutes ago"" setup either. The mid-studio chimney is fabulous for reasons that are hard to explain.
You can walk to a fun pizza place on Sevier. I'd skip Honeybee (that's a lot to pay not to get any cream with your coffee), but there are plenty of other good places around."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah is quick to respond, accommodating, and her place is conventionally located to great restaurants and attractions. I’d gladly stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb posting for Sarah's place made it look very nice, and I was pleasantly surprised it was even better than expected. The neighborhood is up and coming, so has several restaurants within walking distance. While I was able to easily park on the street in front of the Aribnb property, I would recommend walking if going to a restaurant in the immediate area, as parking is non-existent unless you have a permit."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great lil spot for the money. Very close to downtown, good, and drinks.
I loved the eclectic decor!
I only wish it had a regular coffee pot or a Keurig. A French press is unfamiliar for most, I would think.
I would stay here again if needed downtown accommodations."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place was as described but I didn't read it closely enough so did not realize there was no dedicated driveway for parking, TV, traditional oven, or washer/driver. I was visiting my son who was just 0.1 miles away in Flagship Kerns so it was super convenient. The Honey Bee coffee shop just a click down the road in SoKno was amazing. Sarah's eclectic collection of art was fun. I was comfortable but would say overall this suits a younger person best. The walk around the back was a little uneven and the bathroom is very small- a larger person would have difficulty maneuvering around. Sarah was very gracious as were her tennants to allow me to park in their usual spot in the driveway while I waa there. I would stay there again for short stays as you can't beat the closeness/convenience to downtown."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super responsive host, very clean accommodations, and exactly as pictured in the post. What you don't see or maybe I didn't fully understand until arriving, is that the on-street parking is both on-street and on the sidewalk. I wouldn't do this myself but every other car on the street was parked with two wheels on the street and two on the sidewalk. I suspect they do this out of necessity and I wasn't going to take a chance getting swiped overnight. There is no TV - maybe a plus for some but I expected one. The bathroom is super tiny. It works, for sure, and is clean. But it's SUPER tiny. This home is really 3 units and you will hear squeaky floors. Finally, it's in a 'transitional' part of town. If that bothers you, find another place.
All that said, the host is on her game when it comes to communication and instructions. I found it easier to check in and out than many other Airbnb's - bonus points for sure. It's fully equipped as described and once inside, very clean."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sarah was so sweet. Her place was so cute and quaint. She was quick to respond to texts as well. Her place was quiet and I’d definitely choose it again my next visit to Knoxville.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very clean. Host was great with all communication. I was working in south Knox so very convenient for me. But it is still very quick and easy to access Knoxville.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah’s place was perfect for us during our time in Knoxville. Within walking distance of downtown, we were just removed enough from the busyness.
Sarah’s place was homey and quaint — not sterile feeling like many other places. We had fun listening to old tapes and cooking during our stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect place after a day of traveling… really comfortable, clean, and peaceful. Great bed, decor, and heat (it was snowing and cold out). Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Sarah's was great! She met us and helped us into the room when we checked in. A++
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sarah was so great at communicating with us throughout our stay. The place has a super cozy and homey feel, we loved the artsy decor and vibe!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place was a dream—so glad we found it! My boyfriend and I stopped in Knoxville for a for a wedding, and check-in was scheduled for the same time as the event. Sarah was super accommodating and let us check-in early so we could quick-change and get to the wedding on time. Not only was the space super cute and quiet, it was close to downtown and we were able to explore easily. Sarah's place had tons of cute and fun touches and we loved coming back to hang out.

To our delight and surprise, the space felt much bigger than what we were expecting based on the photos. It really has all you need for a comfortable short stay.
Sleep is an important part of travel so we were happy that the bed was super comfortable!
This was our first time to Knoxville and it was fun to be in a space to explore not just the downtown but the neighborhood streets and the local fare just a short walk down the road.
Sarah greeted us upon our arrival and was so fun to chat with her and to hear her local recommendations. We experienced some car issues on the drive to Knoxville and Sarah warmly offered support and recommendations for places around town for car repair.
We would most definitely recommend Sarah's charming spot and will keep on our list for places to stay for our next visit. 😊"

She’s made it beautiful with cool art and vintage pieces, always something fascinating to look at (check out the tiny brass penguin in the bathroom cabinet). AND it’s a fantastic location- easy walk to all the groovy spots in South Knox and a short hike on the historic Gay St. bridge to the heart of what’s happening downtown. Highly recommend!!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are traveling to Knoxville. This is a cozy place perfect for a small getaway. Close too downtown but far enough away you don’t get the hustle and bustle and noise. Recommend staying here 1000 times over.

We will be back again in next year!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous place to stay. The neighborhood is quite yet close to anything you might want or need. The beds were extremely comfortable -- which is not always the case. The apartment was private and quiet even though it is on the lower floor of the house. Everything was just as described -- actually it was a bit better. Linda is a very warm and personable host and readily available if any issues arise (there were none). As we now have family in the Knoxville area, please plan to visit more often. This will always be our preferred place to stay. We would give it more than five stars if that was an option!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda’s place exceeded expectations. Very comfortable and quiet. If there hadn’t been so much on our agenda (a music festival) it would have been nice just to hang out there. It was farther from downtown Knoxville than I had anticipated, but that’s a comment, not a criticism. I could have done better research, but the value and the quality made up for the longer drive."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miss Linda checked in on us first day we got there and made sure we have everything we needed. Location was amazing and the airbnb was well cleaned and everything that had been advertised.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. We had to travel to Knoxville unexpectedly and did not know if it would be better to stay in a hotel or at Linda's place. We are so glad we decided to stay at Linda's. The accommodations were immaculate, complete, and beautiful. Linda is compassionate about others, even strangers. She sensed our challenges and the stress of our unexpected trip, and prepared us a magnificent lunch as a kind gesture. We cannot say enough about Linda’s character and genuine heartfelt care for others."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a UT football game traveling as two couples. The 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment was perfect for us. Location is conveniently located to campus, Market Square, downtown, etc. if you have a car. Getting an Uber on game day was challenging but we were able to call a taxi which ended up being cheaper. Linda was a great host. Would recommend to anyone visiting Knoxville who wants a more scenic and peaceful home base."

Linda was very friendly when we encountered here a few times as we were coming and going. Would absolutely stay here again!"

The host was super nice and we just wish we had a bit more time to have a bite to eat with them. We would love to stay again when we're back in town."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After meeting Linda, I realize why she is a Superhost. She is warm and welcoming, and her place is every bit as advertised. We wanted for nothing in the kitchen, bedrooms and baths. We fixed most of our own meals, and Linda even pitched in with a delicious dish (she owns a restaurant). While the location is very quiet, multiple restaurants and a mall are close by; and, the University of Tennessee is only five miles away. If we return to Knoxville, we will be found at Linda's. If you stay there, I'm sure you will feel the same."

Nice open and inviting kitchen/living area. Loved having a laundry area to use washer/dryer, ironing board etc. Porch swing is nice to sit and drink coffee in am. Very busy weekend for us so we were happy to have comfortable beds to rest and great water pressure in showers. We did hear some motion upstairs, but it didn't bothered us too much. Plenty of room for 4 people."

Linda has created a beautiful, cozy environment that was so relaxing and yet still close to restaurants and everything we had planned at UT. The apartment was perfectly clean, had every item we could imagine needing, and of top quality, and was comfortable in every way. The instructions were perfectly clear and contained all of the information we needed. We even had the unexpected delight of meeting Linda, and she couldn't have been more lovely. There was one tiny item that needed attention, and Linda was on it immediately and fixed it better than we could have hoped. Linda, thank you so much for our wonderful stay!! We will be back!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay in Knoxville! Linda’s Airbnb is clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the yummy snacks that were left for us. Linda is very sweet and accommodating. Our flight was late and we arrived after midnight…she didn’t know that we had rented a car and even offered to pick us up from the airport! Couldn’t ask for a better host. Will definitely be back for next time we visit Knoxville! Thank you for your hospitality!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful Home! Linda's space was so inviting and comfortable and clean. We felt like we were walking into our own home. She was very helpful and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

What’s especially helpful is that the layout of her place is perfect to share with another couple or person. You have enough space between the two bedrooms that you have some privacy. The main kitchen/ main tv area is very large for an Airbnb and the outside seating area enables you to again have some extra space to relax. Linda is exceptional. She is quick to respond and genuine in her desire to ensure if there is any thing you do need, she is happy to take care of it! To sum it up, I’d consider coming back to Knoxville just so I could stay at Linda’s again!"

We had a late night arrival scheduled and when we arrived she came out and introduced herself and Iquired if weeded anything after our long trip. She also personally made and delivered breakfast treats that were warm and ""awesome"" as my stated. Would definitely recommend taking the opportunity to book this hidden gem. We're looking forward to our next trip to Knoxville and revisiting Linda's home."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice and quiet neighborhood. AirBnb unit is a ground level 2BR 2BA apartment under a beautiful home. Newer construction, clean and well supplied. Only issue is that the driveway is rather steep. The owner even brought us homemade muffins on the morning of checkout."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"City living with magnificent mountain/country views! Linda's place is an incredible find. It is minutes from great restaurants, UT, hospitals, shopping etc. and yet when you are there you feel miles away from any city hustle. The beds are extremely comfortable and the baths and kitchen are well equipped. The towels and linens are soft and very high quality. It is clear that every detail is handled by someone who cares about what they are doing.
It is a great place to stay if in town for business or for UT games. Knoxville is a fun town with many great restaurants."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect place to stay in Knoxville. Linda is a wonderful host. She had decorated a Christmas tree for us and left a basket of snacks and made us Christmas cookies. The beds were the most comfortable on our whole vacation of the three places we stayed. The views are breathtaking. This will be our go-to homebase whenever we go to visit our family in Knoxville from now on.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and tidy apartment on the lower level of the house. Everything in apartment is top-notch. Great two bedroom accommodations.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first trip staying at an Airbnb and we could not have been more pleased . We really hit the jack pot with this magnificent, unique and beautiful home .Much care has been given to the flowers, plants and garden area outside and a new hot tub and deck had just been completed. The apartment is spacious complete with snacks , waters and coffee . Linda has a charming and delightful personality . Our only regret is that we could not stay longer ."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was amazing. Very clean and comfortable. I loved all the live plants. Linda was so very friendly and helpful with directions. We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in town.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! We got in late and it was so easy to get to and the host had sent us the passcode so we could just go right in when we got there. It was very clean and comfortable. We went to the UT game and it was a short easy drive to get where we needed. We didn’t get to see the hosts much because it was such a short trip and we were out most of the time but Linda was great at communicating with me prior to our stay. Overall a great stay and I would recommend to anyone coming to Knoxville!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Linda’s place is just as promising as the descriptions. The breathtaking view of the Smokeys from your front porch is perfect with coffee in the morning. All amenities are present and Linda is an absolute delight!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay & the outside space was great. The location was close to UT campus & plenty of stores & restaurants close by.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is roomy and well furnished. The host Linda lives upstairs and is available to respond quickly to any concerns - of which we had none! The layout of the apartment with the 2 master suites ensures that guests are comfortable and have some privacy if needed. The kitchen was well stocked with necessary items including a selection of coffee and creamers which made the mountain views super enjoyable as i sat on the covered patio enjoying the beautiful cool mornings.
The location is very convenient as it is a short drive to downtown Knoxville and an even shorter drive to an array of shopping and dining. We found several small restaurants close by that allowed us to enjoy the local flavors including Emma's, The Gourmet Market and Sullivan's.
The location allowed us to explore a little with drives to the Great Smoky Mountains, the picturesque community of Dandridge, and the American Museum of Science and Energy in Oak Ridge. Walks around the neighborhood were invigorating with the the hills and afforded views of the beautiful neighborhood and the unique houses.
We highly recommend this location and verify that Linda is a ""Super Host""!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place, great location and remarkable host. This was one of our top Airbnb stays ever. Linda is a super gracious and engaging host with a wonderfully situated apartment in the lower level of her home. The unit is bright with large windows and beautifully appointed with everything you need for a wonderful stay. The location was ideal and easily accessible to Whole Foods, Aldi and many restaurants.
The outdoor patio is private and comfortable. We used it every morning and evening. The kitchen is very well equipped and the beds were super comfortable. A nice washer and dryer were a big bonus and the house was super clean.
I would highly recommend Linda's place and we hope to stay there again soon."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was everything the listing and reviews stated it would be.

if there is anything else she could do for us."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Linda's place was great! Super clean all around and comfortable bed in the main room. If you like to cook the kitchen area is awesome equipped with pretty much anything you need and if it doesn't have everything you need then Linda communicates fast to get it for you!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Linda is an absolutely AMAZING host. She went above and beyond for our family. The place was not only incredibly clean and comfortable, but had everything we could ever want or need available. Linda has the best beds that we've ever slept in away from home. She made us feel welcome and right at home. We have made a forever friend and will ONLY be staying with Linda every time we visit Knoxville!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was such a superb hostess and her place is just amazing! My teenage daughter and I stayed for several days and the apartment had everything we needed and more. Linda even made us a fantastic fresh home made meal after our long drive that we ate on the patio with a beautiful view of the mountains. All the essentials are there, kitchen is fully equipped and then some, laundry needs, snacks, coffee, soft beds and bedding/pillows. To note, there is a steep driveway, the house is built into a hill.
It is in a safe quiet subdivision type of neighborhood, and a short drive to everything in Knoxville. We wish we could leave more than 5 stars!! We will definitely be back again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay in this beautiful home. We will definitely visit again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at Airbnbs all over the world and this is the best one we have experienced. Linda is an amazing host filled with warmth & joy. The place was immaculately cleaned and the kitchen had everything that we needed and more. The grounds had beautiful tropical plants and shaded outdoor seating which was much enjoyed (we were there in July). We will definitely return the next time that we are visiting extended family in the area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,5/5 would definitely recommend staying. The place was extremely clean and well kept. It has everything you need. A true home away from home. The hosts were extremely nice and caring.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We met friends for the weekend and stayed at Linda's beautiful home. We were completely impressed by it's cleanliness, safety, and comfort. It is the best AirBnb we have stayed in! This home is not thrown together, it was well planned, well organized and very high quality. Linda has seen to every detail, from the comfortable beds to the well stocked cupboards. We had plenty of room in her spacious home. It is in a great location with ample parking. We were welcomed as if we were family. If you are looking to stay in the Knoxville area, this is the place to stay...it is beautiful!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was an AMAZING host!! So welcoming and kind! The place was comfortable, quiet and clean. Everything worked well Ac, laundry and kitchen. The bathtub is nice and deep for a hot bath. Lovely porch to sit and swing on at night.
She also was kind enough to make dinner for me two nights in row which was heavenly after long hours working. Would 100% recommend and would 100% come
Back…in fact I just may come back to visit her - the stay was so nice!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for almost two weeks while we waited to close on our new home/ while it was being painted- this was the PERFECT place to stay for my family including my 14 month old baby. The apartment is well furnished, kitchen is stocked with essentials and the front porch is wonderful. There’s no place like home but this is the next best thing- super comfortable and great location, convenient to shops, downtown, pretty much 10-15 minutes any direction you need to go in greater Knoxville. Plus Linda and Curt were the kindest hosts of all the Air BNBs I’ve ever stayed in!"

Our stay was wonderful. The rooms are large, clean, and beautifully decorated. If there isn’t something in the kitchen that you need, Ms. Linda will get it for you. She is so nice, and this place is the nicest private rental that I have ever stayed in. I wish we could’ve stayed longer. I will definitely keep this place bookmarked."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This basement apartment in Knoxville was perfect for our family. The touches are beautiful and the space had everything we needed.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda is the consummate host. We have stayed in AirBnB properties all over the world. This was BY FAR our favorite & the BEST one, bar none.
She made us feel at home & she went out of her way to welcome us with “beyond & above” service!
We will be back on our next trip to Knoxville!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda’s place was fantastic! So very clean and well appointed. We especially liked the layout..... 2 bedrooms with a bath attached to each, separated by the living area. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing experience staying with Linda! Her apartment is clean and offers many convenient amenities (washer, TV with streaming apps, brota water filter).

Would definitely stay here again, best place to stay in Knoxville!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We have stayed in many Airbnbs and VRBOs, here in the US and abroad, and we can say unequivocally that this is the most spectacular one of all. The apartment is spacious, beautifully furnished and immaculately clean. The view of the Smokies from the private patio is breathtaking. Linda, the hostess, goes out of her way to make you feel at home. If you're planning a trip to Knoxville, we highly recommend staying at this Airbnb."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda is a delightful host, and her home was just as described and pictured. Very cozy and spotless inside with lovely views of the mountains from the porch. Linda even made us dessert to enjoy by the fire on Friday night, what a treat!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda’s place is beautiful. Lots of room and great views. Easy access to downtown, the freeway and the really fantastic Bearden district.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, with stunning views. The close proximity to downtown and the benefits of a quiet neighborhood are all a plus! You'll want to see this place and experience Linda's hospitality."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible stay! Super clean, very spacious, and a gorgeous view. 10/10"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here while passing through Knoxville area. So much nicer than a hotel for our party of 4. Super comfy & sparkling clean space. Even though described as a basement apartment, it is a walk-out style with lots of natural light. Nicely decorated and well appointed. We especially appreciated that there was coffee available for our early departure!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Y'all, I've stayed at a lot of airbnb's all over the world and Linda is BY FAR the most hospitable host I've ever met.
When we went to check in the knob was locked and she had to come unlock as we waited outside about 10 minutes (thankfully this was early April so it wasn't hot) for her to unlock it and she was super apologetic. Then there was some odd issue with the ac as it wasn't coming out of the vents even though we could hear it running, again she was very apologetic and had it working properly inside of 30 minutes.
Apparently we were only her second guests and the entire area was just put together so they were going through some growing pains.
Linda was so sorry about everything that she made my family dinner that night and omggggggggggggg it was so good, she is Thai and owns a restaurant so she knows what she's doing (and I travel to Asia a lot including Thailand- I know good asian food folks) and we ate well. Then the next day when we got back she had warm mango over sticky rice with coconut milk drizzled on top with some ice water, good freaking lord that woman knows how to take care of a person haha.
The space itself is larger than it looks in pictures and everything was shiny and new, we used the kitchen to make breakfast and the washer/dryer to do some laundry as we had been on the road for several days.
Each bedroom has an en-suite bathroom with a closet with ample storage room and their own tv's with comfy beds. The main living room has a huuuuuuuuuge TV, maybe 80 inches that was super sharp, possibly 4k.
House is located in a quiet neighborhood, close enough to Knoxville that it's easy to get to but far away enough you don't have to deal with the noise and traffic, I slept very well.
If I venture back to Knoxville I would happily stay here again. Linda will treat you right!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful! We had a wonderful one night stay on our way home from Hilton Head Island. We wished we could have stayed longer, it was the best way to finish our vacation!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect for the minimalist traveler. The view alone makes this place completely worthwhile. Did not meet the host(s), but the communication, instructions, and everything else were clear. Barely saw or heard any of the other guests, so mostly quiet outside of the traffic and construction noise during the daytime. Near a convenience store and other places. Will consider booking again pending availability the next time I plan on visiting Knoxville."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful stay, Chris was a great host!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always great!!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Needed a place to do remote work while visiting family. Able to cook so it was a plus. Older house so it had your usual squeaks and quarks (watch your last step at the top of the stairs. it's higher than the rest.)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,great deal with responsive host.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we expected. It's not the Hilton downtown but for the price, it is a great stay. We had an easy check-in; Chris was very responsive and quick. The wifi was quick for my ""working from home"" on Friday. I also really appreciated the shower pressure/temperature. This location is hard to beat, especially for a game day. It's less than 15 minutes from campus, and near a bunch of breweries for a fun night out. We were lucky with the other guests as everyone was quiet and respectful.
If you're looking for the Ritz or fancy place, this will not meet your expectations as it was a bit dated, but I would 100% stay here again if I'm on a budget."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"""The house and the room were tidy and clean. It was a calm and quiet environment. However, despite the cold nights, the house lacked sufficient equipment and heating facilities. Apart from that, everything was great."""
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay at Chris’ place. The room was nice and clean. I enjoyed having the ability to watch tv.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Chris was amazing and responsive. Me being new to Airbnb I asked him about 3,000 questions and he answered every single one of them! Really like the location because it was close to a laundry mat, fast food and a few needed shopping places! All and all a great place to go!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Comfortable with basic amenities that I needed. Only thing I would add is a mirror in the bedroom, since the mirrors were in the shared bathrooms.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Chris’s place. I was very pleased with the proximity to the places I had to be. Nothing was more than a ten minute drive. It was clean and quiet, even with other guests in the home. Very affordable.I appreciated the instructions and suggestions placed throughout the home. I also appreciated responsiveness and resolution to a situation. Upon arrival, I didn’t locate the iron which was listed as an amenity. I reached out to Chris, who quickly advised where it was usually kept; but it wasn’t there. He stated that one would be provided the next day. He found that the iron was in the unit next door and provided me the code to retrieve it. Other guests were friendly, parking easy. The only issue I had was that I didn’t know that the room I was staying in, was upstairs. A back injury has me challenged by staircases. My daily activities required several trips to & from the car. I 100% recommend this host and listing."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff’s place is very nice, one of our favorite AirBnBs. It looks exactly like the pictures, is squeaky clean, and there are a ton of great restaurants within easy walking, including at least two coffee houses.
Jeff responds almost instantly when messaged, which turned out to be very helpful. We returned one evening to water leaking through the light fixtures and fan in the master bath. Clearly the unit above had some sort of plumbing issue. Sadly with water coming through the ceiling, we had to move out midway through our stay. Jeff rebooked us at the Residence Inn himself and took care of everything.
We would definitely stay at Jeff’s place again, hopefully minus the water leak issue."

The old city vibe with shops and restaurants were close and walkable- and awesome for several afternoons of exploring- and I don’t want to forget the art and history!
I would stay here every time I’m in Knoxville- this was my first trip and I can’t wait to come back!
Thank you Jeff!"

-On-site parking made it easy to come and go as we needed to do, and access from Central was always convenient.
-Nice job with the great ceiling fans, as they were perfect for keeping cool.
-We didn’t do a lot of cooking but spotted everything we would need. (The coffee pot got a lot of use, though.)
-All the furnishings were comfortable, stylish, and well coordinated.
-Customizing the door lock code to our mobile phone number was brilliant."

DO NOT MISS THIS!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely LOVED my time at Jeff’s fabulous condo. I was honored to be his first guest. I enjoyed every moment of my stay. Had his place not been booked for Saturday I would have extended through the additional time it was available the following week. I am looking to relocate back to Knoxville from Colorado but taking my time to find the perfect permanent home to land. I LOVE downtown Old City area. Jeff’s condo made me love it even more! I would definitely stay at Jeff’s place again.
Jeff was attentive but not intrusive, there to support my entire stay. His place is immaculately clean, had absolutely everything I needed except for cleaning supplies, including a vacuum. I am a clean freak. I clean throughout my stays. Thankfully, Wal-mart was close I was able to pick up supplies, other than that everything was flawless.

My sister and I decided to take his spontaneous trip and needed somewhere to stay, so we went to on Airbnb. This was the prettiest place that we could find for such a deal. The host got back with me if it was available under five minutes. We got to the place and it was so beautiful and so well thought out. The host did not miss one thing when they were thinking about their guest. I will definitely stay here again when we are back in this area and I highly recommend it to anybody else that is staying in this area. You will not be disappointed."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute and quaint. Overall a very pleasant experience. A few suggestions: get patio blocks all the way to the hot tub (also very clean and nice), we had a little trouble with the water adjustment in the shower and a better selection of stuff to watch on t.v. like local channels (not that we were there to do that, but it would have been nice in the evening before bed).

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the stunning property and the attention to detail that had gone into every aspect of our stay.
One of the highlights of our trip was definitely the use of the hot tub. Set amongst the lush greenery of the garden, the hot tub provided the perfect way to unwind after a long day of exploring the local area. The water was kept at the perfect temperature and the jets were powerful enough to give us a proper massage, which was needed after a day of walking.
All in all, our stay at this Airbnb was an absolute delight. From the beautiful surroundings to the luxurious hot tub, everything was perfect. If you're looking for a peaceful and relaxing getaway, I would definitely recommend this property."

Would love to book this place again ❤️"

The back seating area with the hot tub is really peaceful."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I don’t even wanna tell the truth bc I know how y’all sell out places but this is the best Airbnb I’ve been to. Bc how your place look exactly like the photos?? And she had the nerve to have a lil breakfast snack counter with it! Not to mention the hot tub was clean asf like I swear she had to have been in there on her hands and needs scrubbing. And the actual house was spotless like it looked like we were the first ones to ever stay there. Plus the crisp mountain water in the fridge. There’s also another bigger house next door but the little one is perfect for 2-3 ppl. If I had to pick a con and I’m just nit picking but the hot tub is is shared. But even with that it was available every time we wanted it and you can’t hear other people in the yard so it’s still 5 stars from me.

,,,"Actually we didn’t checkin cause she cancel our reservation. We book a night before the day of checkin then she didn’t even inform me and my husband in the morning that she cancel our reservation, she immediately call the airbnb for the refund and told them not available. she is likely rude to us without proper information. If the airbnb is not available please don’t post in available dates. And now we are waiting for the refund which is 5 to 10 days waiting to receive it back in our card."
,,,"Dead bugs in the room, no lock on SHARED bathroom, and horrible smell. Slow to respond and ghosted us after contacting customer support."
