2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful long weekend that we had celebrating our son's graduation. The house was absolutely perfect. There were so many great things about the house from the comfortable bedding and linens, to the well stocked kitchen and dining area, to the comfortable sofas & chairs, and to our favorite -the wrap around porch.

The history of the home is incredible and Julie has done a great job with a book describing the house's history and how it came to be as it is today. Bed's were comfortable and clean, rooms were nicely sized, beautiful historic character, and this house is close to EVERYTHING. Within a couple minutes to tons of restaurants, and right across the street from the Natural History Museum, and down the street from Piedmont Arts Center.
Would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Martinsville area."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful, comfort, and beautiful home. We had a member of our party with mobility issues, so Julie kindly had a bed made up in the first floor office.
There is a full bathroom with walk-in shower on the first floor, too. There is one full bathroom upstairs that the 2nd floor three bedrooms share.
The kitchen is well stocked with spices,seasonings, pots, and pans.

The house was well-stocked with all of the little extras we needed, and as an added bonus, it was decorated for Christmas when we arrived on Dec. 27! There was plenty of room for our family, and we enjoyed being walking distance to Martinsville’s uptown district (daily morning walks to get coffee and breakfast at The Ground Floor were a must!). We’ll definitely be staying at Julie’s house on our next visit to Martinsville."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Traveling with two preteens the upstairs living/game room was wonderful. The house is quite spacious and having stayed in this Airbnb before we felt right at home and comfortable. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to be at home away from home.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"100 Starling was a great place for a family get together for the holidays or anytime. The house is easy to find and Julie provided excellent instructions.
Once inside we found the house to be very suitable for our stay. There was plenty of room for a large party to spread out and not feel cramped. There is a full kitchen with all the utensils, pots, pans, etc.
The bedrooms are all upstairs and very comfortable. Bonus: there is an arcade machine in the upstairs TV room!
If you are traveling to Martinsville with family, this is the perfect place to stay. We will definitely stay here again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie’s place was perfect for us. We were working on a project in the area and needed a place to sleep a few people with a lot of parking for our work trucks. This place has a ton of parking.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was absolutely one of the best homes I’ve had the pleasure to stay in for a couple of nights. I just wish I could have stayed longer.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Once again the 100 Starling house didn’t disappoint … spacious an ease of location is very important when staying in Martinsville
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""Starling Place is probably the best Airbnb we've ever stayed at and here's why....The Martinsville location is excellent. It is centrally located and easily accessible. There is plenty of parking from the circular driveway in front to the two car driveway in the back with garage/back door access. The house itself is beautiful and welcoming! The access code worked perfectly. The house was so charming! (solid wood doors with glass handles, shining hardwood floors, broad staircase, gorgeous light fixtures) It had the timeless feel of a classic home with all of the comfortable, modern updates. The best part was the obvious concern for guests' comfort. The home was impeccably clean! The bathrooms had fluffy white towels galore AND a stack of beach style towels in the laundry room. The showers had dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and bodywash."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was just lovely. We stayed there for my son’s wedding and couldn’t have been more comfortable. If I ever need a place to stay in Martinsville again, I hope Julie’s place is available."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie’s historic house is both lovely and comfortable. We have enjoyed it several times and will be back! Julie always makes us feel welcome.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better stay at an air bnb to go see a local music festival. The most interesting part of this air bnb is the pieces of art scattered throughout the home. I appreciated the activities and games provide such as the retro arcade games. Great stay especially for the price! It’s so unfair how pricey hotels and even air bnbs can be, Julie is not only fair, but very kind and was easy to communicate with! Thank you again :) we hope to be in the area again and will book this stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed for a night on our way to a festival, but wow did we wish we could’ve stayed longer! The house is so beautiful and has incredible character (and modern touches!). I loved all the thoughtful details, including the history of the home and works by a local artist. Our whole crew loved the game room! The entire place was somehow even better than the pictures. 🤩"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time at Julie’s place. We were in Martinsville for our Hodge Cousins Weekend. The spacious “smart” home was the perfect place for 6 of us.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay hosted by Julie, at 100 Starling Place was Wonderful!
We enjoyed sitting on the spacious and comfortable porch in between our comings and goings in the area, then retiring to rest in the accommodating beds. There was ample room and an equally inviting ethos of hospitality.
Our every need was met or exceeded. The house was perfect for our Family Reunion events & guests.
Thank you for an outstanding stay,
July 21-24, 2023!
Tanya & Julius Copeland & Family
Paula Clark, Julius A. Copeland, Micha Green, & Cameron & Joy Lawson"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the best place weve ever stayed. The home was more than we were expecting. Its absolutly beautiful and the energy there felt the same as my grandparents house in upstate NY. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud... I hit the bed and didnt wake up until my alarm went off ( which never happens) There was more than enough amenities needed to go around, and we didnt need anything for our stay. There was plenty of places to sleep so the kids had different options. The only thing I wish I had done differently was book it for a few more nights. Definity will be my go to place to stay for now on when visiting Martinsville."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were in town for the weekend for my son’s wedding. There were ten of us plus one spoiled dog. Perfect for what we needed. Plenty of room and lots of memories made on the front porch. The beds are incredibly comfortable and location is great. The host also was gracious in allowing early checkin and extending our checkout time. No complaints at all.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at Starling Place was very enjoyable. The cleanliness was top-notch and the number of products on hand for our use was generous. The only thing we expected to use which did not work out was the drip coffee maker; there was no decanter. However, there was also a Keurig machine, along with plenty of pods and other coffee supplies. I would definitely stay here again if I needed a space with multiple bedrooms."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing!!!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect home for our multigenerational family! Very clean, spacious, well appointed, kids loved the game room! Kitchen had all of the essentials to cook a family meal… Lovely wrap around porch that we enjoyed. We appreciate the great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this beautiful house! It is even better than the pictures, very clean, comfortable and so much space. We needed a place near Eden for the week and it was only a 30 minute drive. I worked from the house, the office was a perfect set up. I didn’t have to bring an extra monitor, keyboard or mouse. The WIFI was a bit spotty but wasn’t a disruption for my meetings, if it disconnected it reconnected quickly.
So many extras available in the kitchen, shampoo and conditioner in the showers. Beds are super comfy, towels were extra fluffy. We loved drinks on the porch each evening, did puzzles in the front sitting area, played arcade games in the yellow room. Would definitely come back and recommend to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location was literally within 10 minutes of the multiple functions we attended over the weekend. The home’s interior was clean, welcoming, and just as described. The exterior has been painted so the color is different than the pictures.
There were 10 of us and the home comfortably accommodated everyone.
I would certainly book again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location. Quiet neighborhood.
Very clean house. Host was grea. When back in area, will stay again"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A very nice and unique place. We really liked the house. Kitchen layout takes some getting used to as it is a bit different. The game room was fantastic! The beds were very comfortable as well. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great house! It was very spacious and well appointed. Nothing was lacking that we needed. The beds were very comfortable too. The video arcade game was fantastic. It was so fun playing my old favorite games. I would recommend bringing earplugs as it is located by a road and you can hear the cars going by at night. I wouldn't hesitate to book it again if I am in the area. Thanks for a great spot!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Julie's place for work travel, and had a very pleasant time. The kitchen was great for cooking for our small group, and the beds were comfortable. Would recommend for a week in Martinsville."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a few guys in a shooting competition stayed there. Was a nice place with modern technology. Maybe a little too modern for us old fellas. (Hey siri, how do you work a kurig). We figured it out though."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I needed a place to stay last minute and this home was perfect. The location was great, the home was clean and had everything you will need for a relaxing stay and the beds were very comfortable. Julie was very nice and responsive. This was much better than a hotel. We would stay again and recommend this home to others."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"It is a beautiful and spacious home. With 8 people traveling, we still had plenty of room to spread out. The beds and furniture were comfortable. There were gorgeous hardwood floors throughout. It was clean and inviting, and we felt right at home. We appreciate amenities like the welcome basket on the kitchen counter with snacks and the little extras provided in the bathroom (makeup removing wipes, Qtips, body wash, etc.). Julie was very responsive to our questions.
Julie is a great host, and we definitely look forward to staying again next year. 🙂"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Visiting family and this location was perfect. I loved the game room!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for my family and I, as we was here for my graduation. Which was in Lynchburg Va. Julie gave clear instructions on how to access the home and didnt bother us at all. Home was cozy and had a good feel to it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location to enjoy the best of Martinsville!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a terrific time and the house was very clean and neat. The front porch was a terrific place to hang out and enjoy the evening.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a wonderful place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We only stayed one night but very satisfied with our experience. Easy checkin and comfortable beds and everything one would expect was provided. The home is historic and has a lot of charm and character.

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,great communication and great stay!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful house! A group of 4 of us stayed for a conference in Martinsville.

Would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Cozy and historic. Hands down one of my most favorite stays. Will return.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great except the game room. When you are watching a movie on the couch with the nights out don't lean forward for your food or drink because your movement cuts on the overhead light. This was very distracting.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,I had family in for the weekend and arranged for them to stay at 100 Starling based on the proximity of the house to walking trails and Piedmont Arts. Julie was wonderful. She met me at the house for a walk through a week or so before family arrived and was able to provide much appreciated flexibility as to check in and check out times. My family was very happy with every aspect of the house.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay in Martinsville! Will definitely be booking this home again when we go back for training.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous house! We visit Martinsville several times a year to see family and have always stayed at a hotel but this time we decided to try an airbnb property and we are so glad we did. This property has all the nice touches that I have come to expect with airbnb. The Home Guide had a wonderful history of the house as well as all the other info you need. We definitely felt like we were staying with family. Loved the big fluffy towels and bed linens! We will definitely be back. Thanks for such a cozy stay.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful 1912 home in town. Nicely renovated and very comfortable. We hosted both our children and their spouses and had my cousin and his wife come by for a visit one evening as well. Nicely laid out, beautiful historic home.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely home! the house was conveniently located and provided a great location for work travel. Internet was fast, towels soft, water hot, kitchen well equipped; overall the house was spacious, clean and comfortable. Julie even had a nice personalized welcome note for us when we arrived. I absolutely plan to stay here again when I return for work, and hopefully I can leave time to explore the museum that's located just down the block and enjoy the large covered porch."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at Julie's home! This was a halfway point between our home in PA and our friends' home in GA. we were traveling with two small children and one elementary School age. Julie's house offered everything we needed and so much more (e.g., some helpful perishables and non-perishables in the kitchen, first aid kit and hair products in the bathroom). We had so much fun going across the street to the natural history museum with the kids. And we were able to walk or drive (in under 10 minutes) to a park, a restaurant, and a coffee shop. We also enjoyed visiting Greensboro, North Carolina which was about an hour away. Julie's house was a haven to us this weekend and we know it will be for you, too!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place has tons of space and is very well-furnished. It felt like my grandmother’s house (but bigger) - homey and with a traditional decor - just as pictured. The location was great and the home is very quiet and comfortable. The kitchen layout is a little odd but totally functional and super well-furnished with anything you might need. We enjoyed the big screen tv and also using Alexa to control the lights and the temperature. Communication with Julie was great - would definitely stay again.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Starling Place. It was very homey and clean. The location was very central to everything and it provided a great place for the family to be together rather than staying in a hotel. We look forward to staying again on a return trip.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An excellent stay. We had a bumpy road at the beginning on our side. This was a work trip and one of our travelers got exposed to Covid the day before we were suppose to leave. Julie was extremely responsive and accommodating to our situation while we worked out a new schedule and workers to come out. She graciously accepted our change of dates and change of guests which helped us keep our revised work schedule. The place was wonderful to stay in, conveniently located to the downtown area which is where we need to be. There was a random power outage on Wednesday morning, and Julie again was right on top of things for us as far as getting in touch with the power company and seeing how long the repair time would be. We were quite comfortable in the house and it had every amenity we needed. We can't thank Julie enough for a great stay and accommodating manner. We look forward to our next trip to Martinsville and will be hopefully staying here again. Thank you!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very clean, a great location, and very quiet for being off a main road in the area. Plenty of parking for 3 pickup trucks. The beds were so comfortable, I slept better than I had in a long while! The decor was charming and the fireplace was an added bonus in the evening. It was too cold to enjoy the porch during our stay but it was spacious and even had a cute little swing. I would definitely recommend a stay here."

Julie also provided everything we could need to make the trip easy and relaxing. We would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to visit the area. The Natural History Museum across the street was a fun and interesting time for our kids. They also enjoyed the large game room with a nice vintage arcade machine. Check in was a snap with the front door key pad. All around 5 star experience!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is THE BEST HOST! Her home is our home away from home in our hometown. We just love staying at her place - it's so clean, comfy and just the perfect place to unwind. Highly highly recommend."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"House exactly as described. Our second time staying here. Julie has the house stocked with all the amenities anyone could need (spices, coffee, charcoal for the grill)."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Julie worked with me to drop some refrigerated items early which I really appreciate. I had a couple of other special issues that Julie was very helpful in offering suggestions etc. The house is perfectly located in town, with great access to the local trail system in Martinsville which I spent every evening exploring. The downtown area is a short walk from the house as well. One of the better airbnbs I have stayed at. The kitchen was well stocked with snacks, coffees etc."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Most definitely exceeded our expectations! This is a beautiful home with all the amenities you will need. My family and I were able to grill out in the charol grill that is available on the premises, house is spacious, CLEAN!!!, beds were very comfortable and Julie answered any questions we had. I could go on and on about how wonderful our stay was. Thank you Julie."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"What a lovely place to call home for the weekend. Our host Julie was amazing with communication and super responsive to all our questions. We were in town for a wedding but also got to enjoy the area - Fairy Stone State Park, Mountain Valley Brewery (even if you don’t do beer, the fireflies in the valley at night are spectacular), and of course the wedding at Stoneleigh Estate.
With this house you get the best of both old and new....this 100 year old house has been restored (including home automation features) but still has that old charm...would definitely come back again.
Thanks for everything, Julie!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"An awesome house at a great location . Ms Julie place is one of the best places that I stated on.
There was so many amenities.
I do recommend it to anyone."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing. I usually try to stay at an Intercontinental or Westin or similar. There wasn't anything of this caliber in the area available from any chain - so we checked AirBnB. I am so glad we did. House is as advertised, or better. lots of room. very clean. Close to downtown. Beds were very comfortable. Bathrooms were authentic but upgraded where needed - just right. If we come back to the area we will definitely stay here again! 5 stars!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed being together at the house for the family wedding. I was so nice to sit on the porch everyday and have coffee, lunch and relaxation time with the family."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay very clean and comfortable beds
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and location. Julie is a great hostess. The house is in a great location for a good walk or ride. Our family will definitely book with Julie again in the near future.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My cousins and I were staying here for our grandmother’s funeral. There ended up being some extra people that needed to stay one night and the host was super helpful and accommodating.
The house is awesome! The it was extremely spacious for the amount of people we had there that one night. Sitting on the front porch was very nice as well. There is nothing negative to say about the stay."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Julies place is everything you would expect and more. Quick response, beautiful home & she lets you know about some cool things to do around the area. My family loved the Pac-Man game that was upstairs."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Location an peacefulness
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Julie's house is in a great location in Martinsville. For families with dogs, there is a park within walking distance and the neighborhood is very dog friendly for casual walks. The view of the church and the stained glass windows across the street is gorgeous. The home is very comfortable. If you need to work while there, the desk in the office is a great plus. For us, the home was much larger than we needed for 2 people and our dog. But, for our travel needs, it was the perfect location, dog friendly and among the few in the area that take the extra care needed for cleaning during Covid. Sadly, we didn't have time in our schedule to enjoy the upstairs den and arcade game, or the lovely wrap around front porch. These features would make it the perfect place for a getaway with friends or a family gathering.
Besides being clean and safe during Covid, one of the most important things for us was a kitchen good for cooking big meals that we could deliver to nearby family members. The kitchen is an odd layout, but it worked very well for us. It's very well stocked and has good quality cooking pans. We personally have a focus on natural foods and healthy eating, and we don't use cookware that has chemical non stick coatings, etc. We have found that many nice Air BnB's have crappy cookware and the coatings are scratched, making them even more toxic. For long trips, we've started taking a few of our own kitchen items to make things easier. In advance, Julie assured me that her kitchen was well stocked for our needs and that we didn't need to bring our own. She did not disappoint!
Julie's communication before our stay and during was prompt and professional. When we had a family emergency and needed to extend our stay, she accommodated us. BUT, she wasn't willing to compromise the safety of the next guests and only allowed us to stay the amount of time that she would have time to air the house out for the proper time before the next arrival. That made it harder for us, but we really appreciated that she did the right thing---and she offered to help us find another place for the additional days we needed.
Highly recommend this stay!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Very cute house conveniently located in Martinsville. Lovely front porch. WIFI worked great for both of us to work during the day. Everything was clean and comfortable and we had everything we needed for a great visit.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay here again and again and again! Julie is a great host and the house is amazing. it has everything you would want and need, and is exceptionally clean. The check in process was smooth and easy. The decorations are really cool and has nice local touches. The upstairs living room is awesome. All in all one of the best air bnbs I've been to!"

As soon as we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Anita. She explained everything to us and the guidelines were clear. She always addresses us with a smile. We don't speak English very well but it was easy to communicate with Anita.
We had booked the bedroom with ensuite bathroom. The room was remarkably clean and so was the bathroom. We had everything at our disposal. It was exactly as the photos. This was our first airbnb experience and we are delighted."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I originally booked Anita's place for two nights, and ending up extending an additional two as it was such a clean, welcome, home at a great price.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anita & Denny offer welcome southern hospitality. we stayed 3 nights for a music festival and they never made us feel badly about coming g and going late in the evening.
We were treated to some awesome live music from the pair and learned a bit about their musical background. Everything went smoothly and the spaces both public and private were sparkling clean. I gave an overall 5 stars based on the room and amenities as expected from reading the space description. the room was quiet and secure. They provided a comfy bed with 2 pillow choices, additional box of snacks which in my opinion sets a host apart. A few dollars invested in the guest is so thoughtful when guests arrive and may be hungry without the opportunity to hit a market in a new area. Well done Anita.
Plenty of street parking.
Older bathroom/interior but as stated, sparkling clean and great water pressure in the shower of the ensuite bathroom off our room. They have multiple rooms available. The room included fridge, microwave and a basket of kitchen supplies truly making our stay a breeze.
We will definitely stay here again. Probably missed some things but easy communication so just ask Anita if you have questions before staying."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A clean and spacious apartment with an en-suite bathroom. Communication with Anita was easy, and we appreciated her to meet us in person (that's what Airbnb is about, right? not only endless self check-ins in hotel-like aparts). Her cat is so friendly and cute! Overall, I would definitely recommend this listing! Either for one day stay or for the entire week trip, it would be a great option."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, would definitely stay again"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anita's place is what AirBnb is all about - getting to a lovely home in a quiet neighborhood, with trails to walk, a peaceful night's sleep and some good music, if that's what you're interested in. We enjoyed chatting with our hosts, the lovely room, and of course, their welcoming cat!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Accommodation were exact to what waz advertised. Anita waz a great host. Enjoy my rest in between shifts.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s quite place and really great place to hide from city or just to stay a night between town. I hear lots people stay there regulars for workers. The really nice just a little far from downtown or restaurants. Other than great customer service....superb Anita.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with Danny and Anita. So will you. Their years of managing a “real” BnB ( for those of us old enough to remember) means that they know how to serve without limits and with a joyous heart. Their place is exactly as described. Every amenity. Special touches abound. But mostly Danny and Anita are there at your service ready to enhance your stay in whatever way you might enjoy. We were there for our anniversary, and they asked if they could sing a couple of special songs for us in honor of our anniversary which we gladly accepted. How many hosts have you had in your Airbnb experience who have pulled out the guitar and autoharp and sang in your honor. This was our first, and you can see that we have been to a few Airbnb’s."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing place with intimate touch of the owner to every peace!
Interim is just great, very cozy and comfy- like you visiting your grandma. Atmosphere is incredible. They hid everything you can even THINK OF. Including POPCORN to watch tv!!!! Breakfast skanks and all the shower things. Bed is like an cloud! We were sleeping as angels!
Thank you"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anita and Denny are super host, the room was sparkling and had all amenities. As well as brochures for you to know the area and visit places. I highly recommend them to stay in their place, room is so comfortable and they make you feel like you are at home. Definitely be back on another occasion. Thank You Anita & Denny."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a quick trip for me but definitely a 5 star visit in my book. Anita and Denny are excellent hosts!

The private bath is a real plus and everything is so clean. I loved the bed 😴 ! Their place is a real bargain and they are wonderful hosts! Would definitely return for a future trip! 👍👍
2020-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very nice lower level of home with private entrance. Beautiful yard, close to where I work. This was my second visit this year."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I am a traveling health care worker. I needed a space during the Covid 19 pandemic that was quiet, restful, and comfortable after working 10 hour days. Beautiful yard was very relaxing to view. Relaxing place to stay."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect little spot for our weekend adventure! Super convenient and close to where we wanted to be. It was perfectly cute, super clean and had all the must haves and some extras that are so appreciated! I would definitely book another stay when/if we come back into town. Our only hiccup was when we arrived we had no power and the host was inaccessible for more than 20 hours."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at this cute and efficient cottage and we plan to come again soon. Had a great and comfortable stay. Thanks!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and will be back when working in the area again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable place very well located between commercial businesses and the sporting field location that I was there for."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool little spot
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a wonderful time. The only thing was the water did have a slight smell. Talked with the host in email she explained there was an issue a while back and was fixed and she would look into it. She was kind enough to work with us on it. Wonderful person would recommend.
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted to love our stay, but it wasn’t great.
We were woken up by people mowing and weed whacking right outside our bedroom windows; they were carelessly mowing around our rental car, too, possibly kicking up damaging debris. It was extremely alarming to have unexpected people on the property, especially since we’re not familiar with Martinsville. I messaged the host to see if they expected people to be on the property. Their response was, “They are on a schedule and do it as available. We talked to them yesterday, they didn’t give us a firm date…I’m sorry, but it’s the time of the year.” I understand that the lawn may need to be mowed while guests are occupying the property, but the host should have given us a heads up that random people may show up on the property during our stay.
Some details of the home also pose a threat to guests’ safety (e.g., electrical outlet in living room popped out of the wall), and the house could have been cleaner (e.g., bathroom walls were dirty)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little house in the country. Highly recommend and would stay again.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location was about 10 minutes from stores and restaurants.
House was newly renovated and is beautiful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host has been very comprehensive and awesome. I would definately recommend !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay, very cozy and will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this clean and cozy home. Everything was as described and pictured. We were very comfortable and felt right at home. Our host was kind and helpful. We enjoyed restaurants in the area and overall had a terrific stay. We will check the availability of this place again when we make a return trip in a couple of months.
Thank you, AF, for the great accommodations!
Brian"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to spend the weekend if you are in town for an event or a couple of days for business. Very clean and cozy. Nice bed and linens. Washing machine and dryer and fast internet. Everything is nice and clean and new.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house is nice. But little things add up.
Dirty ceiling fans, stains on couch and washcloths& shower curtain stained. Microwave was dirty.
No water pressure at all.
The traffic noise was loud."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it was a nice stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place that met my needs perfectly. I’ll try to book again when back in town

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, little house. Excellent heating. Clean. Comfy beds. Nice sized rooms and great wifi.
Good birdsong in morning with nice view of sunrise.
All the appliances work and the coffee maker (ESPECIALLY) were right on time.
And proximity to lovely “Dick and Willie”walking trail was super nice."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and accommodating stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,we stayed a week. the place was cozy and warm. would have stayed longer had it been available. Host was very responsive for the one thing I needed.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy, quiet place in martinsville, with lots of windows for natural light. Great for remote work. Lots of amenities but no laundry access, which was difficult since we stayed for a week. Spacious kitchen. Had to buy more toilet paper and trash bags since there weren't enough for our weeklong stay."
2024-01-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve used AirBnB many times and this was the worst. I rented here to have use of the washer and dryer which was non existent. The front porch was so dark I had to use a flashlight to open the key lock box and unlock the door. There were three keys. When I wasn’t able to get in I called the hostess. She was not helpful and argued there was plenty of light from the pole. When I told her that was not accurate she argued stating all the keys worked fine and that she doesn’t turn on the porch light. She said there was nothing she could do about it as she was 2 1/2 hours away. Then she said she’d see if she could get someone there to help me. It was about 32 degrees and a wind was blowing. I continued to try to unlock the locks. One key finally worked and I called to let her know. She told me I was rude.
The water pressure was so bad nor was it hot enough to take a shower.
The temperature was set at 65 and all the curtains were pulled back. It was very cold inside."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was very cozy and clean
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Host was very responsive and kind ,the home is cute and clean,"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. Place was just the right size for 2 adults and a infant. Place was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. The host communicated very promptly if i had any questions. Check in was easy, the rules were simple. I didn’t have any issues for my 5 day stay. I would definitely book again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to town and better pricing and quality of local hotels.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"AF's property met my expectation, it was as describe. It was clean, inviting, easy to access. I would like to have seen larger TV as well as a second TV in the property, but overall, it was just fine. I will recommend to others, and I would stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what I was looking for, would definitely come back again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No complaints. Clean. Just as pictured. No surprises.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Very happy with the place and totally staying again the next time I’m in town visiting family
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was great! The host went out of their way to help us find a spot to leave our car for the week when our original plan fell through at the last minute.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A pretty cozy, homey feeling place to stay. Location is very pretty and easy to access. Water pressure was good and shower is quite nice, never noticed any sulphur smell as suggested by other reviews."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for Martinsville Speedway. Much better than staying in a hotel. There is some road noise so if that bothers you, bring ear plugs. In comparison to the potential noise in a hotel, I would take this place hands down. Very happy with our first Air B&B stay. Would book again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful home! The host was quickly responsive and nice! Their description of the home was correct and looks exactly like pictures. My kids said it felt like home and was even more comfortable than home. It was clean comfortable with lots of simple decor. The host sent over easy to follow directions and had them posted on the fridge. I throughly enjoyed the home. The beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows and extra throw blankets in each room. Had basic necessities for cooking such as pots, pans, plates, bowls, utensils, measuring cups, and drinking glasses. It had a sponge and dishwasher pods. It brought a level of peace while being in the area for an unfortunate situation. I highly recommend this property and I look forward to interacting with the host in the future if I need to return to the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Good place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean home, thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute and clean place! Really loved the look of the bathroom. The only thing I would say is if you have small children or a pet that the main road seemed to stay sort of busy, but this wasn’t a disturbance for us :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolutely beautiful home! Everything was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The beds were great! We would def. stay here again if in the area.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, sanitary, and peaceful environment."
2023-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very responsive and nice, but unfortunately we did not have a very good stay. A problem with the water heater or something in the bathroom left an awful smell for the entire trip. We also encountered many bugs as well as an ant infestation in the kitchen one day into our stay. It’s also never fun when you are required to do a good bit of cleaning and organizing before checkout, while you are paying a cleaning fee."
2023-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,It was a decent place the only issue we had was that when you take a shower it has a super strong sulfur smell and it would stink up the entire house bad
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute!! We loved our stay here.
The shower water pressure was pretty low, & the water smelled like sulphur. If you can get past that, the rest of the home was super cozy.
Good for a 2-night getaway."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay and loved how cozy and at home I felt. The only problem was the bathroom. The shower pressure was very weak and the bathroom had a HORRIBLE smell. I’m assuming that is why people came to fix the sewage. Other than that, a perfect stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean. We had a little problem with the shower, but we contacted the host and they did their best to resolve it. The neighborhood appears older, but it was very peaceful. I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is cozy and very clean. We definitely would stay again if the opportunity came again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Spruce Cottage. The house was great- very clean, well-stocked, nicely renovated. The host was very easy to work with- responsive and provided easy check-in instructions. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Martinsville!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house, recently remodeled, nicely decorated, and very clean. I arrived around 9:00 p.m. and felt a little uncomfortable with a few things right away. 1) very dark outside with no light except the front porch light; 2) grass next to the house was about a foot high; 3) no covering over the window at the kitchen door or the windows over the sink. Someone could have seen into the living room, kitchen, and partially down the hallway from the kitchen door window; 4) when I sat on the bed and then got up it creaked very loudly. I stayed a couple of hours and decided I would be more comfortable at a hotel. This was my first Airbnb experience, and, being a woman traveling alone, I may not have chosen the right kind of place (for me). However, the host was very accommodating and was going to consider a power pole outside and agreed to put blinds on the window of the kitchen door. Issue was reasonably resolved ."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice property. It was cozy and welcoming. Was exactly as the photos portrayed. Centrally located to restaurants, easy to navigate to event we were attending."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host were great. Would stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! Incredibly close to the fields my team played at all weekend and restaurants galore. The space was impeccably renovated and brings a sense of calm as soon as you come in. Do yourselves a favor and forgo the hotel, this is the place to stay at!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at this newly renovated home! Our host was very kind and responsive to several questions and changes to our reservation. We were in town for an event at the country club, and the cottage was close and convenient for this. The beds were soft, and we appreciated a full kitchen with new appliances to cook on. There were a few small items not in the cottage yet, but I’m sure with time, will be added. We would not hesitate to book here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed our stay here! The house was beautiful and had everything you needed. The owners of this home were awesome! Very attentive to all our needs! Tony seeWe will definitely book again.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a full house of 10 adults attending a 50th high school reunion and everyone loved this home!! The house was very welcoming and had wonderful amenities such as a back porch, multiple social gathering rooms on the first floor, a side patio with a fire pit and wood to burn, a beautiful landscaped yard and a big circular driveway. The full kitchen was well stocked. There was bottled water in all six bedrooms along with a large tray of individual snack food and basic toiletries in the bathrooms. Our group could not stop saying amazing things about this lovely well furnished and appointed home!! All of us would be happy return and stay there again. The host Leeland and the co-host Linda were very attentive and answered any questions someone may have had. I have stayed at many Airbnb homes and this one is exceptional!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had people from Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Pennsylvania and it was loved by all. The bed's were very comfortable and the extra's provided are too many to list. It was the perfect place for a group of Marines and their wives to reconnect. We had a couple 51 years together and one married less than 2 years. it provided privacy and numerous places for the group to gather. We made new friends and memories while reliving our younger days and sharing those memories we shared from long ago.
This house provides a well-stocked kitchen, exercise equipment, and even a grand piano. They were extremely responsive to any special request we had."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very special place for our family to gather for a celebration of life for our father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It was homey, but yet spacious enough to provide room for a small reception following the funeral. Leeland and Linda were responsive to requests and did everything to make us feel at home. It was the perfect oasis for our family at this time."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place with plenty of space with a beautiful back yard and great for families.Snack trays in each bedroom was nice touch...Thanks again
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and unexpected amenities such as a welcome tray in each room that felt very inviting. Response time was quick and friendly. This was a wonderful place to stay for our daughter’s wedding at The Legacy at Hatcher Farm and we really enjoyed it!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Place was spectacular, my guests and I had such a wonderful time. Plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms, the downstairs living space was very accommodating for the 10 of us."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our family’s third stay at this Airbnb. We absolutely love staying here when we are in town for family events.

We had great communication with the host and check in was seamless. The house is always spotless and festive. The welcome trays that were in each of the bedrooms always a brings a smile to our faces and just an over the top addition that everyone looks forward to. The home provides plenty of room for our family, this visit we hosted our Thanksgiving day dinner there and there were plenty of space for everyone to eat, sit and park. Were already, planning our next visit and look forward to becoming repeat customers. If you are thinking about renting this place, let me remove any hesitation you may have and tell you, to rent it, trust me, it will be one of the best travel decisions you will have made. I honestly can not speak highly enough for the effort the host and team puts forward, ensuring each of our stays, are filled with great memories."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We rented the entire house for my family to stay during my wedding weekend. My family said that the house was luxurious and welcoming and they really loved staying there. It was a great location and super close to the other airbnbs where our other family members were staying. We would love to rent again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home with very gracious host! I wish every Air BNB experience was like this one! The space, bedrooms, kitchen, patio, and decor were 10/10! I would 100% stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our entire family. Everyone enjoyed the space, from morning coffee on the patio watching the sunrise and nature to curling up in the home theater for a relaxing evening. The dinning room fit our group of 8 very comfortably with room for more. Each bedroom was clean and comfortable. We will be excited to book again next time we come to the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for the wonderful place to stay
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here for our friends to travel in to celebrate a birthday. The Oakdale Inn FAR EXCEEDED our expectations! This house is absolutely amazing and they have thought of everything. The smallest of details to make our stay even better. This local Airbnb is a gem for Martinsville city and I highly recommend for local and abroad patrons. Thank you for being a part of our celebration and assisting with creating wonderful memories with old and new friends.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed for 2 nights for my daughter’s wedding in Danville. She had 10 bridesmaids and we were able to have all of the girls stay together here. It was gorgeous, spacious and just the perfect place for our bridal weekend. Thank you so much! Wish we had more time to just relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Leeland was super responsive and flexible with our check in. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We always have a terrific time at the Oakdale Inn. It has everything you need for a stay in Martinsville for a medium to large sized group. Will definitely be staying again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The home was perfect for our needs and exceeded our expectations. We will definitely stay there again when in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can’t say enough about this place! It is absolutely amazing and so much more than any other airbnb we’ve stayed at in the past. The house is huge, has so much character, very well stocked with anything you could ever need and perfectly clean!. We loved the movie room, the library, the welcome baskets in each room and especially sitting on the back porch having our morning coffee. There is even museum in walking distance, which our kids loved! The only complaint is that we wished we would’ve stayed longer and had more time to enjoy this gorgeous house!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Hosts were amazing to work with and surprised us with local truffles and each bed had an assortment of snacks/goodies on it. The place is gorgeous and the hosts went above and beyond to accommodate our stay! Would absolutely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I stayed here with my family and we found it very comfortable. The home is beautiful and has nice amenities. The host was great and the check in/out process was very efficient.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is awesome! We loved the feel of the home! Beds are excellent and very comfortable to rest and sleep! Wish I knew the brand of the king mattress in the king suite. We were in town for a wedding with family and home was very accommodating for our group! Thanks to the Leeland’s for an awesome Airbnb in Martinsville VA.
We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our family came into town for two events, and needed a large home since there were 12 of us, and this beautiful home was perfect.
On arrival you will be impressed with the street view and landscaping, both were beautiful! The curved driveway could easily fit several cars, and the home is located on a very quiet street.
Simply put, the home is huge and was very clean, it provided us with lots of space to spread out and relax, both inside and out. There was an assortment of chocolates and snacks throughout the house and a very large welcome tray in each of the bedrooms, we felt pampered from the moment we opened the door.
The kitchen was stocked with every plate, glass, knife and appliance you could image. The prep station next to it was home to coffee and tea center, housing a variety of coffees and teas.

Our family truly enjoyed our stay, but what made it that more special to us, was the kindness and hospitality of the host and team, they truly were amazing! Thank you, again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This beautiful home was better than we expected. We lost a member of our family and this was the perfect home for family time and healing.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous weekend with a group of friends sharing this marvelous home for a music festival. This is our second year staying here. Well stocked kitchen, clean and well decorated home. Lots of space to spread out. Lovely gift baskets for each room. And we all agreed that the beds were heavenly. The host was helpful and flexible and we can’t wait to return next year. Love all the upgrades and improvements!!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This home is extraordinary for one person or a very large group. We had a wonderful time and my large group each had their own room and bathroom. This is the nicest experience I have ever had at an Airbnb. The hosts are wonderful and take great care of you.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was great to find a large enough house for the family to be together in Martinsville for the weekend. The house was spacious and beautifully furnished, yet very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks for the recommendation of Hamlet Kitchen for catering. Their food was excellent."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had 11 people in our party. The house is huge with plenty of space. The hosts left us many amenities. Speacial treats were left on each bed as a welcoming.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When you make a reservation for an Airbnb, sometimes the description and pictures can be misleading but that was not the case with this home. What you see is definitely what you get. We were in town for my son's wedding and we had at least 8 family members staying at the home with us. It accommodated us all. Wish we could have spent more time at the house. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I rented Leland’s place for my family to stay at over our wedding weekend. My family LOVED IT! It allowed us enough space to get away when we were tired but ultimately we camped out in the dinning room around the table. We shared stories, laughed, and prepared wedding collateral. All I can say is if you have a large group and you’re in martinsville it’s amazing. I’ve never stayed anywhere quite like it. Hats off hosts! You’ve got a diamond. I wish you many years of helping other’s experience something that you don’t get at an average airbnb."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for family get together! Room for all, and then some."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"great place, relaxing"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was the best one yet. Me and a group of staff stayed while traveling with our mobile dental office. This place provided everyone privacy and a place to come together when we wanted. The trays of snack and water were pretty much a life saver when getting in late from delayed flights. Kitchen is fully stocked with plenty of dishes and spices. Fridge hosted cold sodas and water. I will deff recommend this place to friends, family, and coworkers. Thanks"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Great spot!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"I had family in for the weekend and arranged for them to stay at The Oakdale Inn based on word of mouth reviews, the proximity of the house to walking trails and Piedmont Arts. Kobie was wonderful. He met me at the house for a walk through a week or so before family arrived and was able to provide much appreciated flexibility as to check in and check out times. My family was very happy with every aspect of the house."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, especially for a large group!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, and a great host. We have a young family and they did an amazing job giving local ideas along with alternative plans due to rain! We were very blessed staying there!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed in this lovely home with some friends and family over new years. The entire house was beautifully decorated for the holidays, and there were so many thoughtful touches in each of the rooms. The kitchen was fully stocked with plenty of spices and utensils. The hosts are incredibly responsive and accommodating. There are so many great spaces for people to gather, I can’t recommend staying here enough!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at this property. We thoroughly enjoyed the home and the lovely festive decorations. The host was friendly and tried to accommodate us when there was an issue with the house. We were satisfied with our stay and anticipate returning to the property later this year.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This home is great! We have a large family and we were able to be the most comfortable at this home! From the personal touches to the beautiful Christmas decor, we loved it! The custom vintage elements of this home are also hidden treasures! Everything we needed was there and we loved every moment! Can’t wait to return! Movie was great with planning and executing our weekend getaway! We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,You have to stay here!! I can't believe a place like this is on Air BnB. So spacious and beautifully decorated. There were even little gift baskets with great snacks on each bed. If you have the chance to stay here do it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful, sunny and spacious home full of gathering spaces both inside and out for family and friends. The bedrooms and bathrooms are large and well appointed. The kitchen is well provisioned for preparing meals. This is a fabulous rental!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was truly extraordinary. Our kids asked ""is this a mansion?"" more than once. It is enormous, and every bit of the space is beautifully decorated and built with a quality and care that I think would be hard to find in any new construction today. I think a high point might have been when I sat reading in the library while my wife and in-laws played the grand piano in the next room. The yard was also a lot of fun for the kids to walk around and play in, and everything was comfortable and welcoming. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially larger groups who need space to spread out."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful experience! Had our large family Thanksgiving dinner here and it was so perfect! Tons of space, kitchen had everything we needed including plenty of wine glasses, coffee cups and great variety of k-cups, every spice we could think of and plenty of all dishes. Bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding so luxurious feeling! The little touches like a welcome platter on each bed with all kinds of snacks, chocolates, bottled water, etc. just show how much care Kobie puts into making guests feel welcomed. We loved the outdoor seating spaces too including the fire pit & back yard/porch.
Several of us had many Airbnb experiences and this one was the BEST! I’ve been to properties with on-site hosts and didn’t love it BUT, having Kobie in the downstairs area was hardly even noticeable and he TOTALLY gave us our space. He was even nice enough to assist with a family photo but then we didn’t see him again but he was quick to answer messages if we needed anything. Can’t say enough about ow happy we were with this property and we really hope we can do again!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,I had a great time and my family really enjoyed it
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Had an excellent time here for our wedding weekend with the wedding party staying in the house as well. Worked perfectly for us and couldn’t have been happier with the house!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place for large gathering
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our team was in town working at the Martinsville Speedway and needed a place that was close to the track and could house 6 people. This was exactly what we needed. The house was lovely - classic, well kept and clean."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely perfect! The house is beautiful and the innkeeper is awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Will definitely be staying there again! Thank you so much!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This was one of the BEST Air B&B experiences ever. The hospitality made this stay above and beyond anything we have experienced. It was off the charts outstanding. I would easily compare this to a 5 star stay. The host responds to issues lighting fast, he anticipated our every need. Kitchen was well stocked, close to my home kitchen, it had everything we needed to cook a meal for 12. All the beds were super comfortable. I’m just trying to think at a reason to return to this wonderful home. We just loved it."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"What a lovely, lovely home! We felt very at home here. We had not seen each other for many years and this home brought us together again. We were so blessed to be able to spend this time all under one roof and not be separated by a stuffy hotel room. It had everything we needed right there to make us never want to leave. I hope we can spend time there again! It truly was the best week we had experienced in a long time. Everyone was so happy 😊 thank you!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The home was wonderful, exactly as described. I look forward to staying there again on our next visit."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house with lots of character! We were in town for a wedding. Unfortunately it rained on the wedding day and some of the pictures were planned to be outside, so the bride and groom saw the house and took a few photos there. Inside and around the property because it has beautiful landscaping. So the house is perfect for a big group with room to spare. We appreciated all/most of the rooms had their own bathroom and the large sitting area downstairs. Highly recommend checking this place out."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leeland was a fantastic host and his home was incredible. Would absolutely recommend staying here!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"I have stayed in many airbnb's during the pandemic and have loved several of them. But, the gracious touches at this home -- like snack trays in each room -- were incredibly unique and thoughtful. The house is spacious and beautifully decorated with plenty of indoor and outdoor space to relax and enjoy. Perfect place for a reunion of friends and family."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place in Martinsville! One of the best airbnb experiences I’ve had
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Easily one of the best airbnb experiences I’ve had
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful, clean, pretty, well-located home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was breathing. The communication with the owner was fast and friendly. We indeed intend to stay there again inthe near future. Everyone had room and there were even little treats in our rooms waiting for us. You have got to stay there; just not on the dates we want to go back.lol
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This house is AMAZING!!! It is clean, lots of space, and lots of charm. The host is very accommodating. We have stayed at this house once. This would have been our 2nd stay. When we return to Va, we will stay here again...if the house is available."
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"Our stay at 214 Oakdale was an enjoyable experience with my extended family and friends. The pictures used to describe the property accurately reflected the location. Even-though the home was large with a number of rooms, it felt cozy that allowed for privacy if one desired that. We enjoyed the many windows that provide good lighting during the day. The house was generally clean, yet some of the windows were dirty. The back porch was a favorite meeting spot for AM coffee or evening congregations. The kitchen was well supplied with dishes/utensils, plus a Keurig coffee maker was a bonus. We did have some challenges to find a comfortable setting for the A/C to balance between both floors. The humidity in the house was high that explains the number of humidifiers in the house. We could not get any of the TV’s to show or play programming since it required us to subscribe to a Roku account that we were uncomfortable doing. This was disappointing since the TVs in the bedrooms would have been nice to use. Overall we rated the stay a 4 of 5 and would likely stay again with minor adjustments."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Leeland's place was amazing. the house is emaculate with great attention to detail. it was exactly what we were looking for to meet with our family. thank you for everything.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Hands down the best airbnb I’ve experienced!! The backyard retreat is absolutely stunning and extremely thought out; it was actually AMAZING. Felt like you were in your own private retreat while still having stores and restaurants close by. Everything from the cleanliness of the home, the tasteful decor and thoughtfulness of the hosts, I could not be more satisfied with our stay! I will 110% be returning! BOOK THIS OASIS NOW you will not regret it! 5 stars is not a high enough rating for Frank and Alesia’s home! The pictures do not do this beautiful retreat justice! You can tell they put their own sweat and tears into making this an amazing experience and it was worth every penny we spent!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first air bnb and we had a blast! We are more than satisfied with franks home this place is heaven, the pool is amazing !!! It was honestly sad to leave and go home. There is no doubt we will back as much as we can. Very quiet very clean and so much fun."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, location and stay for our trip"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I grew up in the area and never knew something like this could exist in Martinsville. Frank was amazing and super responsive. 10/10..highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great getaway with fun amenities. The heated pool was our favorite.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful!! House was clean and had everything we needed to spend a lovely day,
We loved the pool! We will Definitely be back!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the pool. Very clean. Was stocked with the essentials, toilet paper, soap, body wash, shampoo, towels. And had other things like qtips and cotton balls. They had a Keurig and coffee pods provided. Lots of outdoor lighting. Lots of seating. The furniture inside was comfortable and clean. Everything you needed for a fun evening outside was provided."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay for my dog and I looking for some peace and quiet!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Frank's was an awesome spot and this is the 2nd time we went here. we will definitely be back

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our kids had a great time at the Oasis. The heated pool was great for playing even in cold and rainy weather. The accommodation was as described and Frank was easy to communicate with. Thanks for your lovely property.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"only a few words? there are NOT enough words to describe how awesome Frank's oasis is: from the basketball court, stocked kitchen, the salt water pools, gas grills, outdoor sitting and serene views, this place has a little bit of everything for EVERYONE! My absolute favorite part was the lovely framed photo of ""You are my Wonderwall"" and lyrics by Oasis. (be still my heart)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed here. Absolutely love this place and the people who own it. Always so clean, we always have everything we need and always responsive. The pool is a major plus . So warm in the cold weather and a perfect get away. Hands down best bang for your buck."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderfully comfortable. Plenty of space, everything needed for the stay was provided. Beautiful, relaxing pool area and very well maintained, and they welcomed my two dogs! Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent host and fun, unique spot! Thanks again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Frank's place was absolutely amazing. We stayed there to visit our grandchildren. The heated splash pad and pool made for a wonderful day with our grandchildren. Everything was very clean and organized. We had everything we needed and more. It was a beautiful private setting. Frank was wonderful to work with and very responsive. We will be booking again for our next visit.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great! Perfect place for us to stay while watching some college Softball.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would definitely recommend this space. It was especially nice to have a heated pool in the dead of winter. Hosts are very responsive and accomadating. House was very clean and tidy.
We had zero issues. Whenever we come back to visit family again, we plan to book with Frank and Alesia.
Thanks again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Frank’s oasis was amazing. One of the nicest AirBNB’s our family has stayed at. We loved the heated pool in the winter.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice overnight accommodations in a quiet neighborhood!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a favorite AirBnB for sure! Absolutely gorgeous inside and out. Very peaceful and quiet. They had everything we needed plus more.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very comfortable and was perfect from where we bought our new house
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Wanna visit again!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Oasis of the winter!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved it and would stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! We had fun, and felt right at home . The pool area was beautiful and the heated pool felt amazing!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Oasis guesthouse. It is decorated nicely and the furniture is comfy. The views from the back deck are gorgeous and there is a table and chairs on the deck making it great for enjoying a beverage. Although there is no true kitchen, there is a working microwave, coffee bar with Keurig, small fridge, kitchen sink with countertops, and a few dishes. My only complaint is that the only available plates aren't microwavable so we couldn't reheat leftovers. We chose to have the pool heated since we enjoy warm dips in cold weather. It was perfect for us even though its not hot tub temperature. Getting toasty in the water and then stepping out into the cold air felt sooooo good!For future travelers I will say that there are two levels to this guesthouse, and all sleeping quarters downstairs. Also, the gate that has to be opened to enter the exterior guest area is pretty heavy, so anyone with mobility issues should be aware of these two things about the property."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super friendly hosts! Excellent experience! Would stay there again for sure! Wonderful!
Terri and Will"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Frank’s place was lovely- a beautiful space to relax and decompress. Unfortunately, in order to know what you’re getting, you have to look at the fine lines. Amenities that are listed include a hot tub, kitchen, dryer, washer, hot water kettle…. All of these were either completely missing (washer and dryer) or checked but not as advertised. Frank has a beautiful heated pool with a splash pad- what is advertised on the listing as a hot tub. When getting the welcome manual, it clarifies that the splash pad “doubles” as a hot tub- when it is neither deep enough (maybe 10 inches in depth) nor hot enough to fit the definition. The kitchen consists of a microwave, toaster, and small fridge. Pots and pans are advertised- but no cooking appliance is present to be able to cook anything, aside from an outdoor grill, of which these pans would be useless. This would have been a 5-star review, if it were not for the feeling that we had been misled by the list of amenities that were advertised."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to the “Oasis” and have already booked our trip for next year. Frank is great to work with and very communicative. The neighborhood is quiet, the heated pool is amazing, and the outdoor covered patio is a great space to read, relax, take a nap or watch the chipmunks gather acorns for the winter."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Oasis was awesome. I really enjoyed the peacefulness. I had everything I needed for my stay, and the place was spotless. The process for checking in and out was easy. I would definitely recommend the Oasis for a nice restful stay. Thank you for a wonderful place to rest and relax."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at The Oasis! Everything was perfect! We hope to come back for another getaway in the future. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience! :) Whitney
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place has a ball with my boys cost for anything you do now in day money well spent
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for an overnight with my granddaughter before grandparents day at her school. Our stay was short but everything was lovely and all details and instructions were organized into an essay to understand guide.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place , host is friendly , responds quickly. Mosquitoes. Are definitely out there, I wish they could install a stove because of the time the Resturant’s closes.
Downstairs very stuff but a humidifier was supplied. Over very clean and quite.
The extra $40.00 for pool and $40.00 for hot tub to be heated was a bit much. Overall it’s was quite and peaceful stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came as a couples weekend getaway and really enjoyed our stay. Clean, private, and amazing outdoor space. We loved being able to travel with our dogs as well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"5 STARS!!! We truly had a magical stay at the Oasis of Martinsville! The pool was absolutely divine, with a waterfall, massage jets, and a splash pad. It was also very clean and, while in the back yard of the hosts' house, still felt very private. There are large trees throughout, which provided some shade, which was great for the dogs. Yet, the pool got lots of sunlight—we both came back with suntans!
The guest house was spotless and well-appointed. The decor was lovely, and the bed linens were high-quality. While the kitchen is more like a kitchenette, it worked totally well for us. The fridge (and freezer) is bigger than it looks, and we brought our own air fryer for baking.
It was so relaxing just being able to float around the gorgeous pool while our dogs frolicked in the fenced back yard. The hosts were friendly, communicative, and left clear instructions for us. We would 100% return and recommend the Oasis to others!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a quick day and a half at their property as a spur of the moment decision to enjoy a pool day. They have a beautiful, private property. Comfortable covered outdoor lounging area, great pool and splash pad, and completely fenced in which was great for our pooch. Enjoyed using the built in grill and beverages from the outdoor refrigerator. Definitely would return."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Well another welcoming peaceful Adventure for the YaYa sisters at the Oasis. Our 3rd time staying and always a quiet relaxing getaway . The pool always clean and relaxing with plenty of space around the pool to either sun bathe, grill out, relax and just lounge around and watch a movie meeting everyones
needs! Frank is always responsive for any questions and accomodating for any of your needs. Always an ""Excellent""stay!
Thanks Monaye and the YaYa Sisters💞"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy check-in and lovely accommodations. Frank is super responsive. This was the perfect stop for us on our road trip. The pool and basketball hoop provided the kids an opportunity to burn off some energy. And the beds were so comfy! Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second year visiting this place my Family and I we love it, peaceful, clean and private.!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Oasis was great! Perfect little get away that’s so close to a lot of things. The guest house was clean and well maintained, as well as the pool. We spent much more time in the pool that I ever thought and it was fantastic. The girls loved the lounging pool to tan in all afternoon. And the main pool has some shade so you weren’t cooking all day in the sun, but could still enjoy the water. Our stay was awesome and hopefully will be booking some time again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Oasis while visiting family in the area. We spent all day, every day in the pool, enjoying the patio and the comfortable outdoor setting. Although the backyard and pool are shared with the main house, it felt very private and we did not see or hear the hosts during our entire stay. We felt very welcomed and were able to relax quickly. Highly recommend this location for families and people who love to spend time in a pool."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Oasis was a wonderful place to stay! The guest house was extremely nice. It had everything we needed and was very clean. We also appreciated being able to bring our fur baby! We could tell the hosts put a lot of thought into making their place feel like home for their guests. We spent most of our time relaxing in the saltwater pool, which was amazing. It truly did feel like a private getaway. Whenever we reached out to Frank, he was very quick to respond. We enjoyed every minute of our time at the Oasis and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Martinsville!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved the weekend getaway with my 2 dogs. The pool and splash pad was so much fun! Had the entire backyard to ourselves and felt great

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a delight! This is definitely one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at! It was a little chilly outside at night, but the heated pool made it enjoyable to be outside at night. Frank and Alesia are very responsive and happy to help! Be aware that on some humid days the dehumidifier would occasionally come on and be noisy, but other than that it was fine. I can't wait for the next visit!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location for an overnight stay for our parents to visit. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Martinsville. The outdoor patio and pool were very refreshing.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town with our small kiddos to visit family. this was our first vacation since undergoing cancer treatments. we needed something fun for the kids but away from crowds. The outdoor space was amazing. Our kids were in the Salt water pool for hours. The fireplace was nice at night and we were even able to watch TV. the indoor space was beautifully decorated and every detail was thought of. The only thing I would change, is having a washer and dryer in the unit. The hosts were great as well. When in the area again, this will be where we will be staying!"

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing guesthouse and outdoor amenities! The heated pool in February was perfect after a long hike and horseback ride. It was a trip for my daughters 18th bday and she’s always complained about never being able to do a pool bday gathering. House was spacious and perfect for the 6 of us. Thank you for a memorable weekend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great host! Frank has worked hard to make his place a haven for his guests. Frank’s place was so beautiful and clean. It had a lovely wooded area out the back of the property that was so peaceful during our stay.

This truly is a lovely stay. You should not miss this home away from home. Thanks so much Frank! We will be back!"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,👌
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were lucky and found Frank's place for my fiance birthday weekend. Pictures don't do it justice. It has everything you need for a get away. Saturday morning we got to see six does running and eating off the back deck. The hot splash pad and pool are amazing. Definitely a little piece of heaven in Martinsville. We will definitely stay here again when we need to get away. Frank ensures you have everything you need there..
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was just perfect. Everything was as we expected. Super Clean.
Just perfect"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I needed a place to stay with my dog who can be quite reactive to things he sees. Frank assured me the Oasis was private and we wouldn't see anyone. The area was completely fenced in and the pool was absolutely beautiful and So Warm in the cold air. From the Resort like pool area to the rear deck with woodsy views, it was like being in two places at the same time. Don't hesitate to book your stay here you won't be disappointed!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. The heated pool in the winter was my favorite part. The pictures online were great, but it was even better in person.
Highly recommend staying here. The cost was so low for all the amenities. I thought it was such a bargain. Really was a little perfect oasis!! Enjoyed my very relaxing stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The guest house was so cute and perfect for a weekend getaway. It was so clean, like exactly shown in pictures. Would highly recommend this."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Oasis was a wonderful place to stay. Enjoyed exploring places around the area and coming back to relax by the pool, grill, and enjoy the peace and quiet. The host did an outstanding job making this place home away from home. Very quick to respond when there were questions or any trouble. Would definitely recommend if looking for a get away with a significant other. Thank you guys again for the hospitality!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the Oasis! We only stayed one night and the kids were disappointed that we weren’t staying longer. Great place! Plenty of towels and washcloths and more than you could need for your stay. Highly recommend! We had a wonderful heated swim before bed.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place made our trip super fun! We enjoyed our stay here. This is definitely one of the best AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed. The hot pool is perfect even if it’s cold outside. They thought through every detail from checkin instructions to the amenities and home furnishing. This place is indeed an Oasis near the Blue Ridge mountains. Frank is very responsive as well and a great host. 5 stars!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay so much! From the heated pool to grilling, our dog having so much freedom to playing ball with one another. The TV outside on the patio helped as well. Loved that I asked for things to be in place prior to arriving and they were presented!! Thank you so much for making this worthwhile. I said out loud a couple times “I could live here!” We hope to be back again & we will. Thanks so much to Frankie & Alesia!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The name says it all, an Oasis indeed. Frank and Alesia provide an amazing setting to relax and unwind. The neighborhood is quiet and definitely safe. We didn’t bring our suits, even though we knew the pool was heated, and realized that was a regrettable decision the second we dipped our toes in the 97 degree water. Thankfully Frank pointed us to places to get swimsuits and we were able to enjoy the pool the entire weekend. He and Alesia are super-responsive and answered all of our questions quickly. We liked it so much, we booked another visit before we had even left."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was absolutely amazing!! Franks level of communication was beyond amazing!! The home was exactly as pictured an described an even more amazing in person!! Even my mom said she will return again by herself just to get away!! No matter what issue we did have, Frank an his lovely wife made sure that everything was resolved in a matter of mins, ie: toilet paper, towels, etc. Trust me, you definitely will NOT be disappointed staying here, because we sure weren’t!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a little slice of heaven. The location is beautiful, the neighborhood is so pretty and safe, the rental and the grounds are clean and lovely. The bed we slept in was very comfortable and we slept soundly. The space was perfect for my husband, myself and our Golden Retriever. There was another queen bed and a twin bed that were in the bedroom downstairs. We enjoyed the gorgeous pool and the relaxing deck. The rental was equipped with everything we needed. WE drove about an hour to the Blue Ridge Parkway to explore some of it. We explored a little around the area and just relaxed and swam quite a bit for a long weekend. This is one of my favorite Airbnb or VRBO rentals, I would love to return, and I highly recommend it. 5 stars, for sure."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Oasis was exactly as described and we had a wonderful time. The pool is definitely the centerpiece of this property. We enjoyed the comfy furnishings inside and the hosts have thought of every detail. We would love to stay again.

Could not have asked for a better stay with Frank and Alesia being the ""Best"" Hosts!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oasis in Martinsville, VA is spectacular. I always think that things look better in the pictures than in real life. The Oasis is one of those few places that actually is way better in person. The pool and background setting is simply amazing. You can tell that Frank is conscious of every detail whether it is small or large to make sure his guests have a great stay. Also, the area is very nice and very safe. I highly recommend the Oasis of Martinsville."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Comfortable, Relaxing, and FUN"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is amazing, every detail, the comfort, privacy. You don't need to carry with a lot of stuff because the place has everything, I went with my dog and was great, full fence (off leash). I definitely will use it again, I'm in love of these place!!🥰"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely home and pool! We can't wait to visit again. Frank was very helpful and answered all of my questions thoroughly and quickly.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oasis was just as advertised…an oasis. From the beautiful pool and surrounding wooden fence, to the beautifully decorated guest house, The Oasis did not disappoint. The neighborhood is quiet and gorgeous with tons of older trees which really added to the secluded feel of The Oasis. We loved spending time in the pool which we chose not to heat since the weather was already pretty warm. Unfortunately, there was lots of rain during our stay but we didn’t mind too much as the guest house provided a comfortable hang out spot. And while there was lots of rain, there was plenty of breaks in the weather that allowed us to enjoy the pool. We even went out for a couple of evening swims. We had the fortunate experience to see a family of deer, through the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck, as we enjoyed breakfast. We are looking forward to another stay at The Oasis."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the accommodations. The setup is the absolute cutest. Very nice, clean and neat. I literally enjoyed every minute of my time. I hope to revisit soon. The pool was nice, warm and comforting. I can’t wait to return in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was immaculate. The small details and extra amenities made our girls’ trip so much fun. The hosts were extremely responsive and helpful - they helped us identify a great winery to stop at on our drive in and offered other helpful suggestions. We enjoyed plenty of privacy in the pool and backyard area. Can’t recommend this place enough! We will be back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"as our first Airbnb trip, and our honeymoon the oasis was the best stay! not too far from some awesome recommendations! thank you again for lending us this beautiful space!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was an AMAZING place! Perfect location, excellent accommodations, pool was perfect and Frank was VERY attentive to our every request. The guest house was well stocked, nicely decorated and very clean. The outdoor space was very comfortable and even though it rained while we were there, it was covered and we could hang out and watch the outdoor TV. I would recommend the Oasis to anyone looking to have some fun in Martinsville, VA!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was hands down the best Airbnb I’ve stay at. We had a bachelorette party at the oasis and it was absolutely perfect! Frank was fantastic to work with and the place was beyond amazing! Highly recommend!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great family vacation at the Oasis!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don’t hesitate, just book! The Oasis is exactly that—many conveniences and a gorgeous outdoor space to call your own during the stay. Absolutely loved it and would go back in a heartbeat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"“Wow” is the main word that comes to mind when writing this. From the get go, Frank and Alesia were fantastic with communication; they were willing to answer any questions we had, and their responses came almost immediately. They provided a very in-depth guide that was useful and appreciated. They were such terrific hosts! The Oasis was truly that- an oasis. While the pictures were accurate, they didn’t do the Airbnb justice. The guest house was just the right size and had everything we needed, including plenty of pool towels. It was quite cozy yet had all the modern conveniences; we loved the huge amount of tv apps to choose from. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and we all slept like babies. The views out back were gorgeous, and the location was easy to find and was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is within quick access to restaurants, stores, etc. We appreciated the lighting and security; we felt safe inside and outside of the guest house while on the property. We were also grateful for the large numbers/locations of outlets to charge devices. The pool was our favorite feature and where we spent the most time. We loved that it can be heated, and it is very pleasing aesthetically. Thank you for such a wonderful time! We look forward to visiting again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the pool and the super cozy guest house! The local area does not have much to offer at all but we would definitely come back just for the pool!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and nice the host is very considerate and nice I enjoyed my stay here!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love, love, love this place! Everything was set up so beautifully! I can't wait to stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A home away from home! The details in this place are amazing the things they have thought of to make your stay feel just like home! We slept like Kings and Queen's!!! This is one of our favroite places and we will be back again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hosts are super accommodating! House is Martinsville's best kept secret!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed at this oasis. The outside is truly the highlight and will provide everything that you will need. Sun and shade, fire and water, and even an outdoor television and grill. Lots of indoor and outdoor living. As noted, it's a small efficiency kitchen, but what is there is well equipped. Single bathroom, also well stocked, located upstairs. Everything was very clean. Neighborhood is quiet and easy to find."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,So much fun!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place ! Our absolute favorite ! Best host and location and place is outstanding ! Love this mini vacation stop in our hometown! We keep coming back and can't wait to go again really soon.

5 STAR Review
We can not thank you enough for our getaway this weekend which was fantastic. The Ya Ya sisters had such a great time away which was much needed for all of us Nurses. Your home was beautiful and all of the accomodations and amentities were spot on and excellent. The pool was perfect and warm for the coolness of the day and evening. The outside sitting area by the pool had everthing that you could possibly need to relax and enjoy the day and evening with the fireplace, TV, wine cooler and grill. We appreciated your hospitality in checking in with us as well, making sure we didnt need anything and always making sure we had enough towels and that we were having a good time!
Great getaway for families, friends and couples for sure.
Thanks again Ms. M Palmer😊"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Oasis is truly that - an Oasis. The pool, the house, the beds, the decor. This place is TOP NOTCH! We stayed here for one night for my sisters bachelorette party and we had THE BEST TIME! The weather wasn’t great. It was drizzly and chilly but we spent the entire duration of our stay in the pool. It was the best temperature. We lit the fire place and just chilled. You won’t regret renting this place. The hosts were so great at communicating and accommodating any need we had. We will definitely stay again!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oasis is the perfect name for this home. Hurry and book. You will not disappointed. The home was extremely clean. The hosts provided many amenities that makes the place really feel like a home away from home. They were also extremely respectful of our privacy and so accommodating. The Oasis of Martinsville will not be a one-time visit for sure.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The guest house was very tidy and smelled great! We had a great time in the pool, great for the kids, tv outside for our littlest one turned out to be a plus. Table to eat outside, heated pool. It was all great"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An adorable escape for a couple or family with young ones too. The heated pool was perfect this visit! Would have loved to share the fun with our family!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was beyond what we can think of as available at one single Airbnb. It was like the greatest parts of all the resorts and Airbnbs we have ever been to across the world in the last 15 yrs. Whoever did the decorating made the place look fabulous. The guidebook was very nice and great to have electronic version. I didn’t meet Frank, but he was a very attentive host. We enjoyed the warm pool and I think our hosts even set out bug spray for us while we were out at dinner in anticipation of us possibly using the outdoor area in the evening.
We were very grateful that this family has chosen to host guests and share their incredible oasis with travelers.
Thanks again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic stay! I have to point out the bedrooms are downstairs from the bathroom and living space for little children or handicap to consider. This is mentioned and we did fine but a consideration. Everything was sparkling clean! The kitchenette worked fine for us as I brought microwavable foods and we cooked burgers on the grill, had sandwiches and such. The owners guide includes suggested local restaurants as well but we didn't have a need to leave with everything provided. There are too many amenities to name! If you forget shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc... It was there. The owners made sure the temperature for the home and the pool was adjusted to our comfort upon arrival. The fenced in private yard truly felt like our own oasis! I thought it would feel weird being in someone's back yard but it did not as the owners made sure you felt like you were in a private space. They were also very responsive when we messaged with a question. In all my only regret was the traffic and time that made us arrive late. We truly wished we had more time there to enjoy our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed this airbnb! Beautiful decor, fabulous outdoor experience and wonderful nature views - the deer were a bonus! Oasis lived up to its name!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little local gem is truly a rare find. Described perfectly, very clean, accessible host, smelled amazing, well stocked, super comfortable, and truly feels like a getaway. I have stayed in other Airbnb's and I must say this one tops the list so far. Every detail was thought of and the pool/jacuzzi was the cherry on top. Will definitely stay again!!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great weekend getaway! The hosts have obviously put a lot of thought behind the whole set up. I would definitely recommend coming to visit!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"there's plenty of stores near by, grilling is a great option as there is no stove. Also, there are several laundry mats near by as well."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The Oasis is perfectly named! We enjoyed every aspect of the airbnb. The pool and fire pit area were so fun and cozy. The beds were super comfy! Everything was where you would expect it to be and easy to get to. The back deck overlooks a gorgeous wooded area. We even saw deer in the morning. It was everything we expected and more! The hosts are super nice and available for any questions you may have. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb. This place has everything you need!. Great for a family with kids. Or alone time with your partner.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best experience had with any hotel or Airbnb frank was so helpful and responded constantly to my every question and need ! The heated pool fire pit and grill were awesome !! The home itself was amazing very clean and so cozy If you are looking for a vacation or just a getaway in Virginia please book the oasis of martinsville you will not be disappointed
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay will definitely come back.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,this was a very nice place! we loved it!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and cozy. Soft towels and wash cloths. Nice decor! Highly recommend.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars all around! Host had great communication. We really enjoyed the heated pool. Nice property, felt private and secluded. Comfy beds. Nice attention to detail!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great stay! The house was super clean and smelled amazing! The decor was beautiful and the couches and beds were very comfortable. I also really appreciated the attention to small details that Frank and his wife put into the Airbnb like providing bath supplies incase their guest forgot soaps or toothpaste. I also really appreciated that they provided travel contact cleaner w/ case kits for guests who have forgotten that stuff. Although I didn’t need it this trip, I have been in the predicament where I forgot to pack it and don’t realize it until I’m getting ready for bed. Frank was an awesome host who had the pool heated up and ready for us when we got there and was quick to respond/help out when we thought we locked ourselves in the pool area. Overall an amazing experience, would recommend it to anyone who is considering, and would love to come back 😊"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, and comfortable! Soft towels and pillows. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is better in person than it is in pictures! My family had a great visit, and will always check availability when in the area!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Super clean space in a cozy setting! Excellent communication by hosts. The only disappointment was the pool water was too cool for us but the weather had been very cold. However, the hosts did their best to have it ready under the extreme circumstances.
We will definitely consider a return trip when the water is hot!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was really nice, clean and have a lot of accommodations. The only thing is that they don’t have stove and in my case that is very important but besides that everything was amazing!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"I had a great time, however, I recommended they update their page because the projector is broken. It's winter so I thought it would be cool to watch movies in the heated pool. They recommended I turn on a movie in the outdoor lounge area, but the TV doesn't face the pool so I'd have to sit in the cold lol... I recommend others have a car but it wasn't an issue at all for me because there's little stores nearby and I stayed at the house most of the time... The heated pool itself was perfect! I was bummed the projector was broken and I wasn't given instructions on how to turn on the outdoor fireplace... Other than that, the guesthouse was clean!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect! The place was super clean and frank was very accommodating and responsive to messages, making sure we had everything we needed. Thanks again!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,This place is wonderful for a little getaway. It matches the pictures/ description really well and still surpassed our expectations. Hosts are very responsive and helpful too. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The guesthouse and the Oasis are simply amazing. They seem to have thought of every detail. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the house. When we arrived, the pool was heated and the kids immediately jumped in - so fun to be able to do in December! We enjoyed the pool and then the outdoor fire/lounging area. Everything is well stocked and they provided so much information about the property and the area. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. We had to leave early unexpectedly and Frank was very understanding and gracious. Then to top it off, we left something behind and he offered to deliver it or mail it back to us. The kindness was much appreciated. We hope to return again soon!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for the Christmas holiday and it was exactly what we pictured as a quiet and relaxed recharging time. The heated pool and the grill is amazing, and I also enjoyed hoopping at the backyard. TV and WiFi are great for watching Christmas sports event and movies. Frank is a very considerate host. He helped us turn on the heater for the pool before we arrived and hence we could have enjoyed the short afternoon asap. Definitely would recommend to big families."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s called an oasis and that’s exactly what it is. From the moment you arrive they make you feel at ease. Communication is great, house is cozy and clean. Pool is unbelievable! Even in the cold winter weather we enjoyed a nice warm dip every day! Beautiful location and scenery! Great hiking at Smith mountain lake."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oasis of Martinsville! The name says it all…. From the minute you walk into the gate you are truly in an Oasis that’s all yours! Our stay here was phenomenal! The pool and outside area are fantastic and so relaxing, even on cool fall days we were able to enjoy the heated saltwater pool until late at night. The lights around the patio and pool area give it an added touch of relaxation and fun. The inside of the Oasis is also amazing, the host have thought of everything and it’s so clean and has a comfy right at home feel to it. It’s a super cozy area and we couldn’t have asked for more. This place is very private and it really feels like your own little slice of heaven! Communication with Frank was super easy and he answered every question in a timely fashion and helped out with everything we needed. Frank even went out early in the morning to make sure the pool was being heated so when we were ready to swim it was ready and warm for us, I was unsure about turning on the gas fireplace so Frank took care of that as well for us. They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need while staying here! Frank and Alesia are spectacular host and have done an incredible job with their Oasis! While your staying there it feels like it’s your own private spot to relax and hang out with family and friends. My chocolate lab Jeter also loved it! He enjoyed running around outside and even taking a dip in the pool as well! For me the fact they welcome pets here makes it even more perfect. If 10 stars were possible on Airbnb Frank and Alesia and the Oasis would earn every single one… this place is awesome as are the host! We can’t wait to go back again and spend more time here! So happy they shared their Oasis with us!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous time. The owners were spot on with communication. Every question was answered right away through the Airbnb site. We felt this was our very own getaway. Our Greyhound loved it as well. Just walking minutes to the lake. The trail was such a wonderful way to see the fall foliage. The trail went completely around the lake. A fantastic 2 mile walk. Oasis is the perfect name for this immaculate gem. Our weather had a low temperature of 28, unusually cold in the morning in Virginia, so the outside has fireplace was a perfect way to enjoy the outdoors. A week earlier we would have been able to use the beautiful heated pool. But with the lights around the pool and the waterfall it was very tranquil despite the cold. Thank you. We would highly recommend this venue. The owners were amazing. So many little unexpected accommodations. We would love to return in the spring or summer. Thank you."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Oasis is absolutely stunning. Very clean. Frank and Alesia pay close attention to detail, and make sure their guests have everything they need. The saltwater pool was amazing as were our hosts. I highly recommend the Oasis."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I found Joe and Maggie's place while we were looking for a place to stay near Martinsville/Bassett, Virginia sowe could do some trout fishing on the Smith River. Their rental does not disappoint! Much better than staying at a hotel that costs 2-3 times as much.
Just as advertised... lovely 2BR/1B that is new and fresh all around. Very well stocked with everything you need for a short or a lengthy stay. The location is in a nice residential neighborhood, but the neighbors are not right on top of one another. It's quiet, but in close proximityto anything you need... food, shops, speedway, fishing, hunting... very convenient location.
The hosts, Joe and Maggie, were top shelf! Great communication and very accommodating.
All in all... 5 Stars+++. Will definitely stay here again!"

Plenty of towels in the bathroom, plus extra blankets/pillows if needed. Whole place was very clean. Happened to meet Maggie and Joseph, who are very nice and friendly.

He usually is on his back deck when I get off work and he greets us as we pull in. Living out of my suitcase, I really appreciate having a washer and dryer to get some laundry done before I head home. This is probably the best stay in Martinsville for a consultant. Thank you Joseph! See you soon."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joseph’s place was perfect for my self and my business partner. We were in town working in a local factory and we had to do some work at night.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for our family of 5. We felt at home and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was very nice.

The following does not reflect on Derrick in any way, but it’s important to know that there are virtually NO Ubers, Lyfts or cabs in Martinsville, so if you are visiting and can rent a car, do that!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Derrick’s place is a great choice when you are staying in Martinsville. My husband & I have stayed there several times now & will stay again when we are in the area. It’s centrally located with a great coffee shop across the street. The unit is always spotless.

We hope to be back on future visits."

We took it to-go and ate lunch in our airbnb and enjoyed the lovely views of Uptown. I worked remotely while enjoying all the natural light in the main living space. My partner found some neat hiking spots nearby. It was nice to have a comfortable, safe, and unique space to come home to each night. Thank you, Derrick! We will certainly be back to visit again."

I truly enjoyed my stay and this will definitely be my first choice for this area on future ventures."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"On our trip from Florida to see family and friends up North, it was great to arrive at such a wonderful place at our mid-way point.
The main room, the bathroom, and especially the shower were extremally spacious. The shower has 3 shower heads and enough pressure to sooth those aching muscles after a long day of driving.

I spend 150+ days a year on the road in hotels and Airbnbs, this is by far one of the nicest places I have stayed. Elizabeth, thank you for sharing your extra space it was perfect for me. I will be back."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After knowing the hotels in the area, I decided to check here for listing. Elizabeth's place I thought was reasonably priced and fair. Once inside, I was amazed and delighted. Glad I found and reserved it. It took myself a minute to figure out entrance into the driveway, as I arrived after dark and the lights outside were not on. Host responded immediately and coached me right to where I needed to be. Place is beautifully decorated and well equipped. I would recommend to anyone. I would have extended longer if it had been available. Hope everyone else enjoys it as I have. 👍"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was quick to respond to my questions and the instructions provided was helpful to find the place. It was so kind of her to offer an extended check out time! I appreciated that kind gesture to ask. I chose her place to celebrate my partners birthday!
This is definitely a 5 star bnb! I like the option to be able to park my car in the garage. This place is spectacular. The shower and king bed was my favorite! The shower is huge and has a fancy option to use 2 shower heads at the same time! It was truly like a spa experience. I slept amazing with the comfy bed! This place is decorated with elegance, no clutter and it’s spacious!
Everything was perfect about this stay. We felt like we were royalty staying here! No joke haha but it was listed at such a great price! Thank you for not charging a cleaning fee and allowing to have pets (even though we didn’t bring ours). I wish I could of stayed longer. I look forward to visiting again!

This is a perfect home away from home for extended stays. It’s cozy, updated and just feels like home. The only thing that’s missing is a kitchen but other then that I couldn’t be any happier here. It has its own private driveway so there’s plenty of parking. There’s even a garage and room for my utility trailer. It’s reasonably priced and beats staying in any of the hotels in the area."

2022-11-01,3,Stayed with a pet,There was only one roll of toilet paper. We had to go out late at night to buy some. Keurig was filthy. She needs to be more clear that it is one room not a separate living space. Not good for 3 adults.

Positives: Comfortable beds, bathroom water pressure good. Friendly neighbors.
Not sure who dropped all of the balls here and I do hope they can get it right but no, I do not recommend, and I am baffled nor by all of the positive reviews for this one. I feel misled and made my choice on them. Not a good weekend hosting my family for her birthday and first trip to the Ville😞

The rooms only have two prongs, it maybe a little challenging for some electric devices that have 3 prongs but I was able to connect the devise in the kitchen with no issues. There is no iron but the host has a steamer that worked just as well. The TV has an option for you to sign into your Netflix, Hulu and Prime. YouTube was available.

She checked to see when we would check in because there had been a cold front that messed with the heat. She plugged in heaters to get the home warm for us . She communicated constantly and quickly. The photos really don’t do justice to the home. Really homey and did not feel like I was staying at an Airbnb but instead at home! I will be returning.

The house was clean, accommodating, comfortable, and just the amount of space me and my boys needed while we were visiting family. The bathroom is modern and the decor is inviting. She has kitchen tools and seasonings and the coffee bar is a great touch. I learned that my son likes playing the piano (organ). We come here every year for a family Christmas dinner and I will for sure be booking again with Lauren. This was a great stay : great price, great house; perfect value !!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"My husband, daughter and I, along with my sister and her husband, had to rush into town unexpectedly as we had a death in the family. There aren’t many hotels (nice ones anyway) in the area and honestly we paid the same price for this cute house that we would have paid for a small hotel room plus we got to stay together. Lauren was so amazing and friendly, sending her condolences and even asking after our checkout if there was anything she could do. If we are in town again, I’d love to stay here.

Josh and Morgan were absolutely amazing hosts! They allowed us very flexible check in and checkout in order to spend more time with my father in law.

2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The place was tidy and cozy, and the bed was comfortable. However, there were a lot of small things that were missing or off.
The bathroom: no floor mat when you get out of the shower. There is also no curtain on the bathroom window which made my wife a little concerned.
The Kitchen: There was no ice in the freezer part of the refrigerator – only a filthy, empty ice tray. Also, the instructions asked that you wash your dishes but they do not offer a sponge or tool to do so. You are also asked to sign the Guest Book – but there was none.
Coffee – They offer K-cups but do not have sugar or any type of creamer option.
We were in the area for a funeral. That meant that I brought hanging garments. There is no place to hang clothes except on the towel holders in the bathroom.
Air conditioner was difficult to operate. Batteries may have been dying."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Blue Door was super cute and a great respite for my travels cross country. It was very well appointed and you had everything in more that you might need. I was just disappointed I was only there for one night.
They were very responsive and helpful. It was super easy to check in and it was great to have a spot to park.
The decor was on point and the space was very comfortable.
Thanks to Morgan and Josh..."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a cute place over top of a garage and perfect for a single person or couple. Kitchen is nice with a stove and all the provided cookware.

Very quiet and backs up to a wooded area but very lit up outside with sensor light and porch light for your coming and goings. Definitely will use this place again when visiting Martinsville/Collinsville.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The GPS may end you up in a few different private driveways so look for a brick house with deep full front porch. The driveway is shared with a house on the right. The guest house in at the back of the driveway with parking directly in front of the guest house which is very convenient. The space is set up well, very cute inside, and extremely clean. There is a Keurig but bring cream and sugar if you take it with your coffee. The fridge was well stocked with water"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Blue Door is a cozy, immaculate and well done space. I was Josh and Morgan's first guest and they knocked it out of the park! Such thoughtful and attentive hosts.
With downtown being walkable (under 20 minutes) and the beautiful wooded area out back, you get the perfect mix of accessibility and peace and quiet. I'd absolutely stay here again :)"
