The secret rooms were pretty neat a well. One of us actually slept under the stairs! LOL.. The garage was just as fun, with a game of pool.
One of the most thought up places ever. Was hard to leave the house that evening after check in.
The host Elizabeth was amazing! She answered every message, even though I was probably a pain. And she was super polite and welcoming.
I will definitely look to stay there again next year. Oh, we even spent some time out back relaxing! Great time all together!"

Would definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking to spend a few days in Springfield, IL."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a marvelous stay!! We loved it that all 3 of our families could stay at one place.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was a perfect home to host our weekend! The house itself is beautiful, with a TON of great amenities! There was plenty of space for our entire group to feel comfortable and have privacy.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This is a diamond in the rough for Springfield, Illinois. It ended up being a retreat for our family of five. The highlights were that my son got the high score on Pac-Man, I won our family pool tournament and we watched five movies on the big screen! Elizabeth shines her light, not only through the rental, but through her communication and love of being the host. Her husband also helped get my daughter going on the ski ball. We are so grateful to God for a time in this rental."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay. Kids had a blast. Refrigerator needs cleaned out. Concerned about the hot tub. Seemed too cloudy and two of the three kids broke out in a rash.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this location to host my female relatives and (future) female in laws so they could finally meet and help me pick my wedding dress! The space was large enough for everyone to sleep comfortably (and the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable), get to know each other, and relax. It was absolutely perfect! Elizabeth was extremely responsive and helpful during our stay (nothing went wrong, but a package was delivered). My only suggestion is to add a rug at the bottom of the stairs on the main floor - the last step blends in with the main floor and more than one of us missed the last step multiple times lol."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing home! I wish I could have stayed longer. Very clean, lots to do with games, hot tub, and theater. Very pleased! Loved the host's responsiveness and communication."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was a very nice place in a great neighborhood. Several things to do as a group at the house and the hot tub was a definite bonus. The only thing I would add is to have more linens for the guests that did not have a bed but if I would of asked, I am sure Elizabeth would have helped. I would recommend this to others and stay here again for sure."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Abe’s Hideaway felt like staying in a home away from home. Immediately upon walking in, we were delighted with how welcoming, comfortable, and tastefully decorated each room of the home was. We had everything we needed and more.
Elizabeth was so gracious and responsive.
We definitely plan to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Abe’s Hideaway did not disappoint, and Elizabeth was such a gracious host! The house was absolutely perfect for our gathering, nestled among quiet and peaceful surroundings!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family loved staying here! It is SO FUN and incredibly thoughtful in the ways things are prepared and set up. The beds are very comfortable and you will never be bored. Packing your own beach towels wouldn't be a bad idea if you plan on using the hot tub a lot but there are bath towels available. Truly a great space to gather!

The house was perfect- everything was as pictured, everything was cleaned, amenities were 10/10, and the host was responsive- always within minutes. The house is in a beautiful neighborhood, you’d never guess the insanity of the inside by the outside of the house! Check in was easy with a keypad lock which is so convenient. 10/10 would recommend, you won’t regret it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked Abe's Hideaway as a Christmas gift for our young kids. They loved it! They were so excited to get to go to an arcade they could play as long as they wanted, and were just as excited to each have their own little light in their bunk. Thanks for the nice, relaxing getaway!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a family get together.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is amazing!! We live in Springfield but 2 years ago decided to downsize for retirement. We rented this home for our family Christmas. It lacked NOTHING!!
It is so lovely and spotless!! There is so much space and so much to entertain every age!!
I have little grandkids and teenage grandkids. It was perfect for all ages!!
The arcade room was such a hit and the hideaway places for the little kids to crawl through and explore. I can’t forget the theater room!!!
We were so sad we only had one night. But we will book early for next year and make this a new family tradition!!
What Elizabeth and her family have here in this home is rare!! We travel a lot and have stayed in many Airbnb’s this one is on our list of the favorites!!! It’s even in our home town!!
You will not regret staying here!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for our girlfriend’s gathering!! We each had our own beautiful bedroom and the house was so warm and welcoming. Our hosts left us a beautiful gift to welcome us and were responsive to all our questions. As we shared memories and made new ones our entire group was so thankful for our peaceful surroundings. I would highly recommend this home to others
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were very impressed with our stay at Abe's Hideaway. The place was easy to find and access. Very comfortable space to stay, everything was spotless. So many fun things to do here! Elizabeth was a great host. Very responsive and proactive. When we couldn't figure out how to work the hot tub she sent her husband over to help us out. We would highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are really happy we opted for this home instead of a hotel.
The home is as described and the hosts are great. The kids had an amazing time and we will definitely be back when we come into.
I’d recommend this to any group with kids. There’s plenty for them to do, and there’s plenty of space for the adults as well.
Great Airbnb. As hosts ourselves, we even learned different ideas for our properties! Do not hesitate to rent this place even if it’s still a “young” listing. It’s well worth the rate!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was so beautiful and in a really nice neighborhood. There were lots of neighbors out walking their dogs when I arrived after dark.
The accommodations were just as described and I loved that there were 2 rooms with King beds to choose from. The sheets, bedspread, and pillows were luxurious and I also loved the noise machine supplied in the primary bedroom!
It was very clean and new. There were TVs in every room and lots of extra pillows, towels, blankets, etc.
The kitchen had everything I needed and the living space was super comfy. We used the gas fireplace as much as possible because it made the living room so cozy.
It's a big house! There are even tunnels for the kids and a really fun theater room and game room in the basement. Perfect for the whole family!
I would 100% stay here again! I didn't get to use the hot tub so we have to come back."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Just wow! From having a very responsive and helpful host, and all of the fun activities this place offers once the day out is done is amazing. my friends and I had an incredible time here! Far away enough from the city but close enough for all of the sites that we wanted to see! If I need a place in Springfield again I will most definitely be coming back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really good experience and enjoyed the town of Lincoln
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall I liked it. ... comfortable. Bathroom was spotless. it REALLY needs curtains in the bedroom - at least - personally I couldn't sleep past about 6 am due to the sun coming in through the gaps in the blinds. The dogs barking and howling below or next door didn't help me work during the day and evening either. There was food left in the microwave as well...
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a quiet getaway. Apartment was nicely decorated and had a cozy vibe
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very historical!!!
Very cool
She’s super nice and knows how to decorate everything in the air bnb was very unique !!!!!
I would recommend 10/10 !!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming vibe. Great king size bed. Wonderful view of historic courthouse. Near fun shops and coffee house. Right off Rt. 66.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Loved the decor of the air b n b. The bed was comfy, shower great, and cute local downtown. However being as we were embarking on a long road trip we weren’t prepared for the loud bar noise, car with loud muffler zooming up and down the street at 1:00 am, the building light that shined right in the bedroom, or the fast moving train that seemed to pass by often. It was too stimulating to sleep 🛌. That was the only reason I didn’t give this a 5 plus star review! Would have been great for a gals night on the town or a date night! Just didn’t get the restorative sleep we were hoping for."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful place to stay! It was very clean and comfortable.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely a beautiful place to stay. I would definitely stay again. It was in a great location and very well equipped with everything that we needed for our visit. Definitely a five star. Thank you and have a great day.

It was perfect for the weekend, clean, had everything we needed, loved the decor and vintage vibe with a touch of modernism. It's always so wonderful to see older buildings be renovated and used in Lincoln. The building has lots of charm and history. We had a wonderful stay with my classmates staying in the lofts below us making this a memorable weekend stay!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Megan’s Lincoln’s Loft, specifically the Pearl suite, is a great play to stay and unwind. It is close to several unique stores and restaurants in a cool downtown. Everything was as advertised and the suite fit nicely into the historic building."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming 3-bedroom home that felt newly renovated. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in a peaceful neighborhood.
Very clean, tidy and uncluttered. My two friends from high school and I chose this lodging for our annual ""Girls' Weekend"" and it did not disappoint. House smelled fresh and clean the day we checked in and every time we came back from being out exploring the area. We enjoyed the location right off historic Route 66 and took the opportunity to drive up to Atlanta to visit shops (such as a quirky and fun place called Midway 154) and the new American Giants Museum. Living room with the two long couches was the perfect place for these three ladies to hang out and talk for hours on end. Would recommend this lodging to anyone having a reason to visit Lincoln, IL or looking for lodging off historic Route 66."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place was one of the cleanest and most functional short term rentals we’ve ever stayed in. After a long trip from Seattle-to-Chicago-to-Lincoln, it was so nice to walk into a “move-in ready” space where all we had to do was drag our bags in and put up our feet. The home is very well decorated with the right balance of “stuff” inside, which made it an inviting and comfortable place to stay for a long weekend. Live plants, modern cookbooks, and natural cleaning products were really nice touches. The backyard was fenced and equipped with a patio set, making it the perfect space to relax with a glass of wine while our two little kids played. The neighborhood was quiet, so going for a run or walk was easy. To top it off, Amy was an extremely responsive and gracious host. Little gestures like offering to pick up groceries before we got into town, complimentary drink cards to the local coffee shop, insight on local restaurants, and extended check out time all made our trip one to remember."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful time in this little cabin! Perfect for a small family or romantic getaway. We loved the amenities provided; snacks, condiments, extra hygiene supplies!
Upon arriving I was a little confused as we were in town and I was under the impression it was out of town. However, it was on a quiet dead end with a cute wooded ended! Away from the hustle and bustle of town and we really liked that! Great location to get to places in a short time!
Steve was quick with responses, had helpful tips on how to get in, parking, and restaurant recommendations!
As for my family and I, we will be booking again for a getaway!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy place and well worth the price and very comfortable sleep.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,You will not regret staying here. We slept so sound. As a single woman I felt very safe. The house was pristine. We regret not getting there sooner in the day and were sad we had to leave early the next morning. This has everything you need. Just perfect.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far the best AirBnB I’ve stayed in. Everything was perfectly set up, and every room was extremely clean. Everything was very clearly and accurately labeled, including the lightswitches. Instructions were clear. It was extremely easy to check in as well, and the area felt safe. This tiny home is absolutely worth the price. If we are ever in the area again, I will definitely stay here."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was a little apprehensive about the tiny home cabin when I booked it, but I figured we were going for a concert and it would be a place to crash.
When we arrived, we were absolutely thrilled with the place, and I would definitely stay there again. I could easily stay there a week. Not only was the place clean and cute, but the amenities were great. All this for less than I’d have paid for a hotel room! I’m totally satisfied!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great visit! I just love staying here. I look forward to it every week!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve was an amazing host and did an amazing job with the tiny home! So many neat, intricate details that we enjoyed! Our stay was short, however it was peaceful and enjoyable. Thank you Steve!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I may never rent a hotel room again!!
Thank you for a fantastic over night stay at your tiny cabin! It was close to every where i needed to be this weekend in Springfield!
Perfection!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve’s stand-alone cottage is what other AIR BNB properties should aspire to be. This modest looking cottage on the outside is extremely well-thought out on the inside, impeccably clean, super comfortable, and is well-stocked with everything one needs. This property is like “Great Wolf Lodge” meets “Tiny Homes” with a beautifully decorated lake/hunting cabin feel. When you enter, you will be amazed with a beautiful downstairs bed and linens, a fully functional kitchen and cabinet space, Wi-Fi, TV and a super clean full bath. There is a comfy upstairs loft bedroom which further gives the property the cottage feel. Steve was a super communicator and if ever in Springfield, IL again, this will be our first place to reserve. The cottage is perfect for a couple or small family to enjoy. Thank you Steve for making your property available."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve's Tiny Cabin was exactly what it says, tiny but comfortable! the place was very clean and relaxing. The bed was very comfortable and much needed after sleeping in hotels for the past 4 nights. The area is very quiet and you get to see some wildlife deer and rabits. You truly feel like your in a cabin when in fact your in town. My family and I highly recommend picking Steve's Tiny Cabin as your next Air B&B ☺️"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Clean. Well thought out extras. I especially liked the clear switch & remote labeling.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a lovely time at the cabin! My kids loved it! It was a warm weekend and Steve had frozen ice pops waiting for us in the freezer upon arrival. He had all kinds of complimentary snacks which we enjoyed as we relaxed and watched a movie at the end of a busy day. Everything was spotlessly clean. Steve provided all the extra amenities we could possibly need. All the thoughtfulness and attention to care did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. The cabin had a cozy woods feel. It was on a quiet street but was just minutes from the downtown area where we were sightseeing. Steve was available at all times for any need we had. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Springfield area!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place rules and Steve does too! Beautiful little spot and cabin with dozens of ""nice touches"" all over the place. You'll learn like 10 little spacesaving or decorating hacks just staying here.
Encountered a deer passing through later in the evening, she seemed unbothered by me and just mosied along. Also did have a few of the complimentary snacks since they were better than my own snacks I brought....
Everything was great, hoping it won't be booked up next time I come through town! Thanks Steve and Gene (and Mark and Mosha!)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and great host !
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a neat little cabin! Loved the woodsy feel. Very easy to find, a peaceful setting and felt like a safe area. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Tiny cabin was exactly as advertised. It was nice and comfy. Wish it had been a longer stay. Neighborhood felt safe and was peaceful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was one of the cutest and cleanest stays we’ve been too! Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The tiny home was more than fantastic. Great place, and Steve is a great host. Could not recommend it enough if you're staying in Springfield!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is very cute snd with lots of thoughtful details to make the stay enjoyable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Steve has built something special with this little cabin. Beautifully decorated with a unique layout and at the end of a quiet street. Location is very close to the downtown area. He is very responsive and accomodating.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely little house super close to all of downtown Springfields attractions. We had a small problem with the lock later on in the evening and Steve helped us right on the spot. Cozy, and he had snacks! Also we didn’t have to change linens or do anything crazy with leaving which I so appreciated - we got to relax."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean and open home, bathrooms were gorgeous and spotless! Relaxing back porch and lovely seating in the home. Very nice TVs to enjoy and relax with, decor was simply beautiful. Great energy in the home! Upstairs is impeccable. Host was very quick to respond and was the absolute sweetest! Definitely might have to stay here again"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, fun for the kids!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"My daughter and her friends had a great sleep over and game day in this themed place. The lodgings were clean and exactly like the pictures said.
It through us off at first that there was not an official door for the toilet upstairs so make sure your traveling with people you like! lol.
I was so excited to have an Airbnb that had decent shades and at least one room you could sleep in if you wanted to.
Both bathrooms were very clean and very large with plenty of space to spread out.
Thanks for an amazing stay."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very responsive, within moments, no matter the issue or time. Loved the house, provided with everything needed plus more. If there was anything we needed it was taken care of immediately. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to other's. Very accomodating, with our stay being updated from one day to the next vs our original reservation. Thanks so much!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so fun! We loved the decor and the beds were so comfortable! Thanks again!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed Wednesday’s Lair so much! It looks even better in person and was definitely a highlight of our trip.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a girls night!!! We had a blast 🖤🖤🖤
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay. I went out on a limb and booked this without asking my wife. She loves halloween types of themes. This right up her alley and made her very happy. The place was clean and Wednesday set up was very cool. Kayla was responsive and available if we needed anything. It was a great value and we wished we could've stay longer.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,great themed stay! loved it
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My bridal party stayed here the night before my wedding. The atmosphere was great for games and laughter. My husband and I stayed there the night of our wedding. Romantic and beautiful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A+ accommodations and host. Modern, trendy and spacious accommodations. Lovely yard and spacious garage!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I reached out to Kayla about 2 weeks before my stay about my allergy to dryer sheets. Within the hour she responded that she would make sure the cleaners did not use any for my stay. Amazing place. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Awesome. That's the word to describe this house! My husband stayed here for two weeks while working in the area. Kayla was responsive and helpful the entire stay. The decor was perfect. The kitchen had everything he needed to prepare meals. The bed was wonderful and comfy. Bathroom was fantastic, he's probably going to demo ours to look and function as this one! He's 6'8"" and said the shower was the most roomy he's been in. I am just bummed I didn't make it to Illinois this time! Thanks Kayla, I hope he's working near soon so I can come visit!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a hidden gem. Just what we needed for a night away from home! Grabbed groceries nearby, cooked our own meal in the cute kitchen and were obsessed with the on brand mugs. Every detail was well thought out."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ah, what isn’t to love about this place!?
Amazing decor - nothing overlooked.
Kind, responsive, friendly host! Would absolutely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This venue was absolutely everything I had dreamt of for my Friday the 13th wedding day. Kayla was responsive, very friendly, and was just as excited to allow us to utilize the space for our event. The house was spotless, and filled with lots of amentinities for our family with young children. Our guests had so much to look at from start to finish, and we could not recommend this stay enough! A spooky lover's haven!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We drove all the way from New York to Illinois just for this house..and it was completely worth it! The house was spotless and very welcoming. The host was easy to reach and responded very quickly. And the theme was perfect. On our drive home my kids were already asking when we can go back! It was such a great stay. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Wednesday’s lair is as advertised. It is a great themed house. The decor is on point and as I envision the Adams’s house would look. We had a great stay and probably will be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wednesday’s Lair was everything we expected and more. We loved the architecture of the home and the modern design, and the Addam’s Family/Wednesday touches were great. The only thing that may bother some guests is the lack of privacy for the master bedroom, it has no door, leaving it open to the rest of the house and there is no bathroom, toilet, or shower door either. This was definitely not a real issue for our family of 4, but may be for others. Overall totally worth the experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wednesday’s Lair was amazing. The decor was perfect and really makes it stand out
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was as advertised and more,attention to detail really stood out.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Im an amateur photographer and booked Wednesday's Lair to host a photoshoot. The house was beautiful and very well decorated. We had such a great time and really appreciated Kayla and her responsiveness.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a few questions during my stay and she was very quick to respond with a answer
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wednesday’s Lair was absolutely incredible!
My family and I stayed there for spring break, and we all enjoyed our time to the fullest.
We’re big fans of the Addams Family and the Wednesday show, so we were very mesmerized by the decor and attention to detail.
The house is beautiful, the colors are on point, and the open concept was cozy and made it easy to keep an eye on the kids.
Also, our host was very helpful, responsive, and very accommodating.
I would definitely recommend staying here. Such a great find, and if you’re a fan of the movie or the show like we are, you’ll find yourself taking pictures of every nook and cranny to show off to your friends and family."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was awesome! My bestie wanted a spooky themed bachelorette and that was exactly what she got! House was so so cute and fit all of us perfectly. Not much to do in the town, as we expected. But we still had a great time and enjoyed everything at the house!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here when it was switching from the spooky octagon house to the whimsical Wednesday’s lair, so the decor was in transition. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The working fireplace was a nice touch. Plenty of coffee and flavorings as well! Some of the decorations were showing a little wear but overall an excellent place to stay!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terry was a great host the place was perfect for our stay. Terrys place was so great we booked it for another week. At the end of our stay he asked for feedback and I mentioned a couple things to him like the beds being kind of uncomfortable and changed them over the weekend before our next stay. Definitely the best host I’ve ever had. Would definitely recommend the upper deck to everyone.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was the perfect place to stay for us while visiting family nearby. We have 2 kids (8 & 1) so the extra space and bedrooms were great! The house was very clean, smelled great, and had everything we needed! Including a baby gate to keep our youngest away from the stairs. I would definitely recommend this property!

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the place was great. the one surprise was that you have to go up rather steep stairs to access the unit I guess the title "",Upper Deck"" should have been a clue to me that there would be stairs.
As it was I only had a couple small bags to bring up for my stay. But if had been a family with a lot of bags it might have been a problem."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,It was clean and close to work for us

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleasantly surprised at the size of this rental. The place has plenty of room for families or groups. It's very homey and cozy and the kitchen was well stocked for meal preps on the days we stayed in. The home is in a great location on the edge of town. Very close to plenty of restaurants and shopping. If we come back to town for the Apple and Pork Festival we will definitely be staying here, if it's available, as it's far enough away to avoid all of the crowds but close enough to be just a few minutes from the festival. It will also be great for summer visits because it is so close to Clinton Lake. The hosts were really great too. They made sure we had everything we needed for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved our stay. We were out in the country and the view was amazing. I wasn't aware it would be in a semi empty trailer court, but for the location and place it honestly didn't matter in the end. Ronda was very responsive and kind. The trailer was spotless, the AC worked amazingly, and it was easy to connect hotspot to their TV. So lack of wifi didn't matter whatsoever.
It's very peaceful, private, and was worth staying at for our wedding night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Ronda's place was perfect for our overnight stay. The place had everything we needed and was a great price.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful! This AirBnB is located in a small trailer park, but I didn't see a single other person and it was extremely quiet. Very peaceful with the whole place to yourself. Ronda was one of the most responsive hosts I've ever had and even helped direct me to some spots to see the periodical cicadas, which I had travelled from Utah to see. I really enjoyed my stay here and Ronda made me feel so welcome."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, relaxing, small town. Perfect for a weekend getaway."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely quiet spot. Nice linen and very comfy bed. A lot nicer inside than you might think from the outside.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ronda's place was very comfortable and cute, she was always attentive to our needs and the beds are very comfortable if you want to rest and sleep very well. I definitely recommend it and hope to be back soon."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was just needing a place to sleep for the night and this place was so homey and cozy!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and gorgeous old farm house cottage. Quiet and serene with gorgeous views. Nestled in what feels like the middle of nowhere but easy access to the interstate.

Close to all Lincoln sites."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cozy place if you’re looking for a place to escape the city at night, but also not too far from things if you need things. Also, George, (the friendly dog) is the best boy and will occasionally run with you down the gravel drive to meet you on the porch. It was fantastic."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely magical place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family was obsessed with this gorgeous cottage on the farm! It felt like a scene from a painting! We really enjoyed all the animals (George the farm dog is THE BEST)! Really hospitable hosts who brought us farm fresh eggs! They do sell wine from the vineyard on the property which is so cool (Although we aren’t drinkers). Still a nice touch! We appreciated the coziness of this property!

From all of the up to date amenities, to the warm & cozy touches, to the beautiful & peaceful surroundings, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. And a huge bonus that it is dog friendly!
The hosts are warm, responsive and have put much time & thought into making this a truly beautiful & unique stay!
A must to-do is to visit the Elkhart Station General store (which features all Illinois products) and enjoy a glass of wine from grapes that are grown right there on the property where you are staying!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay at the cottage (spacious house actually). It was so adorable when you walked in, nicer than the pictures. Plenty of room to spread out and enjoy ourselves. Spacious bedrooms, huge living room and large dining area. Bathrooms were great. Loved the kitchen and the tile work. Easy to work with multiple people in the kitchen making meals. You can tell a lot of love and effort went into setting up the home. Had fun shopping and wine/beer tasting in the little downtown Elkhart area. You could also get ice cream! There are a couple of local eateries too. The bar in town serves fried chicken on Wednesday's and fish on Friday's plus a nice salad bar. Support the local businesses while staying at the relaxing cottage!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a fantastic stay there. Very peaceful. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family was in Elkhart for my mother's memorial service. We needed additional accommodations. It was absolutely perfect! Very slight note, guests raved about eggs. Not a big deal, but no eggs. We definitely will go back."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a great time. The host was amazing and we hope to be back soon
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful bucolic setting! So quiet and peaceful that we were able to truly relax and reset ourselves for the next work week. Waking to the birdsong (and the occasional crowing of the farm’s rooster) was an absolute delight. We have missed the country and definitely got a dose of it, with the cows across the way in the pastures, the swallows darting in between the barns and the lovely sunsets across the fields and vineyards.
The porch was the perfect spot for our morning coffee and a glass of wine in the evening. The beds were comfortable, the living room furniture was as well and all the amenities were well thought out and made our stay a delight. Our hosts were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed meeting them both, as well as the farm’s lovable dog George.
There is no doubt that we will make the return trip from Chicago again many times over!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the Inn At 835's Elkhart Hill Farm Cottage. The owners and staff at the Inn were very welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay possible.
The house is cozy, well appointed, and located in a beautiful environment in which one can enjoy walking around the farm in the good company of George, the friendly farm dog.
The Elkhart Hill Farm Cottage is definitely worth stopping by and a great place to stay with a family!
Thank you for the warm welcome and memorable stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place if your looking for a quiet and secluded, yet easily accessible place….which we were! We had a perfect stay and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. This home provided all the amenities necessary. The host was easy to contact and quick to reply. We will definitely be back again for future stays. The visitors(dogs) we had daily were so friendly and a nice touch to our stay! Oh and those pillows are amazing🙂"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home on an iconic piece of property. George the dog was a sweetheart and the touch of fresh eggs was so sweet. We really enjoyed our brief stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at this Airbnb numerous times and it never disappoints! Always a favorite.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful little Antique shops were such fun just down the street. The house was furnished beautifully with Indian rugs and modern decor. The front porch was our favorite spot which over looked the fields and cows.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is an absolute gem! My family chose to get together here and stay over a long weekend because it’s in the middle between where several of us live so the location is ideal. But the farm went well beyond our expectations. The pictures can’t convey how relaxing it is to stay here. We were able to both connect as a family and unplug from the world. The kids enjoyed watching the tractor in the field across from cottage, and everyone enjoyed the visit from the dog.
The front porch is a retreat unto itself. Everyone loved sitting on the porch. Even when it rained, it was a lovely place to gather.
The Elkhart General Store is also a place you should stop in and visit if you stay. So many different unique finds. We loved shopping there!
We would all love to come back some day!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house on the farm. Relaxing on the porch with the dogs was a highlight. (Large but friendly dogs are prone to taking things so be forewarned. ) Well stocked kitchen. Spotless clean. Walked to downtown Elkhart for ice cream and antique shops. 20 minutes to Springfield for the State Fair and Lincoln home.
Will definitely come again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the farmhouse cottage! It is super cute and thoughtfully decorated and comfortable. Very peaceful.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here while visiting Springfield for the Illinois State Fair. It’s about a 20 minute drive from downtown and was the perfect place to relax after long days in the sun.
Beautiful views all around. Lovely to sit on the porch and be surrounded by the orchard and fields and cows.
The Airbnb itself is by far the most well furnished Airbnb I’ve stayed in. It felt luxurious staying there."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The whole experience was great. Even the little town of Elkhart had a lot to offer. The central location is great for Springfield, Bloomington and Peoria. Lots of stuff to do and visit and come back to peace and quiet of the country side. The host were great as well."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm house in Elkhart is absolutely wonderful. My buddies and I have made it a central point where we come together. This was our second time here and it was excellent. 10/10, plan to reserve again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife, two young children and I greatly enjoyed staying at the cottage. It was easy to get to and communication with the host/property manager was very good. My sons enjoyed watching the tractors work in the fields in front of the house. The drive into Elkhart is very quick and we browsed the small shops and enjoyed ice cream and drinks. Driving into Springfield is also very easy and only about 25 minutes. The house had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. I would recommend staying here if you're looking for a relaxing, quiet getaway."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for solitude. Beautiful cottage with all you need. Front porch restful and quaint. All rooms are decorated simply and lovely. The grape vines are growing and looking wonderful that surround the property. Elkhart has much to offer!! Thank you so much!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice place!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Historic farms house lives up to the hype. Super quiet place in a relaxing setting that melts the stress away once you settle in on the front porch. We didn’t have one negative thing to say about this place. We will be back.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely, quiet, clean and charming home on the farm. You'll notice the light and the quiet right away. The house is clean as a whistle and the kitchen is a bright and spacious place to cook if you'd like. The huge cast iron tub downstairs was soothing and we loved the view from the veranda. A wonderful place for a retreat."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay at the old Gillett farm. Sunrise/sunset were picturesque on the property, all of the beds were very comfortable, and the home/kitchen had everything we needed to make meals. Court was very helpful getting us checked in and that we could find the location as we were coming from out of state. It was beautiful to get out of the city and spend time here"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quaint cottage that really had my 2 and 4 yr old feeling at home. they loved being able to walk around the farm petting the horse and Tom the turkey. would recommend this for anyone near the springfield area. 25 minute drive was worth it.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic spot. Can’t ask for much else - very clean and spacious, host was extremely friendly and communicative, and a cool spot on the hill. If you are considering booking this place, do it! Highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a high end accommodation. Everything that you could possibly need, The Cottage has. After hours of traveling it was nice to see assortments of different wines to purchase using the honor system. Nice touch! The Cottage is eclectically decorated which highlights the area culture. Amazing tile work in the kitchen and master BR. We were instantly put at ease the moment we checked in, wonderful 3 night stay. We will be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,I have nothing negative to say about this place. The host took care of us from the moment we drove up to the place. He left us his number in case we needed anything wish I thought was cool. The only bad thing I could say is that I wish I would off stayed longer. Don't want to break down how the place looks cause I would like you to have the same experienced when we first walked again .
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of a kind. It has a rural setting while still being close to the attractions in Lincoln and Springfield. The farm is an interesting place to explore on its own, with panoramic views and a path leading to the peak of the hill and a historic cemetery. The house comes stocked with everything you need including fresh eggs in the fridge. We would definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Location and scenery are great. House is a little old and the beds are not super comfortable
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house with some great views on some beautiful property! The hospitality was the best part, great people!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was as described in Adams description of his place.
We were passing through on a job, so didn’t have much time to enough the grounds.
The beds were comfortable and there’s a fully stocked kitchen which was nice."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great. The location couldn't be any better with great views sitting on the front porch. We will be back again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Words can't explain how thrilled we are to have found this amazing place. Everything was clean and put together with a fine eye for detail. Of all of the Airbnb places my husband and I have stayed at, this one just blew us away. I felt connected with the land in a very deep way and was constantly inspired by each moment we spent there. The Conn Family and everyone involved in the Elkhart Hill Farm that we interacted with couldn't have been more friendly and kind. There is so much to take in and explore that 6 days just wasn't enough. If you have the opportunity to stay here don't hesitate. I know we will be back again. Elkhart Hill has found a special place in my heart and I am eternally grateful for our time there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family loved our stay here at the cottage! Very clean and comfortable. The views are beautiful and the kids enjoyed all the animals & fresh air! We will definitely be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place on a working farm! Close to Springfield if you want to visit the Capital, but far enough away that you enjoy the quietness and privacy of a farm in a small town. And complimentary farm fresh eggs provided! And lots of Illinois history all around! The amenities are perfect for a family, with three separate bedrooms, and spacious modern kitchen. A great place to unwind!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot on the Prairie hillside. Lovely home with plenty of amenities. Perfect hosts, easy check in. My nieces loved it. Thank you!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is just darling! We were visiting family that lives in Springfield and this cottage was the perfect place to stay. Court is very communicative and friendly, and our 4-year olds loved visiting with the animals. Having the beautiful, wide, open space to just relax in was what this city girl’s soul needed. Thanks for a great time!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can't recommend this stay highly enough! Beautiful home and location. Great communication and accommodations by the hosts. We even caught a summer lightning storm from the front porch that was the biggest and most beautiful I'd ever seen. The gorgeous front deck has a view of a massive Midwest sky (great sunsets as well). Do yourself a favor and stay here.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My mother, daughter, and I spent just under a week here to get some time away from the city. From the moment we arrived, we were absolutely captivated by the beautiful landscape. Court greeted us warmly and showed us around the cottage. He and his family were friendly and very easy to stay in touch with if we needed anything or had any questions. The house is thoughtfully decorated and very clean. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything needed to make and serve your meals. The owners are very generous with the property, allowing guests to roam and explore, as well as befriend their animals. Our favorites were Hero (a horse), Cupcake (a goat), Sis (a sheep), and best of all… Tom (a sweet, gentle Turkey). This whole trip had us feeling like we were existing in a beautifully written children’s novel. All three of us would certainly recommend visiting this magical place."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charming and cute cottage. Beautifully decorated inside. The farm animals were a huge hit with the kids. The owner was very pleasant and welcoming. He brought us fresh farm eggs and stayed in contact with us about severe weather in the area. Very quiet location. Great for anyone looking to get away from the city for a couple days.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a beautiful cottage and the setting was incredible!! The host meet us there and was very welcoming. We loved all the wildlife in the area. We enjoyed walking the property. The views from the top of the hill are incredible!! We will most certainly return!! We loved it!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay. The cottage is perfect. Plenty of room for 6. It was awesome being able to sit out on the large porch and just relax. Every morning and evening there was a perfect breeze. It was so nice to have the horses nearby - the kids loved that. Plenty of other wildlife around as well... Owners were very friendly and answered my question very quickly. GREAT PLACE - we will be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay and experience! We enjoyed ourselves so much we plan to make it an annual visit. A great place to get a break from it all and enjoy the scenic farm and property.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love the cottage! This was our second time there and we are already planning our trip back. There is such a sense of peace in my soul there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Delightful home on a beautiful property. We had four young children with us and they absolutely loved playing out in the front yard and meeting so many friendly animals. The host is super friendly and helpful. It was a perfect getaway.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had the most wonderful time! Everything about it was perfect. We got to see horses and a lamb named sis and 2 of the sweetest fur babies! The location was the best and the view and front porch was fantastic. I look forward to my ne t visit! 10 out of 10!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful inside and out
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say thank you enough! This home was absolutely beautiful and very welcoming. It was clean from top to bottom and had everything we needed! The owners brought us fresh eggs from their chickens and we very sweet! We loved waking up in the morning and having coffee out on the front porch and watch the cows in the fields. There was wine to purchase from a local winery the owners had that tasted great and lots to choose from! It was also nice to have an area to walk around on and explore! We loved our stay and cannot wait to book our next weekend trip here!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! The cottage was so cozy and inviting. The views and solitude were amazing. Court was an excellent host and not only offered up ideas for places to visit but also brought us fresh eggs. This was an amazing place to unplug from technology and just enjoy the scenery. I am definitely looking forward to visiting again.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for a great relaxing place to stay then this is the place. We loved every single thing about this place. Great host. Perfect location. Really enjoyable. Many memories
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your looking to escape the craziness of the city, this is definitely the spot! All the charm of being in the country but still not too far not to be able to go grab something. The secluded feeling had me wanting to fall asleep on that amazing porch, and don’t even get me started on the bathtub in the master bath. The entire property is gorgeous!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Loved the cottage!! Horses, cows, chickens and even a Turkey to see!! The family and I loved the location, so scenic yet quiet! Home is spotlessly clean and perfect amenities! We will stay there again in the future and highly recommended!!!
Paul"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My group had a great time in Elkhart: the property was excellently furnished and set in lovely surroundings, which contributed to a delightful and restful stay. We were brought fresh eggs from the farm, and generally felt very welcomed. We requested strong covid precautions and these were respected completely. All in all, a wonderful trip!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our visit. The kids enjoyed seeing the many animals around the farm. We would definitely return. The house was clean and stylish, it was a very relaxing trip."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farm is fantastic! Guests are allowed to walk freely on the land and to say hi to the animals (horses, chickens, and the adorable friendly turkey!). Our kids fed the horses and got to see chicks and jump on a trampoline. The country road was great for a run. The owner gave us a lovely tour of the grounds and provided firewood which we used to make smores. The guest house was completely remodeled recently and is clean and modern. The farm is conveniently located near Springfield to check out the Lincoln historical sites. There's only a few eatery options in the local village, so guests might want to bring some food basics too. We would love to come back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely time at the historic Gillett Farm! Horses and cows will be your neighbors. We also got along well with roosters, a turkey, a beautiful lamb, and two lovely pups named Whiskey and Jumanji! There are also private wooded areas to enjoy on the property that we had the chance to explore during our stay. We also received a dozen eggs when we arrived which we enjoyed for breakfast. I would love to come back! I should also say that we had an embarrassing moment where we couldn't get the BBQ grill to ignite and we resorted to calling the owner for help after we weighed our options. Court did come down to help us out and we were very grateful!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Elkhart Cottage on Old Gillett Farm (managed by Inn at 835) was a really amazing get-away from Chicago for our family of 4. Our kids (8 and 6) absolutely loved being so close to the horses, cows, chickens and the turkey. They even got to feed the horses carrots. And our hosts (Court and Karen) were kind enough to bring a two week old baby lamb down so the kids could see her. The cottage is jus a short drive from Springfield where we went during the days and were able to pack in some educational sites for our kids' spring break, such as seeing the state capital building, visiting the Lincoln Museum and the Illinois State Museum, as well as walking around Lincoln's old home and the Lincoln New Salem village and the Lincoln Memorial Gardens. We learned a lot about Lincoln! And Illinois! It was also relaxing for the grown-ups to sit on the porch with our morning coffee and to cook some nice family meals in the well-appointed kitchen. Would definitely recommend it! The hosts were so kind and gracious and the location was fabulous. We'll definitely book it again for future trips!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm house cottage was great! Secluded enough to offer privacy, but shopping and restaurants are not far off. Seeing the horses and cows each day made me smile.
Hosts were very responsive and hospitable. First floor bath has a wonderful claw foot soaker tub that I loved. Kitchen is well appointed with plenty of cookware and extra dishes; appliances were newer and in excellent condition.
I would definitely stay again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, relaxing surroundings, very clean and well stocked. I would recommend it."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice country location to get away! My wife and I really enjoyed our weekend here.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay over the few days we were there. It was a great escape from city life and highly recommend staying to ""reset"" yourself. The place was very clean. The beds were comfy. We are going to be making this a regular trip for us."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely little country getaway. Also horses are your neighbors so that's always gonna be a win in my book.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Court and his team were thoughtful and gracious hosts. Even though we (two couples) live only 15 miles away we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway on Elkhart hill. The house has been recently remodeled and it was cozy and very clean. Court took time to show us the house when we checked in and gave us a brief history of the property. He even gave us a dozen fresh eggs from his free-range chickens. We very much enjoyed our country retreat on the hill!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was such a gem. It was a great cottage with surprisingly homey-yet-stylish touches (and a great kitchen setup which we particularly appreciated) but also such a lovely place on the farm. We really enjoyed seeing the animals all around us!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hillside view of the surrounding area, including the newly planted vineyard and fruit orchard, along with the horses make it a very beautiful and serene landscape. We plan to stay there again, as we go to Elkhart 2-3 times a year."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay—close enough to Springfield but certainly secluded in the country—see cows from the front porch and horses out the kitchen window. House is clean and comfortable. Great place for a weekend getaway or short stay.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an unexpected surprise to find such a lovely place in the middle of nowhere. This beautiful newly remodeled farm house has a lot of character and is situated in a quiet location on a large property. Cattle, horses, and chickens close by but on a short walk around the main residence and caretaker's house. We enjoyed quiet solitude that it afforded us. We plan on coming back in the spring to see how Court's newly planted vineyard and orchard comes along."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect get away.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot for a brief getaway. Lovely location, nice and quiet, and outstanding hospitality from the hosts. Highly recommended!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was even nicer and more inviting than it looked in the photos. We enjoyed the farm setting, especially enjoyed the beautiful horses so close by."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is beautifully styled and situated near horses and cows and some rolling hills. You feel like you’re in a different place immediately and can easily channel vacation mode. We celebrated a birthday with a fire outside and some walks around the property. Springfield is close by. We really loved it.
2020-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,a couple small hiccups but the area is very nice and remote. Enjoyed our stay.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house with even better views.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot rate this property highly enough. We booked it as a meeting spot to see my parents, since the pandemic has kept us apart. Court, the owner, was welcoming and responsive; the setting is peaceful and serene. The cottage has been impeccably refurbished and has plenty of space. We cooked meals in the well-appointed kitchen and used the grill in the back for a delicious steak dinner. We enjoyed seeing the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in nearby Springfield and ate lunch outside at a brew pub owned by Court. The porch was a pleasant spot for a glass of wine and conversation. You will not be disappointed!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent time at Inn at 835! It was so relaxing and the home was beautiful! We enjoyed walking around the grounds and when the owner stopped by to give us fresh tomatoes and eggs! Thank you, Inn at 835!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just left and already looking up dates to come back! Thank you for the most perfect mini getaway. The home is absolutely beautiful, the decor is a favorite! I would recommend this place 1000 times. The family who owns the property are incredibly kind and welcoming. Walking the property and seeing the animals, hearing the history of the farm from Court himself was especially memorable. Loved hearing the roosters, seeing the cows and petting the horses! We will be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Relax in the country. The large front porch is not screened, nor does it need to to be. The lovely breezes and adorable white wicker furniture, and nightly cow parades make the porch a one of the best features of the cottage. The kitchen has retained much of its original charm, but has all top appliances and extra counter space. The antique claw foot tub has a view of the orchard, and the toilet has a separate closet. The furniture is comfortable and beautiful. The hosts provided us with produce from the garden, and couldn't have been more responsive. We also went to their beer garden in Springfield and loved it. Downtown Elkhart has 3 antique stores and provided some fun shopping and great finds."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice quaint place! Very stylishly decorated. Not too many animals, ideal if you are looking to spend some time alone."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say We were surprised at how scenic this location was given the previous glowing reviews. Visits from the horses out back and a twice daily cow parade in front gave us plenty of time to sit back and enjoy. The kitchen had a lot to work with, and their is a propane grill out back. This is a perfect stop to get out and enjoy the quiet."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Recommending the place to everyone. It's such an oasis - a beautiful, quiet, comfortable - a great change of pace from Chicago. We found lots of Route 66 segments nearby to drive on, and took some great hikes in parks and explored the land around the farm. The Conn family was wonderful and obviously cares very much about their guests. I'm looking forward to getting back to Elkhart and Springfield to check out their other properties. I've been sharing stories and pictures with friends."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time! The house has all of the amenities that you could need. If you are looking to stay at a house on a farm, this is a place to check out."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at this farm house! The property was beautiful, the hosts were kind and helpful, and our stay was so comfortable.
We used this as an escape from the city and it was just that. When we had to work from here, the WiFi was great so all guests should feel good about being able to work from here.
Pro-tip: close the bottom floor bathroom doors to keep the cool air from the living room pushed into the master bedroom.
We loved our stay. Everything was clean and comfortable. We’ll be booking again!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot for a getaway from the city!! The front porch is pure magic, and we loved watching the cows parade by multiple times a day. Fascinating! We enjoyed stargazing in the backyard each night, and hiking around the property. We would love to return!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was excellent, the house was clean and overlooks the neighbor's farm with cows. Elkhart Hill Farms has turkeys, chickens and horses. The host is very hospitable and attentive."
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"An amazing retreat in rural Illinois! The place is quiet and cozy, full of amenities (especially the kitchen that has all the kitchen utensils). You get to see the cows, horses, chickens, and even deers. The communication regarding check-in was smooth and any issues during the stay were addressed immediately. I will visit again when I get a chance!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The family was great! As the first guests in their beautiful cottage, they were very open to suggestions and fulfilling our requests. We are already planning another visit, and there is a good chance that we may have our wedding there when they have their event hall open.
This little cottage can be your home away from home. It is well off the beaten path, and provides a great view of the night sky. There is so little light pollution that I was able to take photos of the stars with my cell phone. They have just planted an orchard on one side, and a vineyard on the other. The horse pasture is right in the backyard. You can sit on the rear patio and watch their horses, or bring your own watch them all.
We are in love with this property!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Per my work team, this was one of the best places they have stayed in. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we arrived at the caboose, we knew we were in for a special experience. Aaron was the epitome of hospitality, proactive in his communication and always responsive.
The caboose itself was a marvel. Wonderfully restored, it maintained its charming historic essence while providing all the modern comforts. It was spotlessly clean and well cared for.
What truly sets this place apart was the warmth and coziness. The small touches made a huge difference; cups of hot chocolate, candy canes and s’mores kits for the kids added a delightfully homey feel. Furthermore, the hosts were kind enough to throw a log on the indoor fireplace and set the outdoor fire pit as well.
All in all, our stay (just for a night) was simply wonderful. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and cozy getaway."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time during our stay in the Caboose. The owners did a spectacular job preserving the atmosphere of an old train car. This was a unique experience for us, and a real treat. We felt as if we were at home. The location is very private and peaceful; it was perfect for us to get away from the stressful work and enjoy a few moments completely undisturbed. A big shout-out to our host Aaron for his friendliness, responsiveness, and attention to detail."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked this place as a surprise getaway for my wife so she didn’t know anything except it was in Illinois somewhere! She sure did not expect to pull up to a caboose and it tickled her to laughter upon our arrival.
It was a super adorable place and surprisingly comfortable! It was authentic and a LOT of time and effort was put in by the hosts to make this caboose a charming place to stay with a much originality as possible!
Decatur is nearby with many options for dining.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay at the Caboose! I loved all the little details inside; they made me so giddy. The construction of the whole place is restored so well with the floors, metal, little cafe seats, and the wood slatted walls give a woodsy scent to the place. The bed and bedding was comfy, soft, clean, and on theme.
We came in town to see Andy Grammer at the Devon in Decatur and it's a nice drive. Just under 15 minutes. It stayed cool inside even with the temperatures being over 90°F. We loved all the little thoughts put into the stay with the campfire, guest parking sign, etc. We really enjoyed s'mores in the quiet night out back. It rained and had the best sound at night. The wind can get a little noisy, but luckily that didn't last long.
Our host was very nice and didn't have too many clean up requirements. I feel like this place would be especially nice in the fall with the campfire. We spotted a bunch of baby deer playing close by too."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"All aboard... The Caboose is AMAZING! Feels like you're transported back in time! All the little touches make this a MUST-BOOK kind of a stay for a relaxing getaway. They had a smores pack for us, firewood, sparking juice, ice, water, games, train books etc. and the caboose itself was unforgettable. Well done! We'll be back!!! Choo choo!"

The caboose was so darn cute, down to the special monograms on the pillows!
Loved the private back area where we could have a campfire.
We watched the deer from the upper lookout loft as we drank our coffee in the morning.
And slept so peacefully in the comfy beds.
We will definitely be back. Such a great get-away, and wonderful experience."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just book the caboose! Comfortable and amazingly well designed...there is everything you need, including soft linens, good size fridge, and a comfortable bed. It's surprisingly roomy inside. The cupola is very special, and the overall experience is fun. We would stay again in winter for the indoor fireplace. We enjoyed the rain drumming lightly on the roof. Combine your train adventure with a trip to the Monticello Railway Museum. Would recommend heartily. Owner Aaron is very gracious."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was the perfect place for a romantic getaway. It felt like we were stepping back into time. The detail was incredible. It was located in the country, a little around, but close to everything. We went to dinner at Texas Roadhouse, came back, made a fire, and snuggled. It was perfect. My favorite Airbnb yet, and we have stayed at many. Dont, pass this one up. Thank you, Aaron, for sharing this Amazing place with us. You made my husband's Birthday very memorable."

We had a romantic, quiet and unique quick getaway and enjoyed hiking in Allerton Park nearby."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This caboose was very well redone to be very comfortable! We loved our stay and had everything we needed to disconnect from the outside world and connect with each other. We really enjoyed the thoughtfulness that was put into our stay. There were games we could play with each other, fun train related books to read, and we were greeted with a radio that we played during our stay. Overall it was tastefully done with modern conveniences that looked like they were from the 1960s when the caboose was in operation. Host was responsive and the place was better than the pictures and descriptions, which is saying a lot!"

Thanks Joe & Staci!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hut is a very comfortable, cozy, yet spacious place to stay. I'd recommend it to anyone 👍

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place! I really enjoyed my stay in this very welcoming, cozy hut house. Beautiful prairie views too!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thoughtful design of this place impressed me - for example efficient use of space in the bathroom and kitchen. The view from front windows is ag fields to the horizon - something you appreciate if you have any experience in Central Illinois. However, I was not anticipating the array of windmills occupying those fields! We had a little bit of road noise from adjecent Route 121. However, the ""hut"" was much more peaceful that the hotels we usually patronize in the Decatur area. Although located on the edge of Warrensburg, it feels like there is plenty of separation from the neighboring residences. We never needed to contact the owners. The only minor issue we had was attempting to understand the high tech thermostat. Although slow on the learning curve, we eventually figured it out. Despite its relatively rural location, the drive to Decatur only takes about 10 minutes. Overall, very comfortable and peaceful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had never stayed in such a unique lodging before. It was truly a wonderful experience. The Hut was spacious and airy.

Both were very responsive and accommodating. I have and will recommend this marvelous little Hut to anyone and everyone who has occasion to visit the greater Decatur, IL area. They will not be disappointed!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"From the moment I secured my reservation, when I turned the key in the door lock, and throughout my entire stay, EVERYTHING has been exactly as represented. Well, maybe the representation was a bit understated, as I have been delighted with the accommodations and the hospitality level of Joe and Staci. They both are truly Super Hosts and the Country Hut House is destined to please all who stay here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was an excellent experience!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely LOVED this air bnb! Very nice and accommodating!

The historically unique architecture becomes a design asset with their expert lighting and perfectly chosen decorating elements. I found every necessity for a comfortable stay, short or long, had been anticipated and I very much look forward to future stays."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% recommend staying here! Location is ideal for anything in Decatur/Forsyth, plus it's very cute and cozy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! We will be back! So clean, cozy, and welcoming!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,The hut was perfect for us to have our own space and be able to visit and enjoy family and friends. We’ll be back

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We’ve had a great time and really felt right at home. Thank you
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here while we were in town for the Midwest Tandem Rally. An easy, quick drive to the Decatur Conference Center. No problem leaving our bike on top of the car here at night. Nice and quiet (there was some occasional road noise with trucks going by, but that didn't bother us). We enjoyed sitting on the covered back deck on a rainy day watching the birds. While we were there, the internet was really slow, but Joe and Staci are working to fix it. If fast internet is important to you, you might want to inquire before you book."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Description is accurate, awesome stay. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice serene cottage in the central Illinois cornfields.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable and clean
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great place for one or two people to relax!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cutest little hut! I hope to come back sometime!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A must stay, whether a few days or longer. Everything is provided except any food/beverages you may want. Centrally located between the Amish towns of Arthur/Arcola, Decatur and Springfield. Pricing was much better than a hotel too."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the little hut house is my favorite spot out of 3 different places I have been this far. the house seems to be in the middle of nowhere but everything you need near by. host was great and everyone was very friendly. a place a can definitely call a home away from home. I loved that everything that was needed was available including the adult coloring book and Simon. the windows were peaceful to look out too.
thank you for a fun relaxing peaceful and beautiful weekend with making changes for me to add another night!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! This is such a nice cozy place with great hosts! We saw some beautiful country sunsets! We will be back!😎👍
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unique home is so cozy and comfortable! It was great to come home to at the end of the day. The only drawback is the traffic on route 121, but I would encourage folks not to let that get in the way of staying at this lovely home. Everything one needs is there, the bed is comfortable, the towels soft, and the fireflies delightful!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! Best place to stay close to Decatur without a doubt. I was traveling for work and needed a week long residence. After long hours, this place felt comfortable and cozy. The small town was the perfect contrast to work in Decatur and the diner in town had amazing breakfast. The local businesses were well stocked with surging I forgot, but the hosts have this place stocked so well it was hard to find anything missing. The in-house washer/dryer was essential and parking felt safe and was perfect for my vehicle. I’ll be back if I have another long stay in this area"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute hut! It was cozy and comfortable. Very clean.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had to travel to area for a wedding so found Joe and Staci's place to be a pretty good fit for my needs. They have included everything one would pretty much need to cook, clean, bath, and even do laundry if one needed to. This was a nice gesture that you seldom find offered at many Airbnb stays. The bed was extremely comfortable so my back was appreciative of that. Many extra blankets were available as well as plenty of storage with extra things like a small fan and bathroom travel size offerings such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, and toothpaste. The kitchen had some nice quality pots and skillets and utensils to cook many things and had many glasses, cups, and plates to use as well. I found the table was useful to dine or work at and the TV was a decent size with most streaming options and local channels as well. The setting is pretty rural but the house does sit on Hwy 121 right between a change from 40 to 55 mph so at times semi trucks could be heard downshifting or upshifting pretty loudly but I mostly got used to that and the vehicle traffic subsides a lot during the sleeping hours. Communication was great before check-in and instructions were clear upon checkout. They did a nice job fixing up and older building and I think its a great value for a private Airbnb stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An awesome, unique place to stay! Joe and Staci are kind and easy to communicate with. We especially loved seeing the windmills at dawn. 10/10 would stay again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and accommodating lil hut! Very nice host. Will stay again if the time arrives. Thanks!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is at a perfect spot right outside of Decatur, with places to eat and shop just down the road. Very cute and cozy, with all the necessary accommodations. The bed is very comfortable, making this a perfect spot for a weekend getaway."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Among my favorite Airbnb accommodations and hosts. Pictures on listing are nice, reality even better.
Such a pleasant space and thoughtfully designed within a cabin concept, form and function both in great order.
Joe and Staci were even kind to remove snow from the property during a winter storm!
Interior aesthetics are very appealing while the views out the window to the open prairie are an incredible bonus.
Full kitchen was updated and extremely useful. Dedicated laundry room.
The house does reside on a moderately busy state route with frequent heavy truck traffic. However, the road sounds did not affect my sleep.
Worthy of longterm residency. Additionally interesting to inhabit a modified quonset hut!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Country Hut House is quite a find! It's larger than expected, quaint, comfortable and is like a ""home away from home"". We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning when we have the opportunity."

Since we have family in the nearby areas, we will be staying at the hut again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wonderful little place to stay. Make sure to check out Da' Burg Bar &Grill.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The hut house was awesome. It was amazingly cozy, had everything I needed! The hosts were so accommodating! I loved sipping my coffee and watching the windmills!
If I come back to Decatur the hut house is the only place I’ll stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable house. Peaceful surroundings. And excellent hosts :)
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to the area for a wedding and had a great stay at the Hut! It truly is a cozy little niche in a rural area that you can feel at home and at peace in. It was true to the pictures, clean, and Joe and Staci (the hosts) were extremely friendly and quick to respond to us. The location is a little out there, but they provided information on activities and places in the general area, so we were able to go out and entertain ourselves. Overall, this was a great stay and if we are ever in the area again, we would definitely stay here again!

The house was super cute, cozy, and even had a porch swing to enjoy. The backyard had a table with a grill we would’ve used if the weather would’ve cooperated.
We loved everything about it, and will be coming back again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Lincoln, Illinois for Thanksgiving holiday. It gave my wife and I the opportunity to visit my Mom w/o having to stay in a boring hotel room for an extended period of time. When we visit my Mom in the future I hope we can stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved our stay Maddie made everything for us so smooth and easy and not to mention the super cute backyard that is fully fenced in so we could play with our dogs and enjoy our time!!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family (two adults, two kids and a dog!) stayed here for a few weeks and loved it. Would recommend this home for people visiting loved ones in town but still want some space away. One bedroom has a functional desk which allowed my husband to work from home while the rest of us played games in the family room. Also, the backyard is fully fenced and perfect for little kids or pets to roam while you grill out on the gas grill. The owners were incredibly polite and attentive. Very quiet and friendly neighbors, too. Looking forward to coming back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maddie was so great through my whole trip. Any accommodations that my group needed were fulfilled with open arms. The home is also beautiful and absolutely nothing was wrong with the place. If you are thinking of booking with Maddie do it, I promise you won’t regret it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The BoHo Cottage was the perfect home base for our visit to Lincoln. It is cute and plenty spacious for the 2 of us. Everything was spotlessly clean and in perfect condition. The bed is super comfy. We were able to cook simple meals in the well appointed kitchen. This is a much better option than a hotel when we come to Lincoln to visit family. We’ll definitely be back’
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place near downtown. Super cute and comfortable!

We were there for a week and enjoyed our stay in this lovely space. We will recommend this property to others looking for a quality location in Lincoln."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible restored property!!! I am born and raised in Lincoln, IL. Of course I had driven by the yellow stucco building throughout my life. I do know it fell into bad disrepair. What Terry did is truly spectacular. This building is historic and Terry lovingly restored it to its pristine original condition. The pictures absolutely do not do it justice. You have to see all the original woodwork and architectural features that he restored in person to truly appreciate what he did with the property. I was so comfortable staying there and I actually got a bit excited to walk through the door each day. The updated part of the renovation is also very tasteful. The modernized kitchen, bathrooms, etc. made it even more inviting. The bed was also very comfortable and the sheets and duvet were luxurious. I absolutely will be staying in this property again!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Terry was actually working next door when we pulled up. He helped us with the code on the door. It was finicky but once you figured it out - easy. The place felt like home immediately. Very well decorated and clean. The best part for us was the covered porch area. A perfect place to relax and watch the cars go by. Lincoln is a small town so not many go by ;). We will definitely stay here again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Terrys! The space was very comfortable and clean. Would highly recommend staying at Terrys!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous loft style space in the middle of Lincoln. Loved the sound of the train rumbling by.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our group was in the area for a national dog agility competition at the Illinois State Fairgrounds. We loved The Hawthorne, it was perfect for our group of three adults and our agility dogs. There were many great restaurants in the area, a park, and it wasn't too far from the venue.
Megan was very flexible, responsive and helpful. Parking on the street is available for day hours, and a free municipal lot is available a couple blocks away for overnight parking.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and were so appreciative the apartment was pet friendly!"

The accommodations were impeccably suited to our group, and without a doubt, we would stay again when we are in Lincoln!!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Would have been nice to know there is no parking in front. Had to carry all of our bags from down the block and overnight parking is somewhere else. Also, train goes by very often and is very close and loud. If you're not used to trains it can be hard trying to sleep with the horns blowing every few hours."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the space that we all had within the rental. Thank you for having us!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks again for welcoming us to Lincoln! We very much enjoy staying at the Hawthorne location!

Highly recommend this well kept place for a quick weekend getaway or a place to gather the families! Thanks again for everything!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Hawthorne was a great place to stay for our visit with local family. It is very spacious and clean. The loft portion was great for my kids to hang out. Note: If you are tall, you will have to duck on the loft portion as the ceilings are low. We love the location being in the heart of the historic district. Cute shops, great coffee and pastries, and a movie theater are all a short walk away."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stay here every time I'm in the Lincoln area.
Megan is a great host and always very friendly and accommodating."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was super cute and fun. We really enjoyed walking to the The Spirited Republic for a drink and dinner at Guzzardos Italian Villa. The movie theater has any movie you could want from horror to Taylor Swift.
In regards to our stay, if the heat is on keep the doors to the bedrooms open when sleeping. The bedrooms got super hot, but were much nicer when the doors were left open.
If we get back to Lincoln, we would definitely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here with our 3 adult kids and 4 grandkids. There was plenty of room for everyone. Each “family” had their private space with 2 bedrooms and the loft area. The loft area was especially fun for the kids as there were board games furnished and a TV area. They Loved it!
It was stocked with everything we needed during our stay and Megan even offered to provide a pack-n-play and portable high chair!
We highly recommend giving it a try. Thank you Megan."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Megan is a terrific host. The property is a recently renovated historic building in heart of Lincoln, IL close to both Springfield and Bloomington.
The galley is equipped with everything you need. the furniture is comfortable with plenty of room spread out. wireless connectivity was very good.
The location is easy walking distance to train, grocery, coffee shops, parks, several restaurants and a micro brewery.
Thank you for your hospitality.
I plan return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Megan is an excellent host. As you can see by the rating, her apartment was as advertised. She was also very prompt in answering questions I had via email.
This booking is on a nice part of town. A delightful coffee cafe p, restaurant, microbrewery, ice cream & shops all within walking distance from rental. Recommend this booking. We certainly will use the next time we’re in town. Thank you Megan!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, well -thought out historic home on the courthouse square. It is walkable to shopping, coffee, wine & beer bar and some restaurants. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, great place, once again proving that airbnb beats hotel stays hands down. The Loft is not for tall people (lol) but that's fine, the place is huge, the beds are great, kitchen is great, everything was as we hoped.
Lincoln itself has some food and bars within a 1 minute walk (though the taco place isn't actually there contrary to what the most common search engine says).
All in all, you can't go wrong here! Megan responds really fast, too!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lincoln Lofts were perfect for our family of 6: beautiful, relaxing, and functional.
This loft feels very spacious, thanks to the upstairs living room, game room, and sleeping area. My kids loved having their own little upstairs to play in. The kitchen has everything you need to make meals for a large family, and there are great restaurants in the area if you would rather not cook.
This was a great find for our family and we would definitely stay here again when we travel to the area in the future."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Review
This stylish prohibition-era inspired loft is more than your typical Air B&B experience. This location provides modern amenities and comforts with an added bit of interest and fun. Everything we needed for our stay was provided, the beds were comfortable and the TV was pre loaded with Netflix to keep our little ones entertained while we got situated. The place was clean, organized and easy to quickly settle into. Megan was very responsive and clear with instructions so there were no lingering questions or concerns as everything was provided up front.
We had 3 adults and three kids (7, 5 and 2), all slept comfortably. We did notice the baby gate below the stairs which was a nice consideration. The upstairs area slept my 5 and 7 year old with no problem. I am 6’1” and had to duck my head about an inch to walk around but watching a movie or playing poker at the table, you wouldn’t have to worry about that. The remainder of the space was open and very comfortable.
The loft is conveniently located within walking distance of a several food and drink options and a park/playground. Overnight parking is not allowed at curbside but there is a public lot around the corner. I was a little nervous about it at first but I awoke in the morning to find my van plus a handful of other cars there, all untouched. Overall, I felt the area was safe despite some of the surrounding buildings and homes being in disrepair. That said, there are several places like Lincoln’s Loft as well as Mama’s Arcade Cafe and The Guest House Coffee Shop which lead me to believe Lincoln may be on the cusp of re-emerging as a community deeply rooted in its own history while altogether writing a vibrant new chapter. I highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We Absolutely Loved our stay! Luxurious bedding and towels, lots of extras offered (we got 2 floor fans) and great location! walking around the square was nice! Movie theater just around the corner, coffee shops & restaurants all close.
Take a chance on ""Chances R"" a small local bar with great food & super friendly folks!! We enjoyed the jukebox & playing pool there after the great bar food!!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing stay, tons of little details that show the host really goes above and beyond."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The theme was so fun and all the extras were fantastic. We had everything we needed and more. It was just what we needed. Parking was a bit of a pain with a lot of kids and only one adult but we made it work.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment! Love the location - right off the town square. We walked to Guest House (coffee shop) every morning for coffee, which was lovely. It's also close to the park, IGA, ice cream shop, and a few bars. The apartment itself was nice - the photos are accurate, and it's spacious and airy. It was nice to have a few rooms + a loft so our baby could be in his own room and my mom could stay with us as well. It's worth noting that there's no bathtub (only really matters if you have a baby/kids like us). I really appreciate that Megan left a pack n play & high chair for us to use during our stay. She is a great communicator. We hope to come back and stay again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Megan will make sure you are taken care of. If you are looking for something unexpected in little Lincoln Illinois give it a try.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a last minute trip to Lincoln, Il and stumbled upon this amazing loft! It was right in the heart of town, and so cozy. The decor was so neat! I wish this loft could be my apartment! It is so fun! It was super clean, everything we could have possibly needed while we were there.

This loft is just incredible, and we will definitely be back to stay! Thanks for the great stay, Megan!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! The host was also very friendly and flexible.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"The place is perfect. Every detail, down to the wall hangings and articles are spot on."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family very much enjoyed our stay at the Lincoln Lofts. The space was perfect for our needs. It allowed our family to gather and spread out as necessary. And the convenience of walking to dinner downtown was second to none. Megan has done a fantastic job with the property, and we look forward to staying there the next time our travels take us to Lincoln."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lincoln’s loft is beautifully decorated and has just about everything you can think of that you’d need during a stay. We all stayed comfortably and were able to enjoy some Christmas festivities on the square as well including a carriage ride. The square is full of quaint unique shops and restaurants if you don’t feel like cooking. Great experience!!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"It was a beautiful place to stay, had everything you could think of. She was even accommodating to my ESA which helped me better enjoy my stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just a lovely remodel to these old downtown buildings. everything for comfort and functionality.

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"A clean, comfortable and stylish loft that allowed our extended family a wonderful weekend stay. Megan was kind and gracious (we shattered the french press) and a great communicator. We would definitely return and hope to do so. It was very conveniently located to everything you could want to get to downtown. Yes, the trains are loud, but we took our noise machines, and the white noise drowned it all out through the night. Washing my son's college laundry was a breeze in the nice machines as well."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect place to stay in Lincoln. Right off the square. Clean and well appointed. First choice to stay again next time we’re in town
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place. Clean, comfortable, greatly decorated and quite roomy. However, I did not notice under the “health and safety - you must also acknowledge” page that parking is off premises since the “what this place offers” stated “on premises” parking. You can not park in the front of the loft from 2am to 5am and have a 3-4 minute walk around the corner and down a block or so. Going into a strange town and having to walk to the loft after dark was not my cup of tea, especially with a rowdy bar with people walking around a short ways down."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a 5/5! Megan was super quick at getting back to us when I messaged her, the place is clean and gives off a historic vibe. The wifi was really fast! We will be back for sure"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place. Within walking distance of restaurants and parks etc. even though several of us grew up in Lincoln ,

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my family's second stay in the Lincoln Loft properties and both experiences have been excellent.

My 6 year-old and 9 year-old sons also loved having their own space in the loft."

We will definitely stay here again, tons of space for our large family to be comfortable!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a 5 star stay! The loft is super clean with some very cool touches. Beds were nice and comfy as were the couches for hanging out and watching tv. Also, tv's are nice and big with free Netflix! The location is perfect with the Alley Bi (great burgers) next door, Spirited brewery right down the street and top Hat Creamery also down the street. It was nice to have drinks and be able to walk home. Very safe area too. We left to come home well before the sun came up and was happy to see police driving around checking on things. It was only my husband and I but you could have 8 to 10 people and never feel crowded. Megan was a great host and I cannot recommend this place enough!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect location, comfortable, lots of thoughtful decor, and great space for feiends and family."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Communication was great during, before, and after the stay. The place was VERY clean which we appreciated during this time. There was plenty of room for our party of 10. Loved the location and it seemed the other suites would be a great place to stay as well. There was not enough silverware or plates for a group of 10 but that was not a problem for us sine we had most of our meals out (just want to mention in case there are parties looking as big as ours). This places has not been open long so there many be plans to add more place settings in the future. And we could not find as great of a place anywhere near this area for the price! I would recommend any of Megan's suites to anyone interested in seeing the Lincoln, Springfield area. We has the best time and many lifelong memories were made. Thank you Megan!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We didn't get in until late, but my kids thought this place was just great! They loved the little loft upstairs! Check in was easy, very nice space and our stay here started our family road trip off the right way!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an absolutely beautiful loft!! Clean, very well organized with wonderful details & a warm, historic feel. Best coffee & tea station I’ve seen yet in an Airbnb. After a long road trip with four teens, we appreciated the bottled waters in the fridge & access to a washer/dryer. Having two sitting spaces worked great with our teenagers while we visited with our friends. My kids loved the record player...so fun! We enjoyed dinner at Guzzardos, and breakfast at Flossie & Delena’s. Bought some fun things from the antique & Hallmark shops. Great town & everything within walking distance! If we had more time (and no kids) we would have checked out the fun pubs! Excellent communication & clear/easy instructions. We definitely plan to return when we visit our friends again, and visit the Lincoln museums next time. Thank you for going above & beyond for your guests!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Megan's place was thoughtfully designed for a relaxing and comfortable stay! She definitely put a lot of time and effort into the setup and decor. Would definitely recommend!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We went to this property for a quick trip downstate to enjoy getting out of the city for a while. The property comfortably slept 7 adult men (with a few guys on couches). The space is even bigger than it looks on the listing and is in great condition. We enjoyed being able to walk to several bars and restaurants around the town square, and it is walking distance to a grocery store as well. Several of us arrived via Amtrak which also was walking distance to the property.
The train noise mentioned in the listing was not really noticeable to us. We all felt that the value was incredible for such a large space. The municipal (free) parking was nearby and easy to find as well. This was such a great getaway for a weekend. We also had the pleasure of meeting the host in-person and it was so fun to hear about the history of the town including some cool associations with Al Capone."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful condo for our family trip to Lincoln. Loved the convenience to the coffee shops and restaurants around the square.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,updated home close to the square
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place !
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Lincoln’s Loft was a amazing experience for me and my guest if I wasn’t leaving for bootcamp I would stay longer there you have a pizza place a few buildings down, parking is free and that place it’s self was clean and had no issues with my stay would highly recommend for your stay in Lincoln"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lincoln’s Loft is a must stay. The layout is open and spacious. Very convenient location to the square. Great finishes and furnishings.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Super clean and cozy. Location is pretty great, you can walk anywhere in 5 minutes or less. I recommend trying the Top Hat Creamery for ice cream! There is also two parks within walking distance for kids. There is train tracks super close that I was worried about, but never heard any at night (I’m a light sleeper and so is my little) , and any trains that went by in the day were barely noticed. Super neat place. We would definitely stay here again. Also Megan was super quick to reply and very helpful."
