2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was pleasantly surprised, the home was cozy, the neighborhood was quiet. Jeremiah was quick to respond to any issue or questions I had. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Jeremiah was a great host and the house was perfect. We felt right at home. Plan on making this our go-to place when we visit our daughter in college.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, quiet, close to Roanoke, clean."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We recently stayed two nights at this cozy, well-decorated home and really enjoyed it. It was clean, comfortable, had everything we needed and plenty of space for everyone to relax and enjoy their weekend. The Plex library was top-notch and the wi-fi held up to all of our devices super well! Special shoutout for the Patio recommendation -- their pizza was fantastic and reasonably priced. Thanks Jeremiah and family for an awesome AirBNB!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and comfortable. I was happy to get to stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of my fav places to stay when I’m in town. A good value for the money, a lovely kitchen that’s easy to cook in!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Quiet neighborhood and cozy home. The home inside is like advertised and the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom was small but still just fine enough for our needs. The bathroom sink has very small counter space but its not a deal breaker. The tv was nice and had lots of movies. The kitchen was very big and nice and had everything we needed. Everything was really nice and the home is super cozy for a fair price. I will definitely come back when i'm in the area again.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeremiah is a great host. My third time staying there and is always perfect for what I need.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very tastefully done.
The home was very clean and very welcoming with adequate everything to meet our needs.
Thank you for all the extra touches and especially the snacks in the kitchen.
We would stay there again if any occasion has us in that area.
Thank yoi"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's my second time staying at jeremiah's place. It is always clean and peaceful and exactly what i needed it for.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, lots of snacks. Very nice place."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed one night here while traveling for business. Jeremiah was friendly, helpful & responsive, even allowing me to check out an hour late, which was helpful for my schedule.
Of course, in a town like this the pickings are pretty slim. There is only one hotel in Huntington, and I do NOT recommend it. So, in perspective, this house is fine...with one glaring exception: you could not pay me to step foot in the shower. It was disturbingly gross. I would attach pix (I took some), but AirBnB doesn't allow that (which seems like a serious flaw in their system). But just trust me, it was NASTY. The rest of the house seemed fairly clean, so this was really strange. But I have a hard time not being skeeved out by everything else when the shower is this visibly gross. Also, there is no counter space in the bathroom,, which is fairly inconvenient. Otherwise, the place was just fine and served its purpose."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, nice host…"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here with friends multiple
Times. EVERY time things are perfect! Clean, comfortable, convenient, small details like yummy snacks, excellent communication! We will be back for sure!"

We would definitely stay here again."

Jeremiah is a great host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a cozy, beautiful home close by all of the shops and restaurants in Roanoke!
Our weekend plans were rained out, so we ended up spending the whole weekend inside snuggled up with good books and movies.
The house was so lovely we didn't even mind being stuck inside for our weekend away!
We would definitely love to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"a perfect, quiet, and cozy place if you're looking to recharge your batteries."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for our quick visit to HU to visit our son. Bathroom was a bit tight and shower had a constant drip to it, but otherwise the house was very clean with many recent updates. Enjoyed the cold water and snacks that were available when we checked in."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house! The outside was a little deceiving but the house was great. The bathroom is pretty tiny for having three bedrooms but it fit our needs just fine. It was clean, comfortable and had everything you needed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place to stay. It was very quite so no disturbances during the night. Very clean house. Definitely recommend staying here.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We felt right at home as soon as we walked in the house. Curl up on the reclining sofa under one of the soft blankets. The lighting is perfect. Big screen Tv with plenty of show options. The kitchen is a dream. HUGE backyard. It has quite a slope but levels out for sitting. The only issue was the driveway. You back out onto the street right at a curve. I would suggest backing into the driveway. The town’s park is in walking distance. They had water bottles in the fridge and snacks on the counter. Easy access with a lockbox. 1 bathroom with a walk-in shower. It has grip bars and a seat if needed. The bed was very comfortable. We slept downstairs but there are 2 more bedrooms upstairs. The thermostat is tricky. I would ask for instructions from the host. We will definitely rent here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great space for a short stay. Only one bathroom, but totally doable depending on your situation!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very sweet, updated home with plenty of space for us and close to family. We are very thankful to have found it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at this beautiful Roanoke location.
Love relaxing in the Adirondack Chairs overlooking this beautiful back yard after a long day."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. Great snacks and water.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We so appreciated getting to stay at Jeremiah's airbnb for a week! He was so helpful and accommodating and his house was the perfect place to stay and feel all the comfort of being 'at home.'
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay in Roanoke was relaxing and peaceful. The Air Bnb was organized, orderly, nicely furnished and clean. Our host Jeremiah was kind and communicated well with us…very professional Air Bnb Host. Highly recommend!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice place to stay when visiting family and friends in the area. Located within minutes to entertainment and food.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a delightful little house that is somehow both in the middle of Roanoke and yet was so quiet. The host offered extra little surprises … like snacks and cold water. Very thoughtful! The house was clean and smelled very nice. Check in and out was extremely easy. Would definitely stay again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,location was absolutely perfect. Me and my husband had sold their home and were in the process of buying another one and staying with family so we needed a night away and this home was perfect for stress-free environment and a kick back and relax. Jeremiah was very helpful The Home was exactly as described. The snacks on the counter in the complementary coffee and tea was a wonderful surprise would definitely recommend this to anyone

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had booked for a girls weekend trip & this place & Roanoke we're just perfect! The house was just as described, also very cute, very clean & welcoming!! One nice touch was the snacks, bottled water & some breakfast items to eat in the morning. That was really nice since there are not a lot of breakfast choices in Roanoke. Roanoke is a great getaway for a girls trip, lots of cute boutiques & eateries! It's also just a nice relaxing little town! Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Was grateful to find a last minute place to stay in Roanoke, as the town was quaint and very friendly. Jeremiah was very quick to respond with the couple questions that I had. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time at Jeremiah's place. It was exactly as it was described and Jeremiah was a great host. The home was perfect for what we needed. The kitchen had everything and all appliances were newly replaced. He even put out snacks on the counter for us and water bottles in fridge. It was a very cozy home that gave you the home away from home feeling. We will definitely visit again. Thank you Jeremiah!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in Roanoke! Cozy, comfortable, felt homey. The beds were so comfortable! Nicely set up kitchen, host had snacks, water and breakfast items, which were a nice touch. We were given flexibility in a late check out which let us have extra time to see out of town friends. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean and cozy place in a lovely town
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy place, well decorated and clean. Breakfast amenities were included and that was really nice. Warm even in a bitter winter."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very enjoyable stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful and lovely!! We enjoyed our time there immensely!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful older home. Free of clutter so was nice since we were traveling with younger children. Would recommend that they get the shower fixed because it drips and also install a motion sensor light outside since we arrived in the dark and there was not a porch light. Would recommend and will stay there again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,our 2nd time staying and everything was perfect! we got an early check in to enjoy the space even longer. lots of snacks provided and a well stocked kitchen. beds are super comfy. would definitely recommend staing here if you are in the area. roanoke is a great little town to spend the day in!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect place if you’d like somewhere that’s close to walk to eat or shop! Everything was extremely clean and the hosts were very thoughtful, even leaving us bottled water in the fridge and a bowl of snacks in the kitchen! The only downside was that there was not access to closets in any of the rooms and the water temperature was a bit on the warm side. Huge backyard with great views!"
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is probably suitable for 1 person, or a couple, but definitely not for a family stay. The bathroom situation is not good. Very tiny with no tub for kids. The shower head is awful and drips constantly 24/7. The shower curtain is not installed properly thus creating a huge challenge to keep all of the water within the shower surround. While the house was generally clean, the linens did not smell fresh and we fought allergy issues for the entire stay. There is no outdoor lighting for the parking area. You will have to load/unload in the dark if you are coming and/or going after dusk. The door locks do not all function properly, so we were unable to completely secure the home while we were gone. The kitchen was functional yet underwhelming. The lack of a dishwasher makes for more work if you plan on cooking at the home. I think it's fair to say our expectations were not met for a family stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cozy home with a great kitchen in a peaceful loving town.
Great restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! So cute, just like listing. Jeremiah was great with communication. Good/shopping so close!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this was a great place to stay! the surrounding area and activities are so nice. the downtown area is full of cuteness. jeremiah made the whole process so easy.
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,very lovely home. Jeremiah was a excellent host and downtown was very nice and had good restaurants to eat at. Would definitely stayed there again
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly what the listing showed and was perfect for our trip! Very nice furniture and comfortable beds, and walking distance away from local shops and restaurants on Main Street in a quiet, peaceful town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house to stay in, it was well kept and extremely clean upon arrival. You get what you see and it’s more than what you pay for. Highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay for a girls weekend away! Check-in was a breeze! The house is easy to find in a nice quiet neighborhood conveniently located between Fort Wayne and Huntington so lots of options of restaurants and activities nearby. The house was very clean and decorated very cute and comfy just as the pictures show. The beds and furniture were so comfortable we enjoyed our downtime just relaxing at the house just as much as we did our planned activities! The big bowl of various snacks and freezer of breakfast foods were an added bonus! I highly recommend staying here if you need a nice, clean, cute and comfy stay at a very reasonable rate!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated and great view!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was such a cute home! The beds were comfy, the extra snacks were a nice surprise. Everything was smooth and easy from check in to check out! If you stay in Roanoke- this is a great value!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was easy to find, updated and private. I stayed on the main floor and found the bed and pillows to be really comfortable. I slept great on the quiet road that was walkable to the lovely downtown area. It felt very safe.
I almost didn’t choose this gem because of someone else’s review of the bathroom saying how tiny it was. It really was fine. It had a full size ceiling, tub-sized shower with good water pressure, a full size toilet, room for dirty laundry and a small sink. I was able to move comfortably without banging into anything.
Jeremiah was easy to communicate with and invited me to message with any problems or questions. The kitchen was beautifully updated and stocked with seasonings, coffee, olive oil, dishes, cookware, appliances and anything you may need! Very thoughtful!
Great stay and great little town! I highly recommend this house!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice stay. I wish I would have had more time to enjoy it
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nicely remodeled house in a quiet neighborhood in wonderful Roanoke.
Highly recommend it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the house was beautiful! definitely a homey vibe, felt very comfortable. host was very friendly and quick with communication!! 10/10!!!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Roanoke is a very nice small town. Took morning and evening walks and never felt insecure. Restaurants were good and everyone in town was very hospitable
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Jeremiah’s was very nice! The check in process was easy, the house was clean, and the location was charming. He provided water and snacks, as well as some toiletries. The only complaint was the bathroom was small for 5 people to share. There are mirrors in every bedroom though for getting ready."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet home away from home! Jeremiah is an excellent host!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great space. safe quiet neighbor hood in walking distance to anything in downtown roanoke. the host provided snacks, fresh made ice and breakfast items! that was a nice surprise. the space is well decorated, comfortable and clean. plenty of room for family and friends. easy to find, easy check in and checkout. will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was beautiful and peaceful, decorated very nice"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value for this clean and thoughtfully furnished home. Thanks Jeremiah!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!! Very clean and cozy!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great peaceful stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jeremiah had great prompt communication with us the entire time; even when our plans changed, he was very flexible and accommodating. The location was great with being so close to Roanoke Main Street. Beds were very comfortable and the place even had private parking. Would highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home is very clean and well kept. We were in town for a college visit and it was close to everything. Communication was great. Jeremiah left snacks and goodies for our stay. We would definitely recommend staying!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,super clean and cozy and close enough to walk down town and get food it was perfect
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable, wonderful home with charm and character. It definitely deserves its 5 out of 5 stars. We found it very clean and ready for us, with some pleasant surprises like snacks and starter food! It is obvious that the hosts put care into choosing the furnishings. The kitchen is the most stocked we have ever had. It's rare to find as nice of knife set, coffee maker, toaster, silverware, cooking equipment as this house has...and we utilized all of those things during our stay. The beds are very comfortable, the bathroom towels are fluffy and nice, and we even took note how comfy the throw blankets in the living room were, and used them quite a bit! The layout was perfect for our family of 6. The wifi was extremely fast. Just a couple notes that may help future guests: the bathroom is small (note this did not bother us at all). We knew it was an older remodeled home and it was what we would expect. Also their listing does clearly state there is not laundry so we knew ahead of time, but on a longer stay, that would be a challenge. Again, it was not a problem at all for this 5 night stay. The host was an excellent communicator and the check in / out process was seamless. We were 100% satisfied, even impressed, and we will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great communication and quick responses.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeremiah keeps a very clean, cozy house! Check-in was incredibly quick and easy. The beds are very comfortable, and there’s plenty of blankets and pillows. There were little snacks left in the kitchen, and water in the fridge. The cost was also incredibly fair, definitely well worth it!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house was wonderful! It has all the necessities and more. Our hosts thought of everything we could need, and they communicated efficiently and professionally. I would suggest bringing a fan for the bedroom if you sleep warm (it's all air conditioned, but with older houses, air movement can be restricted sometimes). This place is a stone's throw from some fun shopping, great eateries, an amazing winery, and in just a few minutes, you can get to larger cities.
Check it out, and you won't be disappointed!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was impeccably clean! The beds and pillows were very comfortable, the Wi-Fi reliable, & the air conditioning fully functioning. There was plenty of hot water, plenty of bath and kitchen towels, nice snacks and water provided, and nice new dishes, appliances, and cooking utensils. It has a comfortable and inviting atmosphere with very calm and pleasant decor.
The host, Jeremiah, was very responsive to our inquiries."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great. Jeremiah was great. Value was great.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was excellent! It was so clean, and, though it's not listed as an amenity, Jeremiah provided little snacks and waters and things. Just a note, the bathroom is SMALL. It was EXTREMELY clean, and we enjoyed it, but if you're looking for a luxurious bathroom, this isn't it. Again, the amenities included were great! Fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The kitchen, on the other hand, is HUGE. They provide pots, pans, and seasonings. It was a great base of operations for our vacation.
The house was really clean, the furnishings were super comfy, and the neighborhood was quiet. My three boys LOVED it, and my husband and I enjoyed the privacy that comes with getting a whole house."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Really nice place. Very quiet & perfect for me and my friends. exactly like the pictures.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, the house was clean and well maintained. The kitchen had everything we needed there were even snacks for us to enjoy. The beds were comfy too. The host was very quick to respond to any questions I had. 10/10 would recommend and stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spacious, clean private house in a quiet neighborhood just blocks away from a small downtown area that has more great dining options than towns many, many times Roanoke’s size—I tried and enjoyed three of them! Also close to Fort Wayne & Huntington, both of which were important to me on this trip. Good communication."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,House was great. Had everything that we needed. We didn’t spend much time in the house though. We were impressed with the stuff to do in Roanoke. Thumbs up!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay. Clean, everything you need is provided, owners went above and beyond to make the stay comfortable, even including various food items like frozen breakfast sandwiches. Nice location, quite area, I talked to a neighbor lady and she was very nice. Nothing bad to say about any aspect of this stay, THANK YOU!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean! Awesome furnishings! Wonderful place to stay! Would have loved a outdoor area to sit.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was very cool and super clean
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This host makes you feel like you’re a family member visiting. The home has been updated and taken care of to a very high standard. Very thoughtful host that provides amenities(shampoo, bottled water, etc)that really allows you to focus on the point of the stay instead of running to stores. Old town Roanoke was nice also. Nice public park in walking distance with playground and baseball fields. Airport is 15 min away. The host is more than responsive to your messages before, during, and after the stay. I would book it again if my work takes me back to this area. 110%"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, quiet, and clean home!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay during our basketball tournament. From the beginning the host made accommodations for us to add a day to our stay. Then the stay was made exceptional by the small details such as snacks, fully stocked kitchen and toiletries. I was with teenagers so they had no interest going into town but it was a few blocks from a cute little downtown area. We stay at Air BnB frequently and this was one of the best!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,nice clean place we felt right at home. easy instructions would visit again
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This quiet place was just what we were looking for while staying in Indiana. Everything was just as it was listed and our family had a wonderful stay! They even had pamphlets with areas we could go if we wanted to! The house was thoughtfully decorated and we enjoyed our time there!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Didn’t get to do much around the town I was there for work. The house was great

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. The house was just as pictured, had all of the basic amenities we needed for our stay and was very clean. We met Candie and she was very friendly and helpful. We will be returning guests in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 3 weeks at this location. I cant say enough about our lodging and hosts. Candie was awesome to deal with. Our place with just as described and was as big and nice as the pictures showed. It was worth the money.
Do not hesitate to stay. I will again no doubt.
Wabash is a beautiful and scenic area. Im looking forward to doing more work in that area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as advertised and better!
Hosts are great to talk to and personable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was exactly as described, absolutely spotless. So close to where we wanted to be. Definitely recommend. We will be back for sure."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing little “retreat” in a beautiful and charming location, all within the city limits of a small river town.
Kurt and Heidi are absolutely wonderful hosts.
I will certainly be back to The Shed Resort again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little cottage type airbnb! The chickens do greet you every time you come and go! So cute! The host was so nice too and had a nice chat with her and she showed us the kitchen area in the garage. Such an adorable little place. Very clean, and smelled wonderful inside as well!!! And I love the little book where guests can write about their trip and stay while they stayed here, such a cute idea!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. There was meticulous care to provide a very clean environment and they even left a couple of cupcakes with a small hand written note, which was very appreciated. Due to an unfortunate incident on our end, we were only able to stay a couple of hours and didn't get to complete our stay as planned, but in the short time we were there, we really enjoyed this little goat shed turned mini home. Listening to the creek babble while sitting outside was our favorite part. There was also a very friendly cat who did his part to make us feel right at home and the chickens out front were a nice touch too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only needed one night but had a great sleep. Very relaxing setting, Kurt and Heidi have an awesome piece of land and they provide everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Highly recommend if in the area, a very peaceful place."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet, rural location! Great place to unwind and relax"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt & Heidi were amazing hosts! The Shed Retreat was truly a retreat….peaceful, beautiful, restful. We were greeted by their two lovely outdoor cats who became fast friends of ours. We sat around the bonfire practically all day, with the cozy outdoor lights on. We cooked over the bonfire, read, did puzzles, all while listening to the chickens in their coop. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a peaceful place to unplug!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we were so happy to find a small retreat to stay at, Kurt & Heidi are great people. Their kitty cats are adorable, it was warm and cozy and soft and easy. just like indiana, nature, and god should be. 💕🙏"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kurt and Heidi are so kind. They even left a personalized welcome note! The shed retreat is the perfect place for a peaceful getaway. I hope to go back again soon!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The shed and its surrounding area looked beautiful with the different colored leaves that had come with the fall weather. The place was warm and relaxing and the area is quiet and peaceful. I appreciated the hosts always going the extra mile and making sure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. The shed really was a truly unique experience that I’d love to have again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE, completely enjoyable AirB&B experience less than two hours from home, in my own home state!
I didn’t have much time to read about this one ahead of time, but I booked it because I read “shed.” I’ve overnighted in just about every situation, but never a shed.
What I had for just one night was a very cozy, peaceful, and extremely enjoyable escape.
Thank you, Kurt & Heidi, for taking care of every detail and providing a haste-free experience in a lovely setting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this beautiful, little place! They allowed early check-in and since no one had booked the place after me, allowed me to stay later as well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal in every way.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kurt and Heidi are excellent hosts! The place was peaceful and well taken care of. Highly recommend and plan to visit again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cozy little place is on a beautiful property with beautiful big OLD trees. It is very comfortable and quiet. I slept in longer than I had in a long time! It is also close to town and the college. It was a very peaceful get away.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cutest getaway, so cozy and felt like home. So serene and had all the amenities you would need. We will definitely be coming back!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The setting is gorgeous, underneath these massive Sycamore trees. Lots of privacy. The two cats were very welcoming and friendly and reminded us of our own. Would have loved to stay a bit longer and walk the trail and see the river."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking peaceful surroundings in a rustic setting, you will love the Shed retreat. We learned some interesting things about foot pump faucets and camp toilets while enjoying the lovely antique furnishings, suoer comfortable mattress and fleece bathrobes. Kurt and Hiedi, your prayers for us were answered."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were very hospitable, going ""above and beyond,"" providing cupcakes as a welcome gift. They described their place accurately - including the story of the space, the neighboring chicken coop, and the camp toilet and outdoor shower (and instructions to use the community aquatic center as another option for showering). It's a lovely, peaceful, place for those who enjoy being close to nature :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and quiet place for a weekend getaway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the Mexican restaurant down the road, very quaint and quiet, great price for a great place. LOVED THE CATS"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a nice stay. Sadly we only had 1 night and a quick turn around. Hopefully we can return with time to actually relax.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a charming and relaxing place to stay. Hope to visit again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place! Cozy and relaxing. It has an outdoor toilet and shower but that’s part of the experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The shed retreat is a hidden gem. Lots of greenery, privacy, cozy, rustic and comfortable shed. There are things to do if you want or just enjoy the peaceful retreat and hide away."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I drive the Amish places and Im looking forward to stay again. Peaceful and restful. Thank u the stay and the muffins was so good.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is a very quiet and beautifully decorated place... accompanied by cats and fireflies...the bed is really very comfortable... Kurt and heidi, are very nice and very responsive to our requests ... really a location as we love them.... and thank you for the tasty muffins when we arrive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,just the place I needed for my getaway weekend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute shed with a welcoming relaxing atmosphere
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A genuinely special experience
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet. It matched the description and the trail down to the river was a nice bonus. Kurt and Heidi have restored this shed to something very enjoyable and needed for people wanting a retreat from the busyness of life.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay very much
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. Although close to the house, it felt like a completely private little oasis. We spent a lot of time sitting outside, and it was very peaceful and relaxing. All the nice added touches were much appreciated. The bed was incredibly comfortable as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The shed is a great getaway from city life!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Though we live in the country surrounded by trees with a creek running through it, the Shed Retreat, though similar to our usual surroundings similar, was much more! If you want a peaceful, cozy spot to tuck away from the buzz of everyday life, you can't go wrong with Kurt and Heidi's place. It's close to town amenities yet located in country surroundings within a quiet neighborhood we felt safe in. We weren't sure what the compost toilet experience would be like, but it was super user-friendly, no pun intended, and only added to the experience. It's clear Kurt and Heidi put thoughtful effort into making their place and our stay special. Everything was as advertised and then some."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Shed Retreat is a great little space! Exactly as described and hosts go the extra mile to welcome guests and extend hospitality.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The shed is cute and cozy. would happily stay again
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay here and commuted to Fort Wayne during the day for a conference. It was cozy, relaxing, and pleasant and Kurt and Heidi were able to supply us with a few things we had forgotten to bring. We especially loved the fresh eggs and the fire pit!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat was clean, adorable and so cozy for our Anniversary celebration getaway. Just what we were looking for. Kurt & Heidi were very accommodating & helped us with a last minute reservation."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a great location and such a cozy place. Perfect for a girls weekend. Every detail was so thoughtful and made us feel so loved. Will definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat is a perfect and cozy retreat to get away from the business of the world and just rest and humble yourself in nature. The cats are super friendly and greeted me each morning which was very sweet. Unfortunately, my stay called for wet and cold weather but I think the fireplace and the extended grounds close to the creek would've been a great place to enjoy the surroundings and reflect on life. I really enjoyed the photo book detailing how the shed came to be, as well as perusing the several games and books inside the cabinet. This would be a great getaway for couples as there were several books/games available to re-get to know each other and share with each other. I would definitely recommend this location for couples. It's also close to Warsaw which has a cute lake and stores to explore."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying in this oasis and I can’t wait to plan my next time. My favorite retreat!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cute place to stay, alot to do and enjoy on the property. Kurt is a super host, very informative and willing to go out of his way to help you out."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed was wonderful :) The cats were so sweet and followed us around everywhere we went. The outdoor shower was an adventure at first glance but it was easy to setup and was one of the most refreshing showers I’ve had. The sounds of nature mixed with the natural light is its own sensation.
Thank you Kurt and Heidi for having us!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Wonderful little place to rejuvenate.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my revisit to this place. Even the second time, I felt this place was unique and pleasant calm stay in the woods. Especially walking down into the creek and spending time around with forest environment was amazing. Always liked welcome muffins by Kurt and Heidi and also good time with the kitten around. Also attended a music concert at downtown which was a very easy drive and a fun place to hang around. Definitely recommended place for anyone's stay"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean place
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very cute and cozy place to stay
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location was ideal and the amenities and communication were above and beyond. I highly recommend and definitely know we will be back :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The glowing reviews are absolutely justified. As hosts, as a location, the amenities, the comfortable and cosy touches… this is an incredible place to stay. I would highly recommend the Shed Retreat to anyone thinking about staying there."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is by far one of the best airbnbs that we have ever stayed at (we are counting our stays here by the handfuls at this point!). A simple getaway, thoughtful hosts, a unique setting, and absolutely adorable accommodations. This visit called for poor weather, so Kurt and Heidi set up the garage with some indoor games for the kids and I to play so we wouldn’t be bored—I call that definitely going above and beyond. It was well appreciated and they truly are the sweetest hosts. 100% would recommend. Also to note is the adorable downtown area, library with community garden, several Little Free Libraries in the area, and a bomb thrift shop that my daughter and I discovered. ♥️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat is a very unique, clean, and comfortable stay! The homemade muffins were delicious and the bed is super comfortable. It's the perfect little place for a weekend adventure to North Manchester and neighboring towns. We found antiques and oddities, a covered bridge, a waterfall, ice cream, and a great bar for hamburgers and rings! Plus, it has been decades since I won a game of Battleship! Truly enjoyed our stay and the story/pictures of how this place came to be. Thank you, Kurt and Heidi!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. It was evident that a lot of care and thought has gone into making this little space as comfortable and welcoming as possible. For us, this stay checked all of our boxes, particularly being simple and affordable. The bathroom situation (toilet and shower outdoors) was no problem for us, and even added to the fun of our stay. I found myself especially appreciative of the house robes and shoes provided for our use - they made walking to the bathroom or using the shower a lot cleaner and easier than it could have been. Although we didn't meet Kurt and Heidi face to face during our stay, they were always quick to respond to questions, and available to help. I could certainly see us staying at the Shed Retreat again in the future. As parents it was the perfect little space to get away and reconnect for a couple days, without breaking the budget. We really appreciate what Kurt and Heidi have done with the space, and love that they've made it available."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was wonderful staying at the Shed Retreat! I literally made my annual retreat there (8 days) and found the setting and solitude perfect for letting my heart open up to the Lord's gracious love. Thanks to Heidi and Kurt for being such lovely hosts and providing the space (both physical and existential) I needed to discover how very loved I am by God.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Shed was just as described and it was a wonderful relaxing time for my husband and I to just get away and unplug for a few days! The location was great we did some hiking and there was even a little festival in town on Friday night that we happened upon. The bed was comfy and the cupcakes were a wonderful treat!! Thank you so much Kurt and Heidi for making such a peaceful getaway!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi have such a beautiful place and I highly recommend going there for some well deserved relax time. They were such thoughtful hosts with all the signage around, and creating a space that feels so homey. The cupcakes and robes were definite bonuses :-). My heart and soul needed this place when I stayed and I am so thankful I was able to reconnect with what matters most there. Thank y'all. <3"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely WONDERFUL place to stay! So calming and peaceful to hear nature and the town is quaint and well kept too! I was worried about the shower and toilet but both were not bad! Shower was warm and relaxing to hear the trees and birds around you. Hosts were friendly and so were all the animals! Would definitely recommend!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here! It’s such a cozy and relaxing getaway.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet, comfortable!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, quiet! Good value, good hosts!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely place is amazing and perfectly great. One can completely feel about privacy and have a great relaxing time here. With a lot of trees around with a nice trail and fireplace, this place makes you feel like somewhere in deep woods.
A very calm and friendly kitten around makes a greater feeling and morning wake-up call from roosters. The place is cozy and perfectly cleaned by Kurt & Heidi. With provided few kitchens and game accessories it will be great fun.
As the trail leads into a nice creek in the backyard, it will be a great time to spend around in the entire day time in the woods. Definitely love to visit this place again. Bottom line, if you are a true lover of nature then this is the PERFECT PLACE for your pleasant stay....!!!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 3rd visit and its wonderful every time! We love the peaceful space Kurt and Heidi have made for their guests and we look forward to the little treats left for us. We cant wait for our next visit!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place to get away I wish we were able to stay a little longer but visiting family we didn’t get too definitely worth the stay! Will definitely be coming back.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a nice stay. Enjoy sitting by the fire and enjoying the nature.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed. Such an amazing space
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liked it so much, I stayed a second time! Hosts were friendly and the space was perfect, just like the first time I stayed. Unfortunately, I just had time to catch some sleep before hitting the road early the next day. Would have liked to stay a few days to unwind! Maybe next time."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay with Kurt and Heidi. They have done an amazing job on with the creation of The Shed Retreat. Everything about our stay was perfect to the twinkle lights at night to the chickens and kitties outside. You won’t regret staying here in the cutest of towns. My husband and I will be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place to spend some time.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great spot! The “shed” was way more than I was asking for. Comfortable and restful spot (I think I might have slept better than at home). Friendly and helpful hosts made sure that I had everything I needed. They even had cupcakes waiting when I got there! Wonderful people and great value!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed here a handful of times and will continue to do so. Great hospitality, clean, unique, and a great little downtown area to check out with super friendly locals. A+"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! so quiet, clean and beautiful!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect weekend getaway! This place is so cozy with communicative and respectful hosts. I especially loved hanging out with the two cats and spending a sunny afternoon by the creek!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it’s a nice cozy place if you’re looking for a stay and i would highly suggest it, well worth it"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfectly peaceful place!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute and cozy little apartment in a peaceful setting, complete with a couple of really friendly cats and lovely chickens! The shed itself was warm, inviting and smelled wonderful inside. The hosts leave you to your own devices and honor privacy, while still responding quickly to communication through the Airbnb app. The toilet arrangement (a camp toilet outside and one you can take inside) most certainly isn’t for everyone. It was a little hard to handle at times, but certainly didn’t take away from my total experience. Also, because of the time of year, the outdoor shower on premises was not available (there are showers available at a local rec facility for a modest fee). If you can put up with these minor points, I would enthusiastically recommend this location to anyone visiting this area!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed is a perfect getaway spot. If you are looking to relax, this is the place! Cozy and Comfy!!
Perfect place to read a book, listen to music or take in the beautiful creation around you."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and quiet place! The Shed Retreat is a gem, and I hope to visit again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for a little get away. A quaint goat barn turned into an escape I’ll never forget. I felt tranquility and peacefulness listening to the creek babble as I took in the vibrant Fall colors. The crunch of the leaves a few steps down a cute wooded path made me reminisce my childhood growing up in Michigan. At night, the fire pit area was illuminated and beautified by adorning lights- like fireflies of summers past. The kittens sat in my lap purring me awake the next morning while enjoying coffee out front on the deck. Kurt and Heidi hit the nail on the head with the details of my new escape. They pray for those who find their way to the Shed. And pray for you while you’re here. And my soul could feel their healing words. Thank you so much for sharing this sacred space."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here. the atmosphere was cozy & peaceful. I felt very welcomed and the animals were such a great surprise. My son misses it already!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway location! My husband and I did a little ""retreat"" here for a weekend to shut our phones off and be in nature! Perfect location for that purpose. We enjoying spending an afternoon swimming at the fitness center up the road and eating Mexican at El Mezquite. The hosts do an excellent job at making the smaller space feel ""homey."" You get your own section by their house that feels like your own retreat center for your time there. Enjoy!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is ""luxury camping"" at it's finest. The rustic serenity cannot be adequately described with words, but must be experienced. The site is peaceful, the chickens are friendly (Fresh eggs for breakfast!) , and the cats are full of love. There is peace to be had here..."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The restroom situation is odd at first. But there is something soothing about taking a shower outdoors. It is private and tidy. More of a campers paradise than a hotel. While the two cats are quite friendly and affectionate. I would keep them away if you try to cook. The little doesn't have a lot of manners. All in all a great place for the price.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cutest property with the sweetest owners! We loved sitting by the fire pit with the cats. We will definitely be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The name says it all! If you are looking to feel far away from it all and experience the country and pampered camping this is it, the atmosphere was completely relaxing and laid back we will be returning!!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely place with beautiful trees and green grass near a creek. Ideal for young people. We are in our late 70’s and missed the creature comforts of indoor plumbing. However the weather was warm and outside showers were adequate and exhilarating. It made us feel young and adventurous. Kurt and Heidi were gracious hosts.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Very relaxing. Ingenious outdoor shower.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were terrific hosts. While some parts of the space were a shared, I still had all the privacy I wanted. I was greeted with muffins on the bed and a few beers in the fridge. I would definitely stay there again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed in a lot of tiny homes or glamping type of experiences and this was probably one of our favorites. The tiny house was tucked away and felt pretty private. The outdoor space with string lights was perfect for a campfire. There were so many things to do that were perfect for a relaxing getaway. There was also a very friendly kitten when we stayed so that was a plus. We enjoyed our time here and I’m sure we will be back.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cozy little retreat. It’s a great “glamping” spot. The outdoor shower and bathroom were very clean and great for being outdoors. We had fun playing games from the cupboard. Also, the setting was lovely!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat is a little room in a beautifully peaceful setting out in the country. It's kind of a cross between a guest cottage and camping. The Shed itself is relatively close to Kurt & Heidi's house, yet is situated so it's surprisingly secluded and private, so it really IS perfect for a retreat.
Personally, my favorite part about my 2-night stay was probably just sitting inside, reading, writing, and coloring, with the windows open to let in the cool, fresh air. I also enjoyed an evening campfire (ate too many s'mores), walking down to the creek and the green grassy area (early a.m. squats & lunges), gathering fresh eggs, and practicing some ""kitten yoga"" (didn't know that was a thing, but the little grey guy thought I should try it).
The outside restroom is relatively convenient, clean, and comfortable. I feel that guests should be aware in advance that they are asked to do some of their own ""maintenance"" of the camp toilet, and that was not at all a problem for me.
Heidi and Kurt went out of their way to help me with a problem that came up (which was not related to their property), and I'm so appreciative of their assistance.
I didn't experience much in the town of North Manchester, but I did visit the History Museum, which was interesting and informative, and the Main View restaurant where I had a delicious lunch.
I hope I get an opportunity to stay at The Shed sometime in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So cute and cozy! Super clean and neat inside and out. Kurt and Heidi were so hospitable and over all just super lovely people. Would 100% stay again and recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing space to relax, unwind, and clear your mind. The cats made the experience more special! The space itself was clean and cozy. Perfect for couples or as a solo trip. So much love was put into The Shed Retreat and it shows. Thank you so much, Kurt and Heidi! (The apple muffins that were waiting for us when we arrived were such a sweet touch and delicious!)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend this place for a pleasant stay. Do use the fire place at the barn as well as at the creek.
We had a great time hanging around late nights, playing and some refreshing time."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a terrific experience at the Shed. Went looking for a weekend away to enjoy the pleasures of camping but also have a bed and room at night. My kind of glamping! Kurt and Heidi were so thoughtful - welcome cupcakes and a note on the bed when I arrived. The room was comfortable and adequate. Firewood ready for a campfire. Instructions and anything I needed to know was communicated well. They were sweet to say hello and visit but also considerate to give me space. Lots of options for simple fun. I checked out the fitness center one day. Walked downtown North Manchester for ice cream another day. And enjoyed reading and several cups of coffee by the fire. The chickens, fresh eggs and adorable kitties just added to the charm of the experience. Price was right and well worth it! Thanks Kurt and Heidi!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about The Shed is awesome. Comfortable and cute inside and out. This was our third visit and we will be back again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cozy and homey! It was the perfect retreat for our anniversary. There was even a bottle of sparkling apple cider and amazing cupcakes to help us celebrate. They have everything here that you need to make your stay enjoyable. We are planning our next trip in the fall some time. We’d love to come back and enjoy this place longer and get to interact with the owners more. The cats, as everybody mentions, were just an added bonus!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of my favorite places I have stayed. It was so cute and had so many nice additions. Honestly it was so amazing that I got to love on kittens at night and in the morning. That was my favorite addition. It was also nice to have some devotion books because my husband and I got to do it before we went to bed. Also, the cupcakes were awesome!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The shed is super cute and quaint! We came to stay for just one evening for a wedding nearby. Kurt was so helpful and kind. Loved waking up to the sounds of a nature and enjoying some coffee on the shed porch.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very charming and comfy. Great for a couple of nights.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just, wow! It is clear how much thought and love has gone into this little retreat. It was absolutely beautiful and had everything you could have needed and more! Kurt and Heidi have a beautiful property and yes, there were kitties! The kitties were such an added blessing and so adorable. The shed was stunning, as was the yard and little creek in the back! We have never been camping before and this little glamping getaway was a perfect introduction, featuring an outdoor toilet and shower. The toilet was easy to use and very clean, as was the shower. This was everything we were looking for and we cant wait to be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! Kitten snuggles, fish nibbling your toes in the stream, beautiful surroundings, peace and quiet. We absolutely loved our stay, and the cupcakes ,with the sparkling juice, waiting for us was a great touch. So much love and care in this little space, and a wonderful place to celebrate our anniversary."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice accomadations, beautiful setting. The kayak trip was very nice. Great value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space. Relaxing and rejuvenating. Heidi and Kurt have put their hearts into it to make it cute, comfortable and a spot carved out for your soul and heart to rest. My husband gave me this trip as a beautiful Mother’s Day present. I went kayaking, played with the kittens, napped in the hammock, had coffee under the trees, listened to the silence and the sound of the River and rode a bike into town for dinner. It was a gift and a blessing in many ways. I highly recommend the space and the hosts."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely loving. If you like camping you'll enjoy the scenery. If you're looking to experience something different and unique this is something for you.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat was beautiful, clean and so restful. I plan to return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome space with cute kitties
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you like ""glamping"" this place is for you! It was an oasis of serenity and beauty, nestled in a sweet garden of hostas and shady trees. The chickens are near the parking and their sweet soft noises greeted us as we entered the very short path to the beautiful converted goat shed. If those goats could see this place now, they'd be in awe of it! The decor inside is darling and it had everything you needed, including A/C, electricity, a nice comfy chair, coffee table and love seat sitting area. The large bed was extremely comfy and the pillows were perfect. Rubber slippers, towels and bathrobes were provided near the back door for use in the very private outside shower. There is a camp toilet which along with the foot pump sink is part of the ""glamping"" experience that made this a fun adventure. From the cupcakes that greeted us to the fresh eggs we cooked in the barn for breakfast, we couldn't have asked for more! Oh! We also were over the moon visiting with the sweetest momma cat and her five adorable kittens!!! If we could have adopted any, we would have begged for at least two. It will be one of the best places you can find to stay in Indiana and I guarantee you won't want to leave!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a true gem. Even just a night left me refreshed and with a bit more peace. Everything is as described, and Kurt and Heidi were extremely thoughtful and kind in their design and communication."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay…three bookings in the same week (unplanned!) should say something about how awesome this location is!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying at the Shed retreat was relaxing! If you need a getaway and a place to refresh this is a great spot! Sitting out and watching the chickens and the kittens made for a lovely evening. We wish our stay could have been longer but we only were there for one night. We hope to go back maybe for a weekend sometime!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great hosts with a clean and serene space. I stayed with three of my kids one night and knew I wanted to bring my younger two and the host was able to immediately accommodate that without a problem. I HIGHLY recommend this location and it’s definitely a new regular for us. ♥️🐓🥚🙌🏼💕
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely LOVE this location. The hosts are beyond friendly, the cats (and now kittens as well!!!) are just adorable and so playful, and the setting is peaceful and just enough off of the beaten path to feel sort of camp-y in a very glamp-y way. My 15 year old daughter didn’t want to come previously because of the outdoor restroom (🙄😐). She, for some reason, chose to come this time and now said she will come every chance she gets. If this place can win over the pickiest teenager in the world, I’d say it’s whatever level comes after “winner”! 😋😉💕"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! This place is super cozy and beautifully designed. Don't be fooled by the little door; it's actually very spacious inside (and I'm 6'4"")! We were even greeted with some amazing and unexpected cupcakes upon our arrival, which hit the spot after a long drive. The setting is absolutely beautiful; we fell in love with the kitties and the hens. And there is a great woods that leads to a river out back. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our visit to North Manchester. Kurt was easy to get a hold of and super helpful when we had questions. Thanks so much!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful magical place! Friendly hosts, comfortable setup, and kittens. What’s not to love?"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are here to shed your worries away, spending more time with peace and quietness that nature has to offer, then you are at the right place. Will come back again for cute kittens 😁"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This retreat is even better than the photos show! Super cozy, cool on hot days, warmer on chilly mornings. Camping toilet is just fine as is the outdoor shower. Loved ever second of my stay and the kittens roaming around with their mama are just an added bonus!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"clean place. kind, courteous, and helpful hosts"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in. The hosts are clear, clean, and friendly. If you want a rustic retreat that still feels like home, look no further!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were wonderful hosts. The space was clean and comfortable, and there were several amenities to enjoy. We got to play with their cats outside and feed the chickens. It was something much different than we were used to and it was a nice couple getaway for us. We will definitely be back in the future and we couldn’t recommend it more!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cute and clean!!! Perfect getaway
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kurt and Heidi were great hosts! They were great and answering our questions and offering suggestions for activities to enjoy throughout our stay. It was so peaceful and we will definitely stay again next time we are in Indiana!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot! Quaint and cozy. The scenery is unlike any other I have experienced as far as air bnb is concerned. I highly recommend this amazing spot!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’ve got an inkling this place is for you — IT IS! Man, what a rejuvenating experience even just for 1 night away. The grounds were more gorgeous and the space even better than I could ever expect. SO homey and very close to all you need (not far at all from the downtown area of N Manchester). Can’t wait to return!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was excellent from playing on the trails and exploring the water to the sweetheart cats loving on us to gathering our own eggs for breakfast to the cute little fire pit and homemade collie (yum!). We will definitely be back—my new favorite AirBNB! ❤️🙌🏼
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little cabin getaway! Truly puts the “glam” in glamping
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing peaceful place if you're looking for some quiet time. love the cats:)
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Shed is very peaceful. It is perfect for a personal or a couples retreat.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute space.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun stay - Kurt and Heidi have put great thought and work into making their place so relaxing. Communication was quick and great through the process. Plenty of small touches at the property. We did not take advantage of all of the amenities but it was nice to have so many different activities offered. Great value for a relaxing weekend trip. Look forward to putting together a return visit.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi’s place is so unique and was such a treat to stay in! The quaint, farmhouse styled shed was so cozy. We love the roaming cats and kittens! Highly recommend this spot 💜"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The shed is a great getaway! Close to a little creek, quaint, cozy, and quiet. It was the perfect thing I needed to get a little time for myself. There were plenty of blankets to get cozy, all the amenities were provided, and I found the outdoor bathroom a fun little adventure. If you’re not a fan of cats, though, this may not be the spot for you. There are a ton of friendly cats (and kittens) that accompanied me throughout my time outside. I found them endearing, but someone afraid (or allergic) to cats may find that less than relaxing. Definitely would recommend this spot!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the woodsy location of The Shack Retreat. It was cozy and decorated beautifully. Even though close to the main home, it was still very private. We were able to go for a walk and enjoy the kittens playing outside. There are many restaurants and stores within a few minutes' drive. We will definitely recommend to our local friends for a day away!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I never knew I could love Indiana before coming here. Everything LOOKS as pictured, but the FEEL is way better than any words can describe. I'm definitely bringing my daughter next time I come back. Most amazing solo Airbnb experience ever. 💜"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place. Exactly as described. Lots of chickens and cats. Everything was well done and easy. Thank you!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The love and effort Kurt and Heidi put into this experience shows the moment you arrive. I could write about so many things but I’ll keep it simple. All around it is a great place to get away and connect with your partner and forget about daily life for a moment. Loved every second of it!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You need to go here. Best air bnb I’ve been to in a long time!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem here in the middle of a peaceful atmosphere! We loved it!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second trip to the Shed and it was just as awesome as our first time. We love the relaxing space and cozy fire. We did a kayak trip again and enjoyed every minute of it. The thoughtful touches Kurt and Heidi have done just make this one of our favorite spots!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at The Shed Retreat! We were in town for a wedding and only 15 minutes away from the venue. Such a great little spot with amazing decorations & privacy! Coming from country living myself, I loved walking past the chickens & having kitty friends that love back scratches! We actually really enjoyed the outdoor shower and bathroom area. It will kind of catch you off guard at first, but it had a way of taking you into an even more rustic retreat. I will recommend this place whenever asked."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. I have been there about 4 times. The energy is very positive and healing. It is indeed a nice retreat. It is kind of like glamping. There are many cats and chickens. You can ride bikes or go kayaking. North Manchester is a very pleasing rural community. Very amenable to a romantic getaway, you can get really close to your partner here."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi were wonderful hosts! We loved relaxing in the hammocks, spending time by the campfire, and getting fresh eggs from the coop! There were so many small touches that made the trip extra special too--like a welcome note with homemade cookies and a note on a book of questions inviting us to get to know each other better. My wife fell in love with Nala, one of their kittens, who was a great hammock snuggle buddy! Kurt was especially attentive and communicative--transporting our farmer's market goods (There is a wonderful farmer's market in town on Saturday mornings!) for us when he noticed that we had bought a little too much to carry back with us to the shed with the bikes that he lent us. We also really enjoyed, and recommend, the kayaking trip! (This would be at a small extra cost and includes kayaks, paddles, life jackets and drop off / pick up.) It was all just what we needed to get away from everyday life!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! My husband and I took a long weekend here and have already started telling our friends about the The Shed Retreat. Our only fear is that it will already be booked when we want to come back!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There just arent enough words to describe how wonderful of an experience we had! Kurt and Heidi are amazing hosts and created a peaceful space for their visitors! We plan on going back again soon since we just loved our time spent there.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This ranks among one of our favorite Airbnb's we have stayed in! For a quick two-day anniversary trip to Winona Lake, Kurt and Heidi's place was exactly what we hoped for. Now that we know about this amazing place, we hope to be back in the future for a longer visit."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent place to stay! Cute, clean, and lots of fun."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Think ""Glamping"" only better. Kurt and Heidi's Shed retreat was just what my husband and I needed for a few days to rest and refresh. We enjoyed the fire pit, the kittens, and the secluded space ""away from it all."" Kurt was very accommodating when we Kayaked, and they were fantastic at communicating. The little touches of care in the shed were perfect! The unique art work, the extra throw blankets and robes, the coffee and sugar, and the cookies and note - this stay exceeded our expectations! We would love to return!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, relaxing place to escape to!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! The shed retreat was awesome! The hosts are quick to respond, the space is comfortable and stylish! We loved sitting by the fire pit , loved the kittens and chickens, and all of the personal touches! We were able to go kayaking (last minute) and thoroughly enjoyed it! Showering under the stars was fantastic! And the welcome cookies were very much appreciated!
We have stayed at many Air bnbs and this is one of our favorites!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful time during my mom-cation getaway for the night. It was much needed and everything I was looking for. The indoor and outdoor settings made for a peaceful stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my 3rd time staying at the Shed Retreat. It is a very homey and uplifting experience- I love it here.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an amazing retreat into nature and simple living. If you need to clear your mind, get in touch with yourself, focus on art or meditation; this is the place for you. The hosts were so kind and the amenities were unbelievable for the price and quality of the place. I recommend bringing your own grill and food to cook on site. There is a great farmers market in the town on Saturday morning, but otherwise healthy convenient food choices are slim. The camping toilet is really the only rustic part of the amenities so you should be prepared to take care of your own waste. There are some beautiful state parks in the area you can drive to for hiking trails and nature time. The best part by far was meeting the hosts and going on the kayak adventure; they provided the kayak and the drop-off/pick-up. The river was beautiful with a good mix of challenging and relaxing sections which made for a perfect true adventure. Thank you so much Heidi and Kurt for the love and kindness you put into this retreat."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place with lots of love and hospitality shown! We would stay there again if we are in the area
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at the Shed, I love this place!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kurt and Heidi are great hosts and the shed was perfect with so many personal touches. We loved all the helpful notes and signs. The country setting was so nice and peaceful and we thoroughly enjoyed the cats. The bed was super comfy. Highly recommended!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in a search for a small little retreat this is the perfect place! We didn’t do the extra activities such as using the bikes, outdoor games, kayaking or the fire pit. Which tells you that this place is Loaded with options! But we will sure return to do so! Location is great, very quite and peaceful. The Shed Retreat was very clean and the instructions at location were very easy to read and follow. Kurt and Heidi definitely thought of all the little details which makes this place even more special. Can’t forget that there were extra companions, the kittens on the property made it feel more like home. The outdoor shower and bathroom are very easy to use, it is truly an experience. My husband and I can’t thank Kurt and Heidi enough for their hospitality. If you decide to give this place a chance, you will not regret it!! Go for it and give it a try! Have fun!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi went above and beyond for us. We came for our first anniversary and spent our time feeling so welcome and surrounded by kitties, nature, and chickens. It’s like staying in a luxurious little hobbit hole. They let us rent their own kayaks to go kayaking and dropped us off and picked us up for a great price. We got fresh, warm eggs from the chicken coop for breakfast and had a great fire surrounded by fairy lights. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to spend our anniversary :)"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi was a great host! The check in was very easy. The place was very clean. We loved how quiet and relaxing the property was. The location offers a nice trail in the back that leads to a great spot to start a fire. Both her and her husband took care of all of our needs and are very grateful. Great place to spend time with the Lord! Everything was well maintained and kept. Would recommend to any couple who wants to get away or even an individual or family looking for a cool spot to relax. Thank you Heidi and Kurt
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful, private retreat in the country❤️ The shed was like a little cabin in the woods. Everything was clean and the host were very welcoming. You can sit out around the fire in the evening with the kittens. We loved our stay there!
Randy and Ben"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint little place. Hosts offer a lot of extras. Peaceful.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has special loving energy and all you need for a relaxing and peaceful retreat in the country.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great spot for what I needed! Kurt and Heidi went above and beyond with their hospitality.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique, quaint, quiet place!! We really enjoyed our time there!! It was very cozy with most of what my fiancé and I needed for a quiet love bird weekend together! It did get a bit chilly at night but that made for closer cuddling! We didn't use the cold outdoor shower, to cold, but did go to the rec center which was quite enjoyable with the pool and hot tub!! The fire pit was great with all the wood you need and the kittens were just an added plus to the experience! We did have a great stay! Super clean and cozy!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat was such a cute, cozy little space. The backyard area was so charming and would be a great place to relax around the fire, it was raining when I went. The bed and furniture were so comfy and there were plenty of throw blankets to snuggle up with and relax. We were greeted by kittens when we arrived and every time we went outside. It was overall such a peaceful, private, and relaxing place to stay. I would love to go back on a nicer weekend so I could get outdoors there. Such a nice place for some R&R."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a short stay, but absolutely loved it! The shed is such a cute spot with thoughtful touches. We would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first experience through Airbnb and it was amazing! The environment was better than i expected, as pictures don’t do justice. They welcomed us with cookies and water, and had information on everything we may need! Places to eat, things to do, etc. It was a quiet and very cozy setting. They even have the cutest kittens!! Will definitely be back if ever in the area."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time even with it raining the whole time!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time for our 10 year anniversary! Such a peaceful location and the barn was so tastefully decorated! Not to mention the bed was so comfortable! There wouldn't be a single thing we would change with our stay and we plan to return again in the future! You will not be disappointed!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an incredible experience. We are AirBnB host and vacate our home every weekend. Kurt and Heidi’s place offered everything our family needed. We were able to set up a tent right outside the shed, which gave us a little more space to play with. Our two year old twins had a sandbox and swing set to keep them busy. We enjoyed a fire and tenting as if we were camping, yet with the comfort of a stylish and comfortable place to sleep. The shed was separated from the main house by a garage, which had a refrigerator for us to keep milk cold. There was running water and electricity. Also within a mile of a cute little small town and yummy Mexican!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi and Kurt were terrific hosts, responsive, warm, and informative. They have created a true “getaway” from the everyday demands of life. The Shed Retreat was clean and surprisingly spacious. The kitchen area was more convenient than we expected and the outdoor shower was quite invigorating! We were warmly welcomed with hellos and blueberry muffins!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely incredible. I came here for a spiritual retreat and it was perfect. Very cozy, warm, inviting atmosphere. Lots of plants and flowers. I even loved the chicken coop! Everything met my expectations and so much more. There is plenty to do in the area such as historical sites, kayaking, parks.. ect. Will definitely be going back."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic week! Kurt and Heidi (and their family) are so kind and considerate. Although we were on their property, we could not see any of their activity most of the time. They immediately responded to any questions we had and were very helpful about area information. We definitely plan to go back! We hope to make it a traditional trip."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was truly wonderful staying overnight at the Shed Retreat. It was evident how much intention, purposeful, and prayerful planning went into creating every aspect of this cozy space. I was truly able to spend some beautiful uninterrupted time with God. I especially loved borrowing a bike to grab dinner in town!! This place is like it’s own little peaceful sanctuary!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the second we got there our group just kept discussing how much we loved this place! It is perfect, especially if you have a large family with kids! They have everything you need to bring little ones with you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Green Gables was amazing! Tastefully decorated yet homey and Ann provided anything you might need and extras. She provides all nice high-end appliances (including washer, dryer and detergent), comfy beds, bedding, games to play and even some nice snacks, coffee and water. There was plenty of storage area for our unpacked items and luggage. The kitchen is beautiful! It's nicely and clearly marked with what is in each drawer and cabinet which made finding what we needed easily. My grandkids loved sleeping in the attic bedroom that has two twin beds. All bathrooms had an abundance of nice fluffy towels and bath products. Ann made herself available should we need anything. Although all my family did not make it to Indiana, this AIRBNB is so roomy it can hold 10 people easily. We enjoyed sitting and rocking in the chairs on the front porch. This home is beautiful inside and out. We will certainly return to Green Gables when we have the opportunity to return to the Bluffton area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann was very responsive and friendly. The house is beautiful inside and out. Will definitely be returning if I’m in the area again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing house. We are frequent BNB’ers and this one was impressive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann was easy to communicate with, and her place has everything you could need to be comfortable.
We had 3 generations staying in the space, and it was perfect. Nana and Papa had their own room with access to the walk in shower. The “kids” each had their own comfortable rooms, and the “grands” had choices for sleeping accommodations on the same level or up on the next level. The play space in the basement was perfect for the grands to get into safe mischief.
The kitchen is amazing - Nana was cooking at the stove as I was loading dishwasher and 2 grands chased each other on their way to the fridge - all without bumping into each other!
Everything was labeled and easy to find, and we couldn’t think of anything to suggest to add for future guests.
We are already talking about planning our next getaway at Green Gables next year!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Ann’s home to watch the eclipse. The home was spotless! I can’t begin to talk about how clean the home was. The furnishings were beautiful. The appliances were top of the line. The beds were very comfortable. The patio was a wonderful space to relax and enjoy the eclipse. Everything you could think of was provided, bathroom supplies, kitchen supplies, and many different snacks and coffee options. We were there the weekend of the NCAA Final Four and Championship tournaments and the streaming capabilities of the internet and TVs was wonderful. Ann was very responsive and helpful. The home is in a cute neighborhood and the neighbors are very friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if we are in the area again, we would definitely stay at Ann’s home again. If I could give this home double the 5 star rating, I would!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"oh my goodness this house was amazing we own airbnbs we were very impressive of how clean this place is, I love the little toys in the basement for people that have kids that will distract them and keep them busy for a little bit.
you have everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom.
I don't even know what else to say
one of my friends made a comment saying that the house look like it was made yesterday super nice house and Ann was very friendly."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in many airbnbs and this has to be one of, if not THE best airbnbs I’ve stayed. Completely unexpected gem when traveling to Bluffton, Indiana. Spacious. Clean. Immaculate amenities. All the cabinets and drawers being labeled was also a touch that I didn’t think would be important but it feels needed at every airbnb now. Our host even called to help when she noticed our truck broken down. Great spot. Great host. Would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home!! One of the best and cleanest homes I have come across!! We will be returning!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Ann’s place was great! Zero complaints
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recently update, perfectly clean, great spaces, and a gracious host. We loved out stay, and would recommend it without reservation."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in several Airbnbs and this home has been the best one I’ve stayed in yet!
The attention to detail and welcoming atmosphere Ann has created is like none other"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a place. It is common for Airbnbs to not be as nice as they appear on pictures. This one is the other way around. It would be hard to say enough good. Very well supplied. Very communicative host. Just a good clean Airbnb. It is close to the crossroads - which can make a little noise - if that happens to bother you. Just typical small town feel...
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is absolutely gorgeous! Immaculate! Ann was very responsive and answers all the questions we had! Lots and lots of extras!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was everything we thought it would be, it was super clean and organized. Also has all kinds of toys and games for the kids to play with. We will definitely being coming back to stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect, it was very clean, spacious, made you feel right at home. Would recommend this home to anyone."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely superior home. Ann has curated a beautiful, comfortable, and well-stocked home that will make you feel welcome the moment you enter. I have been an Airbnb host for about 7 years now, and I have four properties. Green Gables is one of the best homes I’ve ever seen. You won’t be left wanting if you choose this home. Simply excellent."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family loved Green Gables & Ann’s a fantastic host. She thought of everything to ensure a comfortable stay for all, including the kids. Everything was squeaky clean and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed walking downtown to visit all the local shops and restaurants too. I highly recommend, and our family plans to return again next year."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ann was a great host and the home was fantastic! It was perfect for our large family to celebrate the Holidays together! Immaculate inside!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in at least a dozen Air bnbs a year while working out of town. I think Air is too loose with their “superhost” labeling as few ever meet the “super” moniker.
This one of Ann’s truly is super. She has thought of everything in a freshly remodeled and up to date property.
I would absolutely stay at Ann’s place again in the future and you should too.
I’d like to nominate Ann as the inaugural “ultra host” when Air gets around to making it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anne's place is a beautiful home with plenty of space for us all. Plenty of play area and toys for the kids. Anne was always prompt to answer any questions we had. It was close and convenient to my family, restaurants, and grocery store. Has definitely become our go-to place to stay when we visit family."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was what we were looking for!!!! Clean & comfortable. Needed somewhere that 8 of us could come n go as we needed for the weekend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this house if you are visiting Bluffton! It had a modern and spacious interior with plenty of room for our family of 5 (we didn't even need all the rooms!). Ann went above and beyond to make the house feel like home with snacks and a coffee bar, perfect for us after a long drive. This was the best rental we have stayed in and I cannot recommend it enough to others."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann was a fantastic hosts. All of us that stayed in the home said it was the best AirBnB we've stayed at. Very clean, clear instructions for checkout... not to mention a welcome basket with snacks & labeled cabinets! Finding the things we needed in the kitchen was a breeze with all of the labels. SO appreciated.
The home was absolutely gorgeous and had enough separated space to accommodate our friends and their families. We look forward to renting the space in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is fantastic! Extremely comfortable. The details are by far the best I’ve seen! We loved our stay and would love to come.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ann was an amazing host! Her home was absolutely everything we needed and more! Probably one of the best homes we have stayed in, especially with her many extra thoughtful touches."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We (myself, hubby, daughter, son-in-law, and 3 kids aged 1-5) stayed in Ann’s house while in Bluffton for a family event. Ann’s house was spacious and beautifully decorated, with comfortable furnishings. Ann has thought of everything to make visitors’ stays enjoyable. My grandsons were thrilled with the playroom in the basement, as well as the finished attic space to explore. Lots of room for the family to spread out and for the kids to play. Beds were comfortable for sleeping, and there are room-darkening shades on the bedroom windows which we all appreciated! The kitchen was fully stocked with all items needed to cook a meal - can’t think of anything that we needed that wasn’t supplied! We all hope that when we come back for future family events, that Ann’s house will be available!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very clean, spacious, nice snacks, friendly host. very accommodating.comfy bed."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved this house and wished we had a couple of more days to stay. It is really clean and beautifully equipped. We had seven adults in our group and spent most of our time at the house around the kitchen table laughing and talking. I made a mistake on our reservation and Ann went out of her way to help us get settled. If you are going to stay in Bluffton, I highly recommend this property. You will love it."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Green Gables was perfect! Ann provides so many little touches to make you feel right at home.

This stay exceeded our expectations and with family close by we will be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay…
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann’s place was far beyond any Air B&B I have ever stayed in. The home is gorgeous. The beds were more comfortable than our beds at home. Ann has thought of everything; soft throw blankets all over the house, spare toiletries, first aid kits, a wonderfully stocked kitchen, games and toys for the kids, the list goes on and on.
Ann was very responsive and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We were staying at Ann’s place as part of my daughter’s 12th birthday celebration, and Ann had a birthday card waiting for her on the counter when we arrived. It was a lovely weekend with great memories made at Ann’s beautiful home. Thank you so much, Ann!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"As a travel nurse, this is the best air bnb we’ve stayed in. Clean, spacious, comfy, and quiet considering the down town area. Will absolutely repeat this stay"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Green Gables was a gem. Beautifully remodeled home right on Main Street. Sound was not a problem and privacy glass on the doors and the blackout window shades in the bedrooms made it feel very private. Attached garage was convenient and two parking spots outside as well. Ann really thought of every amenity you could need. Plenty of towels, clean linens, bathroom necessities if you forgot anything, fully supplied kitchen, coffee bar, even folding luggage racks in the closets. Everthing was also extremely clean. My kids really enjoyed the games and toys she had available. Ann was extremely responsive and offered several times to help us with anything we needed. If you are visiting the parks and attractions nearby, stay here! And if you get a chance, read Ann's story in her house info binder, very inspiring."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Spaceous Home! Very comfortable and homely. I will definitely be back to stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying at an airbnb and the bar had been set extremely high. The area was beautiful and peaceful. The house was clean and welcoming. My husband and I loved the deck by the lake and the swings in the front yard under the tree felt like heaven. My husband is 6’2 therefore he constantly kept hitting his head on the slanted ceilings. Otherwise, we highly recommend staying here."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had another place in another town closer to our jobs that went bad due to a broken pipe. We found this place last minute and they welcomed us right away. We were a ways from our jobs, but the peaceful location, hospitality and cleanliness of the hosts made it worth the drive. Thank you for the last minute reservation. If we ever have work in Indiana again we will definitely book with you guys."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was absolutely gorgeous with a fair price. Mrs. Marci was an amazing host with even more amazing hospitality would definitely recommend staying here when in search of a airbnb

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Initially, I thought I was renting a whole house, turns out it was an addition (mother in law suite) to the house. it was definitely cute but is attached to the hosts home. Don’t let that deter you though. The space was cozy, private and perfect for what I needed. At first I thought I would be interrupting and disturbing the hosts by having company or coming and going at all hours of the day and night but they assured me that it was not a bother at all and to feel free to proceed with my plans as planned. They were accommodating and were always making sure I was comfortable. A couple days got chilly and they brought me an extra heater even. I highly recommend this place. 10/10"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting family. King bed was very comfortable.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice quiet place to get away for the weekend. Marci was very quick to respond to anything that we needed!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay with our young children overnight on our way to a wedding. The space was small but well laid out with everything we needed as well as a few activities for the children. All of the beds are upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs. The kitchen was well stocked for us to do our own cooking. We loved the peaceful country setting that made us feel more at home. The backyard was great for the children to play with the playsets and green space. It would have been fun to swim/kayak/play in the sand if it were summer. The trampoline was not assembled as pictured but maybe that is a seasonal thing as we arrived in November.
The place was clean, tastefully decorated and well thought out. Marci was a great communicator and a wonderful hostess. Would recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved our stay! It worked perfect for visiting family in Huntington.

We rode our bikes on the beautiful country roads, enjoyed time by the pond, had a fire in the evening, and cozied up to watch Netflix at night. We highly recommend this lovely spot to all weary travelers and peace-seekers!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marci’s place was easy to find, she sent good instructions on where to park and how to get inside. Spacious with plenty of beds. Netflix was great too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a location near Ossian and Roanoke and this one perfectly fit the bill. Was a great clean and safe place as home base for the activities I needed to accomplish while in town. The host was very responsive and helpful. In case it matters, know that the beds are all upstairs and the only bathroom is downstairs. Also, for tall folk like me, the upstairs slanted ceiling was low even at the highest point and much lower at the head of the bed. It only took me about three “head bangs” to finally figure that part out. :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful relaxed time at her home. Place was fun for the kids, yet enjoyable for us also."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was destined for a 5-star review before we ever checked in! From a communication perspective alone this was an outstanding stay.
Comfortable, scenic with great sleep-ability for our family! Private entry, peaceful and close to The White Rose event venue which was the purpose of our visit to the area.
Marci went above & beyond as a host and we truly appreciated it!!!
Highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Appreciate Marci sharing her guest house. Thanks
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a nice stay at Marci's place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Booked this place as a little getaway for me and my 3 friends. Even though I didn’t meet with Marci directly she was super friendly and responsive to messages and answered all questions we had regarding our stay. This location is perfect if you’re looking for some peace and quiet but still want to be close to necessities like Walmart and other fun activities. 10/10 would stay here again :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Loved our stay in the country - swimming in the pond and the walking trails were a nice bonus. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and private.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great stay! my only recommendation to the host is to put up a small sign or instructions on the listing on where to go when you reach the house. we were afraid that we were at the wrong house, and we didn't get any phone service while in the driveway to check the listing.
But other than a half second of confusion when we first arrived, everything was great! the listing undersells the back yard. our two year old had a great time playing on their little beach, and jumping on the trampoline."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great location, very quiet, I would stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint and Charming. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Family with 3 kids from Germany, came to the area for a weekend to visit friends. Maci's place was perfectly located for our purposes, right between Bluffton (Walmart at approx. 8 minutes) and Ossian (don't miss Heyerley's bakery for the best donuts). We had a great stay for 3 nights. Our girls had a lot of fun on the property, with the family cat, the swimming pond and the swings. oh and the lightning bugs swarming the fields at dusk are another highlight. Marci is a real awesome host, very caring and accommodating, even helped us out greatly by taking care of our laundry, which was perfect for a fresh takeoff into our further vacation. Also enjoyed the forest neighboring the property, which belongs to the nearby High School is open to public use and features well maintained cross trails. We'll definitely recommend this nice place and come back if we get the chance some day."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,another great stay hope to come back again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marci is really easy to communicate with. This is our second time staying and we had a great time. The house is spacious and has everything we need. The area is peaceful and a short drive to stores and restaurants. We mostly love being able to swim and walk the trail next door.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Marci was very responsive to our requests and very accommodating. The property is gorgeous! We made a last minute stay on the 4th of July weekend. They allowed us to shoot off fireworks and we all had a great time! Great place to stay :)

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I rarely EVER leave reviews but Marci was a wonderful host!
My partner and I were looking for a quiet and quick getaway and found it here. We utilized the grill to make dinner and the backyard for star gazing which was beautiful and uninterrupted due to location.
Lastly my partner accidentally left their headphones and she was quick and responsive with helping us get them back! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is great and so is the hosts. I will for sure be staying again and telling everyone about all of it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish that there is an option to give more than 5 stars because Marci would deserve every one of them!

Thank you so much Marci - we would love to come visit again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our kids loved the stay here! ❤️ With so much to do in the backyard. Being able to splash around in the pond was the absolute highlight of our short stay.

She had coffee and creamer stocked for me and all the kitchen tools and utensils we needed. The home was just what we were looking for, for our quick little weekend away. I'd love to stay again when it's a little warmer and we could enjoy the trails. A great place to stay at an unbeatable price. Thank you and your family so much, Marci♡"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful & peaceful! Wonderful place for my small children to enjoy also
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little home. It’s like a guest house located next to their actual house, but it’s a completely separate building. Very clean and spacious, I guess the only thing is the bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs so it’s a whole journey if you need to go in the middle of the night. The backyard is lovely, they have a cute pond and I spent my morning watching crayfish and herrings while sitting on the small boardwalk they have. They are quick to respond when I had questions, and if I’m ever traveling through again I’ll be sure to stay!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We can't say enough positives about Marci's! After a long day of travel, coming to this place and being able to relax and breathe was so perfect. We went to the recommended Mexican restaurant for dinner then came back to sit on the deck by the pond. We may have dipped our toes in that warm water for a minute or two before heading back inside. We propped our feet up on the soft reclining couch and watched a movie before heading upstairs to bed. We've been coming through here pretty often over the last several months and without a doubt we'll stay here again! Thank you, Marci and family!!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay! Our four kids had a wonderful time swimming in the pond and playing on the grounds. The home had everything we needed.

Would recommend this to any family looking for a low key, fun trip!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The property was beautiful and had everything to keep myself and my boys occupied.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We wanted a quick weekend getaway with the kiddos and decided to book Marci’s place pretty last minute. Best decision ever! The kids loved the great backyard and swimming in the pond was enjoyed by all! As a city girl, one of my favorite things was walking outside at night and seeing all the thousands of stars so clearly in the sky!! Our stay was more than we could have asked for! Thank you Marci!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I didn't get a chance to meet Marci, but my boyfriend arrived before me and was able to meet both her and her partner and said they were wonderful. The guest apartment was very clean and just as pictured. I am very sensitive to smells, and there is a room fragrance and old smoke smell that I could smell, but my partner couldn't. It triggers my allergies, but other than that, it was a wonderful stay and so quiet and peaceful! Marci was a great communicator before the trip as well. If it weren't for my allergies, I would happily stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures don’t do this justice! This stay was absolutely amazing! Everything we needed and more. The kids had a blast and the adults got to relax too!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This unit is very clean, very well set up, very comfortable. Easy location, easy access. The primary bed (there’s three), is the only AirBnB bed that we’ve ever found to be comfortable! The beds are upstairs, the bathroom is downstairs, so seniors should know that the stairs are very safe (well lit) and the hand rails sturdy (at 2am!) You’ll love this BnB, a great value."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"FANTASTIC! I've stayed in plenty of airbnbs where the hosts were called ""friendly, great, wonderful, etc..."" and I'm not saying they weren't, just that I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. however.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This two story apartment was designed and is maintained with love. Spotless and cozy, the comfortable furniture and warm decor made me wonder if the space was originally meant for the host's grown children or parents. In any case, it was perfect for our family's visit to relatives over Christmas.
Marci was an extremely warm and gracious host, pro-actively messaging us several times during our week-long stay to check in. She volunteered to provide a pack-n-play without my asking and also (twice!) to wash a load of laundry for us during our week-long stay.
One small inconvenience to note - there is no bathroom on the second floor, where the bedroom and bed nook are located. However, there is a nice light dimmer switch for the stairs, so you can safely descend at night without being blinded."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Located a short distance from our holiday event which made it a perfect little home away from home to enjoy time with family. My kids loved having plenty of space for everyone to have their own bed and we loved the country setting with a fenced in play area. So welcoming with complimentary treats and a information book to help us if we needed to find anything.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I was here with a classmate for an extended stay for 10 weeks. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay. A lot could be said about Marci and Kyle but long story short is you absolutely won’t be disappointed.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marci's place is just what we were looking for. In the midst of our cross-country move, we wanted a place off the beaten path, quiet, private, safe. This was it!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at Marci’s with my wife, 2 year old son, and infant. It was a great 4 day stay for us while I was in town for work. The beds were comfortable, and the backyard was perfect for our son to play and look for frogs in the pond. We would definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is such a wonderful place! Our family of 5 stayed and there was plenty of space for all of us. My 7 & 2 year old loved playing in the pond & in the fenced in backyard with play sets and the trampoline. We’ve stayed at quite a few AirBnB’s and Marci was by far the best host we’ve had. Communication was easy & Marci was quick to respond. I can’t recommend this place enough!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet County Corner really worked for us. We have family back here and for us this was a great alternative to our usual hotel stay. Marci was a great host and we will defiantly come back for our next visit.

The listing was accurate and very clean. The bathroom was spacious. The couch with the reclining seats was very comfortable. The bed was also comfortable. We would love to come back again sometime, especially since I didn't get a chance to use the swimming pond this time around. A+++"

We were able to rebook for March and we are so glad that we did. Seth's location is super quiet and relaxing which is exactly what we needed. We were able to relax in the house during the rain and then warm up in the hot-tub. It was exactly what we needed. I recommend to anyone with the chance to come here, DO IT. I highly recommend going to Pizza Junction (it's an old train station made into a pizza place, and it's delicious. Also check out a little hole in the wall sweet shop called ""Party Shop"" ....."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous home away from home getaway! Seth was a great host and replies very quickly! Hot tub is nicely secluded and private!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing home. Everything you could want or ask for on a couples get away !
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly it was just what my husband and I needed. We are avid hunters and fishers, so we were only 10 minutes from JE Roush. Seth stopped by to check the hot tub, let me know ahead of time, and even talked hunting with my husband some ! All around wonderful experience !"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here. It was quiet and nice. Was a little surprised that check-in was so late (5PM). We asked about early check in but they did not respond. We had a little issue with the tub not draining so hopefully they read our last message regarding that and have it resolved for the next guest. Amenities were great and though we did not use the hot tub - it seems like a nice perk.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a pleasant stay; everything was convenient and comfortable for us, felt right at home immediately which is fantastic when staying somewhere new for a week…able to rest & recharge and enjoy the trip.
Hesitate to say how wonderful everything was (for us) because I want to be sure we can stay here again in the future — can’t do that if it’s fully booked all the time, lol.
I will say that it might feel a bit crowded for more than two adults (imo) but is perfect for one or two people, plenty of room to move about freely."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Seth and Krista are great hosts. We love the house and really enjoyed the hot tub! It was pristinely maintained and exactly what we needed! Thanks for a great stay!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our getaway at this cute place! The hot tub was such a nice perk, and it was fenced off and private. The neighborhood is very quiet and close to downtown Huntington with good restaurants and lots of fun shops. The apartment itself was very cozy and perfect for a quiet evening in watching a movie after spending the day exploring the area. We had a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be back again in ghe summer for a longer stay :)
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for us to stay for just a couple days to get away and not spend a fortune. We were feeling at home the whole time there. Thank you for sharing this space with us!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was just a wonderful relaxing stay! Seth was very communicative and helpful when asked questions. The place is warm and cozy and has everything you need. We were even surprised to find so much food waiting for us to use (eggs, condiments, pasta, spices). Check in was easy and check out was a breeze as they don't have many rules for you as you leave like others airbnbs.
The hot tub, of course, is the highlight of the trip as we even watched the snow fall while relaxing in the warmth of the hot tub. You're also 30 mins away from Fort Wayne, so you can make a day trip there if needed.
Definitely a stay to remember."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This rental was definitely worth it. The host made everything smooth and seamless. The check-in process was easy, the house was very clean, amenities were available if needed, and the hot tub was amazing. We have a 1 yr old toddler who loved running from one end of the house to the other. The house is not child proof, as described in the listing. However, it was easy to remove knickknacks & decorations out of the reach of little fingers. The host communicated before the arrival of his visit to check the hot tub. Our family enjoyed our stay here, and we will definitely come again. Thank you for being an amazing host to us."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""Hidden Gem"" is an apt description of this place! So many small touches, so much attention to detail (ideally placed night lights, room by room thermostats, very well stocked kitchen); truly private hot tub; squeaky clean . . . Overall, we can't recommend it highly enough, and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay absolutely no complaints here.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Seth’s place! The guest home was just as described, easy to check in, clean, a perfect little getaway. We loved the hot tub, and we really appreciated the little extras inside (like spices to cook with!).
We weren’t coming to really explore Huntington itself, but it was nice and close to other areas we visited. Near the house was a fun game store and Nick’s was a great place to eat!
Would definitely recommend :-)"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,over all a pretty amazing place to stay .
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden gem indeed! What a great place! The apartment is comfortable and clean with a great home-y feel. The hosts include many amenities including a year round hot tub and while a few of them might be thought of as basic, they’re also very generous with those basics, going above and beyond.
They have a book put together with guides to local restaurants, parks, etc- even with updates regularly (eg one restaurant had a fire recently and they made sure to note that it was closed temporarily for that reason).
I was in town for a surprise party and had plenty of room to prepare things. I was also able to visit with my co-conspirators comfortably while staying incognito.
The hosts quickly responded to any questions that I had and were very friendly. I will definitely keep this listing in my favorites for visiting the area in the future. (And hope it’s available because it’s got to be popular.)
Thank you!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again! Looking forward to seeing the new place!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely would return! We didn't spend a lot of time there during the day, but it was a great place to relax and unwind at night. Easy enough drive to anywhere you might want to go, and the winery nearby was a plus!
Things we loved:
- privacy
- hot tub (obviously)
- kitchen had enough staples to cook without buying things like oil, salt, seasonings
If you're planning on hanging out and watching TV all day, this probably isn't the place for you because we had issues with both TVs glitching the handful of times we used them. There was also a strange smell to the apartment, which might bother you if you're sensitive to smells. I didn't give any fewer stars on my review for this because it wasn't a smell that indicated a lack of cleanliness, it was just weird and we couldn't figure out what it was."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little place. The host very generously provides things like garbage bags, paper towels, shampoo, etc. It’s like staying at your friend’s house. Hot tub was fantastic."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"it's the perfect town for retirement or raising kids. The apt is fully stocked, on a quiet street and a medium walk to downtown."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property was the perfect size for our cute little get away. It’s convenient location from stores an restaurants. The neighbors was quiet. The host was amazing at communicating even let us know what events were being held in nearby communities. Check in was easy to follow. The privacy was excellent. This home was a huge relief cause it was clean to my standards an that’s hard to find. The only complaint or adjustment I could see helping this retreat is tvs are kinda on a small side but work an picture is great. So all in all one of our better stays an we look forward to going back.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a getaway either with your significate other or just yourself to a nice quiet and peaceful town, this is your place! Seth was a very helpful host. There is a lot of stuff to do, great little shops, and restaurants to dine at. There is a really nice Winery about 15mins away and very worth going to. The bed was so comfy my Husband and I actually slept in! The house was very tidy and organized; we felt at home, relaxed, and didn't want to leave. Everyone we met and talked to were very welcoming and heartwarming. This is somewhere to defiantly tell friends and family about."

Seth was the greatest host. When our flight got delayed, he tried to look for solutions, when he could have just shrugged. We can only recommend staying here and hope there is availability when we visit again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cozy and nice. incredibly clean and tidy with plenty of fixings, snacks, and cutlery. even though it was cold out, the hot tub was really nice to dip in. there are only a couple nice restaurants within a 15, 20 minute drive. everything else is 30 or so minutes out. definitely would stay again, but only in the warmer months. 8/10😁"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem! My husband and I visited to see our kids. Seth was wonderful.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came back for our second stay for my birthday getaway! Love this place! It's a little home away from home! I always miss the hot tub when I leave! It's so nice with the private yard. If the sky is clear, you can gaze at the stars! Love this place and hope to have some more little getaways! 🏡
We always take a day and try to find things to do in Fort Wayne. We found a awesome place called Spectrum Virtual Reality Arcade. It was amazing!! We did an hour for the two of us. We had our own room for 60 dollars for that hour. Definitely worth the money! I wanted to play more! If you are prone to motion sickness like us, take dramamine!
We checked out Granite City Brewery in Fort Wayne. We weren't that impressed for the price. Better off staying local at the Brick House Grill down the street from the house. We really enjoyed that place!"

Also, their attention to detail and to their visitor's needs is great - last time we were there, the knives were lacking. This time, there was a brand new knife block making food prep much easier! If you need a place to stay, or a relaxing getaway, look no further. We'll definitely be back again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite stays, ever! Seth's place exceeded my expectations! My partner and I came to Huntington for an anniversary getaway that was close enough to home that we could drive but far enough away that it felt like vacation. Seth's place seemed nice and had a hot tub so we committed and booked. I couldn't have been more pleased with the space unless someone picked it up and dropped it on a lake in the woods! So many thoughtful touches made the space feel like home away from home. The hot tub was clean, the space was amazing and extra effort was clearly put into ensuring privacy and comfort. Food items were left, if needed. A book was put together with thoughtful local tips and cute notes from previous guests. Check-in was a breeze. Communication was pleasant and timely."

The hot tub was also wonderful-very private and super fun to sit it with snow piled up around us. I appreciated the scrapbook with local suggestions, too! Seth is also very prompt in all communications. Everything about our experience was pleasant and relaxing. I highly recommend anyone stay here!"

My favorite area was the little library nook. The grounds were beautiful, full of birds and deer, perfect for some exploration. Cort was a dream to communicate with and even offer early check-in and late check-out, which we didn't end up needing.

Everything clean and as expected. Easy to find and get in. Appreciated the coffee and chocolates and welcome note :) overall- would definitely recommend to others.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Natalie’s house is so beautiful in the fall. We really had an awesome relaxing time just playing games with our kids, fishing, wandering around, cooking together, and reading. It is the ultimate “unplugged” and secluded location."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place, would recommend to anyone!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was high quality, private, and well done. It rates in the top 3 of my countless Airbnb stays. Don't bother looking elsewhere, this is the best place in the area."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"So this is clean place, and nice home. Issues we had was when we first got there the neighbor was blaring his music, atleast it was some good 80s music. Next the fridge was working, not working, working, so we lost some food, so that was disappointing. Also the house doesnt have enough curtains, the front door has beautiful glass window but if you want privacy you cant. In the kitchen there is beautiful large picture window, but also no curtains, so you can see right out to the neighbors. The side to hot tub is on is on the side of the hiway so you got 4 lanes of traffic going by...so not quiet as private as we thought. But again it is clean place and they have done nice job with the lighting in the home."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented Cheryl’s place for a girls weekend / see the eclipse and the property was fantastic! Just like the photos. It was a great property for this. There are so many restaurants and businesses to visit in town and surrounding towns. Great central for us. Cheryl is very responsive, and provides easy instructions and suggestions of things to do. Will stay again if we are in the area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheryl is a very gracious host and offered to help if needed. I spent most of the time away at meetings in Huntington but I would rank her as among the very best hosts.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is roomy, clean, nicely decorated and conveniently located. The many windows made it feel even bigger and welcoming. Master bedroom bed and bath were excellent. All beds were comfortable- perfect amount of blankets.

Very enjoyable stay. Highly recommend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Cheryl's ""The Rest"" and our stay was exactly that; peaceful and restful. The home was beautiful, spacious and clean and located in walking distance to Roanoke which we love to visit. We had a very lovely time visiting with my daughter there and we would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a hotel."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheryl was an amazing host. My husband had booked the wrong week and Cheryl responded fed quickly and allowed us to correct our error. House was amazing with an outstanding view. I will definitely look to stay with her again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cheryl's place is great! Matches the pictures and then some! Was a great spot for our family of 4 to visit for a few days while visiting extended family. The house took our breath away when we first saw it in person just like it did in the pictures!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, quiet spot, perfect for some R&R! The town has cute boutique shopping and conveniently close. Definitely coming again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Four of us girls wanted a quick, relaxing weekend away with husbands, kids, or responsibilities without having to travel too far. This was a great location in Indiana, with beautiful boutiques and lots of different restaurants nearby. The Rest was so beautiful, relaxing, and made us all forget about our normal lives back at home for a short while. Couldn't recommend The Rest more! Will definitely be sharing this rental with friends and family!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was gorgeous and so clean! There were lots of items provided which was very nice. The town is walk-able and was so cute with lots of locally owned businesses. We loved this house so much we are going to rebook for next year. Thank you for sharing your home with us!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful open space house was very cozy and super clean. Great amenities- lots of kitchen appliances, nice big dining room, great backyard, super showers, comfy beds and pillows, even several housecoats ready for morning!! We liked that there were lots of restaurants nearby, including a good BBQ joint, and sand which shop with ice cream, and a super good fish fry at the Village Inn. We didn’t get to try out the hot tub on the back deck- maybe next time, because we would certainly stay here again! ."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully updated home with modern touches. We enjoyed happy hours on the large deck. The home was conveniently located with easy access to nearby highways. Roanoke has several good dining options & we enjoyed a couple meals at the Village Inn.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home is absolutely beautiful, decorated beautifully and spotless!! We walked into Roanoke, it was a beautiful fall day spent checking out the shops and boutiques. We even found a few unique things we liked and bought. :) Ate dinner at a local restaurant...good food & everyone very friendly.
The entire process was smooth and easy.
We also enjoyed the hot tub on the beautiful deck. I recommend The Rest with no hesitation."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful! There is a beautiful master, two additional bedrooms up à steep flight of stairs which both have locks on the outside of the door. Unfortunately one of those doors got locked during our stay and we didn’t have access to a key for a few hours. Cheryl did great at getting this resolved quickly. The home itself was beautiful and had great amenities. The hot tub and shower were absolutely amazing!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a fun, relaxing getaway in a beautifully appointed, elegant farmhouse feel home, look no further. The Rest exceeds all expectations!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway and stay at the The Rest. We were in town for our sons engagement celebration and this home was the perfect accomodation for our family of five. The house was beautifully restored and updated with every convenience to make our stay most enjoyable. The location was perfect and just a short walk from the quaint town of Roanoke. Our host Cheryl was wonderful with great communication from our intial inquiry through check out. Thanks for hosting us! We will defintely stay again when we return to visit.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After staying for less than a week, I already want to go back. The house was amazing. Comfortable and stunning! If I'm ever in the area again, I will not hesitate to book with Cheryl again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked The Rest for a weekend get away with our friends. When we arrived, we were blown away by how beautiful, spacious and clean it was. It did look like the pictures-but they didn’t do this place justice! Every room and hangout area was gorgeous - including the back patio with a spacious hot tub. We really enjoyed the outdoor speakers and the gorgeous view!
The hosts were easy to communicate with and quickly responded to our messages and any questions we had We only live a hour and a half away from the area- but it felt like we were on vacation! I highly recommend booking a stay at The Rest."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great spot for a weekend getaway with my girlfriends. There is a winery right around the corner, things within walking distance, and the hot tub was a lot of fun in the evening. I would highly recommend this location, and would definitely return for another trip."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Have stayed multiple times!!! Love this house!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property and very clean. the highway behind the trees is louder than expected, and the large windows are beautiful but do not allow for sleeping in or mid-day naps. The location was good and there are many close restaurants and shops. some of the restaurants close early or are not open every day."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is gorgeous!! Hosts are very responsive !!! Highly Recommended

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"clean property, well equipped, flexible host"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Hive has literally EVERYTHING you need besides clothing! We have not stayed anywhere else with so many amenities. The community of Lagro is very small and peaceful with beautiful surroundings. The snacks, condiments, coffee/tea, and s'mores supplies available in the kitchen was such a blessing! We unfortunately weren't there long enough to take advantage of such nice amenities. The provided ziploc bags were a lifesaver since we forgot to bring some!! The beds were quite comfortable...my parents wanted to take theirs home! Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy your home, Barb! We will be back and for sure plan days to just stay out in Largo!!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We were so pleased with our AirBnB choice! The house was right out of HGTV. They thought of everything. The owners put some real TLC into this place and it showed. The host was responsive and she provided us with bikes during our stay which was a lovely bonus. We will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures do not do this house justice! Everything we needed or could think about needing was available in the house. Great for family vacations!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved this home and Barb the host was terrific. Communication was so easy and friendly. Definitely a great Airbnb.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The BeeHive was a perfect fit for our family Christmas gathering. Barb has thought of everything and then some. It was super cozy and has all the amenities. Quiet and beautiful scenery. The house feels bigger than what the pictures portray. We comfortably feed 12 people for Christmas dinner. There is a new breakfast spot within walking distance and a walking trail just outside the front door.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can't say enough good things about this beautiful home. The decor was amazing. It was by far the most comfortable and beautiful Airbnb I had ever stayed in. We were mostly just using the home to sleep since we have a farmhouse in the area that gets way too crowded during the holidays. I wish I could have spent more time at this gorgeous Airbnb!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommend Barb's home. In over a decade of AirBnB/VRBO rentals, this ranks as one of the top places we've stayed. The kitchen was the best stocked we have experienced. Between the pots and pans, spices, dishes, and silverware, there wasn't anything else we could have needed. The coffee/hot beverage bar was amazing, so many choices. They have done a phenomenal job updating a 1930s-era home so that it has all of the modern amenities without losing any of the period charm. The decorating is great, so many things to look at. We were able to spend some time in Lagro and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Thank you for sharing your home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a hidden treasure so close to my home. I’m very thankful for the opportunity to stay there
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home for our stay, the pictures didn't do it justice. across from the river and a few blocks away from a great little restaurant.
Barb was amazing, we will be back next time we're in the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in the area for a wedding, but this would be a great place for a walking or biking holiday along the Wabash river. The Wabash river trail is right in front of this location and Kokiwanee Nature Preserve is very close by. The house was pristine and had all the amenities of a 5 star accommodation. I would definitely choose this location again to stay. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Hive was the perfect place to stay for our family, we only wished we had more time to relax at the house. The hosts did not leave any amenities out! Barb was super quick and responsive to my questions. The coffee bar was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed having it out in the sunroom. If you plan to cook, everything you could possibly need is there, with the exception of the actual food. Beds were all comfy and plenty of room for the seven adults and one child we had. There’s a great walking path that runs along the river and it was pretty with the changing leaves on the trees. The house was beautifully decorated for fall. This house won’t disappoint! Thank you for being such gracious hosts!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Highly recommend this beautiful home! We visited as a group of five for a writing retreat and had a wonderful time!

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Barb was an amazing host and her Airbnb was perfect. We visited for a funeral and the space was really peaceful and perfect for our family during a difficult time. Barb even offered to pick up groceries for us before we arrived which was really thoughtful. The river walk is right across the street and was nice to walk in the mornings. Speakeasy is also right across the street and had great food and drinks!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Hive was beautiful, spacious, and clean. Everything was provided, from towels to linens to bikes. The bike trail from Lagro to Wabash was such a fun experience, peaceful and lovely. Our kids also had the best time catching fireflies in the back yard!

recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you have up coming activities in Wabash, Huntington and even in Fort Wayne, Indiana, this rental may be as great for you as it was for us! All three of those cities are no more than 30-40 minutes away on easily driven roads. Our activities were at Huntington University. It is rustic but very homey with all amenities of a state park on adjacent property. Also, pets, even horses are welcome. We loved it!"

The Carriage House is located in such a quiet peaceful place with access to beautiful wooded trails and charming small towns nearby for shopping, museums, restaurants etc. We appreciated the excellent cleanliness and comfortable beds and furnishings, the easy, complete instructions, and the brochures with suggestions. Welcoming our golden retriever was especially appreciated. My daughter is considering a return stay, maybe bringing her horses."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here because most of our family lives in the Wabash area and we wanted to visit. We had a great stay! Everything we need. I noticed there were plenty of extra things for a traveler that might forget a toothbrush, razor or something. Very comfortable and quiet place. It's got a full kitchen. It's perfect for relaxing. It's located at the entrance of the Dora recreational area. We cooked out and built a fire in the pavilion at Dora during our first night. The next day we visited family in Wabash, I went to Lost Bridge East to play a few holes of disc golf at their 24 hole course. Later we had dinner and beer in Lagro at the Speakeasy Bistro."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer is a wonderful and gracious host. She is responsive and accommodating. The property is clean, peaceful, and as described. I highly recommend this host and property. We will stay again!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough about this place. When we got there I realized we would be a 30 min drive from family that we were visiting but it was so worth it. We loved how peaceful it was at the carriage house. The barn house was beautiful and just what we needed to get away from the week. We enjoyed waking up to the sunrise and enjoying Gods nature and hiking the Salamonie State Park. 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻

My husband was a little concerned when I told him we were in a barn above the animals lol but you’d never know it once upstairs. We were in town for my step daughters wedding and it was 15 min from the venue. I did the cake and cupcakes for the wedding and did all the frosting/decorating there at the carriage house! Jennifer was great at responding and let us have a little extra time to check out because we ended up taking longer to clean up from the wedding. I also forgot my dress on the back of the bedroom door and she’s sending it to me!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, peaceful location! Exactly what we needed for our work project. Several of our team members said they were eager to return for a personal weekend getaway!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. State Park trails only steps away. Clean, peaceful, and secluded. Only concern would be for those who have difficulty with stairs."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location. Quiet and serene. Very clean and tastefully furnished. Easy check in/check out and the host does not require a length list of ""chores"" before checking out. Will be back again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place to stay! Five adults and three Golden Doodles had plenty of space to spread out. The property is in a beautiful county setting. Growing up in Indiana and moving way to a coastal area, it was nice to be back in the country! We were a little worried about the animals and the dogs but no problems at all. Our only issue was the WiFi. We had service outside, but not in the Carriage House. Host was very open with that information when we booked. Honestly it was nice having everyone off of their phones. We will definitely be back when visiting the area again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn was so comfortable and relaxing even on 99 F heat.
Slept so good.
As green and verdant as ever!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Clean and quiet. Everything is as advertised. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great and unique site that exceeded my expectations. So much fun to be in the Carriage house over the barn and hearing the chickens and horse below us. Expected them to be behind the pantry door! Very well maintained and supplied kitchen, gas grill. Quiet you can not believe on a dead end country road surrounded by state forest. Hosts very accessible but invisible throughout our stay. Great to have a dog friendly quality opportunity to stay in such luxury in a functional working barn. John Eads"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The home is wonderful and in a great spot for access to a lot of fun activities and small towns. The owners are very responsive to messages and questions.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely location. Enjoyed hearing all the birds throughout the day and the easy access to trails to go walking each morning. Nice to have a place to sit outside too.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's coach house. It was a beautiful location, super clean, very cute interior, and close to lots of great outdoorsy activities. We loved watching sunsets out the window and taking walks on the property. Perfect for a family trip! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Carriage House is clean, comfortable, and private.
We visited in the winter, but I imagine this is a beautiful place to stay during warmer months."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Cleans and cozy!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fun and relaxing spot to stay. It's literally at the end of the road with the park on one side. You could not ask for a more peaceful setting. The kitchen is amply stocked to cook just about anything. Beds are comfortable. Do note that the bathroom is downstairs and bedrooms up. For us it was no problem. The horse and barn cat were an added plus for our children. This was our second stay here and we will most likely be back.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first AirBnB experience. Super quiet, secluded, with beautiful views. Would highly recommend this place and will definitely come back."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is amazing…has all of to comforts of a hotel, but with the opportunity to get away and unplug. Close to great trails. We brought our three young children and they loved it. Highly recommend and we will definitely be returning"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great. If you're looking to ""get away"" from it all you will have this opportunity. This location was interesting and happened to be halfway between me and my friends.
Keep in mind the internet speed is not optimal of you need to work briefly, both of my Hotspots (tmobile and Verizon) did not have signal.
We all had a lovely time. thank you."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for a wonderful weekend getaway.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and wonderful peaceful stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What you see is what you get! Beautiful area,CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and safe home. We had a peaceful girl's weekend and enjoyed the trails and state parks. Thanks for providing such a peaceful getaway, which is exactly what we needed! :)

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Barn is so tranquil, surrounded by woods and cornfields, you will be able to see all the stars at night. We spent a lot of time playing games and reading on the couch looking out the panoramic living room windows. Amazing sunrise and sunset views! The trails were freshly cut for us, but they are grassy trails and the directions aren't the best so we highly recommend using AllTrails if you go exploring. If you have kids, check out the Salamonie Interpretive Center, it was $7 and included the wildflower garden and access to a huge beachfront of the resovoir. The kids could have spent the whole trip there! Very kid and pet friendly trip!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is really special. It’s peaceful, quiet, absolutely beautiful, remote yet with easy enough access to a town if needed. The hosts were kind and generous but gave us space too. Everything we needed was provided. We loved being truly out in the country. Also checking out was so simple. And what a value. My family and I cannot wait to come back. Truly a gem."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The living space is immaculate and the property was quite, peaceful, and scenic. We loved the animals and how close it was to some nice areas for forest bathing. It was a great spot for a retreat from city living."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No brainer for me to decide where to go and stay for a couple of days to relax and go fishing. I’ve stayed previously for a week with my wife. Had a chance to get away with my son who came home on leave. Clean and neat. Jennifer is very accommodating with any requests you may have.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely loved this place! Peaceful, quiet setting! Super clean and close to town!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property & location. Very clean with excellent amenities. So relaxing and peaceful. The farm animals are all so friendly. A stay my family will always remember.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was wonderful to stay at this beautiful location again. Our kids had a wonderful time enjoying the quiet of the woodland trails and getting to see all the farm animals.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love staying here. Great place and great hosts.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time in Lagro. The carriage house was very comfortable. We also enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and relaxing in the swings. Our son had a lot of fun visiting with Tiger the cat and watching the chickens. The quiet was just what we needed to relax.
There are plenty of opportunities to hike and get outside- we enjoy running and were able to head out along the roads from the carriage house to see the Salamonie Dam and the lake in the mornings without encountering too many cars.
While you are out in the country, it’s not far to Wabash where there are restaurants, parks, playgrounds, grocery store, etc."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great time. 5-10 Mins from the beach and trails.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely love this place. Hubby and I were there for a week. Their AirBnB has modern decor and amenities. So quite and peaceful. It’s literally 3 minutes from the boat ramp at Salamone Reservoir. There are trails to walk to the reservoir and you are surrounded by the state park with other trails too. Their property sits on a dead end street so there is little to no traffic as they are the last property.
Jen and Ben are such great hosts and have everything you would need for your stay. The barn is perfect for a little R&R. Does not smell like you are staying in a barn at all. There is a small fire pit and propane grill for your use too. They have chickens, ducks, a horse and a barn kitty. It’s about 20 minutes from Huntington or Wabash. We enjoyed everything about our stay and will be looking forward to returning. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall very good! I'd only note that the wifi isn't great. Good for a vacation but if you have work/school plan accordingly.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pure Indiana farm country paradise!
So rustic yet totally modern.
Great house design with all amenities.
Host gave us some fresh eggs for breakfast."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our first family vacation in almost two years due to covid, and it couldn't have been better. The Carriage House was so peaceful and relaxing with plenty of things to do. We enjoyed exploring the parks and lakes in the area, hiking, fishing and kayaking and had a wonderful time. Thank you for creating such a comfortable place to create treasured family memories. We hope to be back again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We absolutely LOVED our stay in the carriage house. This is a gorgeous, peaceful, and clean space. We had friends from four different states meet up for a ""framily"" vacation and this was the perfect place to gather!
We enjoyed interacting with the friendly animals, hanging out around the firepit, playing games inside, and exploring Salamonie together. I would've never guessed that this space is above a barn with how clean it is and how great it smells once inside!
The wi-fi did not work very well for us, but it wasn't a problem since we had plenty of other things to keep us busy. Would definitely stay here again whenever we have a chance!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So clean!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place! We loved our stay here and we will be back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a first class stay. It was peaceful and comfortable. The setting was so calming and the description of the property was spot on. This is certainly the place to relax and unwind from the stressors of a busy lifestyle. What a wonderful respite.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a ""country"" getaway, away from the sounds of the city, cars and people, you will thoroughly enjoy this spot. All the many reviews have essentially said this, which was our experience- its so peaceful. You are surrounded for miles by farm land. There is a great view of the horse paddock and fields and farms in the distance right out the window. For city people, its a real getaway. Its super cozy, with two bedrooms above the living area in a loft type space with sloping somewhat low ceilings.
The important stuff like A/C works great and seems new. Kitchen and baths were roomy, clean and nicely decorated. Wifi as others touched on is a little spotty but works. I wouldn't relying on it to try and work remotely though.
We also enjoyed being able to walk directly from the yard into trails. We tried two, one behind the owners house, which led quickly to near the reservoir but the trail -maybe due to rhe weather may have been better on horse back- it was blocked by standing water that was hard to traverse on foot and very muddy. The second trail from the yard directly behind the paddock was a much more pleasant walk- still through rough grass so you may need hiking shoes- but led around farm land and state forest that was very enjoyable.
The town of Lagro has a portion of a bike trail that is not yet complete that will connect to Wabash and further. (See Wabash river trail Facebook page).
As the listing mentions stores and restaurants are closed Sunday (and we discovered Mondays too). So get groceries either at Kroger or walmart or a single family run grocery all in Wabash and open Sundays.
The town of Wabash is small with alot of history and the downtown has alot of charm- and the town and county are working on ""revitalizing"" with new stores and restaurants. The old book store on the main street is an absolute must for anyone enjoying that. The resale boutique Bellazo was excellent with a much better ""curated"" selection of clothes than ""used"" sounds and trendy gifts and tshirts. The restaurant Harrys, a mile or so from downtown was, on Monday night, a great local spot with really excellent food and beer selection."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is an oasis! We loved our visit! The living quarters were very nice! Our son loved being right there with the animals (as did we)! The outdoor area is beautiful and loved that they provided the grill so we could easily cook while outside! This was our first air bnb experience and I am so glad we did it! The views were amazing and the place was perfect! I'd highly suggest you book your quiet get away! The host was great about answering all my questions before hand too!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievably peaceful experience!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our two night stay was just what my family and I needed for our mini vacation!

A great place for families!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really nice place to get away for a long weekend. It was very comfortable to just hang out with family or friends, away from all the busyness of everyday life. There are trails for walking right out the back door, which was nice for a chance to get outside. The town of Wabash is close to get to for anything you might need. We loved the animals that are right below the apartment too!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was AMAZING. Beautiful, modern, safe, and comfertable. We enjoyed our stay so much. Have the quiet farm outside with the horses right when you walk out is so cool! You wouldn't even know you are living in a barn if you did walk outside, it was better then our Chicago Apartment! Loved staying here!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, quiet and the perfect place to decompress!! Nature at it's finest!! We were able to work and homeschool during our visit!!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at the carriage house is beautiful, and designed to be a place of peace, from the color scheme to the beautiful views. The time of quiet was just perfect and having access to trails right outside was wonderful for a morning walk.
We will be staying again soon!"

The amenities were plentiful - cooking supplies, comfy beds, lots of pillows, modern and spacious bathroom. Thanks, Jen!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The space was everything we were expecting and more! The living and kitchen area was spacious. There were plenty of kitchen supplies as well. We didn’t miss any utensils or cookware. Every thing was really clean as well. Before coming one person in our group expressed concern that it might smell bad since we were staying near horses and in a barn, but this place is so nice! (smelled new and clean!) Even the stables below were clean, well kept, and enjoyable to walk through. We all would highly recommend it to others! Jennifer was a great host and was really prompt with our questions. We used the grill and outdoor space which was also nice. There were so many amenities and perks that made this place feel like we got more than we paid for!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time here! Jennifer was so great with our kids, giving them apples to feed the horses and letting them loudly explore the barn. The setting is beautiful, and the space is clean and cozy. We’ll be back!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"What an incredible place! The Carriage House is everything it claims to be and more. Clean, charming, welcoming, cozy, and memorable. The nearby trails are breathtaking and the animals are super friendly. We fell in love with the horses and the cat!
I expected to celebrate my 40th birthday weekend somewhere like Vegas, but the pandemic prevented that. This ended up being such an incredible weekend and the perfect getaway for our group of six good friends. We will definitely be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely farm stay. The converted barn has everything you need for a comfortable and cozy time. If you are into hiking, horseback riding or lake activities, this is a great location."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous! Walking to the reservoir is beautiful. The horses are very friendly and were a big hit with our children. This is the perfect family get away and would make an excellent girls’ or couples getaway as well.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was great, it's close to great hiking areas and not too far from Wabash for anything else you would need. It is in a quiet area, the only noises come from animals in the Barn. That was part of the fun for us though. It has everything you need and was very clean! Definitely would come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really great place to get away from it all. The interior is nicely done with up to date finishes.
It’s great to be at the end of the road and literally surrounded by nature.
I thought it was super and plan to return in a month or so."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a gem! A place we will surely return to! Very clean and has everything you need. The best part of the trip is the outdoors- relaxing outside watching the horses and enjoying a bon fire at night.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. We really enjoyed the carriage house, very tastefully decorated and comfortable. I read people complaining about the water smelling like iron. It not an issue for us. The wifi was not really working for us, but it was not a big deal, we read, played the board games, hiked around the place. We went to Wabash's farmers market. We really enjoyed our stay... So relaxing! Jennifer left us a lot of fresh eggs, we appreciated such a thoughtful attention. They were excellent."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this for a girls weekend and had a great, relaxing time. The horses were friendly and added so much fun to our stay. We hiked through state forests and down to the boat ramp at the lake. While we cooked all our meals at the barn, we did try to go to Wabash after the beach on Sunday afternoon. Jennifer did have in her tips after booking that most stores would close early on Saturday and likely be closed Sunday, but we didn’t expect all the local restaurants downtown to be closed, so that is something to be aware of in planning. Overall we had a great trip and would recommend a stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was awesome! Beautiful view out the windows. Such a cool experience and hard to believe we were in a barn with horses. The place was extremely clean. The towels and bed linens smelled fresh and clean. We would love to come back!

2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time. I have many relatives in Wabash and they all loved the place. I will let my friends know and if possible we will come back.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was clean, comfortable, and smelled like it was brand new.
It was like staying in a four star hotel room above a barn!
Jen & Ben were great hosts.
The state park was wonderfull. They have a large beach, and a marina that rents boats.
And of course the horses. They were friendly an became our best buds after a few carrots.
If you are looking for a unique experience, this is it. Highly recommeded!"

We enjoyed fishing and hiking in the nearby state park which had some awesome trails and views. We are most definitely coming back this summer and bringing friends. I would give this more than 5 stars if I could!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was beyond just a place to stay while visiting family, this was an amazing experience. The carriage house, the barn the animals, and waking up to the horses right outside the window was just beyond amazing. It was extremely clean, and didn’t smell like farm at all!
Myself and my 2 boys didn’t want to leave, they even went 1 whole day with out their cell phones and put together a 300 piece puzzle and finished it. It was just an amazing experience. We can not wait to go back!!!
The host Jen and Ben were super awesome and on top of things. They have a beautiful home and we are extremely grateful."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jens place was such a great stay. Everything was sparkling clean and she was so thoughtful with all the amenities and small touches. She and her husband were very helpful with local suggestions.

I would definitely come back and make sure to brag about this hidden gem. Thanks again Jennifer♥️"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn / Carriage House was very stylish and well appointed. We were surprised how nice the place was, like really nice, for being in an old barn loft. Recently renovated with very new appliances, we found everything we needed was furnished by the hosts. Jennifer was super responsive with communication and made sure the place was sanitized before our arrival for a memorial service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Very private and close to many natural amenities (trails, reservoir, state park), we expect to be back for a future visit. Would recommend to anyone traveling through the area."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jen and Ben are awesone hosts. Very quick to response to all our needs and questions, they keep a very clean and tidy place.
The place is so charming and well decorated and with all the necessary amenities to have a great stay.
We were looking for peace and quiet, and this was the perfect location for that, walks every day to the surrounding areas, nights full of stars and bonfires almost every day, how can you beat that.
Overall the Carriage House was perfect for our needs and surpassed all expectations, we look forward to coming back some time soon."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The bnb was absolutely fantastic. Can’t recommend enough if you’re looking for some peace and quiet.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful place to relax, and plenty of nearby nature to explore right outside the door!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we had a great experience! I loved that I could take the dogs right out and follow the trail to walk around the Salamonie Lake. We didn't have any trouble with high grass and the dogs loved it! It was very clean and we loved seeing the horses. It was also pretty close to where the in-laws live so it was a great location for us. Although the hosts live on the property, we didn't feel like we were being watched and it was very peaceful there.
We did hear some of the animals during the night, but it wasn't overwhelming. The only other ""complaint"" we had was that the water is very iron-y(?). So when you showered you could smell it pretty strongly. They did provide bottled water and water for the coffee which was an awesome touch! We will definitely be back next time we are in town!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am on a cross country trip and this was my first experience with an AirBnB lodging. It exceeded all my expectations. The renovated space above the main barn is very stylish and they have provided everything you need. And if you are wondering, you don't get any farm animal smell in the carriage house."
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing beautiful space, beautiful area and... horses! Ducks! Chickens! Beautiful location next to park and lake!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The barn was clean! I didn't think an operating barn could be so clean! We were greeted by charming duck and chicken noises. The carriage house didn't smell like we were above the stables either. The hammocks were enjoyed by giggling teens. Items were left behind and Jennifer made sure we could pick them up the next day. We only wish we could have stayed longer.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a hidden gem! You will scarcely believe you're staying in a barn. We enjoyed hearing the hens on occasion and seeing the horses in the pasture. This space is very tastefully designed and decorated. You'll enjoy the scenery from the cozy living room, which adjoins the full, and well stocked, kitchen, and convenient full bath with double sinks and walk in glass shower. Upstairs you'll find two bedrooms with super comfortable beds. Our host also provided us a full bowl of farm fresh eggs. Salamonie reservoir and the boat dock are only a short walk for hiking, water access and more."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property! Loved the animals. Well kept place. Modern. Only negative was the shower made us smell like metal. Country life.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My best friend lives in Chicago, and I'm in Cleveland. We wanted to do a getaway weekend somewhere in the middle... And we came across the Carriage House. It has so much charm/character with a gorgeous/renovated living space. I was a little worried about the smell of being so close to animals, but that was a non-issue! While in the Carriage House, we heard the chickens/ducks from time to time; otherwise, it was quiet and peaceful. I'd highly recommend staying here."
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Jennifer has an excellent place to stay. She anticipated the needs of any potential guests! So thoughtful! Her place was immaculate!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Jennifer has a lovely air b&b home! We would definitely stay again if we are back in the area. Very clean and nice. She was also very responsive & helpful!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host, great location, good hikes nearby, fun little towns and boating nearby...great stay! We really enjoyed and just wish we would have stayed an extra day"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, you are above a horse barn. That is part of the charm but the carriage house is beautifully renovated, super clean and appointed with everything you will need. The location is beautiful and we enjoyed the fire pit.
It’s less than 15 minutes to Wabash and it’s a quick walk down to the reservoir. I loved watching the horses and enjoyed the peace of nature. I highly recommend this location."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,I'm happy to be the next in line to give Jen and the Carriage House a five-star review! It truly is everything all the previous guests said it was! Better than expected...spotlessly clean...well appointed...cozy atmosphere...beautifully furnished...nature lover's delight...perfect family retreat...I could go on and on! Jen's Carriage House provided our family with an idyllic setting to create lasting and cherished memories...and we did!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful! Peaceful surroundings and very clean! Her place is very well done! I look forward to another visit to enjoy another time!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful scenery.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay! It was so beautiful and private.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Carriage House is beautiful! So stylish yet comfortable at the same time. The location is unbeatable if you’re looking for peace and tranquility. Absolutely loved the place would definitely go back and Jen is a very thoughtful hostess!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer’s place is absolutely wonderful. The scenery is so beautiful and relaxing. I enjoyed being so close to the horses and watching them mornings and evenings. The barn apartment feels like home with its modern finishes. I enjoyed the coffee shop in Wabash and a shopping trip to Ft. Wayne. It’s a great location out in the country without being too far from city shops. Would love to visit again and see the breathtaking farm views. Jennifer is extremely kind and a top notch host.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Every amenity was thought of - more than adequate in every room !!! extremely clean and comfortable !!!!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very neat and clean. It has everything you need to enjoy your stay. Very private even though the owners are close by. The Hosts are very polite and accommodating.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful place! It worked great for us to stay here while attending my daughter’s graduation from IWU. Very comfy and cozy.
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The carriage house was exactly as pictured on the site, but the picture doesn’t do the place justice. Downstairs was the kitchen, bathroom and group space , upstairs were the two bedrooms. All areas were made to feel comfortable , just like we were at home. Just an FYI, the tv is upstairs in one of the bedrooms so if you’re looking forward to a group movie night, use your laptop. Jen was a great host, always there to answer questions but not intrusive. I’ve stayed at owner occupied rentals before and always felt watched , this was not the case. We would love to come back when it wasn’t raining to explore the state park. All in all a great spot in a beautiful location."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place! Horses are beautiful, the house was very clean! Definitely worth 10 minutes extra to stay there than a place that might be a hair closer to where you need to be. Great great stay"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jennifer’s place was great! The Carriage House was sparkling clean and the linens and bedding were very comfortable. Our kids loved the horses and cat. Very private place. We enjoyed our day trip to Shipshewana as well. It was nice to just get away and play board games and connect as a family. Thank you!!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House was perfect for us! Everything was so clean and Jennifer had absolutely EVERYTHING we needed and more, including an electric hand mixer! Her tips about what shops to visit were spot on and her communication with us was fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. It was the perfect, quiet, relaxing getaway for my mother and me."
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Carriage was clean, well appointed, and exactly what my friends and I were looking for to get away from our busy lives. The space is cozy yet spacious, and was perfect for hanging out. Despite the cold outside, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place! The house is spotless and comfortable. The location is wonderful. Wabash County has much to offer. Can’t wait to stay again.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer’s place was awesome. It was super clean, comfortable, and just as pictured. My family and I had a wonderful time together cooking meals and playing board games. The location was secluded and peaceful as well. We highly recommend staying here!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our Thanksgiving stay at the barn was perfect! It was a great space for meeting and catching up with family! The space was clean, updated and cozy. Highly recommended if you are traveling to the area!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Outstanding host!! Very accommodating and help.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Carriage House was a beautiful little weekend getaway for my family. Clean, nicely finished, recently updated, beautiful views. Nice touches such as coffee, tea, condiments, etc. We made a big pot of chili and made great use of the kitchen, which was stocked with all the cookware you could need, built a fire in the firepit, made s'mores, and played board games.
Would definitely consider returning."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start by saying that Jennifer's place was immaculate when we arrived! Everything we could have ever needed for our stay was there.
And to allay any fears for future guests; there are no horse odors in the apartment. (The #1 question I was asked when I told people we were retreating to a horse barn for our anniversary.)
I highly recommend Jennifer's Place to anyone looking to slow down and relax for a bit. We surely did!
Best regards!
Daniel"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Family of 4 with two teenage girls and a dog had nice and peaceful fall break getaway for two nights. The place is very clean and organized. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom was good size. My girls loved seeing the horses every morning. There are several state parks and nature preserves in less than 10 min driving distance. We enjoyed their trails during the day and played board games that were in the residence at night. We had relaxing and quality family time.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was one of the best AIRBNB stays for myself personally. It has an amazing view. extremely peaceful and quiet. John and his family are incredibly friendly, helpful, and awesome hosts. They treat you like you are part of their family. If I ever get a chance to stay at the cabin again I definitely will."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable cozy cabin located riverside and close to many hiking trails. John was very responsive to the couple questions we had.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very charming home in a beautiful location. The river was very tranquil, and the place just felt nice and comfy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome stay, very relaxing one of the best places I’ve stayed"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One or both of us have stayed at John's cabin a total of four times, and we plan on coming back in the future. We love the setting of the cabin and proximity to friends and family. Thanks again, John, for providing such a great cabin and being such a gracious host!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice private spot and very peaceful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a peaceful and serene setting. The kitchen and bathrooms were well equipped. Everything was clean and well appointed. Thank you John for your lovely accommodations!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time to this area, we really enjoyed the cabin. The moment we walked in we felt right at home. the kitchen is great! We loved the deck at the edge of the river and the enclosed yard with the firepit. We had a great weekend and highly recommend this cabin!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property by river. John was easy to communicate with
I would have a discussion with cleaners but the location was very nice."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely love this place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We absolutely love this place and can't wait for our next visit.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was an exceptional place to stay right along side the Salamonie River. The outdoor setting was amazing with a deck and fire ring. I highly recommend this place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at John's place several times over the last few years. I keep coming back because of it's location near the Salamonie River. It's extremely enjoyable to wake up in the morning in such a pieceful and beautiful location. Thanks, John!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"excellent stay, beautiful area. clean cabin. will definitely recommend"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, as remembered. Planning on returning again!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved every second of our stay. Cutest little cabin! John, was the best!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second visit - felt like coming home!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at John’s cabin on the Salamonie River! It was cozy and comfortable inside, with a great kitchen, perfect for cooking a special holiday dinner for New Year’s. The outdoor area looked great too, and we’d love to come back in warm weather and enjoy the deck, grill and fire pit and explore the area more. We did get in a short hike a Hanging Rock, which is very close by. Back at the cabin, we really were right on the river, and we could watch — and hear — the ice break up. Overall, a great trip! We appreciated being able to bring our dog as well."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time during my stay! The location was easy to find, had beautiful views, and was close enough to town to make a quick trip when needed. John had several items already stocked in the home, which was very convenient. John was quick to respond and very friendly!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely setting and perfect homebase while we were back to visit family. Will definitely plan to come back!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing. Great views. Everything was clean and we had everything we needed. I would highly recommend staying here for a relaxing weekend
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Oh my, what a location! We saw so much wildlife and the peaceful river was absolutely amazing. We can't wait to come back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was absolutely wonderful. Private. Beautiful view of river from the deck. Great for just sitting and talking. Wabash also has some really neat spots. Thank you!
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great! Perfect for my husband who is a Birder, he saw 22 species just on the property. John was very friendly and helpful. The fire pit was great and John supplied wood and marshmallows 🔥, you can fish right on the property. But If you are looking for a 4 star place this is not for you."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a beautiful and tranquil location. Everything necessary was easily accessible in nearby towns, yet the location feels secluded. We were able to fish, walk along the river, and achieve a feeling of peace that isn't the norm in the city. John is easily contacted and answered any questions we had. We can't wait to stay here again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a place to “get away from it all” but not be totally secluded, this place is great! Right on the Salamonie river, you are able to hear the tranquility of the slow current of the water along with the insects and birds. It’s quite relaxing. We loved going down on the flat rock area and sitting and watching the crawdads peek in and out from under rocks.
We also made use of the fire pit several nights which was great to have. The cabin is clean, tidy, and accommodating. Highly recommend booking with John."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend on the Salamonie River. The location was perfect for us because we love to fish and hike. Huge plus that our Black Lab could come too!!! Loved watching the birds and soaking up the tranquility!!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay at John's Cabin for a weekend getaway. If you are looking for a place where you can sit on the deck and relax all vacation, this is the place. However, it is also a two minute drive to the state park, which has some great trails. From a charcoal grill, to a fire pit, to a fully stocked kitchen the place had everything you could possibly need."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We love the cabin. It’s so peaceful and quiet. We seen quite a few eagles fly over. We seen deer crossing the river. So much to explore trails and walk on the river. The cabins are awesome place to stay. Thank you John for everything
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a beautiful spot!!! Enjoyed the deck area where we could sit outside and view nature at it's finest. Enjoyed watching the birds, fishing, letting the kidos wade in the river, catching frogs and crawl dads. The firepit at night was a great way to finish off the day and prepare you for a great nights sleep. Beds were very comfortable. Everything you needed to get you started was there and arranged in such a way that it made it easy to find. The outdoor shower was awesome. Will definitely be back to relax and rewind. John was a great host who made sure we had everything we needed. Thanks John!!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. John was always responsive. The dogs loved it.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"still my favorite place to stay while visiting in Wabash. John is a great host, communication is awesome. I wish the outdoor shower and hot tub worked but it's still a great place. ."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A little slice of heaven. Our family had such a beautiful weekend and can’t wait to return. We have already looked into booking again. The pictures don’t do this cabin justice. It is very well kept and well stocked. A Walmart is located about 10 min down the street for supplies. The cabin is clean, and very beautifully decorated. If you are considering this property, book it, you won’t regret it!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,twas good place:)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just can't say enough as to how much we enjoyed our stay. John is an extremely gracious host, that is for sure. The photos did not do his place justice. We truly loved very aspect of our stay. Just relaxing on the deck watching and listening the river flow by was exactly what we needed to cleanse our souls. The property is great, the area is great, we enjoyed a fantastic walk on the trails to the waterfall. We will 100% return for another stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rustic perfection!
This is my favorite place ever! Pictures do NOT do it justice. The warmth and feeling of home is unmatched. This place was clearly created with love...it exudes from everywhere. So unique...
So many words...delightful, comfortable, interesting, fun, relaxing, cozy, peaceful, personal and just wonderful 😊
The style is eclectic and a bit whimsical.
John has thought of everything. All of your needs are within arms reach.
Everything you need and things you didn't realize you needed are right there too. Brilliantly stocked kitchen.
Love the river, kayaking... so easy to put in. Love the firepit. Sweet grill. This is definitely our dogs favorite place as well.
If you don't enjoy yourself completely you may need in depth therapy!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"awesome place to stay on the river, can't wait till it's warmer and I get to stay again soon great host great communication"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s a quick drive into Wabash and just two minutes away there is a really yummy pizza restaurant. It was very peaceful and quiet; loved sitting outside in the mornings and evenings. A very comfy place! Highly recommend.
2022-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"My family rented this house for a weekend getaway, to spend time away from technology, and spend time with each other. Unfortunately, the Indiana weather was unpredictable, so we couldn't really explore the area. The kitchen was our favorite room. Lots of modern upgrades, and really cozy. The beds and rooms were extremely clean, and the outdoor cabin was a nice surprise. My family really enjoyed the weekend we spent here, and are looking forward to a return visit soon."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little house right on the river! Super quaint, excellently stocked kitchen/bath! We enjoyed a great relaxing weekend! John is extremely on top of communicating!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little cabin— right on the Salamonie River, cozy wood stove, and well equipped overall. We’ll definitely be back again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"perfect getaway, our family loved the setup there, very unique vacation home right next to the river. John was great and quick to respond to any questions or needs"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location is amazing. The house sits on the river and the sounds and sights are lovely. John is a great host and communicates often to ensure everything is as it should be.
The kitchen and bathrooms were very well stocked. The house was very clean and smelled good.
If you enjoy hiking, there are several places close by to do so. I highly recommend Kokiwanee Nature Preserve. The waterfalls are beautiful and I saw eagles perched along the river trail.
I definitely want to come back when the weather is warmer to kayak and fish."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John was a wonderful host! Very communicative and responsive! The cabin was perfect to have a nice little get away. Full kitchen with a nice island and rain shower in the master bath. Nice deck looking over the river and a wood burning stove that heats the place nicely in the winter.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is incredibly close to numerous hiking trails, both inside the state forest and a number of smaller nature preserves. Bald Eagles are abundant in the area! We stayed for three nights and the kitchen was well very appointed, providing everything we needed to prepare all of our meals. (There's even a waffle maker!) We appreciated the extra supplies such as oils, butter, spices and condiments so we did not have to purchase those sorts of items just for a few days. The beds were very comfortable and it was nice to have the full bath upstairs by the bedroom as well as a half bath downstairs. The convenient location for family hiking as well as the river view and comforts of the cabin have us planning to return in a different season. (The frozen waterfalls located on nearby trails were absolutely gorgeous in winter, and we expect the spring wildflowers will be, too). A note for those looking: anyone sleeping in the outer bedroom located in the shed will need to go to the main cabin to use the bathroom. This is a very, very short distance, but might be problematic for some visitors if they need a bathroom closer. Perfect for older children/teens or early/late risers, though! This is cabin is a little gem and we really enjoyed all the thoughtful extras like books and games and toiletries."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place that feels like you are miles away from everyone but yet still close to town. Beautiful views of the river and plenty of wildlife to watch.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy, interesting cabin in a great location. And it's right on the river. Very quiet."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wow! Hidden gem. Wake up every day with a beautiful sunrise and view of the river right out your bedroom window. As a digital nomad, the WiFi was upgraded by John so you can take video calls / stream / be productive online. The fireplace & private steam-room keeps you cozy all day and night. Close enough to groceries / restaurants / bars / hiking / etc. Each night, at sunset, I would drive to Salamonie River State Park to hike. Guesthouse was great for me to bring family & friends to get away & visit me in this cozy, private, getaway. Highly recommend."
,,,"Our stay was a nightmare. Our beds in the house were not made ande we could not find sheets or pillow cases. We had NO toilet paper in the bathrooms & could not find any. Thankfully we brought a roll. We found 4 towels for 6 people. There was a basket full of dirty laundry at the washing machine. We arrived in the evening and then had to go meet family. When we returned, I messaged John and told him I expected a full refund. We had to go rent hotel rooms. We had no instructions. Luckily my sister happened to find the key to the shed. There was dog food & dog hair on the floor. Dog hair on the kitchen table. Filthy/stained carpet in the bedrooms. Bugs in the shed bedrooom & no way to keep them out. There was NO outside lighting. It was a struggle seeing our way to the front door and finding the key hole. I pointed this out to john as well. Trying to see an address on a stick at night on a completely dark road & ulling into the drive and down a hill towards the river was frightening in total darkness. If we had stayed I would want to return by sunset to avoid the danger. Ther were 2 keurigs and no coffee. There was a bucket of folders fround coffee that expired in March. There was JIF peanut butter & I was concerned about the recall, so I looked at it & it expired November 2021. I didnt even touch the large JIF jar after that. We could not find any firewood but hoped to roast smores and hot dogs. We couldnt enjoy the river view because the deck and furniture was filthy and full of bugs and spiders. Of course its outside but things can be swept & hosed off & sprayed for bug control. Again, there were no instructions/recommendations. John blamed the house keeper but some of this is simple neglect in my opinion. The house was nicer in general except for the stained carpet. I am happy John gave me a refund as is fair and I hope he pays better attention as a host."
