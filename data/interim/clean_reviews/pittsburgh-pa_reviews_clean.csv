2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the Airbnb was a nicely decorated and furnished place, the bed had stains on it, but I was provided with new sheets, there was no toilet paper. The next day they had someone bring toilet paper, and the trash that had the name of the previous guest was still sitting on top of the trashcan, the host was very responsive and made sure to take care of anything that I had issues with. I just wish that it would have been cleaned prior to our stay because we checked in at 3 AM so we had no choice but to stay and sleep in dirty sheets on the first night"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great space
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place, great location for sure. Be aware that checkout is at 10am and there‚Äôs a fee for late checkout. There‚Äôs a bodega right around the corner, and even a DGX, which both are perfect for stocking up. Walking distance e to a ton of things. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for just a few days for unfortunate circumstances, and arrived in the city at 4 am.

Host was responsive, friendly, very understandable!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"In addition to being everything I wanted in an apartment that is very centrally located, the responsiveness of the owners was unbeatable.
I was trying to leave early on Thanksgiving Day (5am) and had a problem with the door code as I was packing my car. Very stressful, as you can imagine. I messaged my hosts and within 2 minutes they called me to provide an alternate code (again, this was about 5:30 in the morning by then). I‚Äôd give a 6/5 stars if I could."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spent the night for my cousins bridal shower, everything was great and looked just like the pictures! You‚Äôll get a workout in going up the stairs for the bathroom/bedrooms. Beds were comfy, place was clean, street parking, cute kitchen with everything you could need.

Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kira's place was lovely. Very clean. Beds were very comfortable. The deck with a view was a plus. FYI it is parallel street parking kind of tight unless you are an expert and Troy hill is no joke very steep and tight but that is Pittsburgh for you

The view of the river and across the city were absolutely amazing and the space even has a little deck with sitting to enjoy the scenery. Kira was responsive and and SO helpful, though we didn‚Äôt need much, she made check in/out a breeze. The BnB is in a cute little neighborhood with lots to walk around and see.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I don‚Äôt even know where to start about this quick stay we had in Pittsburgh. Kira was very accommodating from the start when I asked about early check-in and she wasted no time recommending local eats. Her listing was listed at a great price and it doesn‚Äôt do the house justice. A majority of the stay was spent in the house which felt just like home. Would definitely rebook with Kira!

2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Living in the city like Chicago, I never really get quiet. When I got to Kathleen's place, my first few steps in and I was in awe. It was as if I had walked into a totally different place.
On top of the homely and welcoming feeling, the apartment is very well equipped. With adjustable heating and a nice cozy and comfortable living area.
I was just telling Kathleen that I slept like a baby on the bed and now I have to get that same bed, it felt so comfortable, firm and heavenly.
The kitchen is also very modern and nicely equipped, I made dinner and breakfast during my stay, bought some groceries from Target and had a nice cup of hot earl grey tea while watching Perks of being a wallflower on her DVD player.
Did I mention I also soaked myself in the lovely tub? I always wanted a tub like hers. Just amazing.
Will most definitely return to her place if I am ever in the area.
Thanks again Kathleen!"
2015-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for a great place to stay by the stadium! Very quiet area, all residential. Cute renovated apartment. Took UBER everywhere for $5-$8. Super convenient. Exactly as advertised. Kathleen was helpful and easy to communicate with."

If I suggest anything is to have a coffee pot or something, even if people bring their own! It would of been great this am! But seriously this place rocks!
Thank you Kathleen!"
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place in an interesting neighborhood, with a number of nicely restored rowhouses nearby.

2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment was very clean and well kept. Very nicely remodeled. We really enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood was not the best. My wife mentioned she would not have wanted to walk around at night. But overall a great place that we would highly recommend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend! You couldn't ask for more on The Strip. This is a great place in a great location. The apartment is just steps from some terrific seafood and Asian grocery stores, world-class bakeries (Mancini's, Enrico's) and amazing restaurants. It's a short walk to the Heinz History Center, which I greatly recommend for both adults and kids. We did have some difficulty getting into the building, which I mark down to our own ineptitude in reading directions. And parking is a beast, but that is a Pittsburgh thing. The parking apps didn't help. We finally found a lot on Smallman for $18/day."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anastas‚Äôs place was just right for our long-weekend with a few close family members. The place was beautifully appointed, immaculate, and very comfortable for our group of 3. We loved that we could park 2 cars and walk the neighborhood. The rooftop view was a special bonus, with a perspective of Downtown that gave us a real sense of place. Anastas offered us some 100-percent accurate recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance, and the clean, well-equipped kitchen and adjoining dining area made it easy to make a family-style meal and relax together after a day of exploring the city. We felt safe and welcome. Many thanks to our wonderful, communicative hosts for an enjoyable introduction to Pittsburgh."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was very clean and directions were clear for finding/entering the home. Recommend staying in this unit if you have plans to be out of the house most of the day. The walls are very thin and residents of the apartments will bang on the walls indicating to other units to be quiet. While brushing our teeth in the evening and talking in bed someone banged on the wall against our heads. We woke up to neighbors banging on walls on a Saturday morning indicating to other units to be quiet. Location and cleanliness of unit is good along with interacting with host, however thin walls pose a problem as residents of unit are very vocal about keeping it down."

The apartment was spotless and LaShae and her husband were very proactive and responsive before and during the trip. Check in was easy - we only needed to enter a code on the door whenever we arrived at our leisure. The apartment was quiet and location was very close to downtown, with a parking spot included.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,LaShae's place is a great location not far from Carnegie Mellon and Pitt!

Upon arrival, check-in was fast, quick, and calm. The apartment looked exactly as pictured - it was clean, relaxing, and inviting. LaShae went above and beyond to recommend local restaurants and attractions; LaShae was super knowledgeable about the city and it‚Äôs surrounding neighborhoods, as well. Nighttime was quiet and restful. And the neighbors were friendly, too. I would absolutely recommend LaShae as a host. And I look forward to visiting again, soon!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay had one issue, otherwise it was great. We had no hot water from the time of our check in, until the morning we checked out. Luckily it was fixed on check out day so we could shower. Kasa did respond to my messages when I told them it wasn‚Äôt working. Just would‚Äôve been nice to have hot water our entire stay. Otherwise the room was clean, and the location was great."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a perfect place in a perfect area for not being right in the heart of downtown.
We were just far enough away from the city.
It was clean and easy to get aroundü§ç"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was amazing. The location is perfect. Quiet. Private. Lots of local food right around the corner.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect! We were in town for the weekend for a concert and were easily able to access PPG arena in a short, 15 minute ride.
The stay is accessible to many restaurants and the hosts were super responsive! The unit was as pictured and described, super cozy and a cool aesthetic, my wife loved it! Plenty street parking and it was quiet overall. 10/10 recommend Kasa!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay for a great priceüôÉ
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Parking out front wasn‚Äôt a problem for us but that may be due to the time of year (January) super easy to find and a lot of great walkable restaurants and things to do. The room was super nice and so was the building. Easy instructions !! Only cons to this place was that the bar was closed the whole weekend and didn‚Äôt really say why, and the bed was like sleeping on the floor (not very comfy)."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed the cleanliness and security of the room. I completed work in their window seating, and it gave me a comfortable place to focus. The snacks, water and coffee were little touches that made my stay that much more special."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful spacious rooms, easy access, everything available at the hotel if needed, and very responsive hosts. Easy liberty is perfectly connected to a lot in Pittsburgh, which makes exploring the city and neighbourhoods very easy!! Would recommend."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Other than no clear answer to no stairs access the stay was good. Not clear, though, about where garbage bins were.
I understand events happening at ground level, but the Friday before my check-out it was so loud, as if it was happening next door and I was on the 3rd floor. The whole building was vibrating too throughout the evening, as if there was an earthquake."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a fantastic place
I would definitely look to stay here again in future"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spontaneously decided to take a trip and stumbled upon this gem with a great price. The lobby is charming, and stepping outside instantly lifts your spirits with a view of the beautiful church across the street. The room is well-equipped, and I highly recommend staying here. Bonus: Duolingo is right next door‚Äîgave me a good laugh thinking about the fear of being dominated by an English learning app!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ease cleanliness and low maintenance of a hotel with the coziness and charm of air bnb. Instructions for check in are as clear as can be. Great area, right in the middle of everything you could need. Great stay!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything is simple and straightforward. The room was stylish and East Liberty is a great location - major stores and restaurants at a walking distance. For those staying longer, you won't get any room service throughout your stay, so no new towels or sheets. Just as in an AirBnB, not as in a hotel."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So great, will stay again"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cool hotel lobby and guest room designs. Nice keyless entry and responsive customer service. Good street parking options. The chrome cast TV and safety lockbox were difficult to access without help. The view overlooked a library rooftop. Very walkable area. Nice amenities like a coffee bar and sitting area in the room.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Clean and comfortable. Perfect location surrounded by restaurants and near things to do.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a great time staying at Kasa! For context, i stayed here for three months. It was perfectly fine and they put me in a top floor room. Re: some other complaints: yes there are parties downstairs once in a while but its pretty infrequent. The fully virtual desk is quite responsive and accommodating and I never hard trouble reaching them.
I did have an issue with my bed having dust mites which made it quite difficult to breathe. I think the mattress needed to be changed. I fo"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Room was clean and comfortable, and the building was easy to access and get into. Kasa was great about communicating beforehand and made it all very easy. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy and smooth check-in. The room is clean and comfortable.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Checking into what is essentially a hotel without seeing another person is a little strange but not actually a bad thing. the space was beautiful and exactly as pictured. I couldn't have been happier with my room.
My only complaint and it's a very minor one. is that the Wi-Fi was almost unusably slow. that could have just been my room but had I been there longer than a single night it would have been an issue. But again... that's a really minor complaint."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great hotel except that an EDM event happened during my stay which was extremely disruptive.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,super cute & cozy
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean place, good location, clear instructions. A bit overpriced for what it is. AC is loud"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described and pictures in Airbnb. I stayed in a unit on the 4th floor with a view of a beautiful church just across the street. Along with the usual amenities of coffee maker/coffee/tea and creamers, Kasa certainly thought if everything a guest may need to feel comfortable and welcome. The extras like boxes water, ear plugs, make-up remover towelette and Tate‚Äôs cookies (my favorite)were a really nice touch. Kasa even went a step further and left two tokens for complimentary drinks at the bar on the first floor!!!!
I plan to stay again, however many of the weekends that I plan to be in Pittsburgh, they are already booked. If you are thinking about staying, I suggest you book as soon as possible!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Would definitely visit again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Had a good stay. I was there for a month so the space was small for my needs, although for a quick few day trip it would be perfect. Lots of good food nearby. The place is also a venue so there were concerts two nights - I heard the music in my room but it didn‚Äôt really bother me. There is a bar downstairs that is open thurs-sat. Weird hours but cute vibe. I would have liked to have had chairs with a back rather than the stools, as there wasn‚Äôt really anywhere to sit other than the bed. However, for the price and length I paid/stayed, it was very reasonable. Happy with my stay."
2023-08-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,Very noisy hotel. They have a EDM club on the first floor that literally shakes your room at 1AM with how loud the music is.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed my stay a lot I would definitely stay again. The place was clean and the hosts were responsive whenever I texted with a question. It‚Äôs in the heart of the city which is nice because there‚Äôs lot to do around there. One thing I didn‚Äôt know which I didn‚Äôt mind but is important to know is that the first floor turns into a club/bar on weekends so sometimes it can get loud or hectic on entrance. It wasn‚Äôt a problem though and I couldn‚Äôt hear anything from my room
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Solid, clean room. Great location and rate. If you‚Äôre up for the built-in nightlife on the weekends, it‚Äôs a great spot to stay in PGH."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to stay! Super clean, comfortable bed and great room."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for me and the purpose of my trip. Great location. Safe area. Clean and quiet. Really cool historic building. I loved the updated industrial feel of the room with its ceiling height window and window seat. If I had one negative it would be that u can‚Äôt even get in the building prior to check in time. It was pouring down rain and I had to sit outside and wait. It would have been nice to be able to sit in lobby until the room was ready. That being said I will be back!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice boutique hotel in a great location, with well decorated lobby/bar/rooms. It was exactly what we expected from the listing. Check-in was easy and the instructions were very clear. The room was clean and as promised. The view from our room of the church facade was beautiful. Would have loved if a USB and/or USB-C charging port was provided but all other ""tech"" worked as intended. Would recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great deal, fun neighborhood, close to everything but also quiet when you called it a day."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Virtual check in was fine but they ignored my request which was granted- for a high floor due to noise reviews. Change was timely made. Problem with zero place to hold luggage and klunky response to request for extra 15 minutes to leave was unfortunate. Otherwise fine if not glamorous.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,wish they would have told me there was an event before I booked. otherwise nice place
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and clean! Perfect for one night.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very nice spot in a great location, clean, quiet and trendy"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,View out of window did not match magical view of listing but upon calling and a few moments of being on hold we were relocated to a room that had an off centered view of our magical scenery. Very accommodating throughout. Will definitely keep in mind for future stays now that I see have various locations to choose from. Price was great! Hallways were quiet. Nice to have a nice clean space to your own. Also LOVED the hot water!!! All in all I‚Äôd have to say only complaint would be we didn‚Äôt stay longer. There‚Äôs always next time ‚Ä¶.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for two who wanted to get away for the weekend!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to enter with the pass codes. Very secure, beautiful inside and outside. Being seniors, we had a problem streaming. Very quick to respond and helped completely. Amply furnished, bed was extremely comfortable, well stocked with necessities, enjoyed the newly opened lounge on the main floor! Easy arrival and checkout, will certainly stay there again while visiting family in Pittsburgh!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exceptional value for the price. Clear and easy instructions to check in and check out.
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I'm giving them one more star than I originally planned only because they made it right by refunding me for my stay. I had booked a one-night stay with my friend at Kasa Maverick because of its amenities and location. The check-in process and room were exactly as described. What we were not notified about before our check-in was that on the evening of our stay, the hotel would be hosting an EDM concert in their hotel on the first floor. The concert started in the evening and went on until 2am, which we heard all the way up on the third floor where our room was. Because this is a contactless hotel, there wasn't a front desk person to contact, so I messaged them on AirBnB to get the reasoning behind this. I didn't get a response until the next morning, but by that point, we had checked out and were already on the road. Overall, the hotel itself was nice, but not sure if I'd stay at a Kasa again if something like this could happen again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was amazing!
Definitely doing it again.
Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was amazing and perfect! a cute, clean, and comfortable space! We enjoyed our stay so much! The communication was awesome and quick."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kasa definitely blew my expectations, i was on short notice looking for a place to crash after a wedding and luckily, I saw Kasa was on Airbnb , and such affordable price point as well"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good location and excellent communication. Room is clean and fairly unique in aesthetic.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We impulsively booked this place for a weekend away and are so glad we did! Awesome little spot in a great location, check in was simple, and we were supplied with everything we needed for our stay. The room was well decorated and cozy and we felt right at home. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,excellent stay it was so clean and easy
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute hotel room that offers modern updates to a historic building. My view of the nearby East Liberty Presbyterian Church was gorgeous. I loved this place and will definitely check it out again the next time I'm staying in Pittsburgh.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cozy space with thoughtful touches and amenities. Easy check in, we were able to park across the street to unload. We typically struggle with smart TV‚Äôs but directions were clear and easy to set-up. Very quiet and pretty view of the church."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kasa was the perfect little spot in Pittsburgh. The rooms are super clean with cute little amenities and touches. The location is one of the best parts- in an awesome neighborhood and close to a bunch of fun spots in ones of the best areas of the city. There is a bike share dock and electric scooter dock on the block so, instant access to anywhere you need to go that‚Äôs a little farther. Kasa is surrounded by cuts restaurants and cafes. The check in and virtual front desk processes are extremely easy and responsive. Don‚Äôt second guess staying here! Just do it!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and location. Easy parking right behind the hotel and easy self check-in. Would stay again
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Maverick was a perfect place for my fianc√© and I as we stayed for a short weekend trip. Check-in and check-out was super simple and parking was easily accessible in the lot behind the building. Definitely will use Kasa the next time we‚Äôre in town!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. Check in smooth and communication great. Would stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place is really clean and beautiful
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place overall, easy check in process. Rated less mainly because I got a phone call at 2:30 am from their staff accusing my husband and I for putting off the smoke detector in our room.
We were deep asleep and we don‚Äôt even smoke. It wasn‚Äôt so much the 2:30am call that pissed me off, is after I told the guy we were asleep and don‚Äôt smoke he ended the call by telling me this was our first warning , and with a next we would be asked to leave our accommodation.
I understand they have policies but we have no idea if they got the wrong room or what. Just made our stay very uncomfortable as if we were being watched through a camera since no one is there in person.
Place is nice, but would rather stay downtown next time."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My dog and I stopped here for one night on a roadtrip and had a great stay. My room had a beautiful view of the church across the street. It was a Sunday so parking at the Eva Beatty lot was free until Monday at 8am and it was just around the corner so it wasn't hard to carry all my things. During the day I felt safe enough as a young, female and there are a few good restaurants in walking distance. The check-in directions were some of the best I've seen and included pictures which was really helpful. Everything was clean and I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and cozy! Super quiet as well. Will definitely return. Great place for those who like modern but is also a minimalist. The bed was super comfortable also!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean room with an amazing view of the Presbyterian church.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Responsive, kind to work with me when I mixed up my check out time. Great place, convenient to go to Target CVS and Whole Foods. There is no window screen, be careful when opening up the window. Fridge may not be cold, be careful when storing food."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay here! Everything was clean and looked newly renovated. Loved the keypad entry - made me feel safe knowing no one else who wasn‚Äôt a guest there couldn‚Äôt come in. No complaints here!
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Questionable cleanliness. There was no cover on the duvet which looked visibly dirty. During my stay I developed a rash likely due to the sheets. When I asked for a change of sheets housekeeping dropped a bag of sheets at my door which I had to then change myself. Afterwards attempt at communication to discuss what happened during my stay were met with inaction and placation that the ‚Äúboard‚Äù would review things. I have not heard back from the ‚Äúboard‚Äù with any updates and any message asking for a timeframe is responded with it will be reviewed.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely hotel, super thoughtful hosts! They left cupcakes for us when I explained we were in town for a birthday trip."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place. Nice area to walk to eat or have a drink. Room was well put together and clean.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute little apartment feel. Very clean and well kept. Also nicely decorated. Essentials were provided and next to cute little shops and easy to navigate
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room was really nice in a beautiful building. The location was perfect for me and they were pet friendly. It was a great stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and comfortable! Would stay again!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very hip spot. Loved the aesthetics and accessibility of the space and neighborhood. Loved how easy check-in was. Felt safe. The cleaning staff were so friendly and helpful. It was a little noisy at night, but that‚Äôs what you get when you‚Äôre in a city."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The first stop to Pittsburgh, this area is relatively safe, easy and fast check-in, clean, there are not many facilities, but they are all very practical, the bedding is very comfortable, good reviews"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable, very nice bathroom, appreciated the quality soaps/shampoos and tea kettle. Hotels are super expensive in Pittsburgh for some reason, and this was a more affordable option. Walkable to Whole Foods and several coffee shops, and a good central location for traveling throughout Pittsburgh. Would stay again."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Easy check-in and check-out. Communication was outstanding. I would stay again!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Was good but too tidy
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Really great location, check in was easy with a door code. Customer service was helpful too and responsive when I called-- they answered and texted me back within minutes."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it @ Kasa in Pittsburgh. A comfy room with beautiful windows and a great view of a church. Many nice, little treats were left for me (water bottles, tea bags, handwipes, etc.) I will definitely recommend if any friends are ever looking for somewhere to stay in Pittsburgh!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Good
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place and concept! Perfect location. Check in instructions are easily laid out step by step. Would use this company again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Beautiful building the heart of East Liberty and close to everything- restaurants, shopping and the Kelly Strayhorn Theater. I loved the view of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church and the big window with a seating area. The parking in the back of the building was very easy to use and affordable I look forward to choosing a Kasa in Pittsburgh again!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with cool decor
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This place shouldnt be on Airbnb. Check in was difficult, had to sign up for their special account/website. I received 12 emails before I even got into the building, and 3 more since my stay. This place needs to detatch from Airbnb because it is not actually an airbnb, its a virtual hotel chain. The hotel doesnt fit the Airbnb brand and it felt a bit cheap."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kasa was very accommodating, a great location, and the perfect size room for our needs!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It‚Äôs like if a hotel and Airbnb had a baby‚Äî it would be this place. All of the in-room amenities of a hotel without an ubiquitous hotel staff. Perfect for those of us who just like to come and go as we please without a crowded lobby or engaging in small talk. Location is perfect for getting anywhere in the city. Duolingo‚Äôs headquarters is right next door with their cute little walk up tacqueria where you can order in Spanish and get $1 off your order. The most underrated thing about this place is the incredible view of the church out of the window of our 5th floor room. Felt like we were in Europe! Beautiful stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easy to navigate, customer service was helpful, quiet, clean, and felt safe the whole time. The app the hotel suggested for parking was so helpful! It saved me money and never had an issue with prepaying/scheduling parking overnight until I was ready to leave work in the morning. Never once got a ticket or had an issue."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful, easy, clean option, that was well kept and affordable!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We (two people) spent the July 4th weekend in Pittburgh and booked this place on short notice. Overall we loved the accommodations: very clean, modern welcoming furniture, soft towels, well-thought-out telly location, and a flawless check-in system (although the preliminaries asking for personal info outside AirBnB didn't inspire confidence). The location was also top notch, close to good bus stops and hip dining and shopping streets.
One little issue: the window situation by the bed really lacks privacy. Either we used a ""blackout"" screen or the room on the other side looked right into ours (and we into theirs). It would be nice to add a translucent privacy curtain that still allows daylight in."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Flawless check in and check out process. Wonderful location and just 4 miles from Downtown. Comfortable parking and easy access to the building from the parking lot.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved my stay! Thanks for being so accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,nice location nice stay
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was really nice!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Kasa was just as described and very clean. I think it is a great option for those looking for a place to rest after exploring the city. The parking near the location is cheap (I recommend you download the app because other parking around the city uses the same system) and Square Caf√© is a two-minute walk from the spot so you can grab a quick yummy breakfast before starting your day (get that breakfast burrito!). The only issue we had was with the automated noise sensors in each room. Like all automated stuff, they are pretty indiscriminate about your activity so if you have a dog that barks a little as you head out for non-dog friendly event, or have a sneeze attack that reaches too high a decibel, you'll get an email notice threatening to cancel your reservation which is not fun. That said, we were under the impression we could leave our pup in the room if we had to head out which was not the case and that's definitely on us. They later informed us that their pet policy requires you to never leave the dog alone at the Kasa which is something to keep in mind if you are looking to do stuff without your dog. Overall, I think the spot was a good choice and I recommend it to anyone looking to pass by the Burgh and can take pups to every location you're heading."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Room was awesome! Great location and great view of the church. Restaurants and bars right around the corner.
Parking is $1/hr."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and communication
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious place and very comfortable
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Well located and nice design of the rooms. Although the cleanliness was okay overall there were areas that need more attention such as the seating by the window that was dusty. The hallway had an foul smell too.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"PROS: Great location, ease of check-in/check-out, pretty clean, great toiletries, would stay again CONS: TV was a bit small, some street noise in the morning and late night"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Good location. Smooth self check in and out. The room was clean and tidy. Pet friendly! Instructions were clear. Please change the air freshener to something neutral or less strong. We enjoyed the stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a convenient place to stay with a cool aesthetic. Everything is exactly like the pictures.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Lots of good restaurants around that are walking distance. Check-in and check-out was very easy.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Maverick by Kasa is a great option for anyone staying in the East Liberty area. It‚Äôs affordable, the rooms are spacious and very clean, and the check-in/out is very easy since it‚Äôs all based on keypad combinations they send you via email. It‚Äôs also very quiet. I‚Äôll definitely stay here again when back in this area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in and very nicely designed space. Very quiet and convenient location. The space was a former hotel, but there is no front desk reception or anyone to interact with in person, not necessarily a bad thing but just a note for those who may be expecting more of a traditional hotel experience!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this room! Great value! The location is prime in East Liberty. I can‚Äôt give it five stars though because it was so cold. No matter how high I turned the thermostat, I couldn‚Äôt get warm. The room had partially finished concrete floors, a stainless steel table, and really high ceilings. It was a nice modern-industrial aesthetic. Getting in and out was pretty easy and the building felt very secure."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect little space for staying in the city, convenient location, easy parking (lot near the building), easy check in, clean space and super trendy. Lots of towels, linen and everything you‚Äôd need for a small stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience like a private room in a hotel, everything was perfectly prepared!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, minimal, and simple!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little condo.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great space in a neighborhood with plenty of options for dining, drinks and groceries while being close to the city. Really clean, highly secure and great modern amenities."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location. Lots of room and very comfortable and private within the room.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can‚Äôt beat the location or the vibe! Great value as well. Would have rated it 5 stars had it not been for the dirty cups and towels in my room. Would still recommend to friends, however, for the reasons listed here."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My fianc√© and I came to Pittsburgh for the first time ever so we didn‚Äôt know where to stay. I had never stayed in an Airbnb so I was a little hesitant on booking one. Kasa was very quick on communicating with me and answering all of my questions. It is a very secure building which made us feel safe. The room was very clean and exacting how the pictures were. My only negative, which really wasn‚Äôt that bad, is we couldn‚Äôt check in until 4pm and had to check out at 11am. Other than that, everything was great. I will definitely stay there again next time we come to visit!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Room was clean and stylish. Building was in great location. Very happy with my stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places to stay in PGH - highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved the space when it was the Ace and I love that the hotel didn‚Äôt go to waste. Even though the there‚Äôs not an in person front desk or hotel service, I was able to get help with my code when it would work, right away as if the support was right in the lobby.
My 6lb pup loved the bay window seat too. Went to square cafe around the corner every morning for good coffee and breakfast."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for the wonderful stay! It was a beautiful location and bright, clean room. Would definitely come back again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First time using Airbnb and it went great. The room was perfect for my wife and I. Will do again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at The Maverick! My room was wonderful and the view of the church was amazing. I loved every detail of my room, pegged hooks, the big padded window seat and am obsessed with the wood work for the bed and microwave/refrigerator drawer and coffee bar area. The facility is located a walkable distance to eat and shop, close to hospitals, easy to get around. There is 15 minute drop off parking out front and convenient paid parking right behind the building. Communication was responsive and self check in could not have been easier. I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great room! Clean, check in was quick and easy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is amazing - it‚Äôs a renovated YMCA building with a gorgeous church across the street. Best value near Shadyside. The self-checkin was super easy (they text/email you a unique code: just press deliberately on the keypad and you‚Äôll have no problems). Plus the Kasa team is very responsive - would absolutely stay with them again. Pro-tip: Pittsburgh doesn‚Äôt have parking fees on Sundays so you can park on the street nearby until Monday 8am.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Only downside was having to pay to watch the tv in the room.
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very practical. They have a return policy of lost or forgotten items charged 60 dollars. You can't watch local TV and they never have anyone on the counter, but the host is always ready to answer any request.
I wouldn't stay again because there are allergies, my face started to swell and I asked for another room and they said they had nothing available but if you were online they had rooms available. I could hardly sleep for people making noise with a door and my allergies got worse"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend stay. Very easy check in process
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I wasn‚Äôt able to actually stay at Kasa. I needed to reschedule due to a trip inconsistency on my end. I wasn‚Äôt able to reschedule because I requested this the day of but they tried to help me. hoping to be able to try them out sometime soon.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique building‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a converted old YMCA building that is interesting and charming in ways and will be even more so after the new owner gets things up and running. The check-in process was confusing , but they‚Äôre working on it. They were very responsive to my communications. There are plenty of nice restaurants nearby for food and beverage. It felt like a safe neighborhood and it‚Äôs a reasonable drive to the downtown area. Only pay parking is available in this area."

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"I paid $100 extra for early check-in, because his check-in wasn‚Äôt until 4pm. However, the lock code didn‚Äôt work and hosts did not answer the phone.
Finally, via email, they figured out the code.
The house was not clean! Hair, fur, and dirt everywhere. One towel was dirty.
No towel bar to hang towels and only half TP rolls.
Hosts didn‚Äôt offer to clean or reimburse.
Location was great, but place wasn‚Äôt as advertised. Airbnb Help did reimburse me $100 fee."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raymond was a great host, very communicative and pleasant.
The airbnb was clean, bright and exactly what my husband and I were expecting.

We arrived & didn‚Äôt have an air mattress but we ended up sleeping on the couch- but both hosts were extremely responsive regarding and stated that their cleaner was dropping one off, we once again couldn‚Äôt find it once we got back. Our only complaint was the water pitcher had mold in it, all of the occupants all of the guests drank out of it but we spoke to the host and recommended he change them out.
LONG RANG- besides the fact we had an amazing stay!! Thank you for allowing us in your place."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We are a travel sport family and it is nice to not always be cooped up in a hotel. Raymond's place offered a home away from home that was close to many attractions. If you're a steelers fan this property is definitely for you as it is about 4 minutes away from the stadium.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent. Just what we needed :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous building and apartment. High ceilings. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Dog-friendly building.
Be sure to be out at 10 a.m. on the nose because the keypad on the door is programmed to stop working then. We were in the midst of bringing our baggage down to the car when this happened, but luckily, we were taking turns and hadn't both walked outside at the same time.
Bring your own Kuerig pods and dish towel. There are plenty of paper towels available, however.
Linens on bed and bathroom towels were all fine hotel quality. Building is quiet, and the common areas and hallways were all extremely clean and felt secure.
Reponsive host. I'd stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again and again. I was there to attend two Penguins games at PPG Paints Arena. It was walkable for me (though maybe not for everyone). Walked in and out of downtown.
The place was immaculate and just like the photos. Easy to find and enter. Checked in using only the door code.
Raymond was a stellar host. Very proactive and responsive. I didn‚Äôt want for anything during the stay.
Was so clean I didn‚Äôt want to use anything and dirty it up.
It‚Äôs a luxury appt and way affordable."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a really dynamic part of Pittsburgh. Highly recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the nicest Airbnb I‚Äôve been to. I loved everything about this place. It was very unique and artistic with soft and industrial elements. All the windows that brought lots of light in with a view of lots of green from the outside was amazing. I especially liked the upstairs patio. And the books‚Ä¶wish I could have stayed longer just to look more at all the books. I also really enjoyed the artwork and drawings. The neighborhood had so much to offer too! We were so happy and lucky to find this beautiful place. I will look for architect owners from now on when searching Airbnbs.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, myself, & our 60lb coonhound had a great time here. Our dog loved the yard and we all spent a lot of time there as well as walking the local neighborhood! There was a ton to do in walking distance so we only used our car when we needed to cross the river. For us this was the perfect location. Also if you love a great book collection and kickass art definitely stay here. We would definitely stay here again :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this spot, great location with waking distance to everything on the southside, very safe with gated area. The outdoor space was awesome for hanging out - a small oasis in the city. The bed is a bit tricky for two adults, and the ladder up requires shoes each time. Other than that we had a great stay, full kitchen and nice hot shower. Thanks, Carrie!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the more unique places I‚Äôve stayed, perfect for a weekend getaway. If I ever find myself in the area again, I know where I‚Äôm staying!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place is fantastic! The place is just unique, a hidden gem that is cozy and eclectic, and perfectly located in Pittsburgh‚Äôs South Side. When you step out the door you are within walking distance to numerous restaurants, pubs and shops that are just around the corner and down the street. The space has a very nice courtyard that adds some serenity and privacy to the space, and it has its own parking space which is really nice. We were pleasantly surprised as the home was well stocked with snacks, coffee, linens, towels, toiletries, and more, plus a fully functional kitchen, and Carrie was just an awesome host answering any questions we had and making our stay extra special. The next time we‚Äôre in Pittsburgh we hope Carrie's urban abode is open as it is now tagged as one of our favorites. Thank you, Carrie!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Carrie's place was such a cool place and an excellent location. She was so easy to communicate with and I really enjoyed staying there!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My two pups and I are traveling coast to coast (NJ to CA) and we stopped at Carrie‚Äôs place for a couple of nights for some rest and relaxation. It didn‚Äôt disappoint! What a fun space too. The decor was so lovely and I am a big fan of the modern industrial look! Carrie was super responsive and easy to communicate with as well. The yard was perfect for my pups. Carrie thought of everything from snacks to laundry soap to shampoo/conditioner and body wash. The shower was amazing too! Loved the shower head. I highly recommend staying at Carrie‚Äôs place. Excellent home and even better host. :) You will love it!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie was very easy to communicate with, making the stay seamless from start to finish. We loved the ultra-coziness of the unique space. The private backyard with a firepit was a nice bonus. The house is in a cool, walkable neighborhood. It's one block from Carson Street which has a number of restaurants and shops. Carrie gave us some helpful tips on a few places to eat and explore. Even the neighbors we ran into were helpful. They turned us onto the multi-use trail along the river that's just a couple blocks away. We would definitely stay at Carrie's place again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best place to stay in Pittsburgh!
Carrie was very helpful with all the questions I had. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, one of the best places I‚Äôve ever stayed. Will definitely come back whenever im back in town!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host. She was very willing to be available most of the time and she was very helpful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We can‚Äôt say enough about how wonderful Carrie‚Äôs home away from home is. Absolutely cannot wait to stay again. Her eye for design and creativity shines throughout her beautiful residence. I can‚Äôt imagine a nicer or more convenient place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I‚Äôm in love with this little space! It‚Äôs a great spot for two looking for a getaway with a pet - and a delightful design with amazing artwork and homey touches.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Carrie‚Äôs place was perfect for my boyfriend and i and our two dogs for a few days in Pittsburgh! Perfect location for access to anywhere in the city!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôm speechless. Hands down top 3 Airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed at (and I‚Äôve stayed at a lot).
Quirky art, creative use of space, comfortable, rad outdoor space‚Ä¶I could go on for days.
Carrie was lovely in her communication and super helpful.
And the amenities? A stocked fridge, anything you could want coffee and kitchen equipment wise.
The hidden rooftop garden was a joy. A perfect mix of urban and old-timey garden.
The walkability of the neighborhood was awesome. Hit up vintage stores and had a wonderful dinner‚Äîall within a few minutes walk of the space.
Will definitely be back. Amazing. Period."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of my favorite places I‚Äôve stayed at in Pittsburgh! Great place for a couple with a dog. So many good coffee shops, bars/restaurants, and shops walking distance away, right on Carson St, and also two dog parks nearby. Carrie was super nice and responsive, and the place was so cool!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was a great host! Her place is easy to find, walkable to restaurants and a quick trip to downtown!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie's space is so unique! the layout was comfortable. it's in a great location + having parking was amazing. the neighborhood is great too, lots to do, very walkable. the shower was very cool! I would say it was a little chilly and the steps to the loft were a little cold/textured so I would bring some slip ons and a sweater if you're there in winter. Carrie was very responsive and helpful too- and had a really well stocked pantry and fridge!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here! The location is super walkable to parks, restaurants/bars, vintage shops & more; also close to grocery and convenience stores; in case you want to stay in, there is a ton of art to admire, books to read, stocked fridge, etc. I loved having wine fireside in the courtyard and reading in the lofted outdoor hideaway. Carrie was a gracious and responsive host - would book again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is not my first time staying at Carrie‚Äôs place. It is one of my places of choice to stay when in the area. Great area with lots of shops and restaurants and very walkable. During my most recent stay my brother tagged along with for what would be his first visit to Pittsburgh. A great way to introduce him to the city!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The gas station house was a fun space in a great neighborhood.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie's property is such a unique gem in the heart of Pittsburgh's South Side and she couldn't have been more pleasant to book through. I can't wait to stay again in the future!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in - truly such a cool space. Carrie was super responsive, and made the space feel more like a home rather than a temporary space. I‚Äôll def be coming back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Funky cool loft with its own private outdoor space secure for a pup + your own parking space in a neighborhood where that‚Äôs a big plus.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place close to anything we wanted to do, Carrie was extremely nice and informative and responded quickly each time I had a question, great experience"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie is a great host. Stayed several days for my son‚Äôs wedding. Everything‚Äôs in walking distance or just a short drive. Very nice private courtyard, cool decor inside."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying and was great again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place is in a great area, lots of restaurants and bars. It is also close to a bike station and it is easy to get on the bike trail. Comfortable apartment, clean and easy to get to."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Carrie‚Äôs! Her place is so charming with lots of details that make the place feel well loved and cared for. She was so communicative and friendly and the value of the stay was excellent! Would recommend to anyone staying in the area!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was a very gracious host. The home was exactly as described and perfect location for what we needed to do. We are urban dwellers so the occasional city noise was familiar. Carrie offered the snacks and drinks in the cupboard and fridge. We've never had such generosity from any other host. The home has a lovely collection of books and interesting accessories. We hope this home is available on our next trip.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean and eclectic place! Very private and the private parking space was a bonus. Within walking distance to a lot of great bars/restaurants. Carrie was a great host, would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a place in Pittsburgh right around there and the location was perfect. Another huge selling point for me was the off-street parking which seems super rare in the area. Many restaurants in easily walkable distance. The whole place was very cool and a bit funky. The kitchen was well equipped and there were even basic condiments and many other things for the guests use which was great. The loft area where the bed is took a little getting used to with the climb up the very sturdy metal stairs - make sure you bring some shoes to wear for the climb as the slats are hardcore. The warmth up there in the summer was easily remedied by running the fan supplied directly up to help the air flow. The bed was a bit soft for me, but I like a very firm bed - also the ceiling up there is best for people under 6‚Äô tall (which I am not) but I never hit my head. The bathroom was huge and loved the rain shower. Great place and location!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place. Great use of an old garage! Clean and close to restaurants and bars!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"funky , repurposed space thoughtfully decorated . comfortable! walkable! clean! great for solo travelers or couples."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a super cool place! I remember this gas station well as I hung out on the south side as a teen. It was great to come back and stay at this super thoughtful converted home.
Lots of cool books to read, beautiful sunlight and private at the same time.
Carrie‚Äôs was super helpful, proactively attentive and I am sure if I had a concern or issue (which I had none) she would have been very responsive.
The location is perfect, it‚Äôs just off the main drag that has plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and night life.
Will definitely book again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend Carrie's place! The location was convenient in the South Side and easy to get to downtown Pittsburgh. The off-street parking spot was convenient, especially after our drive to the city. Throughout our stay, Carrie was a friendly and responsive host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Carrie's place several times. The home is always prepared as describes. A place with parking is a gem in this neighborhood. There are great walkable restaurants and bars.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my home base during a week-long event at the convention center and I did not regret my choice! Easy bus ride to downtown, but I found the trip was also walkable on nice days. Carrie‚Äôs is a stunning, original and welcoming space that also houses an inspiring collection of books (architecture, art, American fiction) on-site. Unusually well-stocked kitchen. Being able to start the day in the peaceful yard was a bonus!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie is a wonderful host, responsive and checked in with us during the stay. The place is unique with a lot of personal touches and we overall enjoyed our stay - every little thing in the house is taken care of with some extra, fenced yard was great for the dog, the kitchen was stocked, loved the chocolates, great restaurants, nice location!
Since it is a converted gas station, we didn't realize the absence of sound insulation like in apartments or home, this meant everything happening outside was very audible and it made our dog anxious at nights and we didn't find the bed very comfortable. Nevertheless, it was worth the trip and thanks to Carrie for creating such a nice space that is dog-friendly."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This retreat (and yes, I call it a retreat) was absolutely just what we needed. As soon as you walk into Carrie's space, you get that ""wow"" factor that lasts until you're sad to leave. The design, decor, layout, and special touches of the space all come together so well. The mini upper garden space off the loft was a special surprise. And the private parking really made the trip extra convenient. At first, I felt hesitant to dip into the stocked fridge, but only because I'm not used to such generosity in an Airbnb! But in order to really recharge on a trip, it is extra nice to truly relax into a space. Don't miss out on enjoying a fire in the evening!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed at Carrie‚Äôs place many times. The design of the space is beautiful! We always enjoy the artful decor and Carrie‚Äôs graciously-stocked refrigerator and pantry. It‚Äôs very convenient to have a parking space too. Carrie is so easy to communicate with and even wished me a Happy Mother‚Äôs Day.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, great location‚Ä¶ great outdoor space and pups were happy and comfortable"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot! it is very unique and has everything needed. The parking spot makes coming and going extremely easy!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the best place to stay in Pittsburgh especially if you are traveling with your dog. We enjoyed the high fenced yard and a leash-off dog park is 5 blocks away. Private parking made life easier....most of Pittsburgh is under 15 minutes by car. Pantries were stock for breakfast and more with plenty of tastes. Decor is stylish like visiting a museum. Stay here.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs place is great! Small but smartly designed. Comfortable and close to tons of restaurants in South Side (go to Double Wide and the Zenith) and also super convenient to public transportation (take the bus to the ballpark). An extra bonus that our pup was allowed to come along (she loves the nearby dog park). Lovely weekend in PGH made all the better by staying in Carrie‚Äôs cozy home.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cool eclectic place. Right next to Carson street so lots to do. Yard was great for our dog.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot went above and beyond expectations! Beautifully curated inside and super unique! Plus with 2 dogs, the private garden was incredible. Would book again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was stunning. It was an absolute joy to stay at such a awesome location. We really felt comfortable and at home staying here. The design and layout were truly thought out. All the amenities were a great touch! Carrie gave us so many recommendations for places to go. Highly recommend reserving a table at Carmellas around the corner. We had lots of fun and would definitely stay again!
Thanks Carrie!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and great location. Carrie was very responsive and friendly.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely LOVED Carrie‚Äôs place! Such a great location near so many fun bars & restaurants. Place was super cute & we appreciated the little details & quirky decor throughout. Will definitely be coming back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cool spot for a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Very tidy with all the amenities we needed during our stay (and more). Parking spot made coming and going a breeze. Outdoor space + fire pit was perfect for an unseasonably mild February night. Would recommend to any couple and/or pet parent.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location with easy parking and a quirky modern vibe. Exceptionally well organized with everything you might want for a comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights at Carrie‚Äôs place in Southside. I‚Äôve never stayed in an Airbnb as well stocked as this one! The building is so cozy with tons of art and books to read. We also made use of the many games she has. It‚Äôs in a great location with tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is an off street parking spot that came in very handy. Just make sure to bring slippers because the loft stairs are a little rough on bare feet. We definitely recommend staying here and will consider staying here in the future, maybe when it‚Äôs warmer out so we can utilize the chiminea and private deck upstairs!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place was exactly matched to what I needed - great location, comfortable indoors and out, the perfect home base while in Pittsburgh. The decoration is light and airy, but also there are so many interesting books and the place itself is a work of art. I felt safe and private while close to everything in the southside."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie‚Äôs place was amazing and if I go back to Pittsburgh, it‚Äôll definitely be my first choice for a place to stay. The yard is big and very cute, the apartment itself is very spacious despite it being a loft, and it has everything you could need. The location is perfect for walking around and going to bars and restaurants, or for driving into the metro park and ride and going into downtown. Carrie was very communicative, checked in to make sure everything was good when I got there, had a list of info waiting for me, and continued to be responsive throughout my stay. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome weekend home for us and our pup:) Comfortable and cozy‚Äîparking spot is everything!!! Looking forward to coming back this summer to really enjoy the sanctuary outside :) Thank you!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most well stocked Airbnb I‚Äôve ever seen and I‚Äôve been to A LOT of Airbnbs. Cheese, eggs, bagels, chocolate, coffee, pasta, crackers, cookies‚Ä¶ really well stocked. If I wasn‚Äôt on a diet and absolutely starving myself, I would have had a bagel. This is a LARGE space with a small, cozy upstairs loft for sleeping. The bathroom and living area are quite large. Why do the reviews keep saying it‚Äôs a small place? It‚Äôs absolutely not. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was good. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the ‚Äòconverted gas station turned Airbnb‚Äô type as the place is a bit cold and industrial (despite Carrie‚Äôs many warm, decorative touches) so I wouldn‚Äôt come back but it still gets 5-stars for its uniqueness and the well stocked fridge and coffee. I would recommend it if you‚Äôre open to something different and unique. And why wouldn‚Äôt you be?? üòÄ"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This unique stay was a great find! The place was spotless and Carrie was very responsive. It‚Äôs walkable to tons of places in the south side and has its own parking. Best part is its dog friendly with an outdoor fenced in area which is very convenient for the city
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent the Christmas holiday in Pittsburgh at Carrie‚Äôs place with our two dogs. Carrie was a wonderful host, the place was clean, centrally located, and all we could have asked for!
There is dog park a couple blocks away that was a great surprise!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our first Air bnb experience was phenomenal! It‚Äôs located within walking distance of Carson Street and the Southside slopes-tons of things to do. Having a parking spot was great. But the coolest part of it all was the funky urban decor of Carrie‚Äôs converted gas station- there‚Äôs nothing else like it-so much cooler than the basic hotel. The little extra touches such as chocolate and cheeses offered to us was much appreciated. We felt good knowing Carrie was available if we had any questions. We‚Äôd love to visit again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was amazing. The space itself was very unique and very well designed. There were lots of interesting books, a few fun musical instruments, and a well stocked refrigerator to name a few great things about the space. There were so many local food options within walking distance. And if you wanted to venture out and explore more, the private parking space made parking an afterthought. Will not hesitate to book again when in Pittsburgh."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful time in Pittsburgh! This was my second time staying at this unique Airbnb. Love it!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Location was perfect. Fenced in yard for the dogs was great. Fire pit and a few key items in the fridge was a nice touch. Will def be booking again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was clean, easy to get in and out of, and the location can‚Äôt be beat! The creativity of the space was transportational."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really fun place with lots to do nearby. The parking spot made it easy to get in and out as needed.
Bring slippers or something for your feet as the metal stairs to get the loft bedroom can be difficult on bare feet.
Overall the place was fantastic and Carrie made the process super smooth."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eclectic, sweet little place in a great location. We had a great time using the fire pit outside. Thank you for sharing your little sanctuary."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My husband and I loved our stay here. The location was perfect and having a parking space in the middle of South Side was a game changer. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the space and all the artwork. We also appreciated the food and snacks available to us during our stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs place is next to anything you could need. You can walk there and enjoy the loft as well. It‚Äôs beautiful inside and out.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot in South Side Flats! The location and proximity to all the good food and drink in the area cannot be beat. Make sure to take advantage of the patio off the loft, and the fire pit of course! Another highlight- the fridge! It was well stocked with drinks and snacks. I have no shame in saying I ate a few Babybels as a 35 year old. Looking forward to visiting this property when I‚Äôm back in Pittsburgh for work soon!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't recommend Carrie's place highly enough! It's an absolutely stunning loft space with a cool sense of style that feels like a home away from home in Pittsburgh. We absolutely love the design and look of the home and were sad we had to leave. We wished we could have spent more time just at the loft to enjoy the space instead of exploring Pittsburgh. Carrie had a thoughtful selection of snacks in the fridge when we arrived, which really sets the accommodations apart from an area hotel. The parking spot was really nice to have as an amenity as well. The location is great as the loft is easily within walking distance of all the Downtown Pittsburgh has to offer via the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. If you're looking for a truly unique stay in Pittsburgh, Carrie's loft is fantastic and she's an excellent host! (We also highly recommend Dish Osteria, an Italian restaurant a few blocks away.)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the cation and uniqueness of the home. Located just a block off Carson, so plenty to do right in the area."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. A lot of nice walking distance restaurants and pubs. Loved the private parking spot. Loved all the artwork.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is so cool inside! Lots of interesting details make this a really unique place to stay. Not to mention the location is great to!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little oasis in the city!! Great location and parking. It truly felt like a home away from home. The fireplace outside and the hidden nook off of the bedroom were amazing!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a stay in Pittsburgh! Clean, well set up. Perfect location to check out Carson Street and easy to get into downtown area. Having the off street parking spot was fantastic! Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Make sure to bring your flip-flops! Getting upstairs to the loft for bedtime will be painful without them. That said, the industrial fire escape style ladder you have to climb to get into your cozy sleeping space is also one of the coolest things in the space. Just be careful of the spiky stairs. The modern, industrially inspired loft space in the south flats of Pittsburgh is definitely worth a visit. Both the inside and outside will surprise and inspire you. And despite the busy cityscape location the home was incredibly quiet."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The sweetest space settled in a great area of South Side; so many walkable activities in the vicinity! A nice, private yard is just one additional perk. The house is adorable and super cool."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here with our dogs while in Pittsburgh to attend a convention. Carrie‚Äôs place was perfect for us. We really appreciated the dedicated off-street parking space and the fenced yard for the dogs to stretch their legs - rare features when trying to find accommodations in the city! The space is very unique and quirky. The hidden garden that you can access from the loft is adorable. Well-stocked, including lots of snacks in the kitchen. The shower was great! The location is very convenient; easy walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants in the area, and an easy 45-minute walk into downtown as well; we walked to the convention center most days that we were here. Carrie was a friendly and helpful host. We would stay here again. "
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Terrific stay. Terrific time! Wonderful books and nostalgia and location! Thank you.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly special place in the heart of the South Side of Pgh. Unique conversion, excellent decor, an urban oasis yard space --- we loved it and our pups loved it as our home away from home.
Perks: Super accessible to everything, parking, a/c, yard space, and the host is super accessible!
This is absolutely going to be our go to place to stay anytime we're in Pittsburgh."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Carrie's home was an enriching and delightful place to stay for a couple days with my dog. I was on a road trip, and this was the perfect home for us. A great yard for my lab, and a comfortable, eclectic, well designed studio for me. Books and art everywhere, and lots of small touches left by someone who cares about being a good host. Easy to walk to a great coffee shop, a neighborhood bar, a drug store. It was just right."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"stay with carrie was great, love the place super cute and clean. perfect spot in the south side"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot! Came in to town last minute due to covid and was so happy to find this spot as we needed to bring our dog - loved all that Carrie puts into the place to make it feel like home. Look forward to coming back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great funky little place. We were visiting our daughter who lives in Pitt. We brought our 2 dogs with us and the space was great. It has a great yard with a high fence that allowed the dogs to run around a stretch out. The bathrooms has a great rain shower with great water pressure. The living space is small but just right with everything you could use. The loft area with the bed is a nice separate space. The only draw back was the bed is fairly hard/stiff. The location is great, only 1 street from the main drag. There are lots of great restaurants and bars around the block. There was a great cocky bar 2 blocks away and the British chip show at the e d of the block had a great breakfast we brought back to the house and ate out front. Would recommend ."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, interesting, arty, and well kept space. Carrie was very easy to communicate with and we would gladly stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the apt!! Very cool, modern, chic and bright! Carrie is the best host‚Ä¶very thoughtful and welcoming. Location was perfect. Tons of books to go through. Love to be able to drink coffee in the patio!! Recommend it 100%"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay. It was really nice having the outdoor space for the dogs. The home was very open. The parking was convenient with a driveway.
We came into town to visit the museums and this was a perfect place to stay. The home was filled with its own art, like a mini museum itself.
We enjoyed walking around the immediate neighborhood. La Petit Cafe for breakfast and The Vault Taproom for dinner were both great choices.
The next time we make the trip to Pittsburgh, we hope to stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the such a fun place to stay. We loved the courtyard that allowed us to be outside enjoying the sounds of the city. The firepit was an added bonus on cool nights. The home was appointed with towels, shampoo, soap and all kinds of snacks. It was so nice to have our own parking spot so when we came home there was no searching for street parking. Dog friendly home and even had a cut out in the fence for Fido to see out. The furnishings were eclectic and modern and gave a cool vibe to the house. Be ready for a fire escape staircase to the bedroom loft--and bring a good pair of slippers or socks to protect your feet from the grates. Overall, excellent experience for our Pittsburgh trip!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a cool spot! It‚Äôs in the best location and having a yard was so great since we brought our dog. Lots of interesting details. We loved it!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie's place was very clean and in a great location. The off-street parking was definitely a plus. It was perfect for us and our dog. Would definitely stay again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is great with 2 areas for outside: the yard and a cozy roof terrace. Walkable places for breakfast in the morning or drinks at night. (The pub chip shop would be my recommendation for loaded homemade hash brown style tots.)
I would suggest closing the curtains before bed for privacy!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun property with loads of charm. You really can't beat the location. It's within short walking distance from a lot of great restaurants and shops and now more than 15 minutes away from museums, other points of interest."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool spot in a great location of Pittsburgh. Fenced in yard to hang out in and relax, and do some reading - Carrie has a ton of great books to choose from, and quite the collection of awesome chairs.
Only downsides at all would be the mattress isn't the most comfortable in the world. For us, it led to not the best nights of sleep. To others though, it might be perfect. Beyond that, the stairs to go up to the loft are industrial grate ones, with raised metal for tread. Perfect style for the converted garage, but rough on feet. If you come prepared for that / bring slippers, then it's no big deal.
Overall, awesome stay in a unique Airbnb."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place. Clean, cozy, funky, well-stocked and in a phenomenal location if walking to anyplace in Southside is part of your agenda. Carrie is an excellent Host and was very accommodating with my schedule. It's just a minute walk to Carson St. and there's so much going on there. You're also far enough off the main thoroughfare that noise isn't a detriment. The lodging is close to the sidewalk so that if a group walks by talking loud you'll hear them for a few seconds but I was there on both Friday & Saturday night and it was fine for sleeping as I had some concerns before. Do note that the bed (which is a comfy mattress on the floor) is in the loft with a 6ft ceiling and you have to climb a metal staircase (kinda like a fire-escape) to get there. I didn't mind, it's part of the place's charm and efficiency, but be aware in case that isn't for you. No doubt I'd stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique space, complete with an outdoor area and parking space, which is so valued in this area of Pittsburgh. Carrie was welcoming and had so many unexpected touches in her home. We will definitely be back."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Parking was an insane bonus - you know the neighbors are all jealous. It was a bit chilly due to the low temps (especially the shower!), and do not PLAY with those stairs barefoot or in just socks.
This place is a gem. We worked remotely for a day and enjoyed the coffee and snacks. Lots to look at inside and out!
If you want to stay close, here are our local recs: Delanie's was our choice for walkable coffee, and we got donuts from Just Good Donuts inside the Pub Chip Shop. We opted for giant slices of pizza from Benny Fierro's."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cute little stay. Carrie seems to have thought out every little detail that would make staying there even easier!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful stay which I‚Äôm super thankful for. There‚Äôs so much to do in the area which was nice and there was plenty of items stocked in the air bnb. It was gorgeous and just such a pleasant stay. Thank you so much!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"100% enjoyed this stay. Funky, eclectic and well maintained and stocked. Carrie was great for anything we needed from start to finish. The location is awesome!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot within the heart of Pittsburgh's South Side. Private parking spot is clutch!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great & unique place.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was excellent to communicate with. I was unable to stay at her place as my senior horse got lame and passed over the days I booked the airbnb. Carrie graciously offered a refund, however I declined it. She also helped me find someone to take my Steelers tickets, too! Much appreciated."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is downright charming, cool and conveniently located, and Carrie has thought of so many extras for her guests! I can definitely see renting it in other seasons to enjoy opening the garage door to the patio. Such a cool feature. I stayed there in late December, and each day was either in the 30s or rainy in the 50s/60s.
My 15 years old dog loved the perfectly-sized enclosed yard and patio. I'd really like to come back when everything's in full bloom.
***Primanti Bros. being in such close walking distance is a delicious bonus about the location."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was awesome! She was easy to get in touch with and check in and out were super easy. We were in town for a Steelers game and it was the perfect location, only a 10 min drive on game day. The house was super cozy and clean and very close to places to eat. We were able to bring our dogs and there was an outdoor space for them to run around and hang out. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Carrie‚Äôs place!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very nice, loved staying here"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in a great location. Parking spot was a big plus. Loft sleeping might not be for everyone. I would stay here again.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location at south side. Close to Carson Street. Clean. Breakfast items stocked. Off street parking and fenced yard were great benefits.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool and perfectly spacious place to rent in the heart of the south side! Easy to walk to bars and restaurants and drive to other parts of the city. The indoors is impeccably decorated and clean and the outdoors was even bigger than I thought it would be - perfect for hanging out or if you have a pet. Driveway to park your car off the street was an added bonus. Carrie was very responsive as well. Thanks again for letting me share your home!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in the South Side! If you want to be near bars and restaurants but still have quiet nights, this is where you wanna be. The fridge and cabinets also had some nice snacks waiting on arrival. This was a great stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to start this review with the fact I visited mid November. This property is def best as a summer stay. (To utilize the garage door, the secret garden, and the wonderful outside set up)
The place is so cozy, I didn‚Äôt mind not having a day to open that garage door. It was a little cold, which I expected as it‚Äôs a brick and concrete building that wasn‚Äôt built to be crazy insulated. The secret loft garden was wonderful to stare out into, and see the bundles of Mourning Doves that came to the trees in the morning. There‚Äôs plenty to do just literal minutes away. The only thing I would have changed is to bring some house shoes to wear up and down the loft steps. They‚Äôre old warehouse steps, and they‚Äôre a little sharp. It certainly did not ruin my stay, though. I‚Äôd stay here again in a heartbeat."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, close to many good eats and bars; modern cute and cozy. Don‚Äôt go barefoot up to the loft, the stairs are painful! Loved our visit here- would definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Carries! The location is amazing and the house is perfect. Thank you so much for your hospitality!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was Perfect ! Location was great.. will be booking it again ! A +++
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot to stay for exploring Pittsburgh. Amazingly decorated/set up. The neighborhood was quite loud in the early AM hours over a weekend- not sure how it is other days of the week. Something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to outside noise.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time. Carrie was a wonderful host and it was such a unique stay in a great location!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a spectacular stay at Carrie‚Äôs place! If you‚Äôre visiting Pittsburgh you should definitely book this Airbnb.
Great location, privacy, and host!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great, food there was a life saver!! Great for going to football games as well 10 min Ride to stadium. Very nice host."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay! So close to all the good eateries on Carson, a tremendous riverfront trail, and fairly easy to get right downtown.....yet provides some privacy for being right in town. Fantastic yard. Carrie was a very gracious host with the house well stocked. Recommend The Colombian Spot and Over the Bar Bicycle Cafe for great food."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic. If you appreciate little design details and are looking for a place that is not typical (in a good way!) that‚Äôs also within walking distance of cool bars and restaurants, this is your spot. Carrie is a great host and very responsive‚Ä¶will even give suggestions of cool spots if you‚Äôre new to the area and need suggestions."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun and unique stay. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Perfect stay for having a dog. Backyard and walking trail nearby. Most importantly, super convenient for going to a baseball game. Lots of Uber‚Äôs available too!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really hip spot in Pittsburgh. My friend and I had a great time exploring the neighborhood and having an outdoor fire to drink a glass of wine next to! Wonderful loft!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome setting. The pictures do not do this place justice.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute spot in a fun part of town! Carrie was a great host. Would definitely go back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect! Perfect location to so many great place to see, and eat at. You cannot beat the space you have to move about. The outside you will not find again like this! Enjoy a fire, or a roof top seclusion after enjoying South side Pittsburgh. Carrie's hospitality was phenomenal!!! Bring your slippers to comfortably walk about the modern cement floors, and climb the ladder to the loft. Don't worry if you forget something Carrie probably has it there for you just in case.
We will definitely be staying here again‚ù§"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute loft in Pittsburgh, I really enjoyed it! Carrie was very nice and there if I needed anything"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was in a great location- just around the block from so many different restaurants, cafes, and bars. I loved the backyard for my dog, as it was a huge space to hang out and just relax after walking the busy streets. Carrie stocked everything we could need, and I was very grateful! Would recommend this place to anyone going to Pittsburgh, and will look it up if I ever visit again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs home is STUNNING. Having a yard to explore as well as a parking space in the city was incredible. Her home is just as lovely inside as out. What a truly unique and special place.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great and great restaurants are within walking distance.
The place is super cool with just about anything you would need or may have forgotten provided. Easy check in and you‚Äôll have your own parking space. Friendly neighbors and neighborhood."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is exactly what Airbnb is about! The location, thoughtfulness of the amenities, and of course the uniqueness gave me a weekend I couldn‚Äôt wait to tell others about. It is even cooler than it is in the photos if you can believe it! Carrie has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and it truly feels like home! Right off Carson street AND off street parking! Great books and so many cute drawings. You will love this spot and I am already browsing the calendar to see when I can come back :)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, great atmosphere and a perfect location for walking around the city. Plus the little outdoor rooftop patio is the perfect hangout spot to kill some time"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so special. There is a nice fenced in yard in the front. The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you would need. The sleeping loft is cozy and cute but the ladder needs shoes because it is sharp and spiked. Bathroom is large and the shower awesome!!
I would return if ever in the area again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carries place was perfect for our long weekend stay in Pittsburgh. The photos don‚Äôt do it justice! Our dog loved the fenced in yard. There were some cooking staples in the fridge like ketchup and butter - which was so helpful for traveling.
It is right around the corner from all the bars, restaurants, and coffee shops on Carson. Just down 18th street is the start of the river front park - great to run and bike on!
We would definitely recommend it and stay here again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is amazing as well as the property. Tons of fun bars and restaurants within a few minute walk. Very cheap to get anywhere via Uber. Fire pit makes you forget you are in the middle of the city.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great cozy place that is so artistic inside! only one block from east carson street where the resturants, shops and pubs are. and right next store to a great pub and famous sandwich place"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique and private space and garden in a bustling neighborhood that‚Äôs close to bars, restaurants, a dog park and a riverside walking path.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely one of the coolest BNBs I‚Äôve stayed in on my travels. Great art and location! The host was extremely accommodating!
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the heart of Southside- steps from tons of shopping and food‚Äî easy drive to anywhere else in pgh you want to get to. The house itself was a cool retrofit but some elements people should be aware of. House was pretty cluttered and there was little storage to be had. stairs to loft were a challenge and there was definite consistent bugs, spider webs, etc to contend with. In balance, location was fantastic and parking a real perk, but folks should understand the space has some minor issues."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Southside location is a great base for exploring all of Pittsburgh‚Äôs neighborhoods.
Our dog Dryfus loved the fenced in yard!
Off street parking space big plus!
Eclectic fun vibe to the space just like the neighborhood.
We plan to stay again for our next Pittsburgh weekend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little loft with such thoughtful touches. Our golden doodle loved the outdoor space as much as we did. Like other reviewers said the loft is a mattress on the ground but the space is wonderful overall. We couldn‚Äôt believe all the little extras from bagels/bfast items in the fridge to firewood for the outdoor fire pit. Would definitely stay again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here. The location was convenient and the driveway made parking easy!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place is charming, so convenient, and full of fun touches! Our dog loved a fenced yard to romp in, and the snacks/kitchen items available made even takeout much more enjoyable. We plan to stay there again the next time we are in Pittsburgh!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Nice yard and very clean. Would stay again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is a small but enjoyable place to stay. There's an off-street parking spot that helps a lot in the Southside, where parking can be hard to find. Also it's just a block from the main stretch of Southside, so there are tons of easily walkable shops and restaurants for pretty much anything you are craving. And it's a quick commute anywhere in the city as well.
The place is small and is not suggested for groups larger than 2 or 3. There's just a double mattress in the loft and a couch in the living area. But it was a nice cozy place to spend the weekend. Carrie was more than accommodating and even messaged us in the middle of our stay to make sure we didn't need anything."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Carrie's, and we were so happy to be back at her place! If you happen to be traveling with a dog, this is a super spot. Carrie was accommodating and understanding when our plans had to shift. Thank you, Carrie!"
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very central to almost anything you need.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: the outside area was awesome for our pup and was very private.
The bed was on the floor but was comfy but my boyfriend is 6‚Äù2 and his feet hung off the end of the bed.
Upstairs garden loft was cool, but there weren‚Äôt any gardens or plants.
Breakfast was provided: 3 eggs, cheese, milk, OJ, coffee, and creamer. The cheese was moldy and I didn‚Äôt realize until after I poured it all over my eggs.
All cooking essentials were provided.
Wood was provided for the fire pit.
Kitchen was new appliances.
Location was perfect and in walking distance to almost everything on the Southside.
Carrie was quick to respond.
Cons: There is decorations on every inch of the space that there wasn‚Äôt much space for us to put our own things down. It felt as if we were staying in someone else‚Äôs everyday home instead of a spot for guests to come and make it their own.
It was very hot sleeping in the loft but Carrie let us know about a fan in the basement which helped a lot.
Some bugs here and there but it is a converted gas station."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique and fun place to stay. We loved all of the home‚Äôs eclectic details and creativity. The location is awesome with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. We had great weather and enjoyed opening the garage door to live the indoor/outdoor life!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to chill and enjoy a sunny weekend! I‚Äôm a big art/architecture lover and it was an amazing experience.
Make sure to use the heating controller for heat and A&C controller for A&C. We were first a bit confused.
I suggest to bring sleepers because the ladder is metal and it gets cold.
Carrie, thank you for all the food and treats you left for us. We enjoyed breakfast at home."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay in Pittsburgh. Our dog loved the fenced in yard, and we loved opening the garage door on a beautiful day to enjoy the nice weather. Having a dedicated off street parking spot made coming and going super easy, and we always felt safe in the home. The sleeping situation was just okay but is well represented in photos. The mattress is a little soft because it sits right on the floor, but once you see the lofted space, you realize it would be difficult to put a real bed there! We didn‚Äôt have any problems while we were there, and Carrie was quick to respond when we asked about check-out instructions. There are many restaurants and stores within walking distance. The space is very unique, and we would stay there again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous, stylish place in the South Side. Incredible light and outdoor space. Thoughtful artistic touches."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just got back home and are missing our time spent in Carries place already! If the weather is good the huge garage door can be opened and makes the space feel huge and our pup was spoiled. Definitely looking to return in the future.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs place is great! It is a great location and she has thought of many personal touches to make sure you have a great stay!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place was perfect for us! Traveling with a dog can be challenging, but Carrie's fenced-in garden made life so much easier. Off-street parking was a mega bonus. Carrie was so easy to communicate with and is graciously hospitable. Because of the pandemic, we did not explore too much, but the neighborhood seems active with plenty to do. We'll be back!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a special place, so thoughtfully crafted and I felt immediately ‚Äòat home‚Äô. I loved being surrounded by art and literature! The design was unique and inspiring. I really enjoyed spending time in this space and will be reminiscing for quite some time!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Host, Great Stay. Highly Suggested. I will be back"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Carries place. Her place is very stylish and close to all the great restaurants and shopping on East Carson! As many others have said, Make sure to bring slippers as the floor is concrete and the stairs to the loft can be rough on your feet. We really appreciated the driveway, as street parking in pitt can be stressful!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"So nice to have a parking spot and a yard space in Pittsburgh! Though we didn't do much because of covid, Carrie's place is super close to restaurants, bars, etc. We loved being able to bring our pups, and Carrie was responsive and thoughtful."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,cool spot. having a yard and a parking spot in the city was amazing. super friendly host.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carries space immediately felt great - even better than the pictures looked! It's open, with loads of natural light, and so creative. I can't wait to stay at Carrie's place again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here and was even better than the first since we were already acclimated to the space. We had a wonderful time, a great spot for a getaway in a fun city"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location, certainly will stay again when I'm back in town!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying in PGH while everything was shut down was not the plan when scheduled our stay but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The breakfast provided was a great added bonus. Carrie was quick to respond to any issues that came up.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is amazing! The host is amazing! 1000% recommend!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience staying at Carrie‚Äôs place. Her unique design and personal touches make it an amazing piece of art. We brought slippers for the stairs (as others suggested). We loved having our own parking space and although we couldn‚Äôt use the patio and garden area because of the weather, it gives you an extra sense of privacy. We would recommend this to anyone staying in Pittsburgh."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique space with unique decorations. Check-in and check-out was very easy. Would recommend staying here!!!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time in a fun incredibly unique and functional space. The outdoor space was phenomenal both the patio and the upper level deck were very cute with small details throughout. As someone who used to work in construction management I felt very comfortable around all the architectural details and even perusing some of the magazines and books. Thank you for the experience!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and pretty
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs place was wonderful! It‚Äôs in a great location that‚Äôs not too far from downtown so you can make the most out of your stay. Love the artistic touch & the amenities were wonderful as well. Highly recommend it.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a great location in the heart of the south side. The house is fascinating and very well designed.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly unique space in a great location. Carrie left breakfast food (bagels, eggs, milk) in the fridge for those mornings you just don't feel like going out. That was a really nice touch! Only suggestion is to bring slippers as the stairs to the loft are rough on the feet. If you are looking for a cool space in walking distance to shops and restaurants, look no further. We fell in love with the restaurant Le Petite Cafe & Grill!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There's something magical about Carrie's place. We went to PGH for a couple's retreat to work on our writing and art projects, as well as to relax and get away from home. The space has excellent light, amazing style, and a great location. We were intrigued by all of the books, art, and objects on display. (Even though the space is small, it felt spacious even with all of the cool stuff around). Being surrounded by art and great style was definitely conducive to our creativity. On an unseasonably warm weekend in early November, we enjoyed the yard and loft garden. We had a fire in the outdoor fireplace every night (we brought our own wood) and even opened the big garage door for fresh breezes on a golden afternoon. The place is a block from Carson Street, which for us was a plus: hearing and seeing the city sounds and sights was invigorating. I rode my bike all over the neighborhood. Carrie very thoughtfully provides a fairly well stocked fridge and pantry in case you forgot something. Cooking in would definitely be possible, but it was also very easy to get take out from places on Carson. (Shout out to Benny Fiero's Pizza and Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House!) The place definitely has its quirks: bring slippers or you'll want to wear your shoes up the stairs to the loft, because the treads are pretty spiky. But the sleeping loft was cozy, and we slept very well. The two of us lived quite happily in the gas station for a long, four-day weekend. We would absolutely love to go back!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie‚Äôs place was perfect for our mini Yinzers honeymoon in Pittsburgh, with our pup, Pablo. The amenities were more than what we expected and we were very comfortable as well. The design is lovely, and the outside space was a great addition to be able to enjoy, especially with a pup. Location was perfect, and off street parking for this area was another plus! We may be back next time we are in town."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I don‚Äôt possess the vocabulary to say how great this place is. It is adorable beyond belief. The cupboards and frig are stocked available to share. Having a parking place and yard is so unique to her neighborhood. I want to live here and not go home.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient to everything on the fabulous Southside plus it was wonderful to have a parking spot. The yard is lovely and the house is sticker with everything you could need.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs eclectic pad is worth every penny if you‚Äôre planning to stay in Southside! It‚Äôs super close to great bars and restaurants and has an awesome fenced in yard which our pups absolutely loved.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie‚Äôs place was fabulous. Above and beyond cleanliness and amenities. It‚Äôs great area walking distance to an abundance of things or a short drive to Mt Washington area viewpoints. Felt safe parking my out of state car in the driveway and all the outdoor space was so fun to enjoy. Highly recommend
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, private yard....enjoyed a cool fall night with the firepit"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at Carrie‚Äôs place. The house is so unique and has tons of light. It‚Äôs a very cheery place to hang out. The yard is huge and has a chiminea. We enjoyed spending the evening around the fire. All the passerby‚Äôs commented on how awesome the house was!
The kitchen is stocked full of great food. It was great to not have to immediately run to the grocery store. It was a really nice amenity and adds a lot of value for the price of your stay.
There were a few negatives (but I still wholeheartedly recommend Carrie‚Äôs place. ) The first negative is the metal stairs to the loft. The treads are little metal spikes pointed up! Be sure to bring slippers! The second is that there is a fair amount of dust in some of the nooks and crannies. The overall appearance is clean but it could use a more thorough dusting. Bring your allergy meds if you have allergies.
The toilet doesn‚Äôt have a powerful flush. I‚Äôm a petite woman and have NEVER needed a plunger before. Well, I guess there is a first for everything. :)
The shower gets warm but not quite hot. It wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable but I would have preferred it a little warmer.
We tried to use the oven and it made a horrible noise and so we turned it off. Carrie responded right away and said it was safe to use but the cooling fan needed to be fixed and a maintenance person was coming the next week.
Two kind of funny things. There are four lamps that are just for decorations and don‚Äôt have an outlet to plug them in. And there are also a LOT of pillows! Something like five on the couch, seven on the bed, and four extras in the drawers. But no extra blanket for the bed. I guess you should just bury yourself in pillows if you get cold!
But, seriously, you have to stay here. It is awesome and fun and the location can‚Äôt be beat. The off-street parking spot is also a huge perk."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This hidden gem in south side is an absolute must stay. The space is absolutely amazing. You can spend literally an entire day looking at the artwork and admiring the design. The yard is perfect (especially during a pandemic). I was able to order food from the local restaurants and eat outside. The location is in close proximity to anything you could possibly need. I enjoyed staying there so much I decided to extend my trip by another day.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie has an awesome place in a great location. We felt immediately welcome and will stay again!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quirky space close to amenities on the South Side! Carrie was very easy to communicate with and responsive to questions as they came up.
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great spot. Extremely unique. Tons of amenities. I loved being able to do work in the the fenced front yard with my pooch. Would have enjoyed even more if the curtains covered the front door.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a really enjoyable stay at Carrie's place. Wonderful space and very unique. The location on the Southside and having a parking space is a huge plus. Love the open loft feel and it has everything you'd need. The outdoor space with fireplace is also a huge gem. Would definitely love to stay again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very unique property! Carries was prompt in addressing an issue that came up and handled it for me without any difficulty.
The location was great and right near a lot of food and attractions. Getting to the property off the main high way was fairy easy and didn‚Äôt have a lot of traffic.
The space itself offers a unique place to hang out before heading out and lay your head. I do wish the sleeping space was larger and was generally hotter than the rest of the house. The kitchen is great and she offered a lot of snacks and refreshments to help ourselves too. There seemed to be plenty of utensils available if cooking needs to be done during the stay, but I didn‚Äôt stay in for meals. Plenty of counter space.
The bathroom is spacious. The shower is just awesome. Washer and dryer was available.
Carrie was quick to communicate with me. She offered a direct contact number if I needed to use it, but she replied quickly on the Airbnb app when I sent her a message about an issue I was having. She showed me compassion and understanding and worked with me to resolve my experience.
Ultimately, a space that may not work for everybody, but it is a very different spin on real estate and living space that is awesome to see and experience."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was a great host, very responsive and offered great suggestions. Her home is very cute, clean and unique. The hidden garden was serene and relaxing. The large outside garden and driveway is a huge plus!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! We will be back
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was very responsive. Her space is unique with intriguing design. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and cooking in her kitchen. She helped us with finding a place to hike and kayak.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of a kind, special place in South Side. Who else has a private, secluded, backyard corner spot. Perfect for outdoor eating and drinking. 1 block off of Carson Street, with parking, you can't beat it!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay!
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stylish, unique property. It is a quirky place - the ladder stairs to the loft are not for everyone, the bathroom sink is very industrial. However the location, nice outdoor space, good ac and stylish atmosphere compensated. The parking space is a blessing in that neighborhood."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible stay! Well-kept space and conveniently close to all Pittsburgh has to offer!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were the first to stay at this location so there were a few kinks to work out but the host communicated clearly and we were able to lay our heads down for the night. It's a great location with lots of great restaurants and parks and rhe overally design of the house is modern and updated!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay. Quaint neighborhood and crisp, clean, aesthetically appealing accommodations. Other perks included a super easy to use sofa bed, easy street parking, and lots of natural light. Host provided clear and helpful instructions for everything. Wish I had more time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice, clean, quiet, and the host was helpful and responsive. We would highly recommend it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 4th time and the last time I stayed in Natallia's place. Since my daughter enrolled in CMU 4 years ago, Natallia's AirBnB is my second home when I visit Pittsburgh. My favorite apartment is C2, other apartments are also very good.
Natallia communicated with me promptly when I need something. Her place is always clean and quiet. I really like the linens and the mattress.
Thank you, Natallia!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natalia was clear, precise and kind. The apartment is comfortable, with the necessary elements, neat, the noise is transmitted when walking around the floor. Sofacama was not comfortable. The area is quiet, with easy access, public transportation and supermarkets nearby."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and functional
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, great lighting, great location and felt safe."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Natalia‚Äôs stay. The location is very convenient, walkable to shopping and restaurants, few minutes drive to upitt, cmu . Street Parking was easy to find. We left an AirPods at the place and Natallia proactively informed us , and gave us the contact of her maintenance person , who was very helpful and mailed it to us. Service beyond expectations!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My second time staying in this apartment - I love it! It felt like I was staying in an IKEA showroom. All the little details, everything modern and with clean lines, and ultimately very comfortable and livable. Perfect - if I could give it more than 5 stars I would!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was well-appointed and very clean. Very well stocked with toiletries, including toothbrushes. The kitchen seemed well-stocked, though we did not have opportunity to use all that. One area to improve might be providing a set of extra pillows and a top sheet for the bed. The duvet was a bit much, considering that the room was pretty warm ( the first night we used the ceiling fan).
Be advised that since the house is older, every creak and groan from upstairs units and adjacent stairways are audible, so bring earplugs if you‚Äôre a light sleeper.
The neighborhood was very quiet, though, with adequate nearby street parking. Up the street there is a good coffee shop‚Äîa two minute walk. The location is very convenient‚Äînear the Shadyside area that has many good shops and restaurants."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spotless, clean and very comfortable apartment in a safe and walkable neighborhood. Easy, free parking on the street, nice location when visiting Pittsburgh! Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The apartment is so well furnished, clean, and comfor. Had everything we could need, especially a well-equipped kitchen so we could cook a bit and not have to eat out every meal. Loved it and will be coming back to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a very comfortable stay & slept well. The kitchen has everything you need and it's in a great neighborhood - easy to find what you need within walking distance.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay. Cute, walkable neighborhood. The walls and floors are very, very thin‚Ä¶ So if other guests decide to engage in extracurricular activities, expect to feel immersed in the experience - as if you‚Äôre actually there!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for a week and it was perfect, had everything I needed to cook dinner, and the desk was great while I worked remotely. It was very quiet and peaceful, the area is a nice safe neighborhood. Great coffee place around the corner, and a short walk to Whole Foods. Natallia was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We‚Äôve stayed here twice now in 2 different units. Both were exactly as described and extremely clean! This location is perfect for us as we come to town to visit our daughter who lives close by. Hosts are very responsive! Will definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great short stay @ Natallia's. The apt was very clean, modern, and spacious for my daughter and me. It was very close to Whole Foods if you plan on doing your own cooking. The kitchen is well-equipped with everything you need. It was a short drive to the main street in Shadyside with all the restaurants + shops...maybe 6 minutes. It's a quiet, residential area which we liked."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, the suite was very clean and comfortable! The house is located on a quiet street and parking was fairly easy. You share a house with other guests (separate suits) but it wasn‚Äôt a disturbance; we only heard them in the shared hallway on occasion. Quiet hours were reasonable and there were no disturbances. :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Natallia‚Äôs place was great! It was comfortable and cozy!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Natallia was a responsive, proactive host and her property was as advertised. It was clean, tidy, and quiet. She resolved a light fixture issue we encountered upon check in within a few hours. Quiet neighborhood, and we found free street parking within the same block as the property. Would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly as described - Natallia's expectations and norms were very clear, that this is a place for travelers to rest while they're visiting Pittsburgh. It was spotlessly clean, on a quiet street. I loved how walkable the neighborhood was. The walls are quite thin and I could hear everything in the rooms next door and upstairs. But, to be honest, that didn't bother me - they weren't noisy too late, and it was mostly just normal noises of walking around and talking to each other, the walls are just thin. If that bothers you, just be aware!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice small apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Street parking was not hard to come by and seamless check-in process. Well equipped kitchen and very comfortable space overall. The heated floor in the Bathroom is a nice touch as well :)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a quick stop on our way to New Jersey. We were really only there for 8 or 9 hours, but everything went smoothly and was as described. Only drawback was we couldn't figure out the AC. Would stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice studio unit, it fit the needs of my stay. kitchen & bathroom were both nicely equipped with anything you might need. really appreciated the toothbrush/toothpaste set & the coffee maker. nice quiet area and cozy warm apartment!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great neighborhood! Easy to find and host is very responsive!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Natalia was delightful. She did everything possible to accommodate me. Her staff went above and beyond. I would gladly stay at one of her properties again. Everything from the washer/dryer to the electronic entry system was perfectly suited to a property that has several units.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Natallia is a great host! I have stayed in her Airbnb before‚Ä¶always a great place to stay!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space and perfect for a quick stay in Pittsburgh!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natallia‚Äôs place was very nice and felt like home for my boyfriend and I. She responded very quickly anytime of the day and even allowed me to check out check out at a later time so I can finish laundry. The place was very nice and modern. It was close to downtown which was very convenient as that‚Äôs where all restaurants, activities, and more are located. We loved our stay and would stay here again in the future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great amenities and very clean and comfortable. Parking was easy to find and free, which was a plus because we needed space for two vehicles. Natallia was a very responsive host. We would stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a travel nurse and this apartment was absolutely perfect i asked for the length of my contract, but it was all booked up. that shows you just how nice it is 10/10"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time visiting Pittsburgh so I didn't know what to expect. Natallia's rental was in a quiet neighborhood. It suited our needs perfectly. It was very clean. We were able to travel the entire area quickly. I would stay here again.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, checkin and checkout seamless, and I had everything I needed for the weekend."

The full kitchen gave us the flexibility to cook our own meals and Whole Foods was conveniently around the corner. The bed was so comfortable, and the shower was great!

The home itself is just as it‚Äôs described: clean, has everything you need, and while the rules might feel like a lot, it was actually really nice to have so much peace and quiet. Natallia is a very responsive host and seems to really care about creating a warm environment for all of her guests. I would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean small space within walking distance to a lot. Quiet neighborhood. AC works well. Well organized hosts.
Walls are very thin so you‚Äôll hear others moving about so you‚Äôll need to be quiet and considerate yourself.
Great as a home-base while doing other things in the city."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good communication; very nice place to stay. Just the right size for my daughter and I as we recovered from the Taylor Swift concert. üôÇ We felt safe in Natallia‚Äôs place, especially being out of town in a much larger city than either of us are used to. It was clean and comfortable, and I would absolutely stay there again."

And not only was the space amazing, the area was great too. Almost anything you needed was walkable: restaurants, Trader Joes, Whole Foods, liquor stores, CVS, etc. There was even an art glass making studio around the corner that you can sign up for a 1 hour project. Had a great time and plan on returning soon! Thanks"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a convenient location, quiet at night, clean and comfortable. The only small suggestion is that if you write that you shouldn‚Äôt drink the tap water, offering some safe drinking water would be nice - this has been the case in other airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed at. Overall a good stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natallia‚Äôs places never disappoint and is a staple stay when we are Pittsburgh. Super quiet, comfortable, and in a convenient neighborhood for us.

The apartment is nicely furnished, plenty of natural light, very clean, quiet, and has all the needed amenities. The desk is very nice to work from with view of the street with green trees. Parking is on the street, and I was always able to find parking near the front of the house. Natallia even had tea bags, oatmeal and ramen noodle packets in the main area of the house. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a nice weekend getaway. It was exactly as described, and her clear instructions made check-in incredibly easy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natalia's place is great! The rooms are bigger than the pictures make it seem. Clean and quiet, with everything you want in an AirBnB. Checking in and out was easy, the area is quiet and beautiful. We left at the same time as another person staying in another apartment, and she said, ""Wasn't this place cool?"" We would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a great place. It‚Äôs small but it has everything you need. I will be back.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much for hosting us this past weekend!
The apartment was extremely clean and the vibe was great. The heated floors in the bathroom was one of my favorite things! It was so nice to have a full kitchen while staying away from home.
The neighborhood was peaceful and inviting. Very close to everything without feeling right in the city.
Free street parking was also wonderful. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs the second time I stayed in this listing. Nice place!

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean & updated studio, looked just like the pictures & thats why I chose it. Very quiet & nice neighborhood. Loved the location. Great free parking right in front. Only things we had an issue with was controlling the temperature in the room, I pushed all the buttons on the remote but could never figure it out. & the wifi seemed to go in and out a lot for some reason. Other than that it was a very nice stay & time in Pittsburgh! Would definitely come back. Thank you for having us Ms. Natallia."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pristine little apartment with great access to all of Pittsburgh. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This apartment is exactly what you would expect from the photos. It‚Äôs small but it has everything you need. I think it‚Äôs better for 1 person to stay there, it was a little small for two people for one month although it might be better for 2 people staying a shorter time. I was pleased to find that Natallia constantly supplied tissues, coffee, hand soap, etc.
the place was very quiet in an excellent location that‚Äôs a short walk to restaurants and supermarkets and a short drive to anywhere else I was interested in visiting in Pittsburgh.
Natallia was also excellent at responding quickly. My roommate forgot some items after we checked out and the host was kind enough to stay in touch so we can get the items back. The only problem with this apartment would be the extremely thin walls. Luckily it was never noisy but you can definitely hear neighbors if they‚Äôre loud or going up and down the stairs (not really the host‚Äôs fault)."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was great
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Nice space. There was filtered water in the house which was very kind. Recommended.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was really nice and was available to me last minute which I am very grateful for. The bed is really comfortable and the room gets really dark which is really helpful if you have light sensitivity. The building was very quiet, so I could rest easily. I tried to book longer, but it was booked up. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I return to this location due to reliability, ease of access to the City and surrounding neighborhoods, parking availability, cleanliness, quiet, all good things. Recommended."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. I‚Äôm so glad we chose to go with this air bnb. She is so sweet. So was the cleaning lady. We appreciate the great place to stay as well as the area, the area was quiet. I love this place. If I come to Pittsburgh again i will book with her again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed staying for in this clean, newly renovated apartment. Natalia and Richard were very friendly hosts and alway responsive to our questions. Whenever we reported minor issues, they always made sure it was fixed quickly. It surely was a great apartment to spend our first four weeks in the new city."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location. Clean and bright. Very easy to get into and out of, and had all of the little things I needed to make it a great stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great time at Natallias home. The location is great (perfect combo of quiet residential block but literally a block away from great cafes and stores). The studio size was perfect for me and my husband to work remotely, cook, relax and vacation. I definitely would stay at Natallia‚Äôs again. Also Natallia‚Äôs communication was great and she was available via text and Airbnb to answer questions I had - we had a minor issue that we needed to sort out and Natallia‚Äôs was on top of it immediately!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location, walkable to lots of spots! It was a nice home base for a couple of weeks."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Natallia's while visiting our son who is a student at PITT. What a great location! You can walk to everything... the market to grab a few groceries, cute coffee shops for breakfast, and lots of restaurants/bars for a meal or cocktails. The neighborhood is charming with big beautiful houses full of character and architectural detail. Natallia's unit had everything we needed for a weekend. It is updated with modern finishes and the inside of our unit was nice and clean. There was a little clutter in the hallways, but nothing that interfered with movement through the building. The rules might seem strict with asking guests to remove their shoes while on the stairs and in the apartment, but it is needed. We could hear everything in the unit above ours, so if you are a light sleeper, this might not be the place for you. We needed to contact Natallia during our stay due to a concern with an employee, and her response was immediate. She immediately addressed the problem and apologized for the inconvenience."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great studio that is super modern and sleek. Love the heated floors in the bathroom! If u r noise sensitive I do suggest ear plugs in case u have noisier upstairs neighbor staying (my first night required this as they were stomping and rolling around the chair past midnight and I didn‚Äôt want to text the host and wake her).

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is my second stay in Natallia's apartment. I stayed in for three weeks to stay close to my CMU daughter. I have already considered it as my second home for the following reasons:
1) The apartment is very comfortable, the facilities are really good.

Natallia was responsive and a good communicator. The apartment 2C was bright, stylish, well built and clean. Everything worked well, including AC, fans, etc. I had both car and bicycle and it is an easy location to use a base for cycling. Easy parking on the street. I would stay here again."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice space in a convenient neighborhood. Small things were a little disappointing- no toiletries, very poor quality tp, very flat/older pillows, and the shower was very tight. The location was great for getting around and into Pitt, and the dude itself was lovely."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natalia‚Äôs location is an easy ‚Äúmust recommend‚Äù the unit is beautiful, peaceful and overall close to literally (5-15mins) everything! Her instructions are easy to understand ! Thank you for letting stay at your place !"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natallia's place is a lovely old home that has been renovated and split into different units. It is clean and has everything you need.
My partner and I were to stay at Natallia's for the weekend, but unfortunately had to find new accommodations due to some other rule-breaking guests. Natallia was understanding and communicative, and handled our situation with compassion and aplomb. These things can happen anywhere. If you're in town and need a clean, convenient place to stay, don't hesitate to book here."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Natalia‚Äôs spot was in a great location with plenty of places to eat and drink not too far as well as an easy drive to any area of Pittsburgh you might desire. She was great at communicating. We would certainly come back again.

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall our experience was really positive with this Airbnb. Very clean, was perfectly sized for our trip, location was absolutely convenient for our needs. Neighborhood felt very safe. We were a little turned off by the severity of the rules at first, as these units cater towards business travel and we were coming for leisure. It wasn‚Äôt the most welcoming feeling. And while there is a strong suggestion against drinking the tap water, I was surprised that there was no accommodation for providing drinkable water in the unit with a filter pitcher or something similar. Still a great stay for the price and would definitely stay here again."

As we were here in winter, the room gets quite warm and you can regulate the temperature with ceiling fans and controling the amount of heat.
We liked the contemporary design aesthetic. The bed is very comfortable and the closet is roomy. The showerstall is small, but managable with plenty of hot water. Natalia was a good host, and very quick to respond.
We would definitely stay here again!"

It‚Äôs a noisy building (it‚Äôs old, no fault of the host)- no matter how lightly you tread. I appreciate the quiet hours however, might not be the best place if you want to sleep in! Small shower - my hubby is a larger guy so it was a tight squeeze for him."

We highly recommend! Thanks Natallia!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second visit! I appreciate the location, ease of check-in and out, and that the listing matches what's there. (No surprises!) It's been a great home base for me both times.
This isn't a soundproof bunker so you will be able to hear people going up and down the stairs and I could hear normal level conversation and enthusiasm about sports on TV.
The shower is cozy. Not an issue for me but be aware.
This will be the first place we check for availability for any future trips to Pittsburgh."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great space and location!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed staying in this modern renovated apartment and would stay here again!

The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to prepare meals if you want. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, I know my way around and I love this neighborhood so, so much. Highly recommend walking everywhere-so much character and so much to see! I was a solo traveler and this Airbnb was PERFECT. Thank you for a lovely stay, Natallia!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Natallia was a great host. When our flight got canceled she helped my husband and I extend our stay so we could work remotely while waiting for our flight.

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"great place!! There was coffee, snacks for breakfast and water provided. everything was clean and exactly as pictured, street parking was easy, everything was clean and well organized and the neighborhood was nice! 4 stars instead of 5 only because we intended on using the pull out bed and didn‚Äôt realize until we were going to bed at about 12am that there was no bedding for the pull out. other than that, great stay, will definitely be back to pgh!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome to stay in. It was so close to everything and we were able to walk around the neighborhood around and get awesome food.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Natallia‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect! My friend and I were visiting Pittsburgh for a long weekend and we couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place to stay. It‚Äôs in such a cute and safe neighborhood with easy access to downtown. I will definitely be coming back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 would recommend! The apartment was clean and updated! Lots of natural light and super soft bedding! Nice neighborhood with easy access anywhere in Pittsburgh!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quaint studio. Perfect location if you don‚Äôt want to be right downtown but still close enough to get there quickly. Quiet street, parking was never an issue. Great communication with host and comfortable bed."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Natallia‚Äôs place was a lovely, safe, quiet space for my friend and I for a long weekend!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We had a okay stay here- definitely needs some updates. Bed was comfortable but everything was very outdated.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I were in town for the weekend to catch the Braves vs Pirates baseball game. The location of the hotel is perfect! It's an easy walk to the Pirates and the Steelers stadiums. We didn't need a car the entire weekend - in fact, if you're traveling here to see the city, you really don't need one. We walked to all the restaurants and rented ebikes to explore more of the city. This is a perfect location to explore the city."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was 10/10, which is why we picked it. Nothing major to note, the hotel is just a bit older. Beds were comfy, room was a little musty and the elevators were pretty slow/inefficient. But overall, would recommend for a trip to Pittsburgh!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, this was a great place to stay! The hotel is in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. We came to watch a game at PNC Park and the walk to the park was quick and easy! Everyone was very kind from check in, valet, and bellhops.
The pool area is nice and there is a beautiful park right across the street.
Our only complaint - Upon arrival, the hotel had no record of our reservation through Airbnb and thankfully they honored my confirmation through Airbnb and were able to find a room for us. Call the hotel after you book to make sure they have your reservation!
I would absolutely stay here again and felt that this was a very good deal for everything the hotel offers!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Room and location were great. I guess we got a handicapped accessible room, and the shower is not mounted, but hand held, and the tile is flush to the rest of the bathroom. With every shower we took, the bathroom basically flooded. Other than that, everything was great."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location to explore downtown Pittsburgh and the North Shore. Easy walkable distances to PNC Park and Acrisure Stadium, 15 minutes to either. Our room was very clean and comfortable with great housekeeping services. Would recommend!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I made a mistake with my booking. I was off by a day. I had booked two nights May 19-21. I meant to book May 18-20. I didn't catch my mistake until I was checking in. This is my fault I have to own it, but I was looking for some assistance to help. The two front desks clerks were like "" not are problem call Airbnb ."" It wasn't until I asked to speak with the front desk manager did I get any help. I wish I had her name she deserves a special shout out. She couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful. Had the situation immediately resolved and I was checked in within minutes."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a nice place to stay! The hotel is so clean and well updated, got an early check in, and the view from our room was beautiful! Gorgeous bridges and rivers right outside my window! Valet parking wasn‚Äôt too expensive and was so quick and convenient! Pittsburgh has so much construction going on so driving can be full of anxiety but the valet parking really helped, and the clean room helped ease my worry when driving all day! Wonderful place to stay and VERY nice and responsive host!!! Answers all your questions promptly and comes across with genuine care. Highly recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Went to see a concert at the PPG Arena and stayed here and was pleasantly surprised how convenient things were. A lot of great walkable restaurants to check out and the arena was about a 15-20 min walk.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an excellent stay at Wyndham! The room was super clean and comfortable with an excellent view of the city. The fitness center had multiple machines and free weights to choose from. The city was a short walk away, and had tons of great restaurant options. I had one small issue with billing, but the staff was super helpful and helped resolve it right away. I'd definitely stay here again when I return to Pittsburgh."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great last minute deal!! The best views in the city. It was clean and practical. A restaurant and cafe are available in the hotel. Valet was fast and friendly. One of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve booked.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Neat spot right next to the 3 rivers. The room is very small. The window only covers half the wall

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was exactly what you would be looking for in a hotel room. I am happy with my experience.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Room was to be riverview and was not. Bed was made with flat sheet that was too small to be tucked around mattress and didn‚Äôt stay put. Drapes were tattered and oversized for window. Blinds def would be a better choice. Every wallpaper seam was starting to roll off. Room was very small.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, loved that there was so much to do within walking distance! hotel was updated and clean."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"easy check in.
valet was not available due to a gala being held- be sure to ask what‚Äôs going on when you arrive to make sure you are aware of what that can do to your experience. we ended up paying $60+ dollars in parking because their service wasn‚Äôt available."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time I stayed here, and I will do it again. Location was perfect walking distance to north shore and downtown with plenty to do.

I will definitely be staying there again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best stay at the Wyndham thus far. Walk in shower was nicer than most showers that I‚Äôve had in previous stays here. Was a bit worried about checking in through air bnb at a hotel, but had no issues during the process at all. Great rate for Pittsburgh Marathon weekend as well, a lot cheaper than previous years. Hopeful to stay again next year!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and stay!
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,For a hotel I was surprised they did not have vending machines. I was looking for something to drink and a snack around 10 PM and there was nothing available. Other than that everything was great and as expected and advertised.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed one night but it was a good experience! They let us check in at like 1:30pm and that was really helpful. The room was pretty small and the parking was honestly a mess and very inconvenient but that‚Äôs the only complaint I have. $43 per night for parking and it can take 10+ mins for valet to get your car in the busy and crowded valet pickup. But everyone was very friendly!!! Room was clean and it was a nice scenic location (:
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place for the night.
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,Unexpected valet parking fee and then had to wait an hour. I'll get my

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. You can walk to many restaurants.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here very much! We could walk everywhere downtown and even across the river to the National Aviary. The staff were helpful adding an extra night for us with no hassle.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The children were out of control in the pool, made it incredibly unenjoyable. the hotel staff should have told the parents to watch ghwir children more."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Only problem I had was the vent in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work. Other than that it was great
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay! This was a last minute booking for us and it was the perfect location and the perfect size for us. Just what we needed and the price was perfect! Thank you so much for having us. The next time we‚Äôre in Pittsburgh we definitely know where we‚Äôre going to stay!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Checking in was a huge hassle. There was valet parking only at the hotel (even though self-park was advertised). Self-park is only available at a garage about 1/2 block away. All luggage had to be unloaded in the valet area, & there were very few luggage carts, leading toa long wait. The elevators are key-card operated on the INSIDE and I got stuck inside one because my key card was not working‚Äîother people were able to select their floorsut I had to wait until someone else got on and used their card to go to the lobby. There also seemed to be some sort of middle/high school girl's basketball tournament going on with many teams being hosted at the hotel, leading to lots of mostly unsupervised teenage girls jogging elevators, running through the halls, and making lots of noise. Four stars because I was able to at least get breakfast comped after my hassles & the room itself was clean with a nice view."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and views
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great and I never say that about any place. It made me realize that I want a king size bed.Restaurants and mini store in lobby all on first floor. The place in my opinion was great all I can say.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Room had a great view, could see the Pirates stadium while games were happening. Super great valet and wonderful service."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was amazing, but the building needs work done as the hole on the grand plaza floor (24th floor) ceiling was exposing insulation, and the cracks in the rooms crown molding. The Toiletries were nice but not accommodated for each night of the stay and I received a text to check out only after one night of my stay which was paid and booked for two nights.
The elevators are so heavily used I felt like I was on a county fair ride, and contemplated getting right with God each trip up, and each trip down. I did get stuck on the 7th floor between 7th and 8th and the elevator finally started moving after a quick five minute facetime call to my partner to say my goodbyes that I may starve and never see her again.
The saving grace for this review was the level of acumen and communication with the staff at the Wyndham Grand. They understood quickly what the issues were and to fix these it only took a few minutes out of my time.
The location and view was beautiful and all in all, 4.5/5!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was amazing!! We loved the room it was very clean and we had a little view of the river which was pretty. The pool and hot tub were so nice and there is a great fitness center! The check in was very smooth and parking was not a problem for us at all! We were able to walk right to the water/the point which was a great plus!! I will definitely be back!

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very large room and very comfortable bed. This is an upscale hotel, so there is valet parking and bell service so be prepared to tip accordingly (although it was worth it and the staff, especially the valets were exceptional). Lovely views from the room (You can see some of the river and the scoreboard at PNC park). Pretty quiet. Very relaxing. Enjoyed a drink at the hotel bar and was not disappointed (made nice and strong for the price). The room was a little bit outdated and the pictures of the bathroom are not accurate (it is not a handicap accessible bathroom). The bathroom itself was OK but the shower was a little underwhelming and very tiny. Enjoyed the walking distance to restaurants/brewery. Overall loved our stay and would go back. The host was also very responsive and helpful!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room does not look like the photos but there is still a pretty view of the city and all of the listed amenities. It's just a little more rugged/outdated than the photos. I would definitely stay here again though, I had no problems."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came to Pittsburgh to attend a Pirates game so this was a very convenient location (just walked across the Clemente Bridge to get to PNC Park). The room was clean and the bed comfortable, but since we were really only here to sleep that's all of the feedback I have. Would stay again though!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent! everything is walking distance, our romm had a beautiful view, and the bed was so comfortable. Lillie at Front desk was kind and helpful."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay! booked on April 4 to see Andrea Bocelli's concert in the PPG arena. it's an accesible place with pool and gym. The Valet parking people did an awesome job and I felt pretty safe.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location.
Friendly staff"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The staff makes this an incredible stay. They are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay special. Unfortunately the room is very worn and tiny. There is no on-site breakfast service other than a Starbucks.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was great
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great downtown location.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Parking expensive but valet convenient. The hotel was ok but needs renovations but the black lady at the front desk was exceptional and so was the af/am waiter! They were exceptionally friendly!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hotel is a little outdated, but that alone is not a reason for a bad review. The walls are paper thing and we could hear the occupants next door getting off in greater detail than I cared to. There were hairs from previous guests, I assume all over the place which leads me to believe that the room wasn‚Äôt vacuumed prior to our arrival. The bed was missing a sheet, and I get that some Airbnb‚Äôs don‚Äôt include this, but this is a hotel, and there was no notice that we were expected to provide our own. Otherwise, it was a safe place to stay, it was mostly clean, well located, and easy to check in and out."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. My boyfriend and I drove down for the weekend and it was a very nice experience. Will definitely be back when it‚Äôs warmer with my family.
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this stay to attend the NCAA tournament games and liked its closeness to the arena. Other than that, that‚Äôs about the only thing I liked. It definitely was not worth paying $173 for one night. The walls were paper thin and I could hear the loud tenants next door. My room had the smell of marijuana smoke either from a previous occupant or the rooms next door. Overall, this is what I‚Äôd expect from a hotel that‚Äôs $50 per night. Not worth it."

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,My only complaint is the elevators. Several were not functioning properly.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was quick and easy, room was actually nicer than advertised. The listing did not include all of the amenities included in the room so it seemed like a nice bonus. Staff was super friendly, and location was close to everything."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Room was darker and smaller than pictured.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location in the heart of all the action. Beautiful city views.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,All the valet people were very nice and courteous as well as the rest of the staff. The beds were comfortable and the location was nice. It made it very easy to get to wherever you would like in the city.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was perfect for my friend and I. It was walking distance from the drake concert & there is a parking garage right by.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The valet parking said it was $38/night but it was actually $43/night
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Nice but a little pricey considering the room you get.
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"When checking In it was fast and smooth I think a little to fast Nothing was explained to me where the Pool and Fitness center was I had to look for it myself until I just gave up ‚Ä¶. Now Off of checkout I finally seen the room it was half of what was pictured it had one small window and it showed a building and a roof below (The room also had no hot water after this I got discouraged and packed up and went to check out they changed my Room And finally asked what the reasoning on why I was checking out I told them ‚Ä¶ then it was explained to me where everything was And Then they offered to change The room To the Actual one in the Picture and not a closet
Room 1129 ( was not the room in the picture That‚Äôs what I was given

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,no thank you
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, everything we needed was available. Room was on the 20th floor with a skyscraper view and a corner view of PNC Park. Would definitely recommend, but it‚Äôs a bit dated. Not that big of a deal for us, as it was clean and comfortable"

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Hotel very dated. No room service. Bar/restaurant area was ok but my beer was spoiled. Maybe the tap /keg was bad.

Everything went well as expected."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Walkable places to eat and in summer would be a great location for activities. Our room was a little dirty. There was a pastry wrapper and pieces of the pastry on the window and floor behind curtain. Stains on curtains and ceiling.
Otherwise great stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My second visit to this location. Good location to visit the city‚Äôs sports venues. Close convenient parking is available across the street. A good value compared to many other downtown hotels.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was pleasantly surprised that a hotel listed rooms on this platform. I felt that this was a great value for our stay. We took in three hockey games and participated in First Night (New Years) activities. Great access to all of the sports venues and casino.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful view and convenient to restaurants and sporting event!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I enjoyed a wonderful stay here on New Year's Eve with a gorgeous view of The Point and Pittsburgh's rivers. Very happy with my stay!

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay. Only problem I‚Äôve had is they keep charging my debit card random big charges saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get it back in 5-7 days‚Äù kind of bullsh*t. Could really screw someone.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was small but it was all we really needed. The shampoo and conditioner weren't the greatest (bring your own) and there was no body wash or soap in the shower.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a great location!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very good service to the clientele and friendly staff!
The perfect place to stay in Pittsburg, great location
I go back in hesitating!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is within walking distance to just about all the restaurants and shops in downtown, we were able to take the T to the steelers game and back! I only did valet for 1 night because it was expensive even though they did provide with in/out privileges. I found a nearby garage within walking distance for half the price and parked my vehicle for half the price, which also provided in/out privileges. I was on the 12th floor and it was fairly quiet for being there during the holidays, the room was clean but as many other reviews have mentioned a fitted sheet would make a better sleeping experience since the flat sheet that is used does come off at times."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent, I just didn't like the parking, I was wearing moored things on the SUV roof and they charge you for parking the car in the street for you, I thought it was very bad taste, otherwise everything was fine"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very smooth. Room was great.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great!!! The hotel was clean as well as our room! Despite being very busy due to an NFL game and Christmas weekend, the hotel staff were all kind and worked hard to get us checked in quickly.
When we got to our room our TV wasn‚Äôt working so I called down to the front desk for help. They sent an engineer to our room within minutes of my phone call and after 5 minutes our TV was working! The engineer was so kind and helpful!
Overall, the hotel & its location was great! Quick walk to street and garage parking, to many different restaurants, and a few minutes walk to the bridge to cross over to the North Shore!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and perfectly located in Pittsburg. Maybe a 2 min walk to the T
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the hotel was decent. The room was extremely small and not advertised in photos. The bathroom was dirty upon arrival and the walls are paper thin. We were woken many times due to neighbors having too much fun. The bathroom was also very small and made it hard for two people to be in there at once to get ready."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place great location to Steelers
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Room was tight but everything was clean and no complaints! Staff there was great.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful view from our room. Plenty to do all within walking distamce. Amazing restaurants all around. The room was very comfortable and clean.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The overall stay was okay. We didn‚Äôt like that we were made to feel as though valet parking was the only option. An added expense. There was mold or stains in the grout if the bathroom. The bathroom door was difficult and noisy to close. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom for smells and steam.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location downtown. Very walkable to many everything.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was close to so much.. could have been cleaner.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy bed, close to Heinz Hall, communicative host‚Ä¶it was a great (though short) stay over all! Would recommend to anyone."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wyndham Grand was such a nice change from the usual Airbnb situation we choose when visiting Pittsburgh. We go 2-3 times per year to visit our daughter at Point Park University and staying in a proper hotel was such a nice experience. The staff was friendly, the place was quiet, there was food, wine and coffee easily accessible in the hotel as well as a nice gym. Those are all things I really like having close by. The location was excellent, making all downtown experiences easy. This LA family loves Pittsburgh. My only complaint is the thing a lot of hotels do now and that‚Äôs cheap bedding. I hate that fitted sheets aren‚Äôt used. That‚Äôs such a 1st world complaint, but seriously, nice bedding makes a huge difference. Housekeeping was super friendly and attentive so I am not going to complain too hard, but come on - fitted sheets please! üòÅ"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Hotel was not what review said it was that it would be city views but was on 5th floor with a roof top view of other building. Also could hear the shower and toilet running in the room beside us. Also had to wait 35 mins to valet my car.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such an awesome stay for the Steelers game! Everything was walkable and a great area downtown even in December!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Within walking distance of most places and events in the Downtown Pittsburgh area. Parking Garages available within 5‚Äî10 minute walks of $8 Uber drives. Valet Parking available for $20. Most convenient place I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Very nice hotel. Accommodating and friendly staff. Enjoyed the coffee shop in the lobby.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just came back from our stay at the Pittsburgh Downtown Wyndham Grand . It was an amazing trip. The location. Of the hotel is fantastic and the views our superb. We ate in the restaurant two breakfasts and two dinners and was pleasantly surprised . The rooms are older but still clean and functional. The service was great . Overall it was a great success and if we ever come back to Pittsburgh we will stay there again !!

,,,"Planned to stay due to reconstruction surgery and my surgeon had to push my surgery back due to another patient. It was last minute but surgeon was able to get me in 4 days later. Unfortunately it was at another hospital and staying with Kasa would no longer work. As soon as I was aware of the situation I contacted Kasa and every time I spoke with them they said that they‚Äôd defer to what AirBnBs policy and what they decided. AirBnB was willing to fully refund me even though they‚Äôre policy normally wouldn‚Äôt but needed to speak with Kasa. Kasa refused to give me a full refund. With all of my medical bills, due to my breast cancer, this was money I truly could not afford to lose. I understand policy, however, I also feel that companies need to reevaluate their practices when presented with extenuating circumstances. Especially when it involves someone‚Äôs health."
,,,"During our two night stay there was an extremely loud ‚Äúevent‚Äù in the lobby until 2am and that the bass and music could be heard and felt all the way to the top floor (5th floor). We started out on the 3rd floor and our bodies were vibrating from the bass in the lobby. We waited two hours to be moved to the 5th floor after midnight. Then we were told there was no ‚Äúevent‚Äù the following night. The next night there was a wedding downstairs. The walls are very thin or not insulated for event purposes. Also, all communication is done via texting with a ‚Äúvirtual front desk‚Äù and it was not quick or efficient."
,,,"SAFETY AND HARASSMENT! At check-in, my four digit key code did not work on the outside door I was supposed to use. I tried to use my code on the second outside door that was for the first floor, which I wasn't staying on, and it did not work. I tried the first door again - no luck. Second door again - it worked, though, again, not the correct floor. I went in, thinking there might be a mistake with the reservation and worried about not being able to get in period. My code opened one of the doors on the first floor, but it clearly was not ""my"" room, as there was other people's stuff in the room! Tried the first outside door again. Code worked. Went to third floor. After trying two to three times, my code opened the door to a room that was, I came to realize, also not the room I reserved. I did not realize it immediately, however, because (1) the room was empty, and (2), since my code worked, it seemed logical that this was my room. When leaving to go to dinner for which we had a timed reservation, I looked again at my check-in information and that is when I realized I was, alas, in the wrong room. Went to, at long last, the correct room where I found that my code also opened that door as well (after a few tries). I messaged Natalia about this on the way to dinner. She was concerned - not because my code opened so many doors - but because there was to be another party checking into the room my (and the two others in my party) stuff was in. I asked her if she or her cleaning lady or another could move the items. She said no because her cleaning lady lives 20 minutes away and she was 'over seas'. I offered to just stay in the room we were in, and allow the other party to take our room (which was quite an upgrade for them). Myself and my two friends (all three of us house wives pushing 50 on a girl's trip weekend) got back to ""our"" room sometime around 11 p.m. By 12:30 a.m. we were asleep. Beginning at 7 a.m. the next morning, and lasting until close to 8 a.m., I received 7 phone calls and 5 texts from Natalia, and I'm not sure how many messages through AirBnb from Richard (whom I assume is Natalia's husband), informing me that there were ""multiple"" complaints logged through the night about our being loud. I was told we had to ""get out now!"" various times or ""security"" would be sent to ""remove us"". First and foremost, this was disrespectful, at best, and more along the lines of harassment and bullying. If there were multiple complaints filed about our party between roughly 11 p.m. and midnight, why did we not hear about it until after 7 a.m. the next morning? And, if our laughing (there was no music playing, no tv on, no alcohol was consumed throughout our entire weekend) was so disturbing as to cause the need to file ""multiple"" complaints, than the walls must be paper thin. In fact, I feel obligated to add for others who may be considering this place that the doors that lead into each rented space are significantly thinner than the closet doors in my home. To make a long story longer, I would say there are three lessons to learn here. One, I should read my check-in directions more closely the next time I stay at an AirBnb (though it won't be this one) to be sure I'm going to the right room the first time. And, two, this particular place is INCREDIBLY unsafe. I was able to open FIVE doors with my ""personal"" code. I should have only been able to open two. Presumably, I could have opened every door - there is no good reason to think otherwise. And, finally, three - Natalia is unbelievably disrespectful, to the point of blatant harassment. The ONLY good thing I can say about this place is that it was clean, though I did kill an ant. Buyer beware."
