2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another wonderful stay at this cozy lake house. Very relaxing and comfortable. They had Christmas lights and decorations inside and out and that was an added plus!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As soon as we opened the door and entered it was everything I imagined and more! Even though it's small it held seven people very comfortable for eating and playing games due to the weather being HOT. We did get to enjoy fishing and family members enjoyed Kayaking. We will definitely be staying here every year while visiting with family.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My week at the lake house was very relaxing and peaceful. I was able to have some very needed down time and relaxation. I highly recommend the lake house for anyone. The lake is gorgeous and fishing is great!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here and once again it was the perfect quiet get away. Spent a lot of time fishing and they even have it set up if you want to do a fish fry. We chose not to since I didn‚Äôt want to clean the fish. The house is super cozy and private. Only saw two neighbors who were both incredibly friendly. Right by the doc is a built in bed for spawning Brim they were all over. Caught a couple big ole catfish as well. Took the canoe out for a spin right after I tipped over in the lake lol it was pretty hilarious. I highly recommend for people who love to fish or just take the canoe around the lake. It‚Äôs beautiful scenery. The second doc is perfect for catching some sun. The wife loved that.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was awesome, beautiful, and exactly what we expected and wanted. Vic and Cyndi were awesome hosts and readily available if we needed them. Had a wonderful time with family and will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want peace and quiet, set off the beaten path, this is the perfect place. Also, one of the more stocked and loaded places. Many activities and amenities."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Vic and Cyndi‚Äôs cabin was perfect for our family of 4. Cozy, huge space for the kids and dog to run and play, gorgeous views, definitely worth it! We will be visiting them again soon!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was great! Setup made us feel very welcome and at home. I would highly recommend Vic and Cyndi. They go the extra mile with communication and extras to make people feel very welcome! Thank you! We will be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the little cabin on the lake. It is a smallish space but had a large feel and was perfect for our family of 3. You can tell they had fun setting it up for airbnb, it's adorable. They thought of everything one might need. We loved hanging out on the docks on the lake and we really enjoyed being able to paddle around the lake in the canoe exploring. We feel like this spot is a gem, we will for sure return in the future. For all you ornithologists out there, this location is a great opportunity to see some of Florida's local birds."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time at the cabin during hurricane Ian. Just alot of wind for three days so we couldn't get out in the boat! Satellite TV worked well and internet was ample. Wonderful place to relax and unwind. Good eats at Wild Olive and Matthew's BBQ smoker, which was set up behind a house just north of Wild Olive eats. Took some beef brisket home with us before we left. Communication was great with Cindy and our four days went smoo"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place relaxing and good fishing
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful,lovely and quiet place where you can gain the energy you need
The place it real amazing üåé‚ù§Ô∏èüíé
From us fiveüíéüíéüíéüíéüíé"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was very nice and the personal touches (food, fishing poles, plates, silverware, etc) were amazing. You could show up with only the clothes on your back and be completely fine and entertained your whole stay. However, days after checkout we find out we are being charged for damage we did not create definitely puts a damper on the trip after the fact. Overall, I would definitely recommend this house for a cozy vacation but I would make sure you bring up all damage you notice during your stay so you are not mistakenly charged for something."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had planned a bunch of places to visit in the area. We found ourselves sitting by the lake, fishing and just too happy to go out. It‚Äôs the perfect little cabin in a great area. Our hosts were very gracious and communicated clearly. The wifi and cell service was spotty but they let us know that before we ever arrived and to be honest it was enough to get by."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Super clean, beautiful and hosts thought of everything. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to relax and have outdoor activites at your fingertips. Fishing, swimming and boating available. The outdoor sitting, while relaxing options were numerous, with views of the lake in every direction. Perfect ""girls trip"" getaway location."

From the personalized Welcome at the front door, well stocked kitchen including great Coffee Bar, comfortable bed to the great screened porch. The property and the view of the Lake are awesome. We hope to visit again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect, little private cabin. Very peaceful and relaxing and not far from near beaches!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're soo glad we found a hidden treasure...when Itell you we LOVED METTE MANOR OMGGGGG.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed this rental. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the lake is gorgeous, and the cabin itself is really nicely appointed. We are definitely recommending this to our friends and family."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our time at mette cute clean cabin huge yard and property for our dogs and kid to roam fishing off the dock swimming in the lake close enough drive to emerald coast beach‚Äôs hosts were prompt and helpful neighbors were far enough away in each side to still feel private they were both friendly we would definitely come back if in the area again late nights on the dock under the moon and stars can‚Äôt beat that
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"There is so much to say about this amazing place. Let‚Äôs start with Vic & Cyndi. They were extremely accommodating and communicated with us if anything were needed. They were proactive with ensuring our stay was awesome. The cabin, it was simply great. Any and all things needed to feel both at home while also making you feel pleasantly away from home. I know the description says 2-4 people, but honestly, I‚Äôd say 5-6 could stay, but I‚Äôm Army so my judgement may be off. It was a beautifully crafted cabin with much thought put into its design. Now, the location was amazing. The lake was gorgeous with fun fishing to be had and the area, though having neighbors, felt as if you were alone. The entire property was well planned and we utilized the fire pit area the majority of the time. As long as Vic & Cyndi allow their cabin on AB&B I will be sending any and all friends and family that visit to there. I can‚Äôt be more appreciative to them for helping bring my old Army buddies together for a much needed reunion. P.S.-The neighbors on both sides are awesome as well."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AWESOME! Vic and Cyndi were wonderful hosts. Everything was absolutely perfect! The fishing was great, the fire pit was great, the entire stay was straight out of a novel. Very relaxing, very easy check in and check out. Can't wait to go back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place. The cabin sits on a large lot with good neighbors that are not too close. The whole area is peaceful and quiet. There are two docks on the property for use. The hosts provided more than we have seen in our other rentals. We highly recommend this rental. Communication was excellent.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for peace and tranquility‚Ä¶stop looking because you just found it!! This place has everything you could possibly need. The beds are so comfy (sleeps 6) and the entire cabin lives up to its cozy little name. Complete kitchen, bathroom and 2 bedrooms. Located 10 min from the local zoo that is a great place to go alone or with the family. 10 min from Crestview‚Ä¶for groceries and gas‚Ä¶and less than an hour from the beach. But the cabin has docks, fishing poles, an amazing firepit and screened in porch with a porch swing. The owners make you feel welcome from the second you arrive and are very accommodating and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. Very clean and safe. I have been staying in AirBnBs since covid started and this is by far my favorite!! I will most definitely be back and just hope it‚Äôs available again. Great job Vic and Cyndi!! Thanks for everything!!"
2022-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Shooting range nearby and a lot of dogs barking. Bathroom is very small. House is nice though.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs the perfect place to relax. Beautiful view of the lake from the cabin. Everything you need is there. The cabin is very comfortable and cozy.
Vic and Cindi are very thoughtful hosts and communicative. They also decorated beautifully for the Holidays. It was a great stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lake house was perfect for our family. The cabin was equipped with everything we needed including an abundance of Keurig pods for the cool mornings. It was neat and tidy and nicely decorated for the Christmas season. We built a fire and sat outside watching our grandkids fish. Our granddaughter was overjoyed at catching a nice Bream. Very nice and relaxing place! We hope to come back in the summer.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little cabin that is a giant on comfort and charm. Vic and Cyndi were there to greet us and introduce us to thier lake paradise. The lake is so peaceful and tranquil. The docks afforded much relaxation on the water. The cabin was perfect. It was clean, bright and cheerful. It had everything we needed. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in. Having morning coffee on the screened in porch over looking the lake was a perfect start to the day. The Christmas decorations added a special holiday charm. A big thank you to Vic and Cyndi."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything'thing you need is thought of. It is a great place to just unwind and still close enough to the normal attractions like Destin fort Walton and Pensacola
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I normally don't book properties that don't have any reviews but I am so glad that I did! Turns out, we were the first Airbnb guests at Vic and Cyndi's adorable cabin, and it was even better than the pictures showed.
Vic and Cyndi were there for my arrival and showed me around the property. Sweetest people ever and I loved hearing their story about the cabin. The property is absolutely gorgeous on the lake, with two docks to hang out on plus other seating throughout the yard. There was a fire pit outside but we didn't get a chance to use it.
Inside the cabin was very clean and had everything one could need. It's a quaint, cozy little cabin that was perfect for us, and wasn't too far away from town, with lots of restaurants and grocery stores. The bed was comfortable, the towels were soft and plentiful, and there was a full kitchen with a coffee bar. I also loved sitting on the swing in the screened-in porch while enjoying the beautiful view. Definietly recommend this place and will be back again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I first want to thank Carol for being such an incredible host. It was our first experience with Airbnb as well as visiting Pensacola Florida. The way Carol prepared the Cottage was nothing short of genius.

We highly recommend it and we will definitely stay there again next time we come and visit our son at the Army base."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Carols Cottage was perfect! Great location & and beautiful space. Carols attention to details as great! The beds & pillows were so comfortable.

I can‚Äôt say enough good things about my stay at the cottage.
Perfect!!"

Carol‚Äôs kindness and welcoming touches such as the oranges, water, coffee pods, extra towels, make up towel, toiletries such as shampoo, body wash, and conditioners, and super comfy beds and linens made for a perfect stay. Carol‚Äôs place represents all that is right with booking an Airbnb. Looking forward to staying here again in the future. :)

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at Carol‚Äôs place. We love the country setting yet the convenience of being close to I-10. We loved sitting in the swing on the back covered patio and watching the sunsets. So relaxing. The cottage is immaculate and beautifully decorated. There is a Keurig coffee maker, plenty of coffee pods, creamer and sugar. Carol always leaves a bowl of tangerines and bottles of water. We will always plan to stay here when we are in the area."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed at the cottage for 3 nights......and neither of us wanted to leave. It was even better than pictured...absolutely beautiful property and the cottage was breath taking....we didn't even care to leave to find anything to do. We watched the sunset and sunrise every day under the beautifully set up covered patio. Carol messaged us upon arrival with clear instructions for an easy stress free arrival and departure. We will definitely be booking again in the future.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. The cottage was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. We had beautiful views from the back covered patio that held a swing, rocking chairs and a table. We sat in the swing and watched a beautiful sunset. You are close to I-10 and Highway 90 West, but the cottage was quiet and peaceful with no highway noise. You could hop on I-10 and be in Crestview in about fifteen minutes or go west to Pensacola in about forty minutes. You are definitely in the country, but there was a small diner on Highway 90 where we had a great meal and a Dollar General where we picked up a few necessities. There was coffee and snacks and Carol had left a bowl of small oranges in the fridge. We will definitely stay here again!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My friends and I were here for a wedding and this was well located for that. The pictures were accurate. The king bed and one of the queens were extremely comfortable but the two other queens in were not comfortable. There‚Äôs a huge back yard. The house was very clean. There are some additional cleaning rules posted inside the house- nothing crazy but it would be helpful to have them here as well, we almost missed seeing them! The shower in the master was amazing!! Tons of hot water. The hosts were responsive."

The home was easy to find, had parking space for 4-5 vehicles and was at a great location between Destin/Fort Walton and Pensacola. The house was very clean, comfortable and it really felt like you were home when you‚Äôre there. The hosts really thought about almost anything you could need, we kept finding more helpful items throughout the home on our stay. It was stocked with the essentials like toilet paper and paper towels, all the dishes you need, cookware, towels, wash clothes, soaps, cleaners, grocery bags, basic tools, beach supplies, condiments in the fridge, coffee, sugar, some canned food‚Ä¶the list goes on! The big bonus, that it‚Äôs pet friendly! It was so great being able to bring our fur babies with us on vacation.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, exactly as listed & pictures. Plenty of space in the house and well-furnished, without being crowded. The kitchen was well-stocked with pots & pans, dishes, etc. Herbert & Carlee were very responsive and proactive; we had an issue and when I messaged them, they responded right away and took care of it quickly. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this house!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Location Location, Location. If you're visiting in this area, this is a gem. Good restaurants, close to stores, not far from Niceville, Destin, Navarre, and Ft. Walton Beach. Peaceful neighborhood and far enough away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
We truly enjoyed our stay."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Herbert is a fabulous host - so friendly, kind and super responsive. Very humble as well. Couldn‚Äôt ask for better. Lovely, clean and comfortable home in a quiet suburb, 1.5 miles from Crestview. Plenty of space for our group of four adult women - hardest decision was who would get the master bedroom suite with loveseat and large private bathroom with double sinks and separate room for bathtub, separate tiled shower and toilet with privacy wall. Also had a walk-in closet. Very nice kitchen with sunny eating area. Comfortable spacious couches in living room. Three extra bedrooms, each with wonderful queen-sized beds. Smaller extra bathroom to share with one sink and bathtub - not much counter space, but nice and clean. Lovely fenced in back yard getting plenty of sunshine and covered deck with patio furniture. Solar lights might need to be replaced? Loved the garage (with coded access and garage door clicker) offering privacy and comfort in extreme weather conditions. Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay and the back yard is great for our pups.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I highly recommend this home!
We have traveled and used airbnb all over Europe and the US and this has been one of the best experiences me and my family have had. The host even surprised my daughter by putting up a Christmas tree for us since we were coming home to visit and flying from Italy.
Location, price, host, the house and yard were all exceptional! Very responsive host to all of our needs. Check in and out process was smooth and with clear instructions."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This 4 bedroom home has a generous sized kitchen and living room. The backyard is fenced in making traveling with dogs (which i had) or small children (which i did not have) a little less stressful. My parents live in crestview and we were visiting them for Thanksgiving. Mom's kitchen is tiny, so i was able to do my share of the cooking here. The kitchen had almost everything i needed...i didn't notice a cutting board which would have been nice, but the granite counters worked well. We normally stay at a hotel, but this home was much more comfortable for me, 4 medium to big kids, plus my sister and her husband. I will definitely try to stay here again on future trips."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great house and a great price. We enjoyed the location and already made a reservation for new year‚Äôs.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Needed extra help since the guests did not have access to the account used to make the reservation. It was a nice place and happy after arriving. Just needed communication to get in initially. It was a nice place and enjoyed our stay.

It has a great back deck and a fully fenced yard, so our son's dog could go out, as needed. Very nice that it was 'pet-friendly', and a few dog toys and a dog dish were even provided. The master bed was very comfortable, and the Master bath and closet was fantastic! We felt pampered to have such a great place!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This home on the river is exactly as described! It was perfect for our visit to the area to spend the holidays with our children and grandchildren. James is a great host and was easy to communicate with. The balcony overlooking the peaceful wooded lot and river was a perfect place to relax with a morning cup of coffee. The cabin was spotless and the furniture and beds very comfortable.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a Florida gem getaway from it all. Beautiful property that overlooks the shoal river. The home is new construction and is built well. Awesome wrap around 2nd floor patio with comfy furniture. Mirrored bedrooms so no arguing who gets the bigger room.. :)

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James is a serious host and is very accommodating. He is very responsive and will go the extra mile to make sure you have a great time at his home. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to get away from the city and relax.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with super professional owner. Amazing views and super peaceful for a relaxing getaway vacation!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect completely secluded river side cabin! James was an awesome host. The cabin was immaculate and very homey with the most comfortable furniture (inside and out) that I‚Äôve ever sat on. Morrison and ponce de Leon springs are just 30 minutes away if the beach isn‚Äôt your thing.
We stayed here for a mini vacay for my husbands birthday ( we only live 2 hours away so this was a staycation of sorts) and had an incredibly relaxing time but also plenty to do near by if you decide you want to get out of the house but staying at the cabin itself is a relaxing vacation.
The wifi also worked great and would be a really good spot to be able to catch up on work while staying somewhere relaxing with a view and no city noise.
The kitchen had everything I needed to be able to cook with and a HUGE gorgeous island that I loved having the space to prep meals on while having a view of the river/surrounding woods.The spice cabinet also had everything you would ever need in it (trust me)."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James‚Äô place provided just the peacefulness and escape from civilization that I needed. The house is equipped with everything you need! Had a wonderful weekend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything about this place was just perfect will most definitely be coming back in the future
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location was amazing, it was peacefully secluded with river access for kayaks that James brought for us to use during our stay. The house was perfect for us and we loved the design."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and an amazing setting, spotless and as pictured, no cell service in the area so I had to drive back into service to get the details for access.
Place is brand new and the owner is still working out any slight kinks with contractors, don't hesitate to message the owner and things will be worked out in a quick and timely manner."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good stay no WiFi so unless you have phone signal which we didn‚Äôt you can‚Äôt communicate with anyone, very relaxing stay house has everything you need. Would stay again!! Host was very nice and always communicated."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was comfortable and everything was so clean. The bathrooms are a little dated but impeccably clean! Kitchen has been recently updated and had all the essentials needed. Stacie noticed the front door code lock needed new batteries and sent someone right over. Stay was great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed the week before Christmas and chose this home partly because of the location which is close to our grandkids, although it is a little out of town. The home was exactly as described, clean and well appointed. We loved the personal touches such as the Christmas decor. One thing that stood out was the host provided a local guidebook listing recommended restaurants which was much appreciated. At three bedrooms, it was a little bigger than needed for the two of us but the location and comfort will definitely have us coming back when we return to Crestview."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,All was great. TV in master would have been a plus.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Aerial was a wonderful hostess. We only had one issue & she took care of it in a timely manner. If I had questions she always responded quickly. Her 2 children are very helpful also. She has a very nice place & everything was spotless. The place was so convenient because my daughter lives 5 minutes away. Very relaxing! I would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aerial was an amazing host! The place was such a nice private escape for us to enjoy! Everything was in pristine condition with very comfortable beds. We enjoyed the large backyard space and complimentary lemonade and snacks from local businesses, it was perfect for our late nights! I would give this place a 10/10 would highly recommend!!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,Could not have asked for anything better. Had no issues at all. Loved the kitchen as my grandchildren had missed granny's cooking. Had a couple of big family meals together. The house was clean and cozy. I would so love to do it again. They were great hosts and I thank them for sharing such a lovely home. It was also close to so much of the activities we were there for. And close to other things we ventured out to do. We had no issues with anything that we needed while there. Hope to do it again soon.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. Great master bedroom with everything we needed. Kitchen was also very nice. Very quiet neighborhood.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Simply amazing! The screen in porch was my favorite! Along with the house being divided. Everything was in order, clean, and easy to use. Everything was labeled for easy convenience of knowing how to use or where it‚Äôs located. This would definitely be a favorite or my list to rebook ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks again for allowing us to stay! Best wishes!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great home. Plenty of space to enjoy
Quiet and safe neighborhood for walking.
Enjoyed the home. Great communication from hosts."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was just as pictured & was perfect for our stay. The master closet was big enough for my baby‚Äôs pack and play which ended up working even better than I planned. My big kids got to have their own rooms which they loved. The smart door lock did start ‚Äútalking‚Äù in the middle of the night which freaked us out a little. It just said ‚Äúdeadbolt locked‚Äù two or three times. So we don‚Äôt know if someone tried to get in or what happened, but everything ended up being fine. My husband got up and looked around and never saw anyone or anything so we don‚Äôt know why it did that. It never did again while we were there. It was just a little unnerving in the moment. Overall, it was a fantastic stay and we would gladly stay there again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,it was everything and more of what we needed. my wife and i will be staying there again. awesome place thatfeels like home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home. The house was extremely clean well kept. Clear instructions on how to check in and out. Amazing experience i will definitely check to see if i can book the house agaon when i return in a few weeks.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Brenda‚Äôs place was clean simply decorated . The kitchen was well stocked . It is a few turns off the main road to get to but it was close to our daughters which is what we were looking for . We did not spend time there during the day but the eve were quiet .

Will definitely stay again when we come to visit family.
Thanks yall!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful, we loved hanging out on the back porch. Since we stayed in December they had a Christmas tree and a few decorations out and I thought that was a lovely touch. Overall our stay was great, and the house was close to restaurants and shopping(:"

Javier and team were the most thoughtful host. He provided us with all the information we needed. The home is really comfortable. The kitchen contains everything you need. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom clean and light. The location was incredible. Javier went way beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Rented the cabin for the Girl‚Äôs Trip 2024 with my sister, niece, & best friend and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This secluded cabin was exactly what I was looking for to get away from it all! Beautiful inside and out!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming house. Well decorated and cozy. Nice quiet neighborhood. Close to restaurants and stores. Kristy was a great host even allowing us a late checkout so we could shower and change after our pickleball tournament on Sunday. The only issue we had was internet. We could not stream tv and work on computers at the same time. We had to use our portable hotspot. I did contact Kristy about the issue and she was very happy to send someone of over to look at it but we just used our hotspot as we weren't in the house much. We would defiantly rent here again .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice updated country house with all modern amenities in a wonderful setting. The only recommendation our family has would be to upgrade the beds. This is a personal preference as we all have memory foam mattresses at home, and usually find them in rentals. Otherwise a 10 out of 10 and we loved it."

I have no question that if you have a single question or issue, it wouldn‚Äôt be resolved nearly immediately. On top of quick response, Shelly is an incredibly sweet individual and puts you at complete ease when communicating. Her house was pristine and the pictures are 100% accurate. She had everything you would need; maybe even more than I have in my own house. Even better, it was completely quiet. I plan on staying in the area multiple times a year and I will base my travel plans around her tiny home‚Äôs availability. The house and Shelly are that wonderful! You won‚Äôt regret this booking :)"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Shelley created a very hospitable environment!
The listing was misleading because it didn‚Äôt clearly state that air mattress required assembly until we had to set it up when we arrived in the middle of the night. Otherwise fine."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was such a charming AirBnB. Clean and so chic! I want to build a place just like it. Shelly was very responsive and sweet throughout our stay. Downtown was just a 20 min walk away which was nice to visit after 8 hours of driving! 10/10 would go again !

The house is immaculately cleaned and designed. I was so impressed with the condition and the decor I immediately started taking pictures. The owners are kind, responsive and very professional. I wish every Airbnb home I had stayed in took note of this home! Literally the best stay I have had!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional place to stay. A real jewel ! We will stay there again when we visit. Carol has created a tastefully furnished, charming place to stay. Cant say enough good things."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This is one of our favorite Airbnb‚Äôs that we have stayed at! Such a cozy home with luxurious touches. We LOVED the front porch sitting out on the rocking chairs was our favorite part! There is a fire pit in the backyard that we didn‚Äôt get to use. Our party of 6 adults were all very comfortable and the home had everything we needed. Kitchen and bathrooms were very well stocked. Will definitely be coming back again on our next trip to Milton. Thank you Carol
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures of this home are wonderful, however, they do not capture all of the amazing details of this home's restoration. Absolutely beautiful place and so many cozy details inside and outside of the house. The front porch, the living furniture, beds, bedding, bath & kitchen were so cozy. We look forward to staying at Carol's home again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After staying at the Cottage for two days, we thought there was no way Carol can out do herself at the Bungalow. Wow! We were definitely wrong. We stayed the remaining three days at the Bungalow and we were floored by the attention to detail Carol payed at this gorgeous home. Once again, we needed nothing at all for our stay. Carol included pots, pans, dish washing liquid, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, an iron, body wash, shampoo & conditioner, plenty of plush towels and bed sheets and of course her signature oranges and water bottles. The experience was simply amazing! Thank you Carol."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was exactly as advertised in all respects. It was clean , comfortable, and well stocked with necessities. Extra touches such as fresh oranges, Keurig coffee, pleasant decor, a variety of succulents, and an extremely well supplied kitchen with quality equipment and utensils were much appreciated. Everything worked well as in dish and clothes machines, outside gas grill and fire place, and all kitchen appliances,
We were visiting family in the area and found the location very handy for accessing them, Eglin AFB, and beaches to the south.
We also found the bungalow to be a friendly setting in which to host our clan.
Our home away from home added greatly to our wonderful experience in the area.
Thank you.
Ron"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Blackwater Bungalow was the perfect place to stay for an extended visit to NW FL. This charming home has been beautifully restored and exudes warmth. So much more comfortable than chain hotel/motels. Carol provided lots of extra special touches you'd find in a luxe B&B- bottled water in the fridge. Keurig with KCups, sweetener packets and creamer with Bevita Biscuits, Hershey kisses near the bedrooms reminiscent of turndown service. Location provides quick access to I-10 about equal distance between Pensacola Beach and Destin. it's also perfect for a quiet country retreat with a literal rocking chair porch and awesome backyard with grill, firepit and corn hole! I'm from the area and will be booking again on future visits!"

It was in a very peaceful location, with a big front porch with rocking chairs. The large windows let in so much light and serene views.
The linens were soft and comfortable. The home had very nice finishes in the bathrooms and kitchen. All the kids wanted the downstairs bedroom!
I appreciated having bar soap in the showers in addition to the body wash and hair products (small thing but I appreciate it!)
Carol was very responsive and went above and beyond to make us comfortable when the weather did not cooperate! Thank you!!"

The house was stocked with all dishes, cookware, linens, bathroom necessities. Back yard was perfect for making s‚Äômores and sitting around the fire. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay on our trip."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Carol's place was very clean and had everything we needed for our getaway. Carol was a fantastic host, making check-in/check-out processes very easy and made several local recommendations. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"GUEST 1: This home was absolutely beautiful; very comfortable for family of six. Front porch offered a perfect spot for watching sunrise and cup of coffee. Furniture and beds were very comfortable. Linens excellent and towels plentiful. All fixtures/lighting definately ""POSH"" and tasetfully elegant/complementary to the home. It is clear that the contractor/person that did the upgrades paid attention to every detail to perfection. Natural lighting was as welcome as the thoughtful window treatments for privacy. Kitchen was super functional and had everything we needed. Cleanliness exceeded my expectations and we have high standards! Furnishings/lighting in backyard patio left nothing to be desired. Loved it! (Clawfoot tub dreamy!) GUEST 2: This was a very beautiful ""bungalow"". Situated close to the highway. The owners thought of every little detail and provided everything a house would need. I love all the decor and personal touches in each room. I'm
very clean, definitely stay again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We will be back
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I had a wonderful time at Krystin and Ryan‚Äôs place! We were celebrating his birthday and we were looking for somewhere private and relaxing and where he could enjoy some fishing. This place checked off every box. We loved that we could bring our dog too and he had a great time exploring and taking lots of naps. The RV was cozy and fully stocked with everything you could need. We definitely recommend this Airbnb for a unique and peaceful stay! Krystin and Ryan were very helpful and responsive and quick to come out if we needed anything.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved the time we stayed here! It felt like a slice of paradise. We felt far enough out for peace and quiet but close enough to anything you would need on vacation. The stay was everything and more than we expected.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite possibly the sweetest airbnb I have ever stayed in. Krystin is an exceptional host who went out of her way to accommodate us, even leaving us a card to celebrate the birth of our grandson. She has a huge heart and she shows it in so many ways. Her place is so cozy and everything was provided. There was even fresh chicken eggs and strawberries for us when we arrived. The beds are comfortable. The water is delicious and soft. Outside is the best part. Beautiful palms, rolling, grassy hills, a grazing horse,
a pristine lake. Fish jumping, a barking tree frog, chickens clucking with the occasional crow of a rooster. All peaceful sights and sounds of nature that made this place truly special. And if youre not into all that, theres a hottub, cornhole, games, and many hammocks to just chill in. We highly recommend this very special, unique place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can‚Äôt say enough about our experience at Blue Eyed Acres! Not only was it absolutely beautiful and peaceful, it had so many little things to do on the property that made our time there so much more enjoyable! We played cornhole, relaxed in the jacuzzi, enjoyed the afternoon sun breeze in the hammock with a cute visit from Pax, their horse. We caught a few bass off the pier and has the best time kayaking in the lake. It was so quiet, and peaceful! The camper is amazing and fully accommodating for cooking, grilling, preparing, storing and eating. The living space was so cozy and perfect for catching up on our latest Netflix series! We will definitely be returning! We ventured out into town and picked fresh strawberries at Southern Strawberry Farms, had lunch at the Gator Cafe, and toured the local town museum! Last but not least, our hosts! They were so kind and helpful anytime we needed anything or had questions. Very personable and down to earth! Great mini-vacation!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely had the best time! The camper was so cute! So much love put into the place. It was so beautiful and peaceful! I hope to come again in August for my daughter's birthday! Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a little piece of heaven.

We extended our trip after only one night there. We will be back !"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to get away and relax! Attention was paid to all the small details that make a big difference. The inside of the RV is exceptionally clean. The grounds were very well maintained. Extra things to do on site if you want more than just relaxing! I was pleasantly impressed!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful relaxing space. Amazing nature and was such a nice reset in nature, tons of birds and palms. The hammocks around the property were a nice touch as well, awesome to sit and relax down by the water and was able to watch the sunset in the hot tub!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely Amazing! We had a Peaceful and Relaxing getaway. Krystin & Ryan definitely thought of Everything when they created this amazing place. We had an adventure every day and we relaxed comfortably every night. I would highly recommend staying here and we will definitely be back! My daughter said it's one her top 5 places to stay, she loved it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"From beginning to end this was an absolutely wonderful stay! Upon arrival we were greeted with flowers and a lovely note welcoming us to the Airbnb. The inside of the RV was even cuter and cozier than the pictures show and they even had farm fresh eggs in the fridge for use if we wanted as an extra touch! There were plenty of activities available like books, movies and a hot tub to relax in. And a lake to fish at. There‚Äôs also exciting activities too like horse riding and kayaking tho horse riding costs a little extra, it‚Äôs definitely worth it. Honestly could not recommend this place enough, it‚Äôs perfect for a cost get away!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a blast here! Immediately felt right at home and it was absolutely beautiful. We had a great time and are very thankful for Krystin and her family!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best set up airbnb homes I've ever visited! Krystin was born to host. This is cute place, very nice and clean. The camper itself did not disappoint but what stood out the most was all the things she did in this camper to make the guests happy. You will not regret staying here!! Great job Krystin! You're good at this hosting gig:))"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing people! Friendly, courteous, went above and beyond. Very responsive. So much to do here! It‚Äôs very home like and peaceful. We had so much fun in the hot tub, fishing, and just hanging out. Yous made us want to get a set up like yours. Kids didn‚Äôt want to leave, hell neither did we. If you‚Äôre looking for the perfect get away, home away from home, or a place to‚Äùdisconnect‚Äù without disconnecting this is where you should go! We look forward to our next stay here and to make more memories. Thankyou both so much, yous truly are awesome people and deserve the best rating!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like privacy this is the place to stay. It was perfectly described, impeccably clean, extremely peaceful with great communication. Unfortunately due to the weather we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the outside amenities the property offered. When we are back in the area will definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a high school graduation and family parties so I can‚Äôt speak on things to do in crestview this place made you feel right at home. Wonderful fenced private backyard. Cleanest place I have ever stayed at with so many wonderful touches to make your morning or evening feel like you are at your own house. The host was super responsive and even ran over some toilet paper when we ran low. If you ever need to stay in or near crest view this is the place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Josh's Bungalow was centrally located. The description matched the actual house exactly. Very spotless and sparkling clean, well decorated, and comfy beds. We had everything we needed for our short stay. The house was close to local restaurants, grocery stores and anything you might need. The hosts gave great directions and clear instructions.
The added bonus for us was the large fenced backyard for our pups to play.
We would stay here again.
Thanks Josh and Co-hosts"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a small cottage however it did feel like home. Everything was very clean. The Kitchen has full sets of flatware, bakeware, dishware, pots and pans. They had the cutest coffee/tea bar. I brought my coffee and was surprised to see they had a variety of coffee and teas for a regular coffee maker and a Keurig which was a nice surprise. They also had a variety of sugar supplies to match. The backyard is closed in with a table set for 4 and it is super cute.
The cottage is close to several stores and supermarkets which is convenient for grocery shopping."

There was only one couch to sit on and it‚Äôs a little shabby and uncomfortable.
The neighborhood is somewhat noisy. That being said it is close to everything in Crestview and it‚Äôs nice to walk in."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The owners went well and above expectations
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable bungalow very close to I-10, and was super clean and beyond comfortable! Like a five star hotel. The fenced in backyard was especially a plus traveling with a well behaved but frisky doggy. Coffee, body wash, soft towels, bedroom television and lovely decor made our stay exceptional. The Hideaway Pizza place down the road was delicious, too! Could not have been more pleased with our short stay! Excellent."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute cottage with a great central location. Everything feels fresh and clean and well-appointed. Check-in and departure instructions were clear and easy to follow. Do note that Texas Pkwy can get a little busy at certain times.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great little house. The kitchen was a little lacking when it comes to any decent knives and cookware. There was a great cast iron skillet which I used a lot.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was great and exactly what we needed to help us attend our friends military retirement.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is exactly as described. It felt a little bare and could of used some games and books for downtime. Also, pictures on the walls would of made it more homey, in my opinion. But it satisfied my and my husband's needs, as we were in town for a friend's birthday party. Anyone with kids may need to bring supplies."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was great. We loved the privacy and how beautiful the property was. We would definitely recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely beautiful. It‚Äôs set far back in the woods at the end of a dirt road, so it‚Äôs very private and peaceful. It was no trouble to access it, though, even in our front-wheel drive vehicles. The trail leading down to the creek behind the house is a nice little hike that ends at a small beach with a covered table for setting up your fishing gear. Our whole family had a great time exploring the property. The back yard‚Äôs fire pit with surrounding Adirondack chairs was perfect for roasting hot dogs and s‚Äômores. Inside the homes had a Key West vibe that was very comfortable and inviting, and the main house‚Äôs living room couch was so ridiculously comfortable that our teenager chose to sleep on it every night. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and definitely did not want to leave when the time came. I highly recommend this place for a peaceful, comfortable stay that‚Äôs off the beaten path."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very private, peaceful location. Plenty of space for everyone to have their own place to sleep."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"our puppies found some residue that was on the ground next to the tree. We got them out of it and went on about our day. Friday night, our male pup started experiencing the following symptoms: His eyes are about halfway closed, he cannot stand and his head is very wobbly. He would not drink or eat a treat. And he also had a sort of grin on his face.
So we rushed him to the Emergency Vet Clinic in Niceville. After a full work up, it came back that the stuff that he had ingested a THC substance. So that bill was $312.
Now I am not mad nor am I trying to retrieve reimbursement because at the end of the day‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs my baby and I would pay anything to save him. He is fine now and is back to normal.
I‚Äôm not sure who is responsible for the stuff beside the tree but it needs to be taken care of. There should also be a rule established for discarding such products. I am not judging but this is a dog friendly Airbnb and people should be respectful."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was awesome. Will stay again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was lovely.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, calm and confortable. Beach only 40 minutes away."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved this unique place. Property land was gorgeous.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Pictures are accurate and place was very clean. Private and peaceful, we enjoyed our stay and would return in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet retreat to nature, this is it! The property is so serene and cozy. The house(s) are well maintained and very comfortable, plenty of room for our large family to spread out. We enjoyed rocking on the porch and taking a walk to the river. Lots of room for kiddos to run and play, but perfect for a quiet honeymoon get away too!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Would definitely rent again, we enjoyed this beautiful home.
Very serene and peaceful with lots to do and plenty of space for everyone to enjoy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly what we needed!!! Plenty of room and all the little things that we needed for the weekend. It is a bit off of the main road, at the end a dead end drive, which we weren‚Äôt expecting. But Behind a locked gate and with cameras in place, we felt totally safe. It was very clean and well stocked with towels and linens, we were very satisfied!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful area. perfect place to stay for my family while we were in town to visit local family but not intrude on them.
they responded quickly to any issues that came up. worth the money with separate rooms and doors for different couples privacy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect property for us! We wanted a space that was big and open and separated for our kiddos to have the freedom to play and run and laugh as they saw fit! This property was just that and it is SO beautiful. All of us wish we could have stayed locked away in this little oasis forever! We will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Our family of 9 stayed at this location. It was more off the beaten path than we expected. There was plenty of room for everyone to kick back and relax. There were indoor and outdoor places to sit and congregate. Overall we enjoyed our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place is perfect if u don't want to be in the middle of the busy Destin area. The river out back is nice but be prepared for a hike lol! We had hoped to fish but didn't have much luck and didn't see any fish. It was perfect for us and I loved the privacy and peace out there! So if your wanting the tourist experience this isn't for you, be prepared to drive for all that also, but if your wanting peace and privacy away from all the people then definitely pick this place!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the property was pleasant. It was much larger than we expected, suitable for 2-3 small families. It is a country home, but luckily there was a Dollar General where we could buy necessities such as wasp spray, grill cleaning brush, extra paper towels, etc. We traveled with our dogs, and the fully fenced in yard was a definite plus! Our family and pets enjoyed the trail and all the space! Loved all the porches, extra refrigeration, appliances. Fully stocked kitchen was great. We were a bit uncomfortable with AC being recommended to stay at 72, extra blankets would have been nice. Home was clean, except for a few dead bugs from pesticide treatments and dog hair from previous guests in the cabin with trundle beds. The road leading up to the property and the yard was sandy. It was dry when we visited, so we had no issues in our SUV. Had it been raining/wet it may have been an issue. Especially for smaller cars, this is important to consider. Overall we are happy with the rental!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and excellent experience. Very peaceful and relaxing.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home and a peaceful location

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Awesome home and host. Stunningly beautiful decor and surroundings. Host is very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house and surroundings were beautiful! Quiet and peaceful. The porch was the best. We spent most of our time there. We ate all our meals at the house. They had all the accessories you needed to cook at the house. From the grill to the stove. We were able to walk the trail and get the fire pit going . Just an incredible place. Highly recommended!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice home. Peaceful and quiet area.
Though I appreciate the security efforts, the outer gate was a bit of a pain‚Ä¶would be nice for owner to invest in gate with keypad entry."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at this Airbnb was truly a blessing during a difficult time. When we lost our home to a fire, we had no idea where to turn. But as soon as we arrived here, we knew we had found a special place.
They made sure the house felt like an actual home. Every detail was thoughtfully considered, from the cozy furnishings to the welcoming amenities. We were able to relax & unwind in a way that we hadn't been able to do in a long time.
But the true highlight of our stay were the Sozo's. They were always just a message away & were incredibly kind and supportive. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and made us feel like family.
We can't thank them enough for their hospitality and kindness. Our stay here will always be remembered as a special time in our lives and we are grateful to have had such a welcoming and loving environment to turn to during a tough time. This place & the Sozo's deserve nothing but the highest praise & we can't recommend it enough!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,super good home
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was exactly what we needed.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home, clean with great restaurants nearby. Neighborhood is right off the main road as well, and near plenty of places to explore."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as advertised.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dawn was great! Very flexible and accommodating. Place was perfect for my family & dogs while moving from out of state.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay! :)
2023-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Dawn's place was not what I expected at all, and I was disappointed in the stay that my family and I left early and found another place to stay. There were many issues with the home that I felt should have been addressed before putting for rent."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an extended stay for most of the summer, and the place was just what I needed. The house was as described, and Dawn was very responsive and resolved a few minor issues (a few missing utensils during my stay, etc) quickly."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Not worth the $100 per night I paid. Ridiculous cleaning fee given they wanted me to clean everything. This area of town is not safe for women or children. Projects are less than a block away. The lawn was over 2 feet tall. This is the problem with Airbnb anyone can make pictures look good but they don‚Äôt show the crack house next door.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Dawn was great and easy to communicate with. The house was simple & tidy. I enjoyed the extra blankets and pillows, and the keurig. I appreciated the mattress covering, secure that it was clean of other bodies mess or insects.
The fridge and freezer was very clean and water tastes good coming from the fridge filter.
