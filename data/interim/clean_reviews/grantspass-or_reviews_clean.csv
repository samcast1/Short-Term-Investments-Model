2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Our company crew has been staying in the Herron House for 2 months now. Just loves Jennifer's place as she has the acreage to park the construction trailers. Our Project Manager onsite speaks so highly of the place. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place was amazing!!
The house and grounds are stunning and very well cared for - we will definitely come back in warmer weather to enjoy the deck.
There were a few minor issues (some missing batteries, etc), but Jennifer was proactive in checking in with us and fixed the issues immediately.
The driveway is a little hidden, but with Jennifer's precise directions, we found it without any problems.
Our only complaint is that the wifi was really weak, so if you plan to work while there, it might be an issue."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I am lost for words to describe how wonderful Jennifer is to our Airbnb needs. This is the reason why we opt for long-term rental. She always goes above and beyond what is expected of a host. Will highly recommend her!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place and quite relaxing. we were close to city yet far enough away that gave it an almost magical nuance. I would definitely recommend the Heron house. we loved the grounds and the pond is great to sit by. we saw Heron on the pond.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved this stay! The rooms and kitchen were like home, only much better! The wifi was good. The location was convenient too. It felt so removed from the chaos of the city, but then only 10 min away from great food and arts in Grant's Pass. My favorite was the patio for breakfast overlooking the farm & mountains & stars at night."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice home adjacent to cannabis farm in Fort Vannoy area of GP. Beautiful sunsets, excellent appliances and basic necessities provided. Host was excellent at communication. Note, this is attached to another AirBNB unit with constant turnover and laundry area is shared. Also, the Wi-Fi is painfully slow and working remotely was impossible. Verizon coverage is also sketchy in this area and typically at 3 bars. Bring your bug spray and citronella! With the location in the farm area of GP with a “pond “ on property, summer bugs are brutal."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay. Clean house couldn’t ask for a better view!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place is absolutely wonderful, and it's why this was our second stay here. We couldn't wait to come back. The location is beautiful and we love the views from inside, as well as out on the back deck. It feels like a home away from home. The kitchen is well appointed with everything you need to cook meals there - and you can eat in the dining room or out at the table on the beautiful deck. There's plenty of room to spread out and be comfortable. It's definitely the best Airbnb that I've stayed in, and hope to be back again. :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was clean and comfortable, and the grounds were very well- kept. We loved our stay and found the home perfect for our group of five!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had 15 family members visit for a family event and I didn't have enough room for all of them. Heron House was perfect! We ended up renting everything they had, which was a total of 4 rooms. It was perfect for the two couples and two single people that we had. The home is gorgeous, and bedrooms we're perfect and the snacks provided were very thoughtful. My family enjoyed sitting on the deck with their morning coffee. It was perfect and I will contact them again, when needed."
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This is beautiful space with a wonderful territorial/farm view and an awesome covered deck that is well furnished and includes a grill.
Jennifer has included many amenities to make for an easy stay.
We found the west bedroom to be unusable for sleeping due to the noise transmission from the connected unit."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful! We enjoyed our stay very much. Jennifer was very helpful! Will be staying again some time soon!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really appreciated all the niceties that were part of the house - keurig coffee, soaps in bathroom, comfortable blankets in the living room, etc. . The kitchen was great for cooking, bed was very comfortable, the house had a wonderful vibe. If we are in the area again, we would definitely return."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an amazing experience staying at the Heron House! Jennifer went out of her way to provide everything we needed for our extended stay. It was a treat to wake up every morning to ducks enjoying themselves in the pond, gaggles of geese flying overhead and even a heron searching for food. Heron House was a very comfortable stay for us and Jennifer was extremely accommodating. We loved our stay!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jennifer is an amazing host who goes out of her way to provide her guests with a wonderful experience. Her home is warm, comfortable and has everything you would need to feel the “home away from home” security. She genuinely wants you to feel safe and cozy while you are taking in the beautiful mountains, geese and sunsets!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bright and beautiful place, very relaxing and very clean! Enjoyed it very much!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very lovely spot..loved it.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, would recommend staying at this location."
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice shared house with other Airbnb listings in grants pass. Good host with quick replies.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay! Super peaceful with lots to do in the area. Ryan and Thomas were quick to respond and help in any way. What you want in a getaway vacation home for sure!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute spot, beautiful view! My husband and I are 5”10 and 6”4 so the only
Issue is we couldn’t fit in loft! 😂"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and beautiful
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay overall and great hosts
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing space! Stayed over a weekend to get away for the Girlfriends birthday. The dogs took full advantage of the greenspace around the home. Super simple check in. The rainy weekend made for perfect nights, sitting in the hot tub and enjoying some wine. The only issues I had were; the see-through sheet was an interesting choice for the bathroom door and, the cover to the front porch is not weatherized at all. Everywhere under the covering, save a few inches from the door was soaked any time it rained.
Incredibly thankful for the opportunity to use the space!"
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Nice views and a short drive to town. Missing some items that would have been helpful (salt, pepper, cutting board) Hot tub was slimy on the inside and not sure what the yellow foam was on the top. I tried multiple times to message hosts and didn’t get a response until following morning. Host mentioned leaving us s’more supplies but that didn’t happen. Possibly a one off situation and something happened but communication would have been helpful to understand BBQ situation / hot tub situation."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful tiny home. Very private and peaceful. Loved the hot tub under the stars and a nice relaxing view for morning coffee too.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very private and peaceful setting, yet close to town. Loved the deck and hot tub."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved this place!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little get away. Close to town but we felt away from it all. Absolutely loved enjoying a glass of wine while watching the sunset from the lovely deck (with a visit from their beautiful kitty), then sitting in the hot tub at dawn watching the sunrise with a visit from deer and a wild turkey. Rare to find a place where you can enjoy both. The main road is very close (but you can’t see it), and we did have a few louder cars in the night, but we both noticed it’s a pretty quiet road. My husband is a pretty big guy so he felt a little tight in the loft - he couldn’t really sit up, but it’s an amazing space. Very thoughtful design and layout. Love the natural forest setting with wildflowers blooming."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little private escape and the view from the front porch is beautiful
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling the world and staying in countless air bnb’s, I have developed unreasonably high standards. That being said, I give this tiny home my utmost regard. The area was stunning, it’s hard to find something more relaxing than sitting in a hot tub in the woods and looking up at the stars. While it felt like the perfect amount of isolation, I was still close enough to the town to shop at the stores. I used their bbq every night to make dinner. There is also a kitchen fully stocked with all cooking supplies. I couldn’t have found a better place to stay, and it doesn’t surprise me that I was unable to extend my stay. If you have the opportunity to book, I would do it immediately before someone else beats you to it."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy stay with a wonderful view and great hot tub
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay! Very relaxing and house was clean.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and quaint! The water feature and fireplace with the hot tub make for the perfect setting!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was the perfect little retreat. Beautiful scenery and plenty of space for our dog to run around in. The hot tub was exactly what we needed on a night in. The drive into town is short, and we were pleasantly surprised with the entire experience because it was our first time in Grants Pass. 10/10 would book here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very private and beautiful location, perfect for what we needed. After a long drive, having wine and smores for us was just what we needed along with the jacuzzi under the stars. Will have this place saved for the future!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Host was very responsive! Jacuzzi overlooking the woods and hills was a real treat! Felt very private!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cute little place with responsive hosts, and a great little retreat to relax and rejuvenate."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Has pretty much everything you need for a couple nights, wouldn’t recommend any extended stays. The hot tub, view, and privacy were great - just a little hard to sleep with the low ceiling on the lofted bed. Also the couch wasn’t too comfy either but we loved the movie selection and having Roku TV access."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a couple nights and absolutely loved it!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent stay! we will 100% book again. the perfect getaway for the weekend. :)

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I stayed here for our anniversary, and we loved it! The complimentary wine was appreciated, and a relaxing night in the hottub was exactly what the doctor ordered."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thomas was responsive and clear. The home matched what was listed and met my expectations.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay for Valentines Day! Hot tub had great forest views!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked the tiny home to work remotely from for a couple of days. Internet was on the slow side (5-10mbps) but I didn’t have any issues with video calls. The location is a short drive from downtown grants pass but feels very remote from the cabin. I’d stay here again if traveling through.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an incredible stay! It was quiet, private, and beautiful. Such a cozy place to stay with kind, accommodating hosts. We will be sure to stay here again and we will definitely recommend to others planning on heading to southern Oregon!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very private and secluded just what we wanted. place had everything you needed and very clean. Overall great place to stay at.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great! Very clean, very cute, however the heater did not work, and since it was 35 degrees outside, it got a bit cold…"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent location, very easy to find and cozy place. Thomas was very friendly and greeted us with a bottle of wine and smores."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time. We would stay here again. It was beautiful private clean warm and safe feeling. 10/10!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rented this airbnb for my boyfriend birthday and he couldn't be any happier, do think it need frying pans"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Thomas's tiny home was fantastic. It was so lovely relaxing in the hot tub and they left s'more ingredients out for making in their fireplace! The bed did not have a lot of head space (ceiling only about 1-1/2 feet from the top of bed) but if you don't mind that, it was a very comfy space. I would certainly stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot! Cozy quiet loft, hot tub was wonderful."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was good. It's located next to a large house and road so not as remote as I thought, but still very nice."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stay was great! Not too far out of town, but enough to feel the seclusion!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little spot! The hot tub was awesome and the tiny house is soooo cute. We had a great stay - only wish it could have been longer! We will be back!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views. Secluded tiny space. Hot tub in working order. Hot water for shower. Wi-Fi and TV streaming worked great. Host gave excellent food recommendations.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I made a very last minute booking and Ryan has been a great host. He got the place ready for me in just a couple of hours and he was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed.
The tiny house is great and I really enjoyed my stay.
I recommend.
Thanks again Ryan!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house was so lovely! The space is designed well and felt so cozy. Instructions were clear and the hosts were generous too. We would easily book this place again!! :)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the tiny home. The hot tub, peaceful surroundings, and convenient amenities made all the difference during our staycation. Will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was already you know when I saw the pictures online but when I actually saw the tiny home in person I was even more impressed with how charming and clean it was. I wasn’t able to enjoy the hot tub since I had checked in so late at night, but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see I was greeted with a bottle of wine and supplies for roasting marshmallows. There’s nothing I would change about this beautiful tiny home and the host was nothing but gracious and kind. The pricing was extremely fair and to anyone looking for a romantic getaway or just a nice peaceful stay away, this is the perfect place. It’s Just far enough from the heart of grants pass So that you are close enough to go in town no problem but it feels like you’re out in the wilderness and secluded. I would rate more than five stars if I could."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was peaceful, rained the hole time but still enjoyed the hot tub. They left wine and snacks. That was very nice. Overall it was a good experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had an amazing stay! It was so cute and cozy! Will definitely book again.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great time here!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute tiny home. The bed area has more room than you think. The hot tub was very nice on the cold misty evening as well.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an excellent stay at this cute cozy place! Beautiful views and we felt right at home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Great place to get away for a quiet weekend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Me and my son actually live in grants pass and we wanted to do a little staycation. It was perfect! Very peaceful, the hot tub was an awesome feature to have to the tiny home. We enjoyed our stay and definitely will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly what I was looking for to celebrate boyfriends birthday. This is a Tiny but with a great feeling. Great owners and the hot tub and the stars at night were amazing. Local restaurants close by within 10 min and the bed was comfortable. Just needed a few more extra pillows for the bed. No issues and we loved it, we can’t wait to come back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved this tiny home! What a wonderful location and beautiful building. I loved using the hot tub and relaxing on the porch.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved how secluded this tiny home felt! It was so relaxing to chill in the hot tub surrounded by nature. I can definitely see this place being perfect for a romantic getaway! My only complaint would be there was no bottle of wine waiting as advertised and the door didn’t seem to lock from the outside. No biggie as you’re out in the country but just something to keep in mind.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10, such a beautiful place! One night just didn’t feel like enough. It was so beautiful there!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. Felt so welcomed! My wife and I visited on our honeymoon, and were greeted with a “Happy Honeymoon!” on the entryway chalkboard. Cozy, well decorated, amazing hot tub & extra goodies!
It felt very private, hidden & intimate. Beautiful area! Will be back if we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny home is perfect for a little getaway! It’s so peaceful, relaxing, private, clean!!! 10/10 recommend. The hosts were also very attentive and responsive :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I use air bnb exclusively honestly and this place is a gem. The worst part about this place is giving them a great review due to the fact that it will just get booked up and rarely be available but the quality and beauty of everything is due to there vision and hard work. Thank you see you very soon . G
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at the hilltop tiny home on our way back from Portland to the Bay Area. The tiny home was easy to find and the hot tub and fire pit were great after a day of hiking at Crater Lake! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved everything about this peaceful home from the interior to the movie collection to making s’mores over the fire pit and lastly unwinding in the hot tub. It was the perfect getaway to celebrate our anniversary with our pup!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fun tiny home! Perfect
Check out Weekend Brewery- cool spot near by. I would recommend it!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was just as I expected, wonderful!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in this tiny home. It felt fully secluded and private, and the hot tub was an amazing treat after a long day of driving for us. Thomas even provided us with s'mores supplies which was a really nice touch."

The hosts were very responsive and the home was stocked with amenities. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Tiny Home! We went for a trip to Crater Lake and enjoyed our nights at Thomas’ tiny home. We watched the beautiful sunset from the patio with deer walking up and relaxed in the hot tub. Our pup was very happy to roam around the yard and hang out on the patio.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was as described - neat and modern style home with everything you need for a peaceful getaway
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful little house with all comforts and amenities expected

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful but still pretty close to town. Nice little place to stay
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute tiny home, private and peaceful. The AC kept it nice and cool inside. The amenities are also nice like the hot tub and a couple bottles of wine. The couple of downsides I would say is that the bathroom is not private at all. There’s only a curtain that’s serving as a door, so be sure you’re very comfortable with who you’re staying with. Lastly, the photos are not updated with how the landscaping is now. I thought there would be big open space around the property but there was lots of weeds, stickers, and burs. Thus, nowhere that was comfortable for my dog to go potty. Overall it was a very nice stay and if you’d like a getaway that’s away from the city, this would be a great escape. :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic spot for a little getaway. Very cozy and peaceful. The instructions were very well written and hosts were responsive. Thank you for sharing your tiny home, it was our pleasure to stay here. Looking forward to coming again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for every reason! Beautiful peaceful setting but still right there in town. Thomas was very responsive and accommodating. We hope to go back again sometime :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This tiny home was so cute and relaxing. I liked the outside water fountain to listen to while reading a book outside. The views are great and super close to downtown restaurants where all the food is delicious. The entry way is easy to spot and is now a paved road instead of gravel which is great! The spot has AC which was also so nice since it’s been a hot August in Oregon. The place is well equipped with stuff to cook including a microwave for easy re-heating and a grill outside. The couch is comfy and so are the sheets for the bed. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super adorable location with a beautiful view of the sunset! There was also a hot tub and a fire pit which I will definitely look into for a future trip in the winter! I felt so cozy and if I could stay forever I would! Adorable city!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful location and for the size Thomas had every amenity we could need. We did a little cooking and a lot of relaxing. Highly suggest making this a stop on your way or even taking extra time to spend at this lovely tiny house.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED this tiny home! It was beautiful & chic. It’s private and we felt like we were out in nature - great for stargazing; we were able to catch the Perseids Meteor Shower, saw lots of shooting stars while hanging out in the hot tub! At the same time, it’s next to their main house so I felt safe and not scared. The lights on the deck were lovely, the hot tub was nice and clean, and the electric fire pit was awesome! The s’mores stuff and bottle of wine was a generous touch ❤️"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay! wish we had more time there. Beautiful tiny home with great setup!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny house was really cute! Modern and updated. The bed was comfortable. The size is perfect for one or two people to stay there comfortably. The deck was a nice play to relax and watch the beautiful sunset. I would definitely stay here again should I ever need to stay in Grants Pass, OR."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful location—we loved the property! Thomas was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us a late checkout when we requested. The wifi was a little slow, but it's a much better property to enjoy relaxing instead of working ;)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay! Peaceful little getaway home that was close to downtown!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time, everything was perfect for us and our dog, very privy, beautiful view!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The tiny house was a really unique and beautifull soothing experience. The hot tub and s'mores were fantastic!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Looks just like the photos! It is such a beautiful & peaceful indoor & outdoor space. The bed area is super narrow which was a little challenging for me as a side sleeper who moves from side to side a lot.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot, the tub was hot, the loft was quaint. I always so appreciate when people let dogs stay too.
The yard isn’t fenced and there is a neighbor fairly close, just for awareness if you are bringing dogs. But very quiet place."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Overall we had a great stay! The tiny home was cozy and very private. Only problem was the propane was all empty so we couldn’t use the grill or the fire pit. The hot tub would’ve been great but still wasn’t warm after hours of heating. Aside from that we enjoyed being in the nature and the overall experience!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Overall it's a nice get away. Cute place, however we couldn't use the grill nor fire pit as they had no propane.

The host sent a welcome message promising a bottle of wine, candies, everything you'll need to fix smores. But the roasting sticks were dirty, couldn't lit a fire without propane, no candies were found and no bottle of wine either.
I would warn anyone over 5'7"" as you might bump your head entering the bathroom. A cute sign could be so helpful!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cozy and beautiful home! It had everything we needed and we really enjoyed the outside set up. Super quite and peaceful with fun local breweries and restaurants nearby. Hope to visit again soon! Thanks for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very helpful throughout the whole stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mason and Shelby were excellent communicators and even left a thoughtful little welcome gift waiting for me when I arrived! It was peaceful and serene with beautiful Mountain views. I’d love to come back and sit in the hot tub with snow on the ground in winter!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a peaceful spot with wonderful amenities. The bed was super comfy as well!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an incredible time at Mason & Shelby’s Tiny Home! As hosts, Mason & Shelby were very thoughtful and responsive. The home itself was exactly as advertised.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great! Clean.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy home in a private setting. The tiny home was just as described from the listing. There were some personal touches made during my stay which I found to be a nice touch and quite accommodating.
We look forward to coming back here once again and would highly recommend this location to any of our friends."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place is quite and beautiful. I arrived right at sunset. I had the perfect hot tub moment. It’s what I needed after a long drive. Great for a quick trip!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Words can’t express what a gem this place is. Mason and Shelby thought of every comforting detail and it shows. The sunset was beautiful and they even provided s’mores and wine! What more could you want? Highly recommend
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a cute place with everything you would need!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mason and Shelby's Tiny Home was the perfect place to start a honeymoon road trip from Seattle to L.A. It is a very clean home and the location and view couldn't be more peaceful (the hot tub and smores helped, too :-)). Would definitely recommend their space to tiny home aficionados or anyone looking for a quiet place to stay in southern Oregon."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little place was so incredible! It felt extremely cozy without feeling cramp or uncomfortable. The porch and hot tub were our favorite part- absolutely check out sunset if you can! The loft bed was totally fine for my husband and I and was very comfortable.

The hosts provide you with everything you need (plus a few nice surprises!) that we enjoyed so much. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the jacuzzi as it was very relaxing with a beautiful view. It was just a short drive into the main area of Grants Pass which had plenty of places for food. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little tiny home, Quiet, great views, very niceplqce to get away from it all!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had the exact time you’d imagine from pictures. It was peaceful, quiet, secluded. Was 1000% of what we had been looking for. Coffee while sitting on deck in mornings and sitting in the spa under the stars and moonlight at night. Thank you for sharing your magical tiny home with us!
Highly recommend !!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I chose this place for an anniversary get away. The space was super private. We didn’t see a single person which was great, we just wanted to be secluded for a weekend. Everything was just the way it was supposed to be so we didn’t have to ask for help. They even left us some treats for our stay. Wonderful!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mason and Shelby’s tiny home is awesome. Only thing would be a wish for more headroom for loft, for two we decided best route would be to sleep sideways so we weren’t crawling over each other. Besides that beautiful and well built tiny home, we’ll appointed with everything, love the jacuzzi - got in around 9 and just watched time pass with the stars. Love the amenities and quiet. Thank you!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an awesome stay at Mason and Shelby’s tiny home. It was easy to find and very peaceful. I was lucky with the weather to able to see a sunset like that in the pictures. The hosts are very kind and responsive. Just please note that the bed space is pretty small to fit in to. The bed was comfortable and slept well. The wine and s’mores kit were thoughtful welcome gestures!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy place! We really enjoyed the hot tub and enjoying a beverage on the deck. Very close to downtown and some fun restaurants!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re debating staying here, just do it! It’s perfect for the price! Yes it’s a tad small, but that’s the point. It has everything you need. The hot tub was what I was looking forward too! My bf loved the view! His 1 request was to find something secluded & that gave us that while still being close enough to things if needed. It was clean, well taken care of & details thought of! We didn’t get a chance to cook s’mores due to rain, but it meant so much that that was thought of with the stay. Anyways, 10/10!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this for one night last minute and our hosts were incredbly quick to respond and very accommodating. The tiny home was clean, cute and exactly as described. The hot tub right outside under the stars was the best part! The shower water pressure was grea and the bed was very comfy. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We initially booked to stay at their place closer to downtown but when we arrived, the hot tub was dirty, open and cold. They apologized profusely and explained there was a mix up with their cleaner. After a couple of messages they were able to move us to their Tiny Home and it was perfect, even better than the initial location and a beautiful place to stay.
So thankful for their clear communication and ensuring we had a lovely stay at the Tiny House 😌"

Would definitely stay here again when I’m passing thru. The hosts were also very responsive and helpful with my questions.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect end to a weekend getaway. I think we got lucky this place was available. We were questioning our hotel options and when this cozy tiny home popped up it was a no brainer. If you plan on enjoying the outdoors or being busy most of the day, this is a sweet little restful getaway for the price- clean, peaceful and only 10ish minutes from town. Definitely look forward to next time!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very responsive and super cute stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing!!!! No notes. Loved the hot tub. Loved the dvd selection. Loved the trees. Very cute space. Lots of cookware. They have since paved the driveway (a lot of reviews don’t reflect this, and it was easy to get up the hill. My only critique is that a lot of people say that the bed/loft is roomy, and I did not find it so. I felt cramped and thought of my partner (who is 6’) and how they would have hated that. Regardless, I will come back :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a cozy little home! I rested deeply after a long drive. This is my second location I've booked with Shelby and Mason. They are wonderful hosts and always got your back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the location and the views. A nice glass of wine in the hot tub looking at the mountains after a 12 hour work day is exactly why I booked this tiny home for my work trip!
Highly recommend. It is so quite and private and comes with everything you need. Hosts are responsive and you will feel at home immediately upon arrival.
Next time I travel solo for work again I plan to stay here again. This was like a mini vacation I needed and feel so refreshed! Such a great experience. My first tiny home stay and I'm hooked."

This is was our favorite weekend getaway so far and we'd be happy to come back again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mason and Shelby’s tiny home is truly special. The location is private and peaceful.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mason and Shelby’s place is just as described! If you’re wanting something “off-grid” but also close to restaurants and shops, this is the place to be!

The tiny home was so peaceful and homey that our dog was able to rest peacefully. :) We will definitely be returning to this tiny home anytime we are in the area. Thank you Mason and Shelby."

Not to mention how cozy the bed was. Thank you Mason and Shelby for such a unique stay will be booking again in the near future!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at the tiny house in-between our travels home! The property was great for our dog to run around and get his zoomies out (he even greeted their construction workers) and found a ball in the yard to play with! The hot tub was nice to soak in when we checked in to the property after a long drive, and we were able to utilize the gas fireplace outside as well to have a nice end of our night. Thank you guys for being great hosts! We will definitely be back since this is only 3 hours away from us on the coast."

They were really nice about us having to move our stay, and went above and beyond in leaving goodies for my girlfriend’s birthday. They really thought of everything! Hot tub ready to go, heat on, even water in the Keurig! When we had questions about some of the amenities, their responses were always quick and helpful. We will definitely be back! I am sure during other seasons it is beautiful in other ways! I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs, some really bad and some great, and this is the best one I’ve stayed in!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Guy has a beautiful and private listing that was quiet and comfortable.

If we are ever in the area again, this will without a doubt be our place to stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This unit is gorgeous. The room is beautiful and looks over a peaceful green back yard. The bathroom and shower were magnificent - even better than the description.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect location for an overnight stay on our road trip to the CA coast. The tastefully appointed suite was even nicer than expected with all the amenities we could have needed and Guy could not have been more accommodating. From the spacious size and comfy bed to the thoughtful snacks after a long day of travel and great coffee to enjoy with a light breakfast in cozy chairs, we couldn’t have asked for more. Our only regret was not having enough time to enjoy the gorgeous steam shower or outdoor fire pit. The bathroom truly is a work of art. Will definitely book again if we return to the area. Thank you Guy!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we were the first guests for this host and he did an amazing job. there were clear check in instructions. He even came out when we first got there to make sure everything was okay and if we needed anything.The bathroom was had a door connected to the main house but that was left locked and undisturbed from the host. Overall very happy with everything. ThNk you Guy!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The unit looks as advertised. My wife and I stayed there with our dog for two, 1 night stays when passing through the area.

This was the perfect location--the room was clean and looks as advertised in the photos, the AC unit worked well in the heat, and the water pressure in the shower was good. Parking was easy to find in front of the units as well as on the street next to them. One thing to note was that a lot of restaurants closed around 8pm to 9pm, so if you arrive later in the evening it may be tougher to find something to eat. Definitely would come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful house perfect for a family. Sometimes Airbnbs look like they've been thrown together by an IKEA catalogue, but this actually looked and felt like home- everything was pristine and comfortable. The yard was great for the kids to run around in. The beds were perfect- oh so comfortable. Rooms were perfect in size and comfort. Everything was perfectly clean and the neighborhood was quiet.
Everything is drive-able distance.
We also followed several of Tyler's recommendations and they did not disappoint!
Also, sometimes AirBnbs say, ""thanks for staying- now do 30 million things before you leave"". Tyler asked us to strip the beds, lock the doors, start a load of towels and dishes, take out the trash, and we're out. So nice not to have to do a million things before hauling our family out.
I would definitely recommend."

All in all, with our host’s tips and communication, it was a perfect mini-vacation, and we loved Grants Pass!"

Tyler was responsive, home was located near everything we needed (Grants Pass isn’t really a walking town-I expect most renters will have a vehicle)
Beds were great. Showers too. Only small thing I would suggest is how nice it would be to have a bbq available to use. Thanks Tyler! We will definitely look for this listing when we return!"

The backyard is so spacious and the perfect space for relaxing. We kept saying much we wished it was our home!
The location is great. The home is in a safe neighborhood and is close to grocery stores and restaurants.
Above all else, Tyler was the BEST host!! He was very responsive from the time of booking until we checked out. He was so nice and helpful with any questions we had.
I can’t recommend staying here enough! So do yourself a favor and book this Airbnb!"

What you see is what you get, our expectations were high based on photos shown on listing, house met all our expectations and then some! The overall vibe of the place was a home away from home! The entire house was spotlessly clean and we were able to make use of the well appointed kitchen to prepare all our meals and the dining table was a sufficient size and central to our gathering! We appreciated the open spaced layout of the house because it allowed us to talk to each other whether we were in the kitchen, the dining table or the sofa/sectional!
The bedrooms were cozy, the mattresses and pillows were so comfortable! I brought my own pillow but never brought it out of my car because the pillows in the room I slept in was the right height and feel! The bathrooms too were clean with great water pressure from the showers. If we were to return for another family reunion, we would definitely want to stay here again!"

We had 5 adults, 1 child, and 1 infant and we had plenty of space. The home looked exactly like the photos depicted and was super clean upon arrival. We cooked often at the house and it had all the appliances needed.
The backyard was great. Plenty of space to throw the ball around and the fire pit was great. The location was great! Plenty of grocery stores and restaurants nearby.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great Airbnb that felt very much like staying at a friend's house. Thoughtful amenities and great, quirky aesthetic. They have a very well-stocked kitchen and we appreciated the little bowl of snacks and caramels. This is also one of the cleanest Airbnb's I've stayed at, especially kitchen and bathroom - spotless."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house looks exactly like the pictures. Fun retro touches and a working record player. The home has lots of space, comfortable beds and plenty of towels. The kitchen was the best stocked of any Airbnb I’ve stayed at! T and Cameron were great hosts. We visit Grants Pass often and would be happy to stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, clean spot to crash during our roadtrip!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed in and also the CLEANEST! We had all the cookware and utensils necessary's to prepare our Thanksgiving dishes, board games to entertain us and a spare blanket in every room to keep us cozy. Everything was very well put together and easy to use. Not to mention the cheerful bright decor brought tremendous joy! Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is great! It is squeaky clean, and everything is as described. Beds were also clean and comfy. It is in a good location with everything close by."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy house to stay in, lots of amenities, great retro theme."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most personal and wonderful experience I've ever had at an Airbnb. I had mentioned to the hosts that I was getting married that weekend and needed a place to hang my dress. They not only double teamed to clean the space to allow for an early check in, they left me a hand written card and flowers to congratulate me! They were truly the best hosts I've ever had.
The space was fun and playful, comfortable beds and plenty of room. I would love to stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful little place to stay in Grants Pass. very colourful and we enjoyed our stay very much
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice place to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay. The home is very clean, comfortable, and super fun. The retro theme is done very well and the attention to detail is phenomenal. The location is close to I-5 yet quiet and peaceful. We were in town for a wedding so didn’t have time to explore but it was close to restaurants and coffee shops. We will definitely be staying here again if it’s available the next time we are in town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's such a cute place! I loved the look of it, and it was so well-appointed. The kitchen had almost everything you needed...could use a pot to brew tea :} The bathroom was small, but each bedroom had a chair and tables to set things on so that was not a problem. Everything worked well and the place was spotless. The beds were comfy except one was a bit on the hard side and I would recommend putting a cushioned mattress cover on it. It is in a quiet neighborhood and except for a few dogs barking periodically until 10 pm, it was very peaceful.
The owners were very communicative and sent messages to welcome us and make sure all was going well.
Thank you T and Cameron for a lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic stay in Grants Pass. This home is lovely with everything you could ask for. T was fantastic, communicative and accommodating. Would stay again for sure!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice quiet and calm place to stay at.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exceptional hosts and home, totally worth the stay. It’s such a thoughtful place! The bathroom size and configuration is awkward but doable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is definitely one you will want to book again! It was extremely clean, not a lot of clutter, and designed so very well. The location was perfect, and the backyard felt very peaceful. Pictures show you that it’s interior design is cute, but in person it’s even better. Book it now, you won’t regret it."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Stayed for a night with family. Place is bit small but had everything we need for a short stay. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice house in a quiet neighborhood. It matched the photos. We were very happy.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house! Love the retro vibe. Very clean and just as pictured.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We first stayed at T and Cameron’s place just one week ago along our roadtrip from Southern California to Canada.
This was the first AirBnB that we stayed in for this trip and we all loved it so much that we modified our plans to include a repeat stay during our drive home!
Clean, comfortable and thoughtfully equipped are just a few reasons why we returned and would definitely recommend this AirBnB to anyone staying in/near Grant’s Pass."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A True Gem!
T & Cameron’s place was exactly as described. Our family absolutely loved the Retro theme as well as how pristinely CLEAN and comfortable the home was!!
We have stayed in numerous AirB&Bs through the years and we have to say that hands down, this one of the most well thought-out homes we have visited. T & Cameron have anticipated every need for their guests.
An absolute 10/10!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Exactly as described! Very fun unique place, highly recommend if u visiting GP! Thank u for making us feel welcomed"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is sooo cute! I am obsessed with the retro theme. It’s 3 rooms are big, comfortable, and homey. I highly recommend this place if you’re staying in Grants Pass."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host did such a great job of thinking through every detail of this place. It was absolutely charming. we loved the vinyl record player and the whole retro vibe. They did a fantastic job with the decorating and design. the kitchen is very well equipped s
if you have kids, they will love it. there is a HUGE backyard for them to run around in and just a very fun vibe to the place. The kitchen is very well equipped.
I felt very lucky to have found it. We had a mix up in our hotel and needed just one night and it happened to be free. It was a refreshing break from being in a tiny hotel room."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. The hosts provided all the things just in case you forgot something. My kids loved the welcome treats.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely house with all the appliances we need. I'm very impressed by the colorful design of the exterior and the interior of the house. Spacious for a party of six. Convenient location for taking a rest on the way to the nearby national parks. The host is also super responsive. We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house and retro space. Close by to everything you would need in a quiet neighborhood. Would recommend if you are visiting Grants Pass.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute home
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful and clean house. I traveled with kids and they absolutely loved the treats the hosts had at the house.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very happy with the stay. Clean, colorful, fun place. Would stay again. Restored my faith in airbnbs."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is everything you could dream and more! It’s the perfect 70’s time capsule… perfect for our girls trip staycation! Will definitely be staying here again. The hosts are so kind and helpful. Loved everything about our time here.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"House is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean, all needed amenities are provided, easy checkin. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! The home was cute and funky, very well stocked with everything we could possibly need, and super convenient to buzz downtown or hop on the freeway. I will definitely see if their place is available the next time I come to visit GP!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tons of family time fun. Loved playing the board games!! Very clean.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful time at the Retro Getaway. Our hosts made the whole process easy and seamless. There were fresh flowers on the table and in the kitchen, which was so sweet to see when we walked in. Just as advertised in pictures and descriptions. Super cozy and inviting. We have never stayed in such a cool retro place before. This Airbnb quickly stood out to us because of how fun and unique it was. From the furnishings and finishes, to the record player and even the Werther’s hard candies in a crystal dish, to the retro cookbooks..each and every touch was so well designed and thought out to stay in the retro vibe. We enjoyed the games there and listened to lots of music on the record player. This home was fully equipped with everything our family needed during our stay and fun things like books and puzzles for the kids. Location was great, just a close walk or drive to downtown and nearby restaurants and in a nice area. We will be back for sure and highly recommend! 10/10!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"T & Cameron’s place is adorable, clean, and comfortable with all of the special touches that make it you feel right at home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Super cute place and very comfortable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. It was very comfortable. We will definitely book this spot again if we head this way in the future.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time here! The house is nicely renovated, comfy beds, and a well stocked kitchen. T and Cam have added small amenities that many other homes don’t have. It’s close to many different restaurants and some within walking distance. There’s even a park down the street. Walking in the neighborhood is fun with all the vintage homes around. Thank you for a great experience!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,really fun and Thomas was very sweet!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a MUST stay! The hosts here literally thought of everything from the built in speakers throughout the house to the game room to the hot tub mini golf basketball court you name it they had it ! I absolutely loved my stay here and would stay here again ! 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb has it all! There are activities for everyone of all ages and liking. We only stayed on night for a somewhat local “staycation” 2 hours from our home and we will definitely be back regularly! We traveled with a 2 year old and infant and it was perfectly set up! The home is thoughtfully furnished, the hosts are friendly, and the activities are endless! You won’t regret staying here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute place with lots to do for the kids! They loved it and had so much fun! The house was clean and cozy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thomas’s place was fantastic! We drove down to Southern California with our three kiddos (1, 2, and 6 years old) and on our way back wanted to get a place for our kids to run around and have fun - this was that place! Well worth the stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one night on our move up to WA! It was very cozy and unique. It was a little dirty, and the kitchen was a little under stocked, but overall still totally livable. Thank you for a fun, comfortable stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED this place, originally booked one night & had to get it for the next day as well because it was that much fun!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home lovely neighborhood the frogs are my favorite
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this villa! It has been the best Airbnb experience I have had so far. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and colleagues at work. The villa is simply magnificent.
Looking forward to staying here again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fun place! Lots of things to do on the property. It was clean and as described. Not super ideal for kids who need dark/quiet to sleep.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunately some of the games did not work in the arcade which is the main reason why we booked. The basketball hoop in the arcade was broken, the air hockey didn’t properly work, and the fuse table was super wobbly also. Couldn’t access the internet in the game room either. The switch controllers were also not charged. Overall I think the location looks cute but needs massive upgrades and upkeep. Place was clean, cute, and overall has a lot of potential."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect for kids of all ages and they had so much to do while I remotely worked. We were visiting family and needed some more space for ourselves and the space was perfect for the four of us. Check-in was easy and it was such a fun place to play in the game room, outside in the front and backyard. We will definitely book again since we have to go to Grants Pass often."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was so beautiful and perfect! Thank you so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little place! My kids were wiped out after a fun weekend here. We visited family that lived down the street and it was a perfect location. We didn't have to entertain the kids as the house was a paradise of fun! This will be our go to from now on when visiting family. Nicely appointed interiors. Had everything we needed. Great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay - I recommend
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute house and so much to do! Loved being able to hangout in the game room and then end the night relaxing in the hot tub. Perfect place for a relaxing getaway!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,10/10 we’d stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There was so much to do and we were never bored! The whole little house is adorable and perfect for a night in!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great placw to celebrate our son's 10th birthday! Clean, fun, easy."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host and super cute Airbnb. The host was super responsive and helpful with communication. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying. And we love it. very accommodating and a great place if you just want to stay in. plenty too for the whole family. we look forward to staying again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot and host.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. The kids had so much fun! Would definitely stay here again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a fun place to stay for both kids and adults! The location of this house was ideal for a homey stay while passing through grants pass. My kids loved all the activities it had to offer. We will definitely be coming back again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Probably the most unique Airbnb we've ever stayed at. We visit the area a lot to visit out friends and family and it was nice to have a place to ourselves! The arcade was awesome and we had a lot of fun playing foos ball as we haven't played it in years. The hottub was nice to have as well and was a very relaxing end to a long weekend. This is going to become our go to place for when we are in the area from here on out!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Game room was an obvious winner with the kids
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and easily accessible space! Thomas was very responsive and had easy check out instructions.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,It rained during our stay but we still had so much fun playing games indoors (especially my 10 year old) and watching movies by the fireplace. Cute home!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,I would consider booking again!! Great place with inviting atmosphere and amazing entertainment options with game room!!! Great Hot Tub too!! Thank you
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed at a property in grants pass. It was epic! The games room was so much fun and the hot tub was lovely. The place is small like the description says but you don’t feel on top of each other. There are TWO bedrooms plus the upper den I thought there was only one so that was a great extra surprise. Would totally recommend for a friends trip or trip with the family (like we did). The games room can be cold so bring extra layers. There isn’t much to do in grants pass but we were there for the airbnb itself rather than the location!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, I give this home a 10 out of 10."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a great place to stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"awesome place, it has everything and more. the hosts are very responsive. My kids will remember staying there forever because they had so much fun. highly recommended."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! We will definitely be back. Everyone had a place to be and something to do, even our dogs! Our 6 year old loved the arcade and the playground. We watched a Christmas movie outside around the fire and even though it was cold, the fire pit did a great job keeping us warm. The hot tub was large and very clean. The house is also adorable and felt very spacious. Even though it was cold we still enjoyed playing basketball and mini golf. We will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ran into a few hiccups due to previous guest but Ryan was on it! He was proactive in making sure the hot tub was up and running for us and was very communicative. The place was exactly what I had in mind and we really enjoyed our stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful tiny house with all the amenities. Check in was easy and we found the property just as pictured in the listing. Wonderful stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home has bright glowing energy! It’s giving all the warm & cozy memory vibes. The game room offered up hours of pure joy and laughter for the whole family. The interior of the home is warm and welcoming, we were especially fond of the huge island in the Kitchen! The esthetic of the house could use a few upgrades, but it seems appropriate for a family vacay. I personally would have enjoyed a nice area rug and upgraded cooking pans and utensils. The interior gives IKEA kinda vibes but it’s just fine for a family trip. If you’re a holistic foodie and are trying to avoid PFAS I recommend bringing your own stuff. Moving on to the exterior of the abode, the patio space was by far our favorite spot of the property. Really thoughtfully done. Whoever did the concrete and landscape, Bravo! Loved the gas fire pit, putting green, B-ball, and the hot tub was the cherry on top! Really can’t stop bragging about this place! We absolutely will be back next time we’re in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a little gem! Perfect place for our kids to unwind. The house was adorable and plenty of space inside. The outdoor area was a lot of fun but the game room was over the top in the best way, a sweet gathering place for our family. We found that it was well equipped with everything we needed for our stay.
It is in a nice neighborhood and a beautiful town."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing, we were comfortable and had a great time"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for a fun place for my daughter’s bday sleepover! Awesome set up and thoughtful home!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So much to do in this cozy place! The hot tub was perfect and it was so fun playing all the arcade games! Perfect little get away with our dogs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the Best air bnb I have ever stayed at! My Family and I Loved everything about this house ! the game room, the hot tub and especially the yard. It's most definitely the best place we've ever stayed at ! and Thomas was always responsive when I needed him. We will most definitely stay here again !"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of five had a wonderful stay and the kids were in heaven with the game room and hot tub. Hot tub seemed very clean and was placed in the perfect location being able to view the outdoor tv/fire pit from it.The game room was amazing and the reason for staying. Location was good neighborhood and easy access to many things. Just know that many of the games didn’t fully work (such as basketball game and air hockey). And steering wheel on the race car game was broken off. The golf area was unusable when we stayed due to the over abundance of squished plums on the green (from tree in yard)… which also might explain the sticky floors in both the house and game room. Bathroom door was broken and unable to shut all the way. And bathroom faucet was loose/leaked, but bathroom/shower was clean. Bed in 2nd room was placed rather high off ground and was hard for our young boys to get in and out (would guess hard for elderly also). Overall, we do recommend this stay and plan on returning!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing experience we live right here and town but needed a different scene and some peace a n quite and this provided just that! Along with some stay in family fun! We definitely will be coming back and having outta town family and friends stay ❤️
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My Wife and I stayed here for the first 3 days of our 10 day honeymoon in Oregon. Thomas’s instructions were clear and easy to understand to get into the Home. I’d say we got out of it what we hoped for. We had a few issues during our stay but we brought them to Thomas’s attention and he said we would get them corrected immediately. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and the views of the mountains all around you are absolutely gorgeous! The only thing that would make this Bnb better is if it were more secluded. It’s also only a few hours from Crater lake which is absolutely gorgeous! There is a Walmart and other known grocery stores inside of Grants pass which is also extremely convenient.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the coolest house that we’ve stayed at. Our children love the outside area, including the miniature golf, basketball court and absolutely fell in love with the garage/game room.
I look forward to staying here again, or at another one of the hosts listings as they all look very cool, modern and well kept with tons of amenities"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of five drove all the way from central Illinois just to stay at this house! We fell in love with the pictures and knew it would be perfect for our little ones to appreciate too. Needless to say. It was BEYOND perfect. We spent all day playing and making memories. Thank you so much for having us!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a wonderful house and backyard was very peaceful. The house was clean and I would recommend it to my friends and family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Had such a great time! Kids really loved all the amenities this place had to offer. Very friendly host and would absolutely stay there again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed Thomas' place!!! We were traveling with three children (3,7, and 8) and they absolutely loved the game room, the mini golf, and cornhole.
Fantastic and unique use of the small spaces."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a sweet spot! This place is really well designed for fun - certainly with all the fun games and amenities, but even in the little touches, like the large doors that open to the outside and the speakers positioned throughout the house. It makes a great getaway for both kids and adults. We just went with another couple, our good friends, and had a great time unwinding here.
We found the house to be very clean and well designed. Beds and couches and such were very comfortable. The property is set in a nice and peaceful neighborhood, with neighbors that we were really friendly when they walked by, or we walked by them. There were a handful of spots you could walk to quickly (15 mins) and many more in the nearby downtown area. Grants Pass provided plenty by way of good views, good food, and good excursions.
In short, we had an awesome stay and hope to return sometime!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I loved everything about our stay; from the modern interior to all of the fun and well thought out amenities the place has to offer. The house is very well kept and clean. We had a lot of fun from all of the games the backyard had to offer and those inside the 2nd half of the house.
I couldn't help but take pictures and share our stay with others interested in something totally different! The plum tree had some amazing fruit on it during our visit, which was a really nice touch.
I highly recommend checking it out. It really is just as cool as the pictures 😁"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the coolest air bnb I have ever stayed in, and family friendly! Has an amazing game room with unlimited game play. There is even a playground, mini golf, and a side yard for a pet."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had never been to Grants Pass and Thomas's house made that an even better experience. This was the funnest and cutest house we've ever stayed at. It had all the amenities we needed and the hot tub was an awesome bonus. The yard was super private and so relaxing. We would love to come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at this house! We drove down south for the jet boats and then had a wonderful evening playing games and lots of activities for the kids to do. Very enjoyable and would stay again.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip without our daughter and it was the perfect place to book! Even though we didn’t bring any kids along my boyfriend and I had a blast! The game room and outside was where we spent most of the time (: thank you Thomas and family for opening up your air bnb, we definitely hope to be back again soon, even with a 7 1/2 hour drive🥰"
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, lots to do! we had a great time, however, we had to clean the bathroom, game room, and kitchen appliances more thoroughly upon arrival due to stickiness and stains and old food. We did look around for a book/binder with instructions for the hot tub and grill and cleaning instructions but found nothing and had very little information on how to leave the place when checking out. The gas for the grill was very difficult to get going and never got above 350 and one side didn't work at all. This place is great for a short stay but we wished the maintenance and cleanliness was more thorough."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall my family’s stay was pleasant and comfortable. This location is private and plenty to do. The game room was a nice bonus just wished the fan up top would of been working as well as the small ac unit. We appreciated the local wine and popcorn! The AC in the house was ice cold which was nice especially on a 105 degree day! Plenty of bedding and towels.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great, our 6 year old was in heaven. So many fun things to do and a great little place. So well thought out. Thanks for having us!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, beautifully appointed. My 14 year old boys loved the hot tub and game room and we enjoyed all the great activities and sitting areas on the property. Laundry room was such a bonus. Loft area was a bit tight for teens, but would be great for smaller kids. A/C was perfect but bedrooms got a little warm so we kept the bedroom doors open and were all comfortable. A couple of non essential items were broken the owner wasn't aware of, but nothing that made our stay anything but great! My only criticism was that the kitchen was missing some essentials such as sharp knives and a large skillet and pot. There were spices and some cooking items but many were empty. Overall I would give our stay a 10/10! Honestly the cutest, most entertaining rental ever. If available, book it!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very nice stay and appreciated Thomas's communication and flexibility with allowing us to check out a little later (as we had time between the 11 AM checkout and our flight later in the day in Medford, and it was HOT outside!). The property is well set up for young kids, my girls really enjoyed the swings and the games in the garage."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thomas’ place was exactly how it was described and our kids had a great time playing all of the games available. It was a great family stay and lived up to what we were expecting. We would definitely stay again should we pass through this area in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place. Love the concrete wall and all the special touches put in this house! Would most definitely stay again if in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our Grant Pass stay was to date, one of our favourite Airbnb stays. We literally had to drag the kids from the property as they did not want to leave. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a good time at Mason and Shelby’s place for our one night in Grant’s Pass. We did everything (except basketball because that’s where you park)… golf, corn hole and especially the game room. My kids loved it! We were there on a hot day and we couldn’t get the big fan to work, but it was nice to be able to open the garage door to get the air blowing through."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of 5 had a fantastic time! The house has been remodeled beautifully and the hosts thought of every detail for the perfect family getaway. We loved the game room complete with surround sound and Wii system, and the outdoor fire table with TV was perfect for movie nights and s’mores. The basketball court and play structure were great for our kids and their varied ages. Even our lab enjoyed his first AirBNB stay to the fullest thanks to the well maintained dog run and pet friendly policy. The house was in a quiet, family friendly neighborhood and was just a short drive to downtown. The home was well stocked with amenities and the hosts were very responsive. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place was great. some of our group already have plans to come back. it was very clean and comfortable. the outdoor space is amazing. lots to do and would be great with kids. a shot drive to town. definitely recommend

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great way to break up a long drive! This was the perfect place to unwind and have a little fun for the night! Definite recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful and wonderful sanctuary for a mom of three boys. Plenty of space and things to do for 100% quality time (or if brothers irritated each other and need a little space to do what makes them happy)
For me. .. I couldn't have asked for better resources to make memories with my mini men!
We stayed for 3 nights, had an amazing dinner at Taqueria Mexico. A Hellgate Dinner Jetboat Excursion the next day. We also found a cute creak to swim in. All the mini golf, hot tubing and games a person could want the rest of the time.
Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a different kind of place to stay especially with kids. Our kids are all under 6 and they had fun but a bit older would have been able to use more of the great toys. It’s small but
accommodate a surprising number of people if you’re familiar."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful time we had! Shelby and mason were amazing hosts! We made memories here we will cherish forever
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home! We had so much fun with all the games! Limited kitchen space but still managed to cook a decent meal. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lots of fun for our kids! Was such a wonderful way to give the kids a break on our travel down I5. They played for hours outside in the yard and we had a nice dinner outside on the patio. The inside was clean and cute. Would recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, other than disgusting hot tub. We would definitely stay again though!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place! Our family came from out of town, so we had dinner all together and played the games. Then the oldest cousins stayed the night. A good time was had by all 😁 and our graduates give a two thumbs up 👍🏼👍🏼"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect house for having fun and relaxing. It is a very well-remodeled tiny home, and we felt so welcomed and comfortable. The kids LOVED the play room and basketball court. The hot tub was also lovely after long days at the softball fields.
We can’t wait to come back to stay again soon!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Took my family for a stay in southern Oregon and found mason and Shelby’s airbnb and it was a stay to remember highly recommend it to everybody with a little family! ☺️
Thanks again Mason and Shelby!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little villa has EVERYTHING. It’s got tons of space, lots of things to do. The furniture and decorations are beautiful, the mini golf/ putting range is loads of fun, same as the very sturdy corn hole set. The hot tub and fire pit were just what we needed for a relaxing night; and the bed was so comfortable. The kitchen was small but super functional, and had lots of extras. As for the game room it went above and beyond my expectations. Loved the arcade style games and swinging chairs.
Personally I really loved the cleanliness of the space, and the provided cleaning supplies. It was a pleasant bonus.
Can’t wait to come back :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house had so many fun things to do, you wouldn’t even have to leave the house. Great family fun and a very clean place."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was a nice place to stay, the games were fun! However, the game room was dusty, and the floor had a lot of dirt. We also found some cigarette butts outside on the ground. Finally, while it does say that it sleeps 6, in reality, it's just 4 adults and 2 kids. The loft is very small, and only kids fit there. Overall, though, it is a great place to stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We used Mason and Shelby’s home for our out of town wedding guest and it couldn’t of been more perfect! Everyone loved loved the house! It was a perfect place to gather with our family and friends. We now have so many memories thanks to this Airbnb! Mason responded within minutes if I had any questions! Can’t recommend enough!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had such a fun time at Mason and Shelby’s. It’s an awesome place to turn your brain off and relax. The game room was so fun and the hot tub amazing!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a fun stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came up on Easter Sunday and stayed through Thursday night. I can honestly say we were never bored. We spent all of Monday at the house playing games inside and out as well as relaxing in the hot tub. Then we ventured out the other days, but came back each day and continued our fun at the home. Overall it was a great trip full of memories made by the whole family and lots of laughter too. We would highly recommend this home to any family looking for a great place, and given the chance we will most definitely be back again!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! kids loved the Arcade room and the outside play area! It was a perfect location to drive and explore the Redwoods and enjoy Crescent City for the day! it was only a 1.5 hour drive! Seemed way quicker coming back.
The area was quiet and relaxing. the hottub was perfect. The inside of the house was well out together definitely could tell alot of love went into this house! Definitely will be back to stay!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun stay with the kids!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great experience! We have three kiddos 16, 14 & 6 and they were so active playing around while dad & I lived our best lives in the hot tub"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great for 2 adults and 3 kiddos! The backyard was wonderful for kids to run around and we enjoyed a very relaxing dip in the hot tub. And we loved the super cool arcade attached to the house.
The lofted bed is not easy to get up and down on, so keep that in mind when traveling with young kiddos or older adults. The upstairs space is mostly just for kids, with two small mattresses and sleeping bags. The kids loved it!
The kitchen is great for cooking basic meals, but the space and bakeware is limited so plan ahead. The oven is a half oven too as the space is definitely tight. But they have lots of dishes and a dishwasher which was handy!
All around it was a great experience and I highly recommend if you are in southern Oregon to explore. Lots of great hiking and outdoor areas not too far!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place & fun for the kiddos! It's definitely a place we'd stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely the coolest place we’ve stayed at. Everything was amazing and anytime we ever visit the area again we will book a house through these hosts. Awesome experience.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was amazing! The place was beautiful! The game room was so easy to figure out and all the games were free to play, tons of fun!

The hosts were extremely responsive and helpful when we had questions! Overall a 10/10, we will stay again!"

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with lots to do.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolute blast! This was the perfect getaway. The first night I treated my 13 year old to a night with a few girlfriends, and the second night, we did just our family. Although we only live about 30 minutes away, this was one of our favorite/easiest vacations we've ever taken. The home WAS the destination. The little kids LOVED the loft and the game room and all the outdoor activities - even fun in the snow! Mom and dad loved having our own bedroom with a separate entry. We of course enjoyed the hot tub and the fire pit, and schooled our children at Mario Kart. The home itself was updated and modern. There were plenty of TV's, storage space, and kitchen necessities, although we ordered pizza one night and mainly just snacked! We were on vacation of course. Thanks again for a really memorable stay. Can't wait to come back!"

Although the house isn’t big the layout of everything still made it feel spacious! I couldn’t have asked for a better first airbnb experience."

After checking in, we wished we could’ve stayed longer and made many comments about coming back. The house and property was an absolute dream to stay in! The amenities and activities made us never want to leave. The kids absolutely loved the game room, the hot tub was the perfect temp, the outside fireplace with TV was a total hit, and the home was so clean and cozy.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I never knew a ""little house"" could be so spacious!!
What a beautiful place Mason and Shelby have created... they have thought of everything, and it is such an inviting space! It was just my husband and myself, and we didn't take advantage of all of the outdoor activities, but what a fun place it would be if we had time to do that!
We loved our short stay, and will be sure to come back on another trip back up to see our kids in Washington!
A really special and creative touch was the photo book that they created to share all of their favorite hikes and beautiful places in the area!
They truly have thought of everything to make your stay extra special!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home situated in a neighborhood close to shops and restaurants. Owners have carefully thought about everything down to the smallest detail - like an ipad to play music - to make your getaway enjoyable. There is literally something for everyone. The home is small but with the layout and the large outdoor space, we never felt cramped. There was plenty of room for everyone. Don't hesitate to book, you'll love it and so will your kids - teenagers too."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Communicative and understanding hosts, cool play area outdoors!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best stay we could have imagined! It was peaceful, fun and relaxing! Starting with the outside, there's so many fun activities for a couple, family, or coworkers! And it really is as beautiful as the listing describes! With the mini golf, corn hole, fire pit, game room, and hot tub you really don't need much else! There's also a market within walking distance if you needed anything, and food is only 10 minutes out! This was the best airbnb we have stayed at yet and highly reccomend it to anyone who's interested! It was definitely worth it and everything we needed! The amazing hosts communication throughout this whole process was the icing on the cake, such a sweet couple! We'll be staying again soon for sure!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ok, this place is an absolute GEM in every single way! The location is SUPER PRIME. We have 4 children, and they are asking...can we rent this home again tomorrow??

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my favorite places to stay for a weekend in grants pass. The yard is pristine for my dog to play in but it is also a comfort and a relief to be able to see him from the inside of the house. Such a comfy space with a Birds Eye view of the whole bnb from the inside. Also, great kitchen amenities! They’ve added a bigger freezer space!
Can’t wait for the next trip!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy small spot, good overnight on a long roadtrip. It was nice that it was off the main street and tucked away!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place Thomas has. Clean, comfortable bed, everything you need for a quick stay. Would stay here again"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stop for the night! The fireplace was a nice touch:) The parking spots provided are a tad small. My boyfriend and I have a truck and a SUV and we were definitely hanging out into the ally a little bit. Didnt seem to be a busy alleyway though. Only recommendation would be for some curtains on the windows by the bed. Gets a little bright through the blinds. Overall great little spot:)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Cute, quiet, clean and cost way less than a hotel. Coffee and popcorn was a nice touch and appreciated."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The bed was definitely a full sized bed and it was a bit firm, but very clean and updated and the instructions to get there and get inside were very helpful. Would stay again"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This unit was perfect for me, my husband, and our two dogs. The fenced in yard was absolutely nice to have. Also, the space was well put together and clean. I would definitely recommend it."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay! The place was well decorated and I liked having a private court yard. My husband really liked the shower head, and I liked that there were lots of streaming services to choose from. Our host Thomas was friendly and responsive, good value for our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great. There was a booking mix up on Easter Sunday and the host stayed in touch with myself and AirBnB customer service to remedy the issue. Nice clean cozy lil spot right in downtown close to places to get a drink and have a meal.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is not The host fault by any means. But I thought I got this room for 75$ a night. Oooops not true. I booked it for a second night out of necessity. This place is a nice location in downtown to all the bars. Private parking and discreet location. Problem is that this unit shares a wall. And the guest on the other side had unruly children that started yelling at each other @ 7:30 am. After not hearing an adult attempt to suppress their children’s actions I messaged the goats who must have taken care of it because the family left and I have not heard them since. I was happy with the 150+ night fee when I thought I had booked two nights. Not so happy when I realized I had only booked it for one night and had already been out drinking and was in no condition to drive anywhere. This is a 75$ a night unit if you ask me. Loud kids or not.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay in Grants Pass. Lots of walkable restaurants.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to crash for the night, very comfy bed and cozy little space!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Convenient location! Very cute little place with a yard. It was perfect for our travels!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely little place for me and my little dog. It has a big yard with turf. A designated parking place right next to the entry to yard, easy to get in. I especially appreciated the automatic light that came on when I rounded the corner to the door at night, making it easy for me to get up the few stairs and see the keypad and open the door. It was cozy and warm and clean, with good natural light. The shower was hot and had good water pressure. I needed to extend my stay a few times and the host was always prompt, accommodating and thoughtful. The location is perfect and just blocks away from a lot of good restaurants with shopping nearby as well. I will be staying here again."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"it's a neat little place, and works well for me and my pup."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The area is very private and enjoyed the beautiful patio area. It was a great place to go to after a long day of work.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patio had some astroturf recently installed thats not in the photos. Perfect for small pets. Nice shower. Ample mood lighting and electric fireplace. Super cozy and warm. The bed sinks severely because of a cheap bedframe. It affected my sleep quality.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was like coming home! Super cozy spot with everything you need. Very clean and the host was extremely responsive. The enclosed patio was perfect for the two doggos I had with me. I did feel a little on edge (being alone/female)
parking and entering through an alley way at night, but luckily it's pretty well lit and I felt safe that the door had a bolt lock."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place within walking distance to lots of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. Has a big private backyard to retreat to after a long day. Place is a studio which worked well for me, traveling alone for work, didn’t need too much else. I appreciated the coffee maker and the smart tv connected to the basic streaming services.
I would stay again.
Cheers"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very pleased with our stay. So very cozy and warm. Perfect for a weekend getaway. Dog had a lot of room for play. Relatively quiet part of town and felt private and very safe. The stove is a little tricky to figure out and the freezer compartment of mini fridge may need to be defrosted soon. Otherwise, extremely happy to have these amenities. The host is very hospitable and available when questions or concerns arise. Even has a periodic table of elements available next to the clothing rack. Will be staying again :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,👍🏻👍🏻

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is convenient to downtown Grants Pass shopping and venues. It was quiet, cute and clean inside, but lacks an indoor small table and chairs. There’s outdoor dining if the weather permits. The host is responsive. I recommend it for one or two persons wanting a short-term place close to downtown where they can cook their own meals."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a comfortable stay and everything was in walking distance. Whenever I go back, I'm definitely going to consider staying there again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thomas’s place was very sweet and clean. A but small, but just fine for my sister and I for 2 nights. Everything was as pictured and the yard was great for hanging out or if you bring a 4 legged friend."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed for 5 nights at this lovely Airbnb in Grants Pass, Oregon. The space, though small, was charming and exuded careful attention to detail which I greatly appreciated. The only hiccup during my stay was the occasional WiFi issue. I would have loved to use the backyard, but the rain deterred me. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back during clearer skies to fully enjoy the outdoor space. Highly recommended!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice little place right in the downtownarea.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is an adorable space :) and a beautiful fire place! Well stocked kitchen. Responsive host when I couldn’t find the towels 😅 cute outdoor space for summer nights! And east check in. AC that you can control for a perfect temp! Great location close to downtown Grants Pass. Wasn’t loud. GPS brings you to the front of the house but host provides adequate instructions to find where you need to park.
In my opinion- bed is a too firm."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was perfect for a good nights sleep. I was driving from Portland to LA and needed a spot for the night. I especially loved that there was a kitchen/stove top so I could cook my own dinner. The place was squeaky clean and Thomas was super responsive when I had a question. I booked at 2:30pm and checked in just after 4pm. I left at 6am so I can’t say much about the neighborhood, but from what I saw it was really calm and friendly."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and peaceful stay! The yard was so perfect for my pup and really put us at ease on our long road trip.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My recent stay at this small studio on Airbnb was an absolute delight! Despite its compact size, the studio was cleverly designed and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. The fully fenced outdoor space was a fantastic bonus when traveling with a pet.
The ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect retreat after a day of exploring the area.
The hosts were also incredibly attentive and provided all info for a easy self serve check in. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and would gladly return to this charming little oasis for future trips! Highly recommended!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved how cozy this studio was and that it had a small fully functional kitchen that was perfect for the space.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb and it was positive. As a woman traveling alone this trip-I felt safe, “stuff” I needed was supplied and I liked the parking. The hosts responded almost immediately when I had a question. Thank you Mason and Shelby for this experience."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Immaculate, perfect spot for a quick rest on our road trip. A little expensive for the size and location, but it was spotless and comfy. If you just want a place to rest- this is it. Just small enough that we didn’t feel the need to linger, but we did not feel crammed by any means. It had everything we needed, and not sure I’d change a thing!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a perfect place for one or two people! There is a nice private yard with outdoor furniture, which seems like a great place to relax and enjoy the evenings, or to enjoy your morning coffee."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Solid location in Grants Pass. Easy to find, safe neighborhood, and relatively quiet. It certainly got noisier closer to morning, but nights were silent.
The space itself was clean but lacked a level of polish and thoughtfulness which makes me wish I had booked a hotel instead. The bath mat was wet on arrival, and the towels were small and rough. There was also a window on top of the front door that I would like to be able to cover because it looks directly into the bathroom. The space was small but I’d say they’ve done enough to make it feel cozy, but there were certain things like the towels and an uncomfy bed that took away from the stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect stop on our road trip from Sacramento to Seattle! Great location, very easy to find, the hosts were communicative and welcoming. Overall a very cozy and private space. Would definitely visit again!"

I was only one person and the space was just what I needed. I enjoyed my stay in Grants Pass."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,it was a wonderful place to stab for just me my boyfriend and our dog completely fenced in so she was safe to be off leash. with the nice seating outside and the fire place it as really great and a good area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was perfect for the two of us. We had to work a few days so we used the WiFi and Kureg to their fullest potential. The yard was nice to relax in and all the restaurants were walkable. We love Grants Pass and Mason & Shelby’s little place. Thank you and hope to come back again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and space!
This was a working vacation for me and the space was perfect for that. The unit is well laid out and comfortable. Very clean and well-maintained- you can tell a lot of thought went into designing the studio. Having stayed in hotels in the area many times, we felt this was by far a better value than any of them.
For working from the space- The Wifi supported Zoom calls without issue and the area is quiet during the day. There are plenty of outlets too.
For personal time- The outdoor area is great for lounging or dining. The location makes walking to the farmers market and most of the downtown area easy.
The hosts are wonderful. We needed to extend our stay and they were quick and kind about it.
All around a great stay!! We will book again!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place for quick stays in grants pass, great location and has everything you need!
Mason and Shelby are very nice!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I loved our stay here! We hadn’t realized how close we were to another apartment, but we still felt like we had our own space to enjoy.
Our intention was to spend more time out and about and less time in the apartment, so this served our needs perfectly."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot for a night passing through Grants Pass. Small studio, well stocked with easy parking and seamless checkin. Only note is if you’re not alone there is limited privacy in bathroom due to the sliding barn door that stays just slightly a jar."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was amazed how fast they responded when we were lost. We were so tired and they helped us so fast. The shower was AMAZING and we slept like babies!

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and tidy, but it felt like living in a shoebox. You couldn’t even bend over on the bathroom. Stove was wonky and non-functional, which was a real bummer since I brought food to cook."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location and very clean. Easy check-in with clear instructions and the hosts were very responsive and graciously allowed a later check-out. Coffee and basic amenities are provided. It's a great little spot. The only downside and reason I would not rebook is the very uncomfortable bed with squeaky frame, only two cheap feeling pillows, and minimal bedding given it's winter (no comforter, only a thin quilt in combination with a lack of flannel or warmer winter sheets). There were two extra blankets and another quilt so thankfully it was warm enough with both heaters going."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Small studio room with basic bathroom and bed. Good for a short layover.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy little spot with everything ya need close enough to town to walk to all conveniences such as restaurants and stores. Huge high-fenced yard for privacy and dog containment. The area around it was great for walking the dog too and had more of a neighborhood feel that was quiet at night. Extremely clean bathroom, very comfortable bed, and cool electric fire place! Will definitely consider this place again when visiting GP!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mason and Shelby are very gracious, the unit is nice and the backyard area charming. The only problem we had was our big truck did not fit the parking space"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mason and Shelby were awesome! Awesome communication and seem genuinely interested in making their airbnb as awesome a possible! The place was small but very cute-- the backyard was amazing-- i would definitely back here in the summer to hang out in thag backyard. It was the best outdoor situation ive had with an airbnb for my pup!

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so stinking cute! Perfect for the trip. I needed somewhere in town - close to the hospital. It was everything I really needed. The little kitchen area is perfect- waterfall shower is amazingly hot and the courtyard is great. The design of the studio and the fireplace is amazing for ambience- fair warning it does not actually provide heat but the hosts do also provide a heater! You do share a wall with another Airbnb (I believe?) and the guests next to me were incredibly noisy the second night-
It seriously sounded like they were wrestling and slamming into the walls. Thankfully I had earplugs and that’s really not something you can control with Airbnb so I was understanding. The bed would be my only serious comment. Not really that comfortable. For the price and the location- I really appreciated the space and the opportunity to be close to where I needed to be! A great space for a great price ❤️"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Great location.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cute and cozy. super responsive hosts when I needed them. A+
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mason and Shelby were so amazing to communicate with. Their Airbnb was so cozy and clean and so close to many restaurants. One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever booked!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our cozy stay at Mason and Shelby’s studio. It was nice to have private parking and be such a short walking distance to shops.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sweet little cottage with private, fenced area. Super clean, as pictured, smells wonderful, and cozy with the electric fireplace. Full tv app selections was terrific for watching from bed in the chilly evenings. Perfect for 1 or 2. It was a little cramped with our two dogs, but would have been perfect for just the two of us. The private patio area and side yard was excellent for the doggies. Dutch Bros coffee pods and flavored creamers was a bonus!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, second time staying there and it was just as good as the last time!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're going back and forth between this place and another....BOOK THIS ONE! This was such a warm, cozy stay for a night on my way to San Diego from northern Washington (I'm a travel nurse)....I stay in these very often and I learn what makes for a good air bnb. This one, is a good one. Probably one of the best ones I have ever stayed in. The shower was amazing, the pressure and size of the shower was perfect. The glass fireplace honestly made my stay. It changes colors, heat settings and speeds. I had some wine with this going and it was perfect after a long day of driving. The bed is very comfortable. The outside area is very spacious and cozy with the string lights and waterfall. I did have some trouble finding the place in the dark but Mason called me right away and answered my questions. A very nice keurig/coffee pot was provided as well as kcups from a local coffee shop. I really appreciated this because you would be surprised how many air bnbs don't even provide coffee or a coffee maker. 10/10 recommend this place. Thanks for allowing me to stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"5 Stars across the board! location is perfect, communication was great, and the vibe of the space was exactly as described and pictured in the listing. One bonus feature we found upon arrival was the storage space under the bed. We were worried about having our bags lying all over the floor but the bed is on a metal frame that allows for total storage underneath it. We would definitely stay again if the opportunity presents itself!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had an excellent time at mason & shelbys place. They provide a great experience and a safe place to stay. So cozy and the perfect little getaway!

Great patio with a little water feature. The only reason I don’t get five stars is we had some problems with some neighborhood teenagers but that’s not the house fault at all it’s a nice place to stay in good value for your money"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute little couples get away, stay cation, or a night off the road. Easy check-in, clean, cozy, and relaxing stay. has all the basics to stay in and cook or to store leftovers after exploring the local scene. Great water pressure in the shower.

We especially loved the patio space and wished we had more time to spend out there! The town of Grants Pass exceeded our expectations. Everyone we interacted with was the absolute sweetest!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The sweetest little studio and the perfect place to land for such a short visit. Equally clean+practical and adorable+welcoming.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mason and Shelby's place was clean, cute and very well located - close to downtown shops and dining. We had a very nice stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mason and Shelby’s space was small but very thoughtfully designed and put together. It was super comfortable and had everything we needed for our (unfortunately) short stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mason and Shelby were the best host I have ever stayed with. Our stay was nothing but perfect and I cannot wait to stay again! House was clean and easy to fine. Everything was there that one would need. Thank you!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and very comfortable and clean. I would stay here again

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mason and Shelby were very accommodating and the space was a wonderful place to stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Grateful to Mason and Shelby for being accommodating, and providing me with a lovely, clean space! I wish I could have stayed longer!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay!! We came into town for a wedding and it was so perfect. Our favorite part was getting to binge our favorite show on Hulu and sit on the back patio area at night and enjoy each others company. The space was perfect, the AC was also amazing"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I thought this was a budget friendly place in a central location. Comfortable for one person and maybe a bit tight for two on a longer stay. My eye shades were very handy against the street lights. Owners were very kind and check in was smooth.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, clean, & cute!
As someone who used to live in Grants Pass this location is prime. Right in the heart of town and walking distance to local coffee! Loved having such a peaceful and convenient home to go to.
Very clean, as a clean freak myself I loved seeing the detail put into cleanliness and overall sanitation. Perfect for a couple or single person needing a place to stay. HIGHLY recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice place to stay
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time in this cute little studio! Having that private patio was and your own parking spot was real nice! All the amenities you need are there (shampoo/soap/towels/coffee). Would stay again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was a really great place to stay on the way to Portland with my dog. Would recommend to anyone coming to Grants Pass.
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,The space is adorable and I really wish we would've been able to stay in the space. Unfortunately there was dog fur all over and inside the linens on the bed which resulted in an allergic reaction. Mason & Shelby we're incredibly unprofessional and apathetic in their response to my concern. I ultimately sought resolution through Airbnb because of it because I didn't feel safe. 'Pet friendly ' doesn't mean it's an excuse to have dog fur everywhere.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place at a convenient location! Would defiantly stay again! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely a must stay!! The place was great for my husband and I as we only needed it for the night. We enjoyed a bottle of wine by the fire place before heading to bed. We will definitely be back :)
Thank you, Mason and Shelby!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and beautiful! We appreciated the air conditioning and the coffee they provided :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here from Aug. 6-7th and it was amazing. The space was neat, clean, had nice decor, and was homey. We had access to a kitchen (utensils included), bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, and body wash), t.v, outdoor patio, coffee and tea. They also have a notebook available where guests can write down an entry, most of them described their experience and thoughts about the Airbnb. I absolutely loved that. The location was great, it’s a small town so we could walk anywhere really. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mason and Shelby's place is super nice. It has a great layout and cool design. There's a safe private parking spot and an outdoor seating area. The air conditioner was much appreciated on the 95 degree day I was there. Easy in and easy out, and very private."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very happy I found this spot, will definitely keep in mind for future trips through south Oregon"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was amazing and we had so much fun. The swing in the backyard was beautiful and over all it was a great experience.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Host was great to work with! Requested early check in the day prior to arrival, got in early without issue. Perfect for our family. Traveled with 5 adults and 1 toddler. Rooms were perfect, back yard fully fenced and lots of shade for hanging out. Plenty of space to spread out and a game room in the garage. House was stocked with all of the basic needs. Very pleased, would ABSOLUTELY stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Plenty of shops and restaurants close by. Perfect if you have a dog or kids. It’s nice that it has a hot tub and an outdoor tv, making relaxing after a long day on the road."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time at Charity's place. The home is located close to many great places to eat in Grants Pass. We came for the state bowling tournament and the home was perfect for our team. The beds were very comfortable and everything was clean. Thank you for the great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Charity’s home was clean and beautiful and so spacious. The backyard was large and the pups had so much fun running around. From the bamboo to the hot tub you couldn’t ask for a more perfect getaway that felt quiet and peaceful in the city!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Really cozy stay! Especially enjoyed the hot tub + tv :)
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The hot tub under the covered patio with a tv is my kids' favorite!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Charity was a wonderful host and the house was exactly as expected. After a stressful night at another Airbnb that was not at all what we expected... Charity's place was a breath of fresh air. The beds were comfortable, the house was clean, and there was a lot of space to stretch out and relax. We were super thrilled with the hot tub. It was bigger than expected and very clean. Anything we needed we were able to find at the house.
The location was great, close to our family and close to stores and restaurants.
We would definitely stay here again 🙂"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay!
Its very nice and clean.
Great beds! Very nice hot tub also.
It's nothing super fancy but I don't mean that in a bad way it's very nice and very well-equipped as far as thoughtfulness and availability of things like sugar & creamer for coffee or hair dryer, straightener and spices to cook. I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs and I appreciate those little details and comfy beds more than anything!
Host was friendly and gracious even with us having some issues that made us less then perfect guests.
Definitely recommend"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was wonderful - if anything, I would say that the home was even better than we expected from the listing. The home was immaculate (and such a cool space!), and every amenity you could think of was provided already. From spices, to shampoo and conditioner, to coffee, anything we thought we'd forgotten to pack was already there for us - Charity thought of everything! The location was great, easy to find, and close to everything we needed. And our host Charity was a dream - super responsive, very friendly, and wonderful to work with. Would 100% stay again, and highly recommend this home and this host. If I could give more than five stars, I would!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I’ve stayed at her house a few times and other properties she owns! Absolutely love her houses and her as a host! 10/10 would be back over and over ! Best place to stay for sure
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, great location everything worked as it should’ve. as advertised.
Our final baseball tournament in high school sports. No problems. At all."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Couch was super comfy and the kids loved the garage space with the pool/air hockey table. The hot tub was also a plus but the water was way too high, so whenever someone got in it spilled over the sides. The water pressure in the shower was WAY TOO HIGH. It was actually painful to shower. For what we got, I think it was slightly overpriced. But good enough for one evening."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Backyard is private and secure for the doggo. Hot tub is huge and really nice. House is MCM, and as such, is dated but it is what we expected and everything is in good shape, and pretty cool. Pictures are accurate. Home was clean, well laid out...I like that there are a couple common areas so if the TV is on, others have another place to talk, or read. Only negative is that the paved patio area is small. Neighborhood felt completely safe, and is close in and easy to find. We only had a short time, so Charity offering an earlier check-in, (without us asking) was very nice. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Good price really nice house, loved the pool table, very clean and always responded in a hour or less and flexible"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot; Charity was very responsive and welcoming.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even better than the pics. We had everything we could
possibly need. It was cozy, exactly as described and the shower was awesome. The jacuzzi was such a nice touch and perfect for relaxing. Great place to stay and a great host. Would recommend and definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet neighborhood close to I-5 but didn't sound or feel like I was surrounded by people. The backyard was large, and it felt private thanks to the bamboo trees. The house was spacious and offered lots of seating for a large family without feeling stacked one on top of the other."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"My friends and I booked this home for a fun get away weekend. The house is perfect. It’s homey and cozy, just perfect for our group. The hot tub was amazing!! We enjoyed that every night we were here. We will definitely be back to stay here again. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would 100% stay here again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly what we were looking for! Had a great time and had everything we needed to make our stay for the night fun and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10! We will definitely stay here again when we’re in the area!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun stuff for kids!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home that fit all of our needs on this business trip.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay , wonderful host !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were on our way to Portland and had to turn back to due to freezing rain. We were so delighted to land here in this airbnb. After all day of traveling we got in the hot tub and played games with the kids. It was a delightful, peaceful ,experience. Loved the pool table that easily flips upside down to make an air hockey game. Large back yard with a large hot tub! The kitchen was stocked very well and very clean. It felt safe and quiet. I plan to stay again when we are passing through the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an amazing time in Grants Pass. Charity's places were Fun and secluded. She helped me get into a second place when I needed another night A+ host. Thanks again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful place. My boys and I loved the game room with NES, pool, air hockey. We especially loved the jacuzzi with the TV. The house was cozy and peaceful. Comfortable beds and a great atmosphere."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An excellent and very comfortable place to stay! Has everything you need, and more. Residing in a great part of town, and with plenty of comfort items and additions, you can't go wrong with this place. The host is very friendly, helpful, and proactive!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice stay. Liked the hot tub, kids really enjoyed the game room, and the neighborhood was nicely quiet."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a very easy to find and convenient location. There is plenty of room to hang out altogether or take a little space from each other. My bed was a little too soft and made my back hurt but that's no fault of the owner. My mom's bed suited her well. Everything was clean. My only complaint is that we didn't get to use the game room which we were really disappointed about, because it was just too dang cold even with the space heater on. We were looking forward to it, but it's OK. Maybe we're not as acclimated to the cold as the locals."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and cozy! Central location so close to everything. Definitely recommend
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"10/10 would recommend for any small families. Bunk beds for the kids, and a game room to keep them entertained while the parents enjoyed the hot tub."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house. A little dated but clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed the hot tub and it was close to the door so easily accessible. Smart TV’s in almost every room which was nice. Lots of amenities, including freshly ground coffee. Fun game room too! Will definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very nice and comfortable home. The only slight drawback is that it appeared all the electrical outlets were of the old two-prong variety so I could not plug in laptop until I found an adapter plugged into an outlet in the kitchen.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, easy to find, close to I-5. Plenty of room, great yard for the dog. Wonderful house for a family. Plenty of kitchen amenities for cooking meals."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"we loved our comfortable stay here! we had a blast in the game room, enjoyed relaxing in the jacuzzi, spent a peaceful morning in the sunny living room, and slept soundly in comfort. home is close to several great restaurants in grants pass all within 5-10 min drive."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed to visit my son and have a pre-Thanksgiving dinner . Grants Pass is beautiful! I loved staying there . The house was really cute,clean,comfy and had everything we needed . Except a Keurig , they did have a a coffee press and a coffee pot , Ive just got used to the pods . The beds were comfy . The back yard full of greenery , being able to watch our favorite cheesy holiday hallmark movies while relaxing in the jacuzzi was nice ! The game room on garage was for the kids . Shopping was super close ! We went to TapRock to see the Bridge .
The view is just beautiful! The food was really good .
Overall me & family had a really great time staying there .
Great hosts !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is in a nice neighborhood. The beds are really nice.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. With five adults and one dog, there was plenty of space for us all. The home was nicely decorated, very clean, and was well stocked with anything we could need. Centrally located in Grants Pass made it easy for us to find our way around town.
We enjoyed the pool/air hockey table, too!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! close to EVERYTHING! i enjoyed how quiet and relaxing her place was. The hot tub was the best at night just so quiet and warm. would recommend this place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay in a beautiful house! Game room, hot tub and fenced yard. Can't wait to stay here again!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charity was a gracious, responsive, and helpful host with an AMAZING home!!
The house is impeccable, adorable, perfect for families and pets! We will definitely go back!
The kitchen and fridge are amazing, and well-outfitted for a family!
My kids also enjoyed the game room! And the big TV!
So many beds, pillows, and blankets in airbnbs are cheap and uncomfortable but these were so nice and high-quality. We have a sensitive sleeper who travels with a mattress pad, and he didn’t even need it (for the first time ever)!!
We unfortunately ended up there during fire season and the smoke made it impossible for us to do what we’d planned. Charity made it easy to leave early, even though the shortened stay was in no way her fault. Also, the AC in the home made it possible for us to stay in comfort and clean air! 🙏
There were wifi issues the first day, and Charity not only helped me troubleshoot, but she called the service provider, and the issues were resolved for the rest of our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Charity is an amazing host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot - especially for family and kids! The single floor (no slips down steps!), large rooms, and big fenced yard make it so easy to just plop the kids down to play. The game room is on the opposite end of the bedrooms so the noise of Mario and billiards won’t keep anyone up.
It was clean; comfortable; and well stocked. I’m very happy I chose this place for my family trip."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay, it was clean and quiet and a good place for families with the game room and bed options."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the second time my family and I have stayed at Charity's place. The home is clean. There's plenty of things for the kids do. The beds are super comfy. It's close to the highway but not so close where you feel like you're staying in the highway. There's also a lot of food options nearby. This is our new spot for long road trips down I5.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was what was described. The yard was a good size and my kids got a kick out of all the bamboo in the back yard. The living room was nice and spacious and the kitchen was a nice size. Down the street were a lot of places to shop plus Charity put out a lot of information to help a traveler out. Overall it was a great place to stay overnight.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay here! The home was so clean and cozy. They had everything we needed including a binder that was very helpful. I’d 100% stay here again if I’m ever in Grants Pass!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 4 loved staying in this lovely and clean home. With 2 young kids, there was ample space to play, the game room was super entertaining, and the hot tub was heavenly.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great amenities at the house. Wonderful home for families. Overall very comfortable, clean, pleasant, and inviting.
We were a little nervous watching a movie from the hot tub because we were unsure of the noise pollution in the evening to the neighbors. We had to assume that it was all right since there was a TV out there.
Will stay here again next chance we are in grants Pass!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family loved the feel of the house. So quiet and peaceful. Beautiful home. I would really recommend the home and area.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Charity's place was exactly as described. An older home with some modern updates. Very responsive and even had ready for early arrival.

Definitely would stay again if my family comes back to this area again.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was lovely and spacious. My kids had a blast in the lush backyard, hot tub, and playing old school Mario Nintendo and pool in the game room.

It's pretty close to the highway but in a private quiet neighborhood. Charity was very friendly and incredibly easy to work with. I would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, good stay! Place was very clean, worth staying here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic little get away; great hub for day trips to Redwood National/State Park, Crater Lake National Park, Rogue River tours/rafting, and other many local gems. Place is super clean, has ample space, super functional kitchen, and a fantastic backyard for evening wine and hot tub enjoyment."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Charity was so helpful on providing recommendations on things to see and places to eat. She was quick to respond to a few questions we had! We loved the game room space! It was prefect for our time in Grants Pass.

,,,"Unfortunately, I was never able to get inside. I arrived at 9pm, the arrival time I’d shared in advance. There was no clear way to open the gate. I messaged the hosts but didn’t receive a response until 11 hours later, so I had to find a hotel to stay at that night.
I learned later that I was supposed to pull on a bottle opener to open the gate. I’ve never encountered a gate like that before. I’ve stayed in over 22 different airbnbs and lived and traveled around the world, but I’ve never had an issue with a gate or self-check-in. This could have been solved easily just with a faster message response time. Unfortunately, my refund request was denied.
Please note the app required me to rate other aspects of the space, but I didn’t actually experience them. There wasn’t an option to leave them blank."
