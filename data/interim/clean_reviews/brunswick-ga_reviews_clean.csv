2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful place with so much charm! We would definitely stay there again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The outdoor shower is definitely worth it. Loved being out and hearing all the nature sounds.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful! Perfect spot for a getaway from the hustle and bustle.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I only passed through for a single night on a road trip with my 6 month old. The parrot place was very quaint and eclectic. We loved the big bed and bath tub. They were very accommodating to us and thought about our needs before we expressed them. Highly recommend. Its a very beautiful property.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Old Parrot Place was absolutely charming. My mom and I felt like we were in a Nancy Drew novel. Antiques were artfully dotted all around the property; winding paths led you to a cookhouse, greenhouse, and animals; and the Spanish moss and palms gave the entire property a slightly mystical vibe. The cabin was well represented in the listing’s photos. Its furnishings were antique but sturdy and well-functioning. The bed was comfortable, the towels and linens clean, and everything felt very homey.
Mary herself was a delight to communicate with. She was extremely friendly and responsive to messages. She had clearly put a great deal of thought into what people might need during their stay and provided many creature comforts such as books, DVDs, a coffee maker etc. The fully outfitted cookhouse provided an easy place to make meals if you didn’t want to go into town. And the outdoor shower (there’s an indoor tub too) was a fun extra feature. It truly felt like staying at a relative’s home."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spent a wonderful few days at Mary and Marvins place. We were in the cabin and everything was as shown. We used the cookhouse for meals. The outdoor fridge was useful and Mary left condiments and beverages for our use. Mary and Marvin were very kind and there were animals to visit. It is close to Okefenokee and to the coast Brunswick and St SImons.. Very peaceful. Also there is a lake nearby for boating.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay the night! Peaceful surroundings. Mary was kind and offered fresh eggs.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Mary and Marvin was ideal!! We were looking for a place to relax and unwind and this was the perfect spot. Both Mary and Marvin were very friendly and great hosts, they made us feel welcome and at home. We can't wait to visit again soon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, special, unique place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, beautiful, peaceful place to stay. Mary and Marvin were a lovely couple and so welcoming as well as there fine furry friends. We loved being greeted by their 2 dogs Corey and Susie and Phillip the cat. It is a lovely setting and Mary gave us some history on their property. Easy parking right in front of the cabin. Nice clean and cozy room with comfy bed, large bathroom and also has an outdoor shower. Lots of dvds to choose from if you want to watch a movie. Even has another building if you want to cook something. Mary had fresh eggs waiting for us upon our arrival. We were also introduced to her other animal friends that live on the property. What a great place to stay. We can’t wait to come back. Thank you both for a wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"At Mary’s place, we were able to escape the norm and partake in paradise. Mary and Marvin are exceptionally nice hosts who took us on a tour of the property, explaining its history and some potential plans for the future. The place had everything and more. We definitely hope to go back and stay a couple of days. Unfortunately, our schedule did not permit it."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the stay. She is just so friendly and even left fresh eggs!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was extremely easy. They communicated well from booking to checkout. The host came over and introduced himself and made sure that I was comfortable. The setting was the most peaceful place I have ever stayed. I loved the animals and the charm of the property. If you are looking to unplug and get some peace and quiet, this is the perfect place. I only wish I had more time to spend there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to spend a weekend.
Loved meeting/petting all the animals, star gazing at the fire, sunset walk to the lake, and cooking farm fresh eggs in the morning. Cabin was a great place to stay and felt rustic the best way."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Mary’s place! The cottage was peaceful and pristine. We enjoyed the personal touches she added. Mary was accommodating, responsive, and very welcoming. We enjoyed chatting with her about her diving adventures. Our favorite part of the stay was definitely meeting and feeding the baby goats she is babysitting. :)
If you are looking for a peaceful place in nature (and love animals) this is the place for you. Incredible value and a special find. Thank you Mary for your hospitality, we’ll definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The sweetest and most peaceful place to stay! We will definitely be coming back :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary's place is just a gem. The cabin is so cosy, the cookhouse just perfect for having meals. All you need for preparing food is available, Mary even provided some fresh eggs. Such a nice place to visit. Would love to stay there again someday!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Mary's place for my sister's 50th birthday present. She said it was the most adorable place with so much character. They got to kayake in the lake, grill out, feed the animals and relax on the porch!! The cook house had everything you needed to prepare a meal. The hosts provide farm fresh eggs, as well! My sister said they will definitely be back again. Thank you Mary and Marvin for making her birthday a special one!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay . The hosts were worth it alone. They were wonderful people who make magic happen in peoples lives because of their presence and the offer of sharing their land and cabins for little cost for those seeking to remember the best things in life are peace joy and love, which we received in abundance. A wonderful and relaxing get away in a whimsicle space that we began to miss the minute we closed the door to our rustic and yet very comfortable cabin which left us wanting more. WE will be back Thank you for such a great memory and your amazing generosity of spirit. To us you are now friends Victoria and Chris"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for an idyllic, bucolic location 😊, this is the place for you! Super friendly and helpful hosts. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever. Go for it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet,cozy place to relax and unwind. We spent several days here celebrating our 39th anniversary and enjoyed it so much! Perfect location away from city noises -loved hearing the rooster crow in the mornings and the train whistle at night. We took day trips to the Golden Isles from the abnb. A day on St Simons, a day to Cumberland National seashore and a day golfing on Jekyll Island. Lots of good places to eat in those areas and then back to the cottage for rest. Also there are nearby convenience stores for whatever you may need or want for snacks since there is a microwave and fridge at the cottage. Mary and Marvin are wonderful host, available if needed but not around if you don’t. They gave us a tour of the little farm place and all the critters and we enjoyed that and their friendliness. I have to comment on the cost as well as we have stayed in rentals for years now, thank you Mary and Marvin for keeping the cost down and affordable for everyone. Just a truly great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a magical and restorative two days at this beautiful property. Mary and Marvin are kind and generous humans. They left me fresh eggs in the morning and treated me like their own family. It was exactly what my soul needed. The property is quiet and a perfect respite from our too-busy world. There's so many places to explore: the animals, the lake, the various antiques on the property. I loved it. Thank you again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming cabin! Far from the city, close to the wildlife refuges"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,If you need peace and quiet and beautiful surroundings this is a great place to go
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a lovely yet too short of a stay at Mary Ann Marvin’s. We so wished we had booked for a longer stay, but we plan to return in the near future. So peaceful, and inviting. We felt so comfortable and wished we could’ve stayed longer. Mary gave us a wonderful tour of their property, and we were astounded at all of the work they put into it to make it such a lovely place to be. Upon arriving we were greeted by two adorable affectionate dogs. The cabin we stayed in was perfect. Mary, thought of everything, to make it comfortable including small floor heater as there had been a cold front the day before. She was so gracious and showed us all of her amazing animals on the farm, as well as the larger unit for a family gathering situation. Just gorgeous workmanship and decor. A very special place, that I would highly recommend for someone who appreciates a peaceful place, with a sweet history."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When I pull up to Mary’s cabin, it feels like I just got home:)). It’s so lovely on their land and Mary is such a helpful host and delightful to chat with— makes me feel like I wish I was staying longer!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible deal for the price! Such a relaxing spot with incredible hosts! All the animals on property are a great bonus to the stay. We so wish we could have stayed longer. If you are looking for a secluded and relaxing spot - this is for sure the place!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend Mary and Marvin’s place when you need fresh air and quiet— great little cabin, with a front porch meant for coffee and reflection!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED it here. So peaceful. It’s off the beaten path but well worth the drive to Okefenokee. Mary was great. The animals are amazing. The horse and donkey really like carrots, the potbelly pig preferred apples.
It rained while we were there. Nothing like rain on a tin roof to lull you right to sleep. I highly recommend this little cabin!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful and peaceful place! Cozy, unique and super clean. We really appreciated the extra touches like popcorn & movies. We look forward to coming back:)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Most responsive host ever. Had troubles on the way there and she was willing to help in any way. Really looking forto staying here in the future.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a cute place. Perfect place to stop on our way to Florida.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always love staying at the parrot place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay. Peaceful. Lots of animals. Quiet. Off the beaten path. I’ll be back for the outdoor shower next trip to FL. I chickened out in the chilly morning air. The clawfoot tub was amazing. Plenty of hot water
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, quiet cabin with a beautiful shared cookhouse, lots of quirky antiques to see. Great if you want a rustic, throwback vibe - but still want AC and running water!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here. Love this place! So interesting, animals to feed and interact with, peaceful and quiet. A very special place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Mary's cabin, so that's a sign right away that we like it!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really unique and cozy place in rural Georgia, fun stay for an evening! Definitely would recommend to most folks; quirky touches and really lovely surroundings.
*A few tips though: if you're staying on a Friday/Saturday night, there's a wedding venue nearby that can have music playing until 11pm-midnight. Also, the road into the place is sandy dirt, so in wet weather it can be half a mile of bumps and sandy tires.*"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is off the beaten path and it’s quaint cute and smells like fresh linen. We were so comfortable and would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were so kind, friendly and hospitable. We had booked the cabin for a quick, quiet get away but there was a complication with the plumbing… they didn’t miss a beat. They put us in another house on their property and we still were able to enjoy our peace and quiet!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always look forward to staying at Mary and Marvin's place in the country. I got a free upgrade to the bigger house because some repairs were needed at the cabin, which was extra nice."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our review is actually for the other home on the property, Story House. We were due to stay in the cabin and received a call from the host on our way down to inform us that the previous occupants of the cabin had been I'll and the host felt it would be wrong to have us stay in the cabin until they had thoroughly sanitized. They instead offered us the large home on the property to stay in at the same rate as the cabin. This was the beginning of the hosts endearing themselves to us. I don't know the policies of the company but I know that most hotels and other stays might not have given us the same option. It is so cozy and we loved being able to unplug, watch DVDs and rest before visiting Cumberland Island the next day. When we returned from the island there was a fire in the fire pit, the cookhouse lights were on as I had said I wanted to explore over there and Marvin and Mary were both outside dealing with farm emergency (I hope the horse recovered!). We can't wait to return!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We booked this as a stop on our way to a vacation spot. Little did we know Mary's place WAS a destination! We loved it so much. Mary and Marvin were very welcoming. Their homestead is full of wonderful surprises around each corner. Mary pays attention to little details to make you comfortable. I cannot wait to go back and make more great memories!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing out of the ordinary place I. a beautiful nature surrounding and the cabin Wow

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved it! Mary and Marvin were soo kind and we felt right at home. We used the cook house to cook several of our meals which was really helpful and fun! We loved chatting with them both and meeting ask the animals! Hope to come again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a special place. Every touch in this little cabin was absolutely beautiful. It was full of warmth and just felt so cozy. I highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Mary's cabin was great! She was responsive, helpful, and flexible when we were delayed by traffic. The cabin is wonderfully decorated: we felt right at home. The host provided everything we could have needed for our stay! We watched one of the many DVDs and bundled up in bed. There were pamphlets to local parks and many field guides, which we enjoyed. Mary provided interesting details about the property and buildings in the provided binder. Any questions we could have had were clearly answered by the binder or helpful notes left around the cabin. We had a great time looking at the beautiful plants and saying hello to the animals in the back.
Clean, comfy, and very welcoming! We hope to be back someday."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very beautiful, cozy place to stay and the owners were so lovely"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Old Parrot’s Place in my cabin in the woods was a dream come true, to every last detail of interior design Mary so thoroughly put together. I enjoyed Marvin’s hospitality; I saw their horses and the miniature donkey, and the pig was a riot! I enjoyed making myself a hot tub, and watching a DVD the old school way. I felt right at home! It was everything I hoped for, and more! I highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this little cabin. It was perfect for us. Mary and Marvin were both very hospitable and friendly. They made us feel right at home. The cabin was charming, cozy, comfortable and very clean. So many little extras were well thought out and provided. From games, pens, colored pencils, books, dvds and so much more. We did not make use of the cook house. But we toured it and found it to be quite a gem. If we had more time, we would have made use of it I am sure. We hope to stay here again when ever we are back in the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’ve stayed here numerous times- we love it! Quiet getaway ❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay if you're looking for a quiet place surrounded by woods. The cabin is super cute and the property is full of awesome collectables. Mary and her husband are the more sincere people. They took their time to show us around the property, introduce us to all of their animals, and answer any questions we had. They are so genuine. I'd highly recommend their place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary & Marvin are the epitome of what a gracious host should be.
This was our 4th visit and plan to visit more in the future. We have stayed in both the cabin and the ""story House"" and absolutely love both."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This completely charming airbnb is close to the Okefenokee Swamp, and it was my second time staying. Always a pleasure to enjoy some farm fresh eggs and say hello to all of the animals. My go-to stop if I am ever looking for a place in the area. Hosts are wonderful and very accommodating. Outdoor shower is always a must."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was absolutely thrilled with the cabin. Very cozy and the surroundings were welcoming and just what I needed to get away from the city. Wish I could have stayed longer.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary is the most friendly and hospitable AirBnB host we have met to date. The cabin was perfect for our stay and we loved our time there. Hope to stay again in the future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place ! Awesome cabin with the most fantastic outside shower ( great water pressure/tons of hot water) . It’s set in a wonderful Sandy bottom forest with tons of shade. The cabin has so much character and charm as does the “ cook house “. Felt like I was transported to an earlier era when life was simpler. Marvin and Mary are wonderful hosts ( generous , hospitable , friendly )."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was Rustic as described but everything I needed was provided. Property was interesting and quiet, plenty of good walks around."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Mary's place. We absolutely love everything about it. Both Mary and her husband are delightful people marching to the beat of their own drums! We enjoyed perusing the fascinating collection of antiques and other oddities. Most of all I applaud Mary's consideration of my fragrance allergies as she made sure to wash the linens and towels in unscented detergent to keep me safe. Many thanks, Mary!! We shall return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our third time back and we love it here! Mary & Marvin are always so welcoming and flexible. They always make sure we have everything we need for a comfortable stay. We look forward to any time they can spare to sit down and chat with us, at the same time they give us lots of space/privacy. I’ve told so many people about this wonderful place- and we hope they always continue hosting guests."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what an amazing place! We had a fantastic time, wish we had been able to explore more. We would totally stay again. What fabulous hosts, an amazing visit. Highly recommend!!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I always enjoy staying with Mary and Marvin! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and her husband are south Georgia jewels! What a peaceful place they have; I had a wonderful stay! They could not have been more accommodating. I would stay here again if I am ever back in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were friendly, relaxed hosts. The location was my delight because it was in the country and so peaceful and calm. I could walk barefoot and sit on the earth. It’s rustic in a good way, but clean. I ate their chicken’s eggs. Mary, Marvin and I shared conversations and connection. They introduced me to their animals and since I’m a plant person, too, Mary showed me her plants. We geeked outside on herbs and potions, too. Mary sent me away with a cutting and other treats. Not saying that will be the case for everyone, we just shared interests.
Marvin is kind and caring and made sure I felt safe when working guests arrived in their truck at night at the other house.
I loved! hanging out with their two dogs and the horses and donkey. I gave Piggy my persimmon peals per suggestion. All friendly animals; if you don’t want to have animal time, you don’t have to.
Their cook house is cool. I love a gas stove. There’s a zip line! I forgot to try it before I left."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin have created a rustic and timeless get away free from the noise of everyday life. Step back from all the business and enjoy the uncomplicated pleasures of a simpler approach to life.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin are just the loveliest people you can find. The place is rustic but awesome if you look for an unplugged hideaway!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary's cabin was absolutely charming! We arrived at dark but were still able to get in and settled with no problem. We only got to stay one night. We were blown away by the place the cookhouse and absolute charm of the whole surroundings. We would definitely stay there again. Wish we could have been there longer this time around. If you love a charming cabin in the woods this is your place. The attention to detail is spot on. We love the antiques and the welcoming atmosphere. We slept well and enjoyed everything about the cabin. We would definitely stay there again and spend more time. Thank you Mary!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little cabin in the woods was spectacular. We built a nice little fire outside when we arrived. Made breakfast in the cook house and explored the area the next day. Don't miss out on this one! It's a WONDERFUL place and at a great price!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you're looking for fancy, this ain't it. If you're looking for a comfortable night's sleep in a quiet, rural spot with friendly hosts, you've found it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, my stay was lovely. Mary is a wonderful hostees and is very engaging and knowledgeable about the area and what it has to offer. I will definitely be back for my, now, 6th visit there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay! The property is peaceful and quiet. A nice quiet get-away. Our cat was really enjoying exploring around the property and meeting the barnyard animals. We would love to book a longer stay in the future. Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect, quaint spot for a cozy stay in South Georgia! Mary is the consummate host and even will provide fresh eggs and breakfast items for you in the cookhouse just next door (with a gorgeous wraparound porch). You must experience the outdoor shower — so fun! The bed was comfy, too. Will stay here again if we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was absolutely amazing. Mary and Marvin thought of everything to make sure that we had everything we needed to feel at home, including fresh eggs from their chickens. The property is eclectically decorated with plenty to look at and explore. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to unplug and unwind in a peaceful natural setting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful respite or just an opportunity to decompress, you have found the right place. Mary's cabin is lovely and quaint. You can almost imagine yourself in another time with all the interesting antiques and old-time setting. Mary's husband, Marvin, gave me a tour around the property and there is quite the interesting history. The location is remote with no decent restaurants or other city amenities within miles. But that's what you are there for, right? There is nice wooded hiking and a pretty lake (with fishing I understand) just across the road plus Jekyll Island is not too far away. Clean and comfortable and although Mary describes it as teeny tiny, it's small but not that small (and the bathroom is quite large btw). These are good people - I wish there were more Airbnb hosts like Mary and Marvin that really cared about providing a good experience for their guests."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love visiting the cabin! It was our second stay here and we hope to continue to make visits. Mary always makes us feel welcomed and makes sure we have everything we need. Always grateful for the hospitality and friendliness. Thank you 💜

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was nicer than I thought it was going to be very clean, secluded quiet place in its own little section of woods on his property. I love the outdoor shower they were very friendly. I certainly will be staying there again in my travels."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was so cozy place. We had a peaceful and relaxing weekend. Mary and Marvin were so friendly. Thank you for sharing you place with us.
Tammy and Keith"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary's place was amazing. We didn't have a lot of time there but we totally enjoyed it. Mary was really friendly and show us around the place in her golf cart which was really cool. They also had animals and we loved our stay and we will definitely be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mary and her husband were gracious, wonderful hosts who made me feel so welcomed! It was so refreshing to stay in the rustic cabin and I felt safe and able to enjoy the beautiful property. It was a joy to meet their sweet animals and spend time visiting with both hosts. The property is wonderfully set up for lone travelers or families with children. Loads of fun kids things to do on property with play sets, slack-lines, etc…Wonderful people, wonderful place, wonderful stay. Highly recommend this lovely rustic retreat!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy cabin off the beaten path. Definitely worth this trip and we'll hopefully be back for many more. Thanks for everything, Mary! 🥰"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an absolute gem of a place, and the hosts can’t do enough for their guests.
Perfect for a getaway, loved everything about the place - the animals, peace, being in the woods, the rustic cabin and fresh eggs in the morning. Thank you to Mary and Marvin, thoroughly enjoyed meeting you both - I will return and highly recommend!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,True cabin experience. You are provided everything needed for a peaceful stay. The owners are super kind.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gift to find this gem of a cabin on Airbnb! Mary and Marvin were fantastic hosts and we loved spending time on their property. We took advantage of the cookhouse, farm fresh eggs, and outdoor shower. We have already booked our next stay and can’t wait to return. Thank you both for the conversation and opening up your home to us. It felt like a home away from home from the moment we parked and we are looking forward to coming back again, kayaking or sitting around a fire and having more conversation. Exactly the relaxing, laid-back weekend trip that I needed to reset. 11/10: wonderful experience, kind hearted people, +animals and delicious eggs! 💕 thank you, thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very hospitable and accommodating!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best air bnb I've stayed at yet. My daughter and I were traveling from VA to Florida for a wedding and needed a place to crash for the night. The cabin was clean, the bed was comfortable, and everything made me feel like I was at home. We got in late but woke up and walked the property to be happily greeted by all the farm family. Horses, chickens, dogs, cats, and my daughters personal favorite, a mini donkey by the name of Skippy Jack. The welcome guide covered everything you could possibly need to know about the place, whether you were staying for a night or a month.
10/10 I'll make up a reason to travel there in the future to stay again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary, Marvin, and The Old Parrot Place are a definite TREASURE.

The peace and tranquility we find there is beyond compare, and we look forward to unplugging everytime!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an unforgettable experience at the cabin. my partner and I were escaping the hurricane, and Mary responded to changes and answered questions quickly, even very late at night.
When we met her, she was filled with so much joy and made us feel very comfortable and right at home. I have never met someone with so much hospitality.
I loved feeding the donkey Skippy he is so sweet. we also loved walking around the property barefoot the sand is amazing! the outdoor shower and the bathtub were also great! there is nothing more I could have asked for. I would not have wanted to spend my time anywhere else during the unexpected hurricane.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a peaceful environment and enjoy authentic antiques and a rustic atmosphere this is your paradise! Mary and Marvin have really out done themselves and have thought of every little detail to make your stay comfortable and carefree! They greeted us on arrival, gave a us a gate pass and key to the private boat ramp. Left us fresh eggs daily. You could spend hours looking at all the antiques and taking a step back in time. We absolutely loved the outdoor shower! Especially after a hot day on the river fishing. We didn't get to talk plants but Mrs. Mary has lots of those to look at too! We will definitely be going back and we look forward to visiting the Woodbine Opry that Mr. Marvin told us about. It was the perfect way for us to unwind! Bella (our dog) enjoyed her self as well!

Thoughtful touches and details abound all the way down to the fresh flowers placed in the bathroom! This time we were blessed enough to get to meet Susie and Cooper, the sweet puppies on property. Sitting on the little porch with a cold drink and a good book is an unbeatable experience and we can’t wait to come do it again soon!!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not only is this Airbnb just a unique delight, the hosts make this experience extra special. I had my two small children with me, that they welcomed with open arms. We felt like family right from the start. Between the Zipline, ninja warrior course that they set up along the trees, the horses, the donkey, all the chickens. We felt as if we could’ve stayed there and then content for a week. It was an extreme pleasure getting to meet Mary and Marvin. I can’t wait to sit down and have breakfast again with them one morning. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for an unforgettable experience."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is a little piece of history. A fun little time warp with everything you need!
Everything was neat and tidy. Lots to look at but not cluttered.
We popped in for a long travel day pit stop. We didn’t get to meet Mary but made us feel more than welcome with communication through texts.
I took many photos of the pine trees next to palms. Amazing energy in this landscape. Can’t wait to draw and paint from this stay! katykstudio"

Adding this spot to my vacation rotation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an awesome experience at this Airbnb. Mary and Marvin were absolutely awesome! We loved the room and the surroundings. It was so peaceful and absolutely beautiful where we were. Mary was even kind enough to give us fresh chicken eggs for breakfast. They have a beautiful kitchen that you can use to cook whatever you would like while you’re on property. It’s about 20 minutes off the interstate and it is well worth the drive. It was about 30 minutes from the beach. Mary had an awesome book to let us know different restaurants that were available in the area. My husband and I cannot wait to book another visit to the area with Mary and Marvin. Next time we will stay definitely more than one night, we hated to leave. Thank you so much for being such a gracious host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay! Marvin and Mary made me feel very welcome and shared wonderful tips for my trip to Okefenokee. They were gracious enough to offer fresh eggs and let me explore their beautiful property. I loved meeting their sweet dogs that made me feel right at home

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is a true gem, and a great deal for the price. I stayed here with my two dogs for just one night, but I would love to come back and enjoy a longer stay sometime in the future.
It's a cozy, rustic spot that's great for just one or two people, but it has a large and comfy bed, and a surprisingly spacious bathroom as well. It sits on a 25-ish acre rural property with plenty of walking trails and woodsy sights to explore.
Guests at this cabin have access to a separate building called ""the cookhouse,"" which has a full kitchen and dining room and is filled with interesting antiques.
Mary and her husband Marvin were incredibly warm and gracious hosts — they were nearby to greet me when I arrived, and checked on me a couple more times during my stay (but not in a way that felt intrusive).
There were so many details that made this Airbnb feel special, from thoughtful touches inside the cabin to the friendliness of the hosts. It felt like a home away from home."

Mary and Marvin are perfect hosts who provided us with everything we needed, even farm fresh eggs for breakfast!! The bed is extremely comfortable and, though small, the cabin had everything we needed for a great evening. We sipped our wine while rocking on the porch and listening to the birds. This is perfect a perfect place to relax!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many reasons why I have returned to The Old Parrott Place 5 times in the past 15 months, and one of them is Mary! I truly consider the area my second home now, and it wouldn't feel quite the same without the care and attention that Mary, and Marvin, provide."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place. Such charm. So friendly and helpful. ♥️
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"On a star scale of 1-5, staying with Mary and Marvin is a solid 10. Old Parrott Place is a charming, funky, delightful “estate”. The hosts provided fresh eggs from the resident chickens - and you might be visited by those chickens as you feast in the dining room looking out through the squeaky screen door of the Cookhouse. Numerous and varied antiques and collectibles provide a peek into the past of Southern Georgia life. Book with Mary and Marvin to give your eyes a feast and your brain a rest."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin have an amazing place. The cabin they have is absolutely beautiful and immaculate. It is decorated perfectly.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were excellent hosts!! They were very friendly, knowledgeable about the area and offered excellent suggestions for places to see and things to do. The Old Parrot Cabin was a diamond in the rough! The cabin and kitchen had everything you could possibly want or need, and then some!! Fresh eggs from their own chickens no less!! Suzy and Copper, their super friendly dogs came to meet us when we arrived and greeted us every morning and evening. It is quite evident that our hosts spend a lot of time creating and furnishing our cabin as well
As the two story cabin, for 3+ guests. Melvin built most of both cabins himself! A very skilled craftsman and Mary was a wealth of knowledge regarding the Flora and Fauna on their property. If you are looking for a rustic and quiet retreat, this is it!! As a bonus, only a short drive to The Golden Isles, St. Simonds, Jekyll and Sea Island!!!
Highly recommended!!"

We chatted by the fire under the stars, listened to Louis Armstrong while we read some of the books, and visited the chickens and horses on site. If you're looking for a truly unique Airbnb experience off the beaten path, this is it!
Marvin was so friendly and even got out the karaoke machine for us! We will definitely be back!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rustic and quaint small cabin offers a wonderful bit of tranquility--a lovely respite from an often crazy world. I could just sit in a rocking chair on the porch for hours, with a small ""break"" to feed the horses apples. As a long-time travel writer, I have plenty of stays in ultra-luxurious accommodations. This was a nice change, and yet I lacked for nothing. There were small items of convenience thoughtfully tucked in every corner. A very enjoyable stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying here and I absolutely love the place. If you are looking for somewhere to stay when going to Jekyll Island this is the place. Bring a book and relax in the rocking chairs. It's a good spot to unplug and relax. Highly recommend staying here.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great country, shabby chic setting among a lttile enclave of homes nestled in the woods.
Kitchen facilities available steps away in the ""cookhouse."""
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute historical cabin. Definitely a great deal too. The stars look beautiful at night and the bed is so comfy. Mary is super helpful and responsive. I hope to come back one day.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical . You are staying in the enchanted forest . Yes , rustic , but still comfortable. I didn’t use the “ cookhouse “ but Mary gave me a tour and I thought it would be such a fun experience to cook there . In the morning before I left I visited with the horses and chickens. ❤️ . Lots of thoughtful little touches. Tea and honey, oatmeal, DVDs! Just simply fun ."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the perfect stop on a solo drive to Florida with my dog. Friendly hosts introduced me to the animals and showed me the great spots on the lake. Giant antique bath tub with candles for a relaxing soak. My dog was truly welcome and got along great with the resident pups. This is my new go to when I need a break from a stressful world or a long drive.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's always a fairy tale at Mary and Marvin's place. This is a place I love revisiting with my family. We book both of her Airbnbs when we go and we always enjoy ourselves, and are never really ready to leave. This place is like going in a time machine back to simpler times when you could sit on a porch without any technology and just enjoy nature or make your own music. Being here is like a type of therapy for me, and I love it"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Old Parrot Cabin was absolutely amazing!! It was so charming, had all of the amenities, plus more! Mary and Marvin are the sweetest couple - they gave us a tour of the other house, they gave us fresh eggs, and Mary and I bonded over plants in her greenhouse :) The pups and horses were so sweet as well. We will for sure be back!!"

The cabin had a very comfortable king size bed, microwave, coffee pot and coffee, creamers, popcorn… wine glasses, mugs you honestly felt right at home! We traveled during the cool weather and she already had the heaters going for us in the room and the bathroom! The tub has a shower attachment and the water was hot! :-) the kitchen is a detached house but it included a table with chairs, pots and pans, spray oil and fresh eggs from her pets! We loved feeding the horses, donkey, chicken and playing with their sweet doggies. I would definitely recommend this home and plan on going back again! It gave us the outdoor cabin feeling with the rocking chairs and fire pits !! Ms Mary and Mr Marvin were incredible hosts!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin’s cabin was perfect for us. We visited Okeefenokee Swamp one day and relaxed the next on rocking chairs on the porch. The cabin is a short drive to Jekyll Island and other sights….great location. Parking was easy. Bed was very comfortable….we slept well. Kitchen had everything and more than we needed. Any Mary and Marvin were extremely welcoming….so great to meet them. FYI…Larger groups would love to stay in the old Sears mail order house. We would stay again.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the cabin and all the decorations inside and out. Both Marvin and Mary are so nice and approachable-- nice visits with them. The cabin has all you need and it's so cleverly constructed. We liked all the extras of books and instruments and just a general funk factor. The separate cookhouse is a great idea and we loved the outside fire ring-- sitting outside in a peaceful setting. Definitely coming back!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin are very friendly and gracious hosts! They went above and beyond to make sure you had everything you needed to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. They provided much more than expected of hosts from proving firewood and even starting our evening outdoor fires to providing their golf cart for us to use to go exploring and a well equipped kitchen with every utensil know to man and even proving fresh eggs for our breakfast! They even provided the charcoal for the big grill they provided. They have 2 of the sweetest dogs although we are not pet owners we loved having their dogs visit especially the big dog “Cooper” he is awesome and you can’t keep from loving him? If you don’t like rustic forget this place but if you like nostalgic book now you won’t be disappointed? So many antique treasures to see and they let you roam around the farm and feed and pet the horses and feed the chickens etc. you will love it at least we did?

And the hens shared amazing fresh eggs with us.
Thank you for a delightful experience."

Our kids have already asked a handful of times if we can move there!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"location was perfect for us as we attended a wedding in Waverly.

We loved the upper deck, looking out over the marsh. The whole space and vibe of the home was relaxing. I could hang out on that deck and down at the dock all day. Danielle was also the perfect host and responded quickly to any questions I had. When in the area visiting family in the future, I would love to stay here again. No need to look any further. Oh, and check out JB's Shrimp Shack close by. It's just a small place but has delicious food."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was absolutely the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. It had everything we could possibly need.
The grand kids (8 and 11) who are usually more interested in their tablets spent most of their time out on the dock fishing,
or playing ping pong! When it was time to go no one wanted to leave. I had to promise we would come back soon.
We are already talking about our next trip! Can't wait to come back!!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great. Great water view from large deck off living room. Two bedrooms had doors to deck that also faced water. Comfy furnishings. Two large bathrooms and well stocked kitchen.
Only things which owner cannot control was the rain, rain, rain and a bit more traffic sound from highway beyond the marsh.
We visited Brunswick, Jekyll Island and St Simons. Had couple great meals and cooked couple at house. Nothing could dampen the once a year time together of four sisters hailing from FL, VA and NC. Thanks Danielle!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was amazing from top to bottom. An IKEA kitchen to start that had everything you need to make your meal for the week. Bedrooms were plenty big and we had plenty of room for everyone that stayed and a tv just in case you want one in every room. The living room had plenty of space for everyone to lounge when the time was right to gather. Bathrooms were big enough to sleep in, if needed 😁. Outside, plenty of room for parking, great dock and boat house to pass the time away along a tidal creek that yielded plenty of blue crabs. Also caught a shrimp and fish in the crab trap provided. Beautiful views out over the marsh. Close to a well traveled highway leading into Brunswick, but was never an issue as far as noise. The game room downstairs is sufficient to keep the evreyone busy. Visited Brunswick, St. Simon’s and Jekyll islands. All within a 30 minute drive. Roughly an hour from Jacksonville, so Florida is right on the doorstep. If you’re looking for a great one, this is it."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts were very responsive, unfortunately we happened to visit during the extreme cold for South Georgia and had a few pipes break towards the dock. The hosts were very responsive to messages we sent about it and was able to get a plumber out to take a look. The house was amazing, very clean and not to far from the interstate but far enough away to give you plenty of privacy. In less then an hour you could be in Jacksonville and less then 10 minutes from the house you could be on St Simons Island, we will have to visit again when the weather is a little warmer, also the dock was perfect for our 22 ft center console."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow - this is a hidden little gem in Brunswick! Group of 4 in town for a wedding at Cedar Lodge in Waverly.
The House - Kelly has done an awesome job of making this a true home away from home. If you need something it's there, if you forgot something it's there, if you need something to do it's there! Neighborhood is great - quiet, neighbors friendly and welcoming.
Location - the best for visiting all of the Golden Isles. We have often stayed on SSI with the crowds, traffic, wait times, etc. Downtown Brunswick offers a lot and you are a short drive to all the island and even up to Darien.
Will definitely book this place again! Kelly, it's a wonderful place, thank you for sharing with us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelley’s home was so much more than I expected for the price. It was very clean, well stocked, local to many amazing eateries and shopping. We booked this space because we wanted to spend some time at the beaches on Jekyll Island but we discovered so much more. Kelley was very responsive and gracious in all of her communication and her home was beautiful, bright, and super clean. If you are considering a stay, do yourself a favor and book it today! And, while you’re in town, check out Maggie Mae’s for breakfast and Indigo Coastal Shanty for lunch or dinner. I promise you won’t regret it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough about how amazing this home is. Easy parking, well stocked with things I didn’t even know I needed, comfy beds and just an overall feel of cozy.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My friends and I stayed here for our family vacation and we LOVED the Airbnb! It was beautiful!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the best air BNB we've stayed in. It was very clean, nicely decorated and very comfortable for our family. It was beautiful but didn't feel stuffy like we could t relax in the space. The location is great, close drive to both Saint Simons Island and Jekyll Island. It feels very safe and close proximity to historic downtown Brunswick, and grocery and drug store. I highly recommend for families, we could easily relax and play games together but also retire to our own spaces to rest. The kitchen is very user friendly and welcoming. Kelly is an excellent hostess and left lots of communication to help us feel right at home. Wound definitely recommend this and stay here again."

My mom was so impressed as well & I hope that we returned the place as nice as when we got there which was incredible to begin with. The instructions she left were perfect, and the house was so inviting. Will DEF be rebooking for a future trip."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelley’s place was superior in all ways—so clean, cozy, way beyond with the amenities. The location was perfect for visiting Jekyll Island. Our kids also loved staying here, with our 3 year-old calling it her “New House” :). My only suggestion is a small stool for the bathroom. Neither of the kids could reach the bathroom sinks."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay here. The location is a short drive to St. Simons and Jekyll. The house was very clean and well equipped with everything you need.

There is one high step required to get into the living area of the house that has no railing or handholds. My mother was unable to go up or down this step without help. I would definitely like to stay in this home again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The home was clean, comfortable, and decorated so nicely. We enjoyed all the historic charm of the house. The location is great close to downtown Brunswick, Jekyll, and St Simons Island.

I did not have to go out to the grocery store to purchase any side condiments coffee bar was one of my favorite things. Yeah, when I was with also the fact that we were only about 10 to 15 minutes away from family so the location was very convenient in a few. I do recommend maybe putting TVs in the bedrooms other than then we will stay again and we enjoyed our stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood was quiet and private. Access to the loft was private and secure. The loft itself was cozy as advertised and quaintly decorated creating a homey feel during the entire stay. The vibe of the loft was extremely peaceful and relaxing which is exactly what was needed after a long day on the beach. As fair warning, a part of the coziness of the loft is achieved by the slanted ceilings throughout most of the spaces. Make sure to watch your head if you are vertically gifted."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay, and Lori was quite responsive whenever I reached out. The guidebook was quite helpful.
One wee word of caution if you’re a light sleeper: Consider turning off the HVAC unit and using the supplied fan for air, as the unit is in the same room. The fan is small and powerful, which allowed me to sleep without issue."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very cozy place with plenty of privacy considering it's in town. It was a bit small for the 4 of us but would be perfect for 2 people, but we were constantly on the go so it worked. It's close to the islands and the beaches and shopping. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Lori was very responsive through messaging and gave us our privacy. I love that. Thank you Lori."

The location couldn't have been more ideal for exploring the Golden Isles. With its convenient proximity to the attractions and natural beauty of the area, we were able to make the most of our visit in just a few days. It truly felt like a home away from home.
Every detail within the apartment was thoughtfully arranged and immaculately maintained. The tasteful decor, comfortable furnishings, and well-equipped amenities made our stay truly exceptional. We couldn't have asked for more!
It's the small touches and genuine care that make all the difference. We wholeheartedly recommend Lori's place to anyone seeking a perfect getaway in the Golden Isles."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our hosts were thoughtful and the space was clean and comfortable. Lori left us a welcome gift of sweet treats and a card, wishing us a happy anniversary. We were attending a wedding in northern FL, so we were about an hour from that, but I didn’t want to stay in a crowded hotel with a lot of busy noise around. We liked being able to walk downtown to restaurants and being just a few miles from Jekyll Island. Lori checked on us through the app and gave us restaurant recommendations. In fact, everyone we encountered in town was friendly. We had everything we needed and enjoyed the clean and clutter free space and the quiet neighborhood. It was nice to be able to do a load of laundry, and I appreciated not having a large cleaning fee tacked onto the rental. I would definitely stay here again if in the area. Thank you so much, Lori!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, and I travel a lot!

Brunswick is a PERFECT location that has proximity to both Jekyll Island and St Simons. Each were around a 15 minute from the loft. Brunswick itself is a hidden gem so don't miss seeing it as well! We ate at Indigo Shanty and South of Heaven BBQ. Definitely amazing eats! The loft was clean and newly updated. We loved the upcycled flooring which is originally from Brunswick High School's gym. Everything in the loft was great quality and roomy. The directions and communication from Lori were clear and we had no issues arriving. Between the location, privacy and quality, this is a can't miss spot for any trip to the Golden Isles. If we come back, we are booking at The Cozy Old Town Loft! Thank you!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy little loft. It is a bit bigger than the pictures make it seem. previous reviews about the trundle bed are no longer accurate as they changed it to a full/queen size memory foam mattress. 100% recommend

It has everything it claims which made my family super comfortable. There were eight of us staying for two nights. I wish we could have stayed longer. We ample parking and use of the garage.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was great for our family. It is extremely clean and it is updated. The beds were comfortable and it essentially had 2 master bedrooms to go with the other 2 bedrooms. We didn't use the kitchen but it looked really nice.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly what we needed for the weekend ( exactly as it was represented on the website)- the 2 sitting areas made it easy for the kids to be doing something and the adults still having room to talk - the weather was not outside weather as it rained but the screened porch looked very nice and the fenced yard would have been great for kids to run around in and adults to enjoy the firepit.
The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms clean and easy step in showers
The kitchen was spacious, great new appliances and decked out with plenty of kitchen & dinner wear.
The parking was plentiful - we had 3 cars and availability of the 2 car garage was very nice.
The owners were very attentive - checking in on us to see if there was anything we needed during our stay.
We would recommend and if in the area again - rent again"

For four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a garage, and screened in porch, the deal was great!! I only have two complaints : 1) It took about five to seven minutes for the running water to become hot and 2) The house is located on a busy street so sometimes it was difficult to pull out of the driveway. However, I would stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our experience at Anlley's place surpassed all expectations. The pictures fell short of capturing its true beauty.

The eclectic lounge room with coffee and tea bar was our favorite! The whimsical front porch was also nice to relax on in the evenings after a day of adventures. Proximity to food and entertainment in town was very easy- Especially since they went above and beyond to get bikes out for us!!!
We loved it so much we stayed an extra night and will absolutely stay here again. If you are kind people looking for kindred spirits in a communal artsy home you found the perfect central spot to explore the Golden Isles of GA and will be well cared for here ✨💖"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place for my quick overnight stay! Check in was simple, street parking worked fine, and there were plenty of towels. The bed was comfortable. The toilet is short, close to the sink, and may be difficult for people with knee or joint issues, but was fine for me. I appreciate the good quality toilet paper. And there's free tea available in the morning. Overall, a great stay, and I'd stay again. Thanks Lynna!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this charming Georgian home was an absolute delight! From the serene sunroom to the inviting coffee bar, every detail was just perfect. Lynna's book recommendations and delightful conversations added a special touch to my stay. The location couldn't have been better – walking distance to downtown. I couldn't get enough of the delicious tea and the Yellow Deli recommendation was spot on. Exploring Brunswick amidst wedding festivities was a treat, especially with Lynna's insider tips. The room was comfortable with ample amenities like storage, mood lighting, and a smart TV. Kudos to the hosts for creating such a safe and charming haven for travelers. Can't wait for my next escape to Jekyll/Brunswick – I know exactly where I'll be staying!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm glad to have stayed in the Garden Room at Lynna's place on my first visit to this area of Georgia. As a solo traveler, I felt safe within the neighborhood and the home itself. Daniel responded immediately when I needed assistance with the keypad entry (which turned out to be a simple misunderstanding on my part.) I was close to all the sights I wanted to see, and the other guests were quiet. I met Lynna and she recommend a great eatery, the Yellow Deli. This space is charming and an excellent value."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Lynna’s place was good for a quick stay! Just to be aware there is someone living in the attached unit and you can hear (and they can hear) everything so it’s important to be mindful and quiet when you stay here. You do get your own private room and Lynna was very nice to provide a dog bed for our puppies. Thanks again!

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Good impression!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely. The only drawback was that we werent allowed in the kitchen, so if i wanted to rinse a cup out i had to use the bathroom. It was hard to eat anywhere except in the room, i mean there was the hightop table next to the closed door to the kitchen but no paper towels no fork or any utensils available, couldnt really feel comfortable as i believe, the concierge Daniel, really lives on the premises which made things a little awkward for me as he was there 24/7 and he is the one who said we could not use the kitchen. The description indicated shared space i just never dreamed we would be in just a room and not allowed in kitchen, i could not even reheat my cinnamon roll plus i was told i would get to have a shot of espresso at 7 and daniel would make it, however, i never saw him and i had to go to work as i live here and was just trying to get away from my roomies. Had we been allowed to use premises especially kitchen i think i would have had a more pleasant stay."

The Yellow Daily is a must restaurant to visit."

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little tiny home in historic Brunswick. Church right across the street with bells, but they must be on a timer because I didn't hear them through the night time hours. Bed and pillows were super soft, which is not my preference, but might be perfect for others. Shower took some time to warm up, which might not be a problem in summer months, but it was a particularly cold weekend in January when I was there. Mary was an excellent host, very responsive. Decor is so lovely. All in all, a very nice space at a good price."

So glad I found the cottage"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little cottage! Great location half way between Jekyll and St. Simon’s. History all around…and St. Mark’s Episcopal church bells added a bit of magic….) Comfortable/homey feel with all amenities needed. Definitely will return!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cozy little studio. It’s in a great location, walkable to restaurants downtown. It was comfortable and simple. The internet was not great. It was coming from the main house next door, and the signal was not very strong. Mary responded very quickly to my message and had the guests in the main house reset the router/extender, but it didn’t seem to get much better. Just keep that in mind if you need wifi during your stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely charming cottage. Well decorated and clean. Just minutes away from the Golden Isles. Downtown Brunswick was a quaint little town. ❤️
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Mary’s place!! The space was really clean, bigger than it looked from the photos, and had everything we could’ve needed plus lots of thoughtful touches- Mary even left bowls, a bed, and treats for our pup. We booked last minute (and then extended our stay last minute, too!) and Mary was super responsive and accommodating of us. If you’re a light sleeper and like sleeping in, maybe bring earplugs as we found that the area was a bit louder than we’re used to with cars, church bells, children playing etc., but an easy fix with earplugs. Loved our stay and would absolutely come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mary's place was the perfect spot to stay for our trip to St. Simon and Jekyll Island.

The space was small but very cute and cozy. It was clean, smelled really nice, and had all the amenities you would want for a short trip. She was also very considerate in leaving treats, a dog bed, and bowls for our dog. Mary was communicative and quick to respond. Check-in and -out directions were clear and easy. I would stay here again!"

Mary is responsive and thoughtful.
We were in town for a wedding in Jekyll Island which is a 20 minute ride We even ventured out to St. Simons since we had extra time.
The cottage is very walkable to downtown Brunswick, the city is small and friendly. If you plan on eating in town, it’s best to call ahead to find out hours of operation for the small businesses.
The cottage is clean and safe.
Our chocolate Labrador was excited for the treats and sleeping pad!
We enjoyed our champagne 🍾"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great!! I wanted a little weekend getaway for two plus a dog near a beach and this was perfect!! We went to both Jekyll and St. Simon Islands. The drive to both was about equal distance, the cottage is right in the middle of both island entryways, so very close!! The neighborhood around the cottage was nice. Could hear live music at night, and walking distance to restaurants, but not after 9:30. The town shuts down pretty early. The place itself was really cute, clean, comfortable and thoughtful. We had what we needed plus a few extra touches that were nice. Overall I had a great time at the salon cottage!!
As an added bonus I love this places history as I am a hairstylist myself 😉🦋🪶🐚"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying in this cute historic district of Brunswick. There were cute shops and a few restaurants nearby though we spent most of our time on St. Simons for the beaches. This was a quote and almost traffic-free location and very peaceful. As described, has a microwave and mini-fridge. If you plan to use to heat up food, etc. plan to bring your own plates and cutlery as well as there are none for use. A very nice place, minimal amenities, but the basics of what you need and very reasonably priced. Mary wrote and note and left a few beverages which was a nice touch. She also proactively communicated before our arrival. She was a great host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Salon cottage is a great place to stay for two people. Mary thought of everything we could possibly need.

To go food or eat in all freshly made daily and within walking distance from The Salon cottage."

Had the issue solved in less than an hour which I appreciate. Another reviewer mentioned noise from kids at school - I found the kids and teachers voices and laughter comforting and homey; you could hear them on the playground behind the house but to me it was not disruptive"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Yeah - it’s only one room and the bathroom “privacy” is a barn door with a gap, but it was immaculate, comfortable, very well-appointed and only 0.3 miles from Indigo Shanty and Silver Bluff Brewing. It’s our 2nd trip with Mary, and she’s 2/2."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in the beautiful cottage. The bed is huge and very comfortable. Almost all amenities you can think of are included.
We just thought about three minor things, which could be improved:
- a larger table, so two people can sit together for a coffee or breakfast
- higher water pressure in the shower
- mirror in front of the sink would make shaving a lot easier (for men).
However, we would for sure book again and can only recommend to stay in this cottage."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Salon Cottage is a cute little place in the historic district of Brunswick. The location is convenient to Jekyll Island, where we attend a yearly weekend event, that we were able to commute with no problem. The history of the little cottage is what drew me to it, and I was not disappointed. I especially enjoyed the photos and references to the building’s previous life as a neighborhood beauty salon.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and a great place to stay if you want a hotel room sized place. Area is very quiet, surrounded mostly by churches. Only issue we had was parking due to church events in the evening, we had to park a block away and walk, this was not the host’s fault just the nature of being down town, but do keep that in mind. Overall, very happy."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very clean and comfy stay, with great amenities. Enjoyed the ease of the remote AC, and the nice big TV screen.
The only thing was- I was really surprised nobody mentioned in the reviews the noise of the children in the school behind the house. It was quite loud, and though I adore kids, and was a preschool teacher for years, their yelling beginning at 8:30 am was hard to sleep through. They seemed to have a lot of pent up energy, it was extra, and it was loud until noon.
I came needing to do some writing and other paperwork, it would have been good to know so I could plan around it, or make a different choice."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t describe enough how perfect this location was! Less than a 10 minute walk to so many locations. My boyfriend had to go to a job location and use the car for the day. But it was perfectly fine because I got to walk to coffee shops, stores, have lunch and walk right back to Mary’s place. I also took my dog which is highly reactive to other dogs but it was not an issue at all. I took her for many leashed walks and did not pass by another person walking a dog once. The backyard is also very private so I got to play fetch with her without having to worry about her reacting to another passing dog. Everything about the place and location was perfect! Definitely will be booking again the next time my boyfriend has a job down here."

The little touches like dog bowls, dish soap, etc were very helpful. Increasingly important as the summer comes, the AC and fans were perfect. The location was perfect too - we could choose St. Simon’s or Jekyll Island.
Be aware if you’re there on weekday afternoons that the kids on the playground in the school next door are having fun and can get loud! Headphones or a white noise machine will come in handy for those few hours."

Check in was easy, the location perfect for visiting the neighboring Islands or for a stroll through historic Brunswick. The cottage was refurbished to have all modern features and was the perfect and affordable getaway for our little family. The king size bed was comfortable and exactly what we needed to enjoy our ""baby moon"". We can only recommend Mary's place and we were very lucky to have been able to secure this gem for our stay."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem - clean, cozy, perfectly located and very unique!
My husband and I were visiting family at Jekyll Island and did not want to break the bank for our two-night stay. We also needed to bring our dog with us. Hotels on the island were pricey and the pet fees were insane.
Mary's Salon Cottage saved the day! It's only a 15 minute drive to Jekyll Island and it's within walking distance of Brunswick's historic downtown.
The cottage, which actually used to be a beauty salon in the 50s, had all the comforts of home and was perfect for a quick getaway. It was also very reasonably priced during our visit and the pet fees were affordable.
Mary was an excellent host and great communicator. She even provided extra touches like a handwritten note and treats go for our dog.
I highly recommend this host and property."

Easy access to Jekyll and St. Simons as well. We were surprised at how quiet the surrounding area was since it is downtown. I would definitely recommend staying here!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place for a couple getaway and if you have a dog she provides a dog bed and bowls and our dog loved it! Such a good time.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience!! Mary is an AWESOME host!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary’s cottage was absolutely perfect for our family vacation. It was just as described and pictured. It was just a walk away from downtown and had plenty of street parking for us to use. Small touches like water bottles and champagne were very nice and we felt like we were home the minute we stepped through the door. Once thing we wishes we had was some type of small table or a luggage rack to put our bags on but that’s just a very small thing that wouldn’t deter us from coming back. Mary was so kind when we met her on the second day. We would suggest this place to anyone and we will for sure be going back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a beautiful cottage. There’s a lovely little restaurant within walking distance. The bed is soooo comfortable. The little back yard is lovely. We had a great stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place for someone traveling solo because it’s both private and safe. It’s also a great location for proximity to both St. Simons and Jekyll Islands. Mary is attentive, welcoming, and check-in was a breeze."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is amazing for exploring the golden isles, and the space is small but comfy. Bring bug spray for the mosquito’s outside though."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about how great my experience was here. The place was so clean and neat, and it had all the right touches for a homey stay. It was a perfect base for spending time on Jekyll with my pup. I felt incredibly safe and secure as a woman traveling alone. The private backyard space was really nice with having a dog. The location is really perfect - near the main drags yet so quiet at the same time. The neighborhood was great for those little walks with the dog. Thank you Mary for such a great place!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We found everything to be exactly as described. The location is perfect. The beaches are close and easy to get to. Mary is a great host and very communicable. We would definitely stay here any time we are coming to the area.

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect location to have peace and quiet but also easy access to Jekyll Island, St. Simons, or anything.
Also, just a short walk away is several coffee shops and a Yellow Deli that we loved so much.
We would definitely book again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a real jewel. Peaceful, encourages relaxation, well-equipped & very comfortable. The restoration is just perfect... well-done, lacking nothing while maintaining the feeling & authenticity of a historical low country cottage. In other words it's the sort of place that welcomes you to truly relax & accept all it offers. Exceptionally clean. Air conditioning system was perfect. Ceiling fans were the perfect touch. The lushness of the Palmetto & Magnolia trees made for an oasis on this quiet side street. Pre-arrival communication from the owner was timely & provided instructions / recommendations. Other than that I did not have a need to communicate with the owner because everything was as hoped for & perfectly met my needs.
I highly recommend this cottage as a base from which to explore Brunswick, St Simons, Darien, & the barrier islands."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a charming place. The decor was amazing and Mary has everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Perfect location and quiet. Immaculate decor.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary’s place was absolutely perfect! It looked just like the photos. It felt so homey and cozy. She suggested we go to First Friday and we were actually able to walk downtown in less than 15 minutes. Will definitely be staying again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place in a beautiful part of town.
Coco’s Cottage was even better than the photos captured. Everything about the place felt thoughtfully and carefully done. It’s very stylish and very comfortable.
Everything we needed was provided. From the comfy bed to the spacious shower, the well equipped kitchen to the peaceful garden. We enjoyed every part of it, having cosy evenings in the lounge and warm afternoons sitting eating and drinking on the deck overlooking the garden.
We had a great time visiting nearby Jekyll Island which is packed with history and incredible beauty. We also enjoyed driving around the surrounding area, taking in the lovely houses, trees and gardens.
Coco’s Cottage is very special, an ideal place from which to visit Brunswick and beyond. We can’t recommend it highly enough."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brunswick is the perfect in between place if visiting st Simon’s and Jekyll island.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful, quiet stay at this cute cottage. Right in the heart of the historic district, it was wonderful walking around the neighborhood and seeing the beautiful homes."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming…comfortable…convenient! Those are our three “C” words that describe Coco’s Cottage. Everything we needed was provided and we were easily able to day trip out to Jekyll or St. Simon for adventures. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying at Mary’s place. It was more spacious than we expected. Both the interior and the yard reminded me of what you would see in a magazine. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Definitely would stay there again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our anniversary trip to Cocos Cottage! Mary was kind enough to leave a handwritten note and a bottle of wine for us.

When I reached out with a question Stacy responded within minutes! Overall, great experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We chose this place to be near to our son. It was a great house and within walking distance to downtown Brunswick. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here during the weekend of my wedding on Driftwood Beach. The location of the cottage was so convenient, as both Jekyll and St. Simon’s were less than a 30 minute drive away. The street is very quiet, and the home has a rustic charm with lovely decor and the most comfortable beds! There’s a cute deli around the corner called The Yellow Deli, which has amazing food!
Our hosts Mary and Stacie were so nice and accommodating! I needed assistance with something and Stacie came right away to help and was extremely nice! They also wrote a sweet card congratulating us on the wedding and left us a bottle of wine, which was super nice!
My absolute fave AirBnB stay! I hope to return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just a peaceful and calm home. Loved every minute of our stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for three days and swore we could've just moved right on in. The house is well-decorated and redone as far as the finishes are concerned. The space is easily found but nestled in a wealth of greenery with shrubs and trees: the view from inside the windows is peaceful and serene. The king bed in the main bedroom was extremely comfortable and the kitchen was outfitted with everything you could need. Having a cup of hot coffee on the front porch is highly recommended. Great spot!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coco Cottage was perfect for the two of us. The house was well furnished. The bed and linens were top quality. The towels were soft and thick; it was like we were at home. There was a nice personal note and a delicious bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived, such a great gesture. We were within walking distance of many beautiful historical homes and a short bike ride from downtown. Brunswick has a long and interesting history worth learning. Mary was very responsive and offered many helpful suggestions. We would definitely stay here again."

Thx again for a great stay Henry."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if i could give 10 stars i would … Henry was THE sweetest host ive had and was very proactive and attentive. check in was easy, the decor was so cute and vintage, the fridge was cleared out for us and he had many snacks, water bottles and milk for us as well. we didn’t see him that much, but when we did it was always a very friendly interaction as well as caring (did we need anything, are we comfortable,etc). i come to the 912 area every year and hope to be a guest again with Henry next year.
i booked in advance by about 1 month and a half, so it wasn’t super pricey but even still you couldn’t ask for better service for the price paid :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Henry is a superlative host. Every need was anticipated and the snacks made one feel comforted after a long day of interstate 95. Henry even brought me a razor when I asked him if he had one. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, and it’s easy to get to St. Simons from there, too. I enjoyed it so much more than a budget motel. Highly recommend Henry’s place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brunswick is a fun place to visit with a lot of good restaurants. I have stayed with Henry before and usually have the place to myself. Always very clean and quiet. In todays high prices of motels this is a blessing.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night but we really enjoyed our stay. There were clear instructions for everything, bedroom was super clean and Henry provided fresh fruit, snacks, coffee and milk as well as bottled water. The only downside was that the bathroom floor was pretty dirty (a lot of hair); apart from that, everything was perfect and we would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A business meeting brought me to Henry’s. The location, price , and reviews hooked me.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have been an AirBnB customer for several years, with multiple stays. I am able to rate Henry's accommodations as offering one of the very best stays ever.

Henry is excellent at providing detailed instructions for everything - this is so important when you are staying in a house you are not familiar with. He is clearly committed to providing a great experiences for guests. The bed was comfy and beautifully made. I even got a welcome gift. Highly recommend if you need a private room but don't mind a shared bathroom."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Henry's place was spotless, comfortable, and all of his instructions for getting in and getting situated were clear and easy to follow. He clearly puts a ton of care into creating a great guest experience as evidenced by how clean it was and the unexpected welcome bag of goodies and a thank you note. I briefly got to meet him on my way out and he was very kind and grateful I'd chosen to stay with him. It's clear to me why he's earned the ""Guest Favorite"" badge."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was economical and in the perfect location for us, as this was close to our son’s FLETC graduation site, and 30 minutes away to a Jekyll Island visit. This Airbnb was easy to locate off the interstate. Henry is a great host. His hotel experience shines through. He provides clear instructions, and responds within minutes of your messages. The bed was comfortable, the wifi worked great, and the bathroom was spacious with a good working shower head. He left out snacks for us to consume which was a nice touch.

Our room and bed was very comfortable. We had the use of the entire common areas including a dedicated guest refrigerator. We had never seen such a variety of snacks in any other Airbnb places.

When I got to my room I was greeted with a little goodie bag, it’s the attention to detail for me. The kitchen has a whole set up full of snacks and coffee. Home was very quiet and clean. Cleanest shared bathroom I’ve ever stayed at and I’ve stayed at others. I was only here one night, for the price of stay it was 10 mins from the ceremony I was attending. So perfect location if you’re attending the graduation for the academy. It’s 25 mins from Jekyll island and the historic district. I would definitely stay again if I was ever in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There are people who do things because they have to do them; and then there are people who do them with utmost love.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in the Brunswick area, this is the place for you. Henry's place is a step back in time, but very comfortable and homey. Henry's southern charm and kindness can't be matched. The little extras of leaving a gift bag of candy and welcome card in your room, candy dish when you enter to coffee and snack area in the kitchen. Comfy bed with very nice linens and towels. Best value for your money. Our second time staying there and I'm confident we'll return"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I needed a place to stay the night during our road trip and Henry’s home was a perfect place to catch some zzz’s before continuing on our way. It is a unique set up unlike any we have stayed at in the states. It reminds me of a youth hostel we visited in the Netherlands but with much more charm and personal touches that make you feel like you are being welcomed back than just a passer by. Although we never met Henry, we communicated well via the Airbnb app. Our stay was great and the bed was comfortable. The snacks and coffee was great way to start off our morning too!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Henry's place has always been a great place to stay for me. I think I am going on 6 stays so far. His place is always warm and inviting and very comfortable. It is clean, safe and very quiet and I have never had any issues while staying there. He really takes pride in his house and he is a great host.
One aspect of his place that I really love, and it is something simple but makes a big difference for me, is the fact that he ""Does Not Use"" any artificially or strong scented laundry detergent or scented dryer sheets or any of that artificially scented stuff on his sheets and towels. I am highly allergic to those artificial fabric scents and it makes a world of difference to be able to use the towels and sheets without having to deal with that aspect of it. The linens are super clean and fresh, but not smelling like some chemically altered flowers or whatnot... So, for that aspect alone, it is a great place for me to stay, but just overall, his place is super homey and a great place to stay for a night or even long term."

Temperature set at comfortable range and I brought our own blanket to use on top of crisp clean white sheets. Henry does have as pictured in this room the comforter and Plenty of pillows. Henry even had treats for us in room and soda and an assortment of creamers in fridge. This was the perfect place for us and well worth the price.

Fortunately, I didn’t have to share the bathroom because there wasn’t another guest. The picture doesn’t do the property justice. Also Henry has GREAT snacks! Fresh fruit and the coffee bar was my favorite! Definitely not my last stay!
So may great things to say about my stay! I didn’t want to leave the first day so I stayed in and enjoyed my room. Very peaceful! Also Henry was so accommodating especially with my schedule! All in all you won’t be disappointed if you book."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a very comfortable stay at Henry’s! Would absolutely recommend. Loved everything about it.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is fabulous! It’s easy to see why he is a super host. Everything is so thought out. He really goes the extra mile. Thanks for everything Henry, we will be back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Prior to my arrival Henry took time to answer my questions. As soon as you walk into his home you immediately can tell the care that goes into this home just by how clean it is. You then notice the details throughout the home; like each room has it's own code and the bathroom has great scented tiny bottles (shampoo, shower gel, etc.). I appreciate the heartfelt details including a variety of snacks and chocolates. Not only that, I met a lovely couple that was staying in the room next to mine. We talked for a bit in the living space (very comfortable) and decided to go to dinner together. Lot's of restaurants to choose from, we chose ""Reid's"" they offer delicious dinner specials and $5 happy hour. In my one day stay at Henry's I enjoyed meeting 2 great people, had an amazing dinner, laughs, snacks, and a restful and peaceful evening... Thank you Henry!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extremely hospitable and welcoming. Plenty of amenities to make your stay comfortable. Great communication and convenient location if you’re traveling due to close proximity to 95.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Henry is great!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed a lovely overnight stay in Henry's beautiful home. Henry is a most gracious host who goes above and beyond to make sure his guests are comfortable. Everything about this experience was all that airbnb is about. I highly recommend this place to anyone needing accommodation in the area.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, we easily saw why Henry is a Superhost… in fact, we consider him a “Super-Duperhost” because of his warm welcome, genuine concern for my husband and me, and his kindness. Easy check-in, super clean home, comfy bed… plus his local travel suggestions all added to our memorable stay. His amenities were much appreciated - extra towels and pillows, snacks including cookies, chips, and fruit, a full-size Keurig machine with to-go coffee cups, and bottled water, soda, and milk chilled in the fridge. We look forward to staying with Henry again when back in the area… HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Henry is the gold standard for airbnb in my book. All the LaQuinta training has paid off. A pleasure to stay as his guest. I recommend him highly.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Henry certainly is gifted with hospitality! We felt so at home and enjoyed a great night’s rest, extra clean accommodations with lots of towels, soaps, big screen TVs and even remote ceiling fan and lighting, special treats including coffee, fresh fruit, muffins, cookies etc. We appreciate all Henry does to make his guests feel special!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Henry’s place could not have been better.. truly felt like I was at a 5 star hotel! Henry was very personable and immediately available for any communication needs. Made for an excellent visit to the Isles!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay. Henry is the consummate host. He takes your comfort seriously. I just stayed overnight. But it was a very relaxing visit. His home is very clean and tidy.
Henry communicated promptly. With a plethora of information. Parking in front of the house. Check in is a breeze. Love the push button door locks. Nice to have a lock on your bedroom door as well. Nice size room. Big closet. Very comfortable bed. I slept very well. Night stands and lamps on both sides of the bed. Ceiling fan as well. Bathroom was spacious and very clean. Plenty of towels. And hot water. There are small bottles of shampoo, body wash and lotion provided. WiFi was strong. Worked well. What Henry provides in the kitchen is amazing! Snacks galore! Fresh cookies. Huge oversized muffins for breakfast. Chips. Packaged cookies. In the refrigerator you will find water and soft drinks. A keurig coffee maker with coffee provided. Along with cream, sugar and tea. A very generous offering. Easy off and on from I-95. If you’re hungry I suggest the barbecue place on your way to Henry’s home.
I highly recommend a stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Henry was one of those FLAWLESS HOST that took care of EVERYTHING and provided me with 5 STARS service equal to a fine hotel, incredible attention and genuine southern hospitality! GO NOWHERE ELSE if you plan a trip to Brunswick! : )"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of my best airbnb stays! Henry is a wonderful host. Henry provided all the detailed information right after booking and check-in was such a breeze. The house is lovely, sparkling clean and cozy. I enjoyed the bed, tv and snacks etc. etc. Henry has thought of every detail to make the perfect stay and he is so kind and caring. I highly recommend staying at Henry's place if you are in the area!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check in was easy, and the whole place was beautifully furnished and comfortable. There were keypads on the bedroom doors so lots of security and privacy. The bed was supportive and comfortable. The area was quiet and easy to find. The food was a lovely touch and the amenities were everything you could want. Henry is communicative, helpful, and hospitable. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is by far the best Airbnb experience to date. Host answered all my questions and he was very fast to communicate and provide all details for my stay. The place was immaculate. Easy to get to know and host anticipates all your needs for your stay. I would stay again in a heartbeat.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Henry's house is beautiful, clean, extremely confortable, plently of good details, and he is a friendly host as i never seen in de traveling around the world. Book with him and get the best in Brunswick, Ga. I swear."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you ever find yourself wanting to stay in the Brunswick area, Henry's place is the place to stay. He is a super personable and nice guy, his place is very clean and he has everything you would need for a pleasant stay.
My one night stopover at his place started off a bit convoluted, as a tropical storm slammed the area the night I was suppose to bunk there and I had to postpone my trip by one day. However, Henry was able to reimburse my previous night stay and I was able to rebook my stay at his place the following night with no issues.
The bed was very comfortable, there were lots of clean, fresh towels in the bathroom and he had put out plenty of drinks in the fridge and snacks on the counter in the kitchen. I was able to cook some dinner and breakfast for myself too. It was very secure in the house as the bedroom has its own keypad door lock. I had access to his huge TV in the family room with Netflix and Hulu and other streaming services and also another nice size tv in the bedroom. Nice and safe neighborhood too, just a mile away from I-95. Outside, I could hear some road noise, but once inside the house, it was dead silence and no noise from the highway or surrounding streets at all.
I would definitely stay there again if and when I am traveling through the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Henry’s place! The room was spotless, fresh towels were put out daily, and the kitchen was stocked with many beverages and snacks. Henry was incredibly thoughtful and friendly. He truly has the gift of hospitality and thought of quite literally everything. I’ll always remember how the toilet paper was folded into a little point each morning :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Very easy to get everywhere I needed to go. The house was spotless and Henry kept cold drinks in the fridge, coffee to make, and a variety of snacks. He has a better setup than any hotel I’ve stayed at. The bedroom had a large TV mounted on the wall and wifi access is provided. You really can’t go wrong staying here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Henry’s place is conveniently located a mile off of I-95 in a quiet neighborhood. The keyed door locks were very easy to operate and safe. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of bottled water, sodas, hot tea and coffee along with a nice selection of fresh fruit, cookies, crackers, and muffins. The decor is definitely retro 70s in a fun way, but also providing the latest amenities like internet, cable and streaming services.
If you need a safe, clean, affordable place to stay within reach of many services and tourist sites then I definitely recommend checking out Henry’s place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to get away for the weekend. The home has so much charm. Super clean with all the little extras included! We loved it! Would recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was wonderful, and everything was as described. The house is beautiful, clean and had everything that we needed. It was also in walking distance from a cute little deli within the neighborhood. We enjoyed every bit of our stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary was a great host. the residence was extremely what we needed for the weekend. It was spacious and comfortable. We had a nice bottle of wine and a welcome letter from Mary, which I thought was pretty cool. Overall are stay was fantastic, we lived the home and would stay there again in the future if needed."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although an older home, it was well laid out with spacious and unique rooms. I especially liked the bathtub. Furnishings were interesting and decor matched the tone of the home. The entry was very easy with a bench next to the door that was helpful. I think the hidden gem in town is The Yellow Deli just down the street. Their down home menu selections and prices are excellent, service is top notch. It's a homey atmosphere. I brought home a loaf of homemade bread. I also liked the Coastal Kitchen for the outside seating views and good food. Overall, it was a fun first visit for just a few days packed with places to see and things to do. I recommend Driftwood Beach, the lighthouse, and Sea Palms golf course. It was easy getting to St Simons Island and Jekyll Island for golf and shopping."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay in Mary's historic bungalow. The neighborhood was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. Mary gave excellent recommendations of restaurants and activities nearby. I would be happy to stay there again.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute house, great spot if you want to check out both St Simon’s and Jekyll Island. About a 30 min walk to downtown Brunswick, cute coffee shop (Daddy Cate’s) and good pizza spot (Arte Pizza)."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little bungalow! Great location - not far from downtown Brunswick, St. Simons Island, and Jekyll Island. Perfect little backyard space for our dogs. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return! Cannot recommend Mary & her place enough!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed at the cottage for a wedding at Cedar Lodge and it was perfect for us to get ready in with the big bathrooms to do hair and get all glammed up. The house was beautiful kept and decorated. Comfortable beds and a great kitchen. Super relaxing place and quiet neighborhood! We enjoyed our morning walk through the neighborhood with our coffee and met the most friendly cats down the street!! Best place we’ve stayed in yet!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The house had everything we needed and was perfect for our two night stay while in town for a college visit. The house is old and full of character. Check-in was very easy and the handwritten note and bottle of wine was a nice surprise from Mary.

Couldn't ask for anything more. I understand why her ratings are at the very top - she deserves every star."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay. Very roomy, charming, well appointed, comfortable and clean. Neighborhood is terrific for walking. We felt very welcomed with our Labrador Retriever (there were even biscuits to greet him). Loved morning coffee on the porch and evening cocktails there too. Mary is a superb host with great communication before and during our stay. We wished we could have stayed longer and definitely recommend this superb accommodation."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home was located in an ideal spot...between Jekyll and St. Simons. The house was like stepping back in time. I appreciated the architecture and cool details with modern conveniences.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, quaint bungalow in historical district of Brunswick! Easy, short drive into downtown. Mary was great and responded quickly to questions. Bungalow included everything you need! She even left us a bottle of wine for our anniversary!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was a awesome host. House was spotless. She was easy to communicate with and when I had an issue with to keypad, she contacted me in less than 5 minutes. It was me and not the keypad. Will use her as a host again!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at this cute home! It's a bit of a walk to downtown (very easy drive), but the setting of the home itself is very peaceful. The house is very nice, and was spotless when we arrived. The kitchen especially stood out."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Easy commute to Jekyll Island! Mary was very responsive! Very cool house!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in historic Old Town Brunswick. Convenient to dining, shopping and especially to beautiful Jekyll and Saint Simons islands. This accommodation could not have been any better, and Mary is a considerate, professional host. All was perfect."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at Mary's with our dog and it was just as great as the first time.
Very clean and also close to everything you could want in an airbnb. We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect home for visiting the Georgia coast. Location was great. Home was extremely comfortable with a very well stocked kitchen. Did I say I loved the location? Nice walk to the historic part of town to wonderful restaurants (or you can drive). Mary also included helpful guides for the area. She was very kind and answered our questions immediately. Would love to return in the fall. Two nights was too short.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's place was exactly as described and was great for a quiet girls trip. It was located conveniently to our interests in Brunswick, as well as St Simon's and Jekyll. The home was spacious, and the neighborhood felt safe. We definitely recommend to anyone visiting to try Reids Apothecary and it's hidden Speakeasy! Thank you Mary for letting us stay in your lovely house!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place with a great host - I highly recommend it!
The place was easy to find and exactly as described in a perfect location. It was spotlessly clean, the furniture nicely arranged and it immediately felt like home. The house is really nice with a big shower and tub, long dining room table, excellent dimmable lighting and a great kitchen.
The couches in the living room are narrow and low, so as a tall person I found it more comfortable sitting on them lengthwise. The coffee was terrible (just my opinion) so I bought some local. The fancy microwave / toaster oven was very modern but difficult to operate. The location of the dishes and cups were oddly placed in the cabinets but maybe that was just me, it took me a hot minute to find things. These are micro critiques - if you're looking for a great home with an extremely responsive and awesome host I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home in a great location. Mary was very communicative and let us know there was a block party during our stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. The home was beautiful and the bottle of wine she left was delicious. Very cute comfortable antique home. I felt like we stayed in a museum. The house was very clean and we had everything we needed for our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very quaint house, secluded quiet neighborhood with amazing old oak trees.
Easy check-in, comfortable and clean. Enjoyed taking walks around neighborhood in the evenings.
Found some great places to eat nearby in downtown Brunswick."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for group trips. Really close to Jekyll Island beach. special attention to details. We had two dogs and Mary accommodated for them as well.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful welcome gift and smooth check in. Roomy accommodations, comfortable mattresses and neighborhood full of beautiful oak trees and traditional southern homes. Wooden floors, claw foot tub and large front porch make this place unique. Short, easy drive to great restaurants and adventures to Brunswick, St Simons or Jekyll Island."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home in nice, quiet neighborhood. The only inaccuracy in the pictures is that it doesn’t capture just how amazing, and large, the house actually is. Mary, our host was very proactive in ensuring that we had a smooth check-in and stay, and even left us a small gift to celebrate my wife’s graduation event we came in for. It was a wonderful personal touch, and made us feel very welcome and at home. I highly recommend a stay here, and will stay again if I’m back in the area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was exactly as described; beautiful, comfortable and just what we were looking for. The location is equal distance between Jekyll Island and St. Simons. Would definitely come back and stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for my wedding and loved the house it was beautiful and Mary is a great host!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mary's place really was a home away from home. I could work remotely on the wifi while taking in the century-old live oaks with the Spanish miss swinging in the breeze. Then, I could walk up to the commercial district for a top notch meal. I had an excellent stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s place was a great place for my son and I to stay to visit Jekyll Island. The house is lovely and had ample space to relax.
The clawfoot tub was a wonderful extra and was lovely to relax in after a day at the beach.
The house is easy to find and was close to downtown Brunswick and also close to Jekyll Island.
There are plenty of linens, the kitchen is well set up and having a washer and dryer in the house is really nice.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. I would recommend it to others. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. We felt right at home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Mary’s Cottage in historic Brunswick, suited two private people well. The home is on the same block as one of the “squares” and we felt comfortable walking in the area. Location is easily accessible from the Lanier Bridge. Good restaurants locally. Also 15 minutes from either St Simon’s or Jekyll Island’s beaches. We would come back. Appreciated both a shower and a claw foot tub with shower."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming and well-kept home within historic Brunswick. Very clean and well-appointed with covered off-street parking onsite. Convenient to both Jekyll and St. Simons islands. One note: both entrances have several steps up in case you have mobility issues. The only downside was that the thermostat was set to 71 degrees and was locked. Tried to contact Mary about this and didn't get a response, but it could have just been a miscommunication. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Mary’s place! It was a short drive to FLETC which was very convenient for us. Mary was very kind and responsive

House was a very decent size, clean, and we were all very comfortable as if we were in our own home. Thank you once again for having us, Mary!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay in Brunswick discovering Jekyll Island and St. Simons Island.

Centrally located, the house is an easy drive to visit Jekyll and Saint Simon Island. Mary was a great host and provided detailed information."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quite spacious home. Clean and cute decor, but not overdone. Pretty quiet neighborhood and exactly 1 mile from downtown which we bicycled to for breakfast.
It was just me and my wife so it was more home than we really needed but we're not complaining. If you enjoy walks in old neighborhoods, go two blocks west and walk Union st all the way to downtown (20-25 min walk) and all the 100 yr old large homes."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! Extremely spacious. Everything needed was there.
Lovely decor! We so enjoyed our stay!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, historic home full of character and lovely details in a friendly family neighborhood with a mixture of Victorian mansions and modest bungalows. The house had comfortable beds, large shower, plenty of towels & hot water; comfy furniture in living room. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies although we did not cook. We liked to sit on front porch in late afternoon where neighbors walking their dogs always greeted us; kids after school smiling & waving, too. House was a 20 min drive to Jekyll & St Simon Islands, 30 min drive to Darien to visit historic sites. Mary was such a gracious host, very attentive & quick to respond. We look forward to another visit."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful historic cottage. All the amenities you need to feel at home and have an enjoyable stay. Location is quiet and centrally located. Check in was super easy.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and Mary was very helpful with recommendations, etc. We arrived on a Monday evening, and the Brunswick downtown area is pretty quiet on Mondays. There were two pizza shops open and also Yellow Deli which I highly recommend for breakfast of lunch. This location is very closely situated to get to Jekyll and St. Simon Island which was perfect for us. The house was a bit chilly as we had a cold spell and the themostat was locked but after contacting Mary she promptly turned up the heat. The TV is an apple TV and there are certainly enough channels and also netflix. We had some trouble lowering the master bedroom shades and Mary came over promptly and had the magic touch. I only mention this because I would suggest that you try to lower the shades before it gets too late as not to bother Mary after hours. We enjoyed our vist and would recommend this adorable cottage."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This stay was absolutely perfect for our stay. The kitchen has everything you would need and the neighborhood was great to walk.

This little cottage was immaculate.. we do not have pets, but this is a very pet friendly house. I would not have guesed by how immaculately clean it was. Beautifully appointed with period decor.

Not noisy at all for being on a corner. Would definitely (and plan to) rent again!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you haven’t been to Brunswick Georgia yet then you’re missing out! I lived in the town for almost ten years and my daughter and I rented this house to come for Christmas to see old friends.
There’s a lot to do within walking distance of the house and because it’s in the historic district you’ll have many lovely houses to view during your stay.
The house is small yet functional with a great front porch, tip top kitchen and everything you need to make your stay in Brunswick memorable."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary is a great hostess. Really quick to respond to questions. The house was very neat and clean. The kitchen has everything you need to cook or bake. Has a nice gas range. That’s what we prefer to cook on. We only used one bed and it was very comfortable. All said our stay was very pleasant.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Communication was very good. Would definitely recommend this house. Enjoyed our stay
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is a GEM. The location is awesome. Very close to St. Simon’s Island, Jekyll island and an easy hour drive to Savannah. Stocked with the essentials. We had small children with us and I liked that the house was clean and uncluttered. They could play without me being afraid that they’d break something. There are a few breakable knick-knacks, but they’re tucked away safely in a cabinet. Downtown Brunswick is super cute and very close to the house. Mary was polite but unobtrusive. The kitchen is great, we used it quite a bit during the stay. Had everything we needed. Five stars for sure!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Communication was clear, photos are 100% accurate, and the little bungalow was beautiful!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing home in a great location close to St. Simons and Jekyll Island. The home is exactly as pictured. It is very spacious with a beautiful kitchen, dining room, and living room. The beds were comfy and it was a great space for three people. We would definitely recommend this home for your next trip to the area!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and well appointed house in the historic district. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. Carport and covered entry were welcomed features during a rain storm. If you’re traveling with a dog you’ll find a small, but sufficient, fully fenced backyard. The WiFi is strong enough for streaming but was spotty on the screened back porch. Bed and linens are quality and comfortable. Air conditioning is strong.
I have one nit to pick, and if it weren’t for AirBnB’s dumb rating system (where hosts have to continually get five star ratings) I’d ding her a star for this. Mary is a responsive and friendly host. But she does something that some other hosts do which really annoys me. Though not a majority. When I look to book a stay, I look at, in addition to price and location, the house rules. If I agree, I book. What I don’t like is finding additional rules after I arrive. In this case it was strip the bed, take out the trash and put the linen in the laundry room. I’m sorry but I’m not the housekeeper, especially when I’m paying a $132 cleaning fee. All of this should be in the listing prior to booking. Imagine if you book a room at a hotel and the manager leaves a list of things she wants you to do? Maybe we, as guests, should start dinging hosts that do this one star and explain why? I’m going to in the future. I also paid a $75 dog fee (not exclusive to Mary). But why? Because I kept my dog off your furniture and cleaned up her poop? One of the better AirBnBs I stayed at had a pet deposit and then refunded it after my stay. Anyway /rantoff and not directed solely at Mary, but some hosts in general. It really is a nice house. And you’d not make mistake staying here."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute house in a good location. Mary was helpful and communicative.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary's place was immaculate and in the perfect location. You can access Jekyll and St. Simons in a relatively short drive. Thanks again for letting us stay!!

Mary was understanding and prompt in helping my family out. 10/10 recommend!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Brunswick!! This place is exactly as advertised. It’s an older home but that’s part of the charm of this historic area. You’re 15 min driving from Jekyll Island or St. Simons. Try the rum distillery and brewery downtown as well as the amazing Reid’s Apothecary for dinner. We will be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for a month and were actually sad to leave! Cute dog friendly house conveniently located 10-15 minutes from FLETC, St. Simons and Jekyll Islands. Also, a great midway point between Savannah, GA and Jacksonville, FL.

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a lovely ""old"" house in a picturesque and historic part of Brunswick. And the location relative to Jekyll was as good as you can get without being on Jekyll. As you can see in the pictures, the house is in great shape and has everything that you would need, including WiFi. The many old live oaks and other trees in the area were just breathtaking, and one of those, The famous Lover's Oak, which is reportedly over 900 years old, was just a few blocks away. Just a lovely experience. Highly recommended!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for myself, my wife, and our dog. We stayed four nights and loved every minute. The home is clean, cozy, and nicely decorated. There is plenty to do in downtown Brunswick, but we spent of our time in St. Simmons area. Mary is a great host and made our trip effortless!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much for everything Mary!! The house was everything we wanted and more. We just simply fell in love with the southern charm! The house was closed to Brunswick’s downtown area, which is a great area to walk around and grab lunch or dinner. Jekyll Island and Driftwood beach were out of this world! We will definitely be back again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very pleasant stay at Logan’s Playhouse with our dog for a long-weekend getaway. We love staying in historic Brunswick because it’s 15 minutes away from Jekyll and Saint Simons, and also close to the fun things to do in Brunswick.
We loved the layout of the house. The living room is huge and the beds and baths are situated at the back for maximum privacy.
Our favorite space in the house was the screened porch! We drank our coffee there in the mornings.
Our dog thoroughly enjoyed the giant fenced in backyard.
Thank you to the hosts for a great weekend in the Golden Isles!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary’s place is lovely, it has a very homely feeling. Mary responded to my question very promptly.

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What first caught my attention , was the backyard was completely fenced in. Which gave me a piece of mind that I could let my Golden Retriever run after daily trips to Bruinswick, Simon and Jekyll Islands. She did provide a dog bed and feeding dishes for my Golden which I had already brought his things with us. Appreciate the floor fan that was provided which was used in the master bedroom to lower the temperature. Liked the washroom off the kitchen area and the patio area was very nice and relaxing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,London’s playhouse was a great place for our family. Mary was a considerate and responsive host.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I rented London’s Playhouse for two weeks over the holidays. I was so impressed with the accommodations, Mary had decorated for the holidays, which was such a welcoming treat and made us feel like we were in our home away from home. The home was well stocked - more than any Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. We felt comfortable and well cared for. I also appreciated that they were inclusive of my 100lb dog, as most places have weight restrictions in place for rental. He absolutely loved the backyard! The location was fantastic, we took daily walks down Union St to admire the historic homes, and were able to easily get to St Simons and Jekyll Island with a quick drive. We loved it and would definitely rent again!"

The swing out back is my kids favorite thing to do after sitting on the screened in porch and enjoying fresh air and nature. Mary is so accommodating and her customer service is great. We will make this our Air bnb whenever we are in town.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house on 3rd Avenue was perfect for us. It was within walking distance to downtown. It was the perfect size for our family of 5. The backyard was perfect for our dogs. We lacked nothing. Thank so much, Mary!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host and lovely home!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house met our basic needs: it's clean, beds are comfortable, kitchen is basic but functional. The house is older and not in tip-top shape, e.g, loose faucets (we notified host) but the location in a quiet neighborhood fairly close to downtown is nice."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is our second time visiting at London's Place. We loved it just as much as the first time and can't wait to visit again. Thanks so much to Mary for making our visit comfortable. Everything was so nice and clean. She provided us and our dogs an amazing place to stay for our trip.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home, really enjoyed the screened in porch, everything was very clean, decor top notch… no issues."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mary's place was a great place for our family to stay. We appreciated being so close to downtown Brunswick, Jekyll Island and St. Simon's Island. The fenced in backyard was great for our 2 small dogs. Mary was a wonderful host, answered all our questions and provided great local recommendations. She was very responsive and gave us advanced notice of what to expect. We definitely recommend her place for families with or without a dog!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay, everything was as advertised. No problems"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a couples retreat, and the house, location, and especially the back screen in porch was the best part for us!!!!! Absolutely beautiful 😍"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice location in a home just a few doors away from historic Union Street. Quick and easy access to downtown Brunswick. BTW - Basil Thai & Sushi downtown is quite good.
An easy 15 minute drive gets you to either St. Simons or Jekyll Island.
Beds were very comfortable. Plenty of hot water. Large fenced in backyard for your dog. Great amenities.
Overall, if you are in this area, Mary's home is a great place to stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay during our recent stay at your lovely house in Brunswick, GA. The house is well-maintained and tastefully decorated, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately made us feel at home. The attention to detail was evident in every corner, and we appreciated the little touches that made our stay extra special.
One of the highlights of our visit was the proximity to the beach. Being only 15 minutes away allowed us to enjoy the stunning sunsets and walks along the beach.
Your quick responses to our questions and willingness to accommodate our needs made our stay even more enjoyable. We felt well taken care of and appreciated your thoughtful recommendations for local dining and activities in your guidebooks and text updates.
Our entire family had a wonderful time in Brunswick. We will cherish the memories we made during our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Houise was wonderful and we were greeted with a bottle of wine and a couple dog treats for our dog Basil. It was a great, and appreciated surprise"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location in Brunswick Georgia close to everything Saint Simons, and Jekyll would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mary was great, and always responsive. She responded within minutes, when I had a question. We picked this home due to it's location, and its fenced in back yard. We have two miniature dachshunds, and they loved the huge yard. It was very secure. I highly recommend this home, to anyone traveling with their fur babies!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a great time! This house is centrally located between St. Simons and Jekyll with a short 15-20 min drive to either place. House had everything you would need and is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. If we make it back down to the Golden Isles, we will certainly stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second trip to this location, love dealing with Mary, everything is easy, house is always clean and everything is great! Will stay again with Mary’s property next year!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Mary’s place was exactly like the pictures and she was so sweet and responsive! We felt right at home and it was only a 10 minute drive from Jekyll Island- it was exactly what we were looking for!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay. Close to everything. Clean and comfortable
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very Nice! We would love to go back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was cute and the ac worked great! The kitchen was very well stocked. It has lots of good local pamphlets and we went to a couple places that were outstanding. Iguanas restaurant was amazing and so was Palmers Village Cafe!! About 20 minutes to the beach. My grands had a blast!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay at house was ok.
Mary left nice note and a bottle of wine for us.
House was clean and ac worked well!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute older house convenient to both St. Simon's and Jekyll Islands. Mary is super quick to respond to messages and has thought of everything you need for a great stay--lots of little details included. The kitchen is well-stocked, and the beds are very comfortable. The screened porch is a nice addition for morning coffee.
This home is an excellent home base to drive to many local attractions, but the neighborhood is not a place we felt comfortable taking a long walk--too many overgrown yards, hungry gnats & mosquitos, and a few sketchy situations."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved this home. It had everything we needed. Clear instructions, lots of local recommendations, and extra blankets for lounging on the couch. We had a great time. Would definitely stay again. Everything was clean and it close to everything."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I've been apart of the Airbnb community for a long time, and Mary's place was one of the most pleasant stays I have ever had. The location is off the beaten path but close to everything you could want to do while visiting the Golden Isles. The local restaurants and beaches were fantastic and not overly crowded. Sometimes I feel like beach food has to always be fried, but we found so many places that catered to gluten free and vegetarians as well. Mary's home is clutter free, while also being very homey and comfortable. The back porch was one of my favorite places and the trees all around that area are magical. Everything worked the way it was supposed to and it was really nice to stay in an Airbnb that made us all feel very comfortable. She is also incredibly responsive. Most of my texts were returned in less than 5 minutes. This is a fantastic home away from home and the Golden Isles are definitely worth the trip."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home in Historic District. Great space, clean, comfortable. Would visit again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely gorgeous! Exactly like the photos, Mary was incredibly responsive and helpful. Great place super super cute.! The back screened in porch was lovely!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a lovely weekend away at Mary’s place! My wife and I along with our two pups had plenty of space and everything we needed for a relaxing stay, including a thoughtful welcome gift of wine and dog treats! There’s tons more closet space to use than in a typical Airbnb. Mary was a great host, proactive in sharing information and very responsive. We enjoyed the quick access to Jekyll. The neighborhood is beautiful- loved watching the sun filter through those Spanish moss draped oak trees!"

Such a great location! My dogs loved the fenced in yard! My whole family had such a great time! Thank you Mary for such a wonderful place for my family!!! We appreciate you!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first stay at Mary’s place. It was very nice and we plan to return next year. If you’re planning to enjoy fun in the sun on St. Simons Island and Jekyll Island, Mary’s place in Brunswick is a perfect home base. The fenced in backyard made it a great place for our dog."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Mary’s beautiful home for a few days leading up to our wedding. We have family in the Brunswick area and were thrilled to find such a perfect spot close by! The home was beautiful, clean and so cozy! It had everything we needed and Mary was so welcoming to our family, even down to our pup! We will definitely be back, thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"London's Playhouse was the absolute perfect stay. We were blown away by how clean the place was. Mary kept the place beautiful and had everything you could possibly need. She definitely thought of all the details to make our stay perfect. She was so very thoughtful not only for us, but also for our dogs. She provided a doggie bed, water bowls, and even a welcome biscuit for each of our dogs that came with us. She also provided a complimentary bottle of wine for us to enjoy.
Another thing I love about this place is how easy it was to get there. The location is perfect! There are several parks nearby to enjoy, and it is also situated near the downtown area. The Sidney Lanier Bridge to Jekyll is only a few minutes away making this a great place to stay. We will definitely book this place again. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,really nice home and host
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Mary's house was a perfect location to base out of while exploring the Georgia coast. Little touches made our trip even more enjoyable. Beds were wonderful and a good selection of pillows for those of us that are particular. The kitchen was well stocked. Thanks again Mary for your home.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Host was very responsive to all communications. House is very clean with lovely screened in porch and large, fenced in backyard. House has a well equipped kitchen. There are three steps leading to the front door, with no handrail, which is difficult to maneuver for anyone with mobility issues. The neighborhood is quiet and very walkable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,London’s Playhouse was perfect for us! The house was clean and neighbors were quiet and friendly. All things were in working order and spotless. Couch and beds were comfy. Master bath is on the small side but there are 2 bathrooms so it was no problem! Nice to have a washer and dryer also. Very clean and cozy. Highly recommend eating at Reid’s Apothecary. Thank you Mary!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary was very proactive with messages a few days before we arrived. Location was great for us since daughter and husband live nearby. Huge backyard - perfect for our dog. The place was very clean. Nice screen porch (a little chilly when we were there so did not get to enjoy). Kitchen was nicely furnished. There was even a dog treat and bowls for food/ water waiting on us. I would recommend Mary’s place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"While the place was simple, it was clean and comfortable and it met our needs while house hunting in Brunswick and terrific for our 2 pups. Mary is attentive and helpful."

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect location for our weekend get away. Located on a quiet neighborhood convenient to both St.Simon's Island and Jekyll Island. We were pleasantly surprised with the historic downtown area of Brunswick, and loved looking at the beautifully restored historic homes. Mary's house was very comfortable, the porch was a lovely place to enjoy our mornng coffee. There were no unpleasant surprises, the discription of this house was spot on."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of four, including two young children, loved our stay at London's Playhouse. We planned to spend most of our time on Jekyll Island and loved how convenient and easy it was to hop over to Jekyll Island then come back home for rest time or meals. This house made our vacation feel flexible and comfortable. Only good things to say about Mary and her communication with us plus generous things she did to make us feel welcome and appreciated! We would definitely stay here again. If you have children, there are three really awesome playgrounds within 5-7 minutes of the house, plus a magical tree swing in the backyard!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at London’s playhouse. Our family stayed on jeckyl island and so it was a very short drive to them. We brought our GSP dog and our 4 month old baby and we had more than enough space. The house was clean and had clear instructions. The backyard was amazing for our dog. The HVAC went out but Mary got it working by that same evening and it ran perfectly the entire rest of the trip. There was also lots of cute games and such at the home- we appreciated all she did to make our stay comfortable :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was comfortable and well equipped. Mary was quick to respond to email

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quality stay and in a fantastic area!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very great stay located near everything nice quite neighborhood
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the first time I've ever stayed in an Airbnb, and it far exceeded my expectations. It was clean, extremely comfortable and felt like home. In fact, the family members who stayed at an oceanfront resort ended up spending more time at the house. In addition, Mary was helpful and informative which put me at ease."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Plenty of towels, blankets, kitchen accessories, and pillows. A must when you stay away from home!
Clean and nice. Also the beds are comfy. Plenty big enough for our family of 6."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is truly a hidden gem! It’s close to everything on the island and it’s very clean and neat and well furnished. Our furry friend loved exploring the backyard. This was a great landing pad when we weren’t out adventuring.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back again! Mary was a gem and had great communication!! Thank you Mary , for your fast response and help. Our stay was very welcoming and relaxing. The house has everything we needed and our little dog enjoyed being able to join us on our family trip. Mary left dog treats which was so sweet! My dog is a picky and didn’t indulge, but we appreciate the sweet gesture. The location is great and not a busy sport. It is a prime spot for visiting Saint simons island and Jekyll island. The beaches are lovely and restaurants are plentiful. Dogs are welcome at a lot of the restaurants. Be sure to get there for an early dinner, because the restaurants get busy by 6pm and parking can take some time. Saint simons island welcomes dog from sunset and Jekyll island has beach spots where dogs are welcome. We had a lot of fun, thank you!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location and very comfortable house. Easy access to Jekyll and St. Simons, the best of both worlds. Nice clean house in quiet neighborhood. Perfect spot for exploring the area!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary’s house is a great place to stay if you are visiting St. Simons or Jekyll Island. Really close to both places, you can make more than one trip, if needed, each day. Mary’s house provided everything we needed and was comfortable and clean. When I needed something, Mary responded quickly. We greatly recommend it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"London’s Playhouse is a dream location to stay. This was our second time staying here and we couldn’t have been happier. Mary is an excellent host and she even went above and beyond to leave gifts for our two kids. The house is very relaxing, with a perfect yard for dogs. If we are ever back in the Brunswick area we will for sure try to stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful place! Convenient to both Jekyll Island and St. Simon Island. Beds sleep well, firm feel. Beautiful screened porch and back yard for the pups. Loved our stay and will stay again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little house was much larger than it appeared. We were in town for a school trip for my daughter. We wanted somewhere affordable, clean, comfortable, dog friendly, and close to Jekyll. I probably made 3-4 trips back and forth to Jekyll a day. Dropped off at 8:00 am and was back and forth between working from the house until 10pm. My husband and I both worked while we were there. I set up on the dining room table and he in the back bedroom that has the desk. We made the quick drive over for sunset every night on the marsh. Communication was top notch. The neighborhood streets can be hit or miss as far as upkeep and so can the houses on the street. But, we enjoyed walking around and all of the beautiful trees! We walked to Yellow Deli one day and sat in their beautiful courtyard. We also ate at Tortuga Jacks and The Beach House on Jekyll because they have big patios with ocean views. There are so many sand dollars on Jekyll (we made sure to take ones that were not alive) that it was incredible. We will stay here again no doubt. Jekyll has so much free parking ($8 toll) for beach access and this house is so close there is no reason to not stay here and enjoy historic Brunswick as well."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable home in a convenient location! Short drive to Jekyll Island and St. Simon's Island! Spacious and clean; felt very open and homey! Everything we needed was provided! Historical neighborhood and restaurants within walking distance! Definitely a great value!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"London’s Playhouse was a perfect vacation home for our family of 2 adults, 3 small children, and a dog. We thoroughly enjoyed the convenient location, spacious backyard, and screened porch. We had a nice walk to the Yellow Deli, which is a neat Jewish deli in the neighborhood, too. Everything was extremely clean and Mary was a wonderful host. If we come back to Brunswick, this place will be at the top of our list."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary was a wonderful host! Location is in a quiet neighborhood set perfectly between Jekyll Island and St. Simon’s and a 3 minute ride to downtown Brunswick.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just the 2 of us stayed at London’s Playhouse with our little dachshund, and we enjoyed it so much. It was spacious and exceptionally clean, and in a nice quiet neighborhood full of huge live oak trees dripping with Spanish moss. The furnishings and bedding were very nice and comfortable, and the kitchen was very well equipped with good dishes and glasses (much better than one usually sees in a rental property), even though we didn’t cook and only made snacks and coffee (coffee filters were also provided). The backyard is so huge, we could have had greyhound races back there; it was plenty big for our little doxie to poke around. We were so grateful to have everything we needed for our 3 night stay, and wish it could have been longer. It was the perfect location to go to the nearby beaches, and we even made a day trip to Savannah. We were so close to Jekyll island and made multiple trips to Driftwood Beach at different times of day (gorgeous at sunrise!), but also really enjoyed discovering Brunswick, which has an authentic old downtown, historic homes, and some great restaurants. Really liked Indigo Coastal Shanty - food was delicious - and the Yellow Deli, as well as Silver Bluff Brewing (which also had a food truck with yummy Mexican food). We missed out on Reid’s Apothocary this time (have to make reservations), so hopefully we’ll go when we return here someday!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"London’s Playhouse was the best AirBnB we have EVER stayed at! Mary the host went above and beyond and got my family a sweet Easter treat as we stayed over the holiday.
The moment we walked in the house it felt like home. My kids immediately ran to the backyard where they found a swing and spent hours occupied. The house was perfect for both my family and our two dogs.
We already booked this same location for a week vacation in June. As we checked out my kids asked, “when we come back can we please stay here again?” To their surprise…Yes! We cannot wait.
Thanks again Mary for a fantastic stay and beautiful home."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place! Very clean, clear instructions, and close to St. Simons."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place! Very spacious including a huge backyard with a rope swing. My family and the pups had such a fun time! Clean & accurate to description
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It is a nice and cozy property, especially convenient for pet owners."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Mary made our stay at London's Playhouse so enjoyable, answering any questions we had promptly. This was the first time that my husband and I ""played snow bird"", and took a 3 week vacation. Also a first for traveling with our two Shih tzu. This house was perfect, with everything we needed. Even the puppies felt quickly at home, enjoying the beautiful large fenced in backyard.
The location is qreat, a short drive to Jekyll Island and St Simon Island. Both islands have dog friendly beaches. We ate at several of the island restaurants that were dog friendly, a new experience for us. My husband enjoyed the golf courses.
We had a delightful relaxing vacation, and wouldn't hesitate to return."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was so nice! The host was very gracious, and we had everything we needed. Thank you Mary!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"London’s playhouse was an epic find. Mary the owner was very accommodating to our needs. It is a great location to St. Simons & Jekyll. We comfortably fit 4 adults, 3 year old & 3 dogs. Londons is spacious, clean, & worth every penny. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an Airbnb near Brunswick, Jekyll island, or St. Simons!!!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, I and our 2 dogs stayed for 2 weeks and overall the house was comfortable for us. I particularly enjoyed spending time in the screened porch, it's a nice relaxing spot though it would be better if there was a ceiling fan. The bathroom that is insuite to the primary bathroom is very small, only 1 person can fit at one time. Both bathrooms lack plastic liners, there is only a cloth shower curtain, and so the bathrooms always smell mildewy. The kitchen is stocked well enough for cooking, however, the lighting in the kitchen is very poor, making it hard to cook.
The major plus is this is a good home base for visiting the other islands and not too pricey. Also, it is not far from downtown Brunswick which is a nice little city center to spend time. Highly recommend visiting Silver Bluff brewery in downtown Brunswick!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for our gymnastics weekend. Quick drive to Jekyll where the girls competed.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Both Mary and the owners were very quick to respond with answers to our questions. The fenced in back yard is great for the grandkids and the dog to play.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, comfy, and convenient place to stay in close proximity to Jekyll Island. Perfect for us and our new puppy. Very happy with our stay here and would not hesitate to return and fully expect that we will."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family really enjoyed staying here. Very convenient to downtown Brunswick, Jekyll Island and St. Simons. House was comfortable, cozy with a very nice outdoor porch and big yard."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Mary's place was perfect for us! Had everything we needed, it was clean and cozy but big enough for all of us. The kitchen is amazing! The neighborhood is safe and quiet, you cant hear any traffic at night. Its close to everything you need and the back yard is fenced in and perfect for family bbqs. We really liked the front door lock, not having to worry about keys is a great feeling. Mary was very easy to contact if needed and she left little doggy treats/toys and a bed for our girl. We had an amazing and relaxing stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a convenient neighborhood to Brunswick. Clean, simple and very comfortable."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Mary’s place was perfect! Right in between St. Simons & Jekyll Islands but far more affordable than staying on either island.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My friend and I took our kids to stay a couple days and had a great time. Due to rain, we were stuck inside most of the trip, but the house was well stocked and the kids had a blast. Mary was very easy to contact. We look forward to staying again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Second time staying here! We enjoyed our stay and house was perfect.

The beds were comfortable, there were extra towels and linens, neighborhood was quite and friendly, there was plenty of space for 4 adults and 2 children, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We loved the outside screened in porch for relaxing and family time. The location is perfect, you are centrally located to Jekyll island and St. Simon island. We loved exploring both islands!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a great home. My favorite part was the patio. When it’s not raining it’s a great little spot with games and great sitting. My dog loved the backyard; completely fenced in and super convenient. Mary also took the time to provide cute little dog treats for our dog and this home was truly a great getaway. She also had cute kid friendly puzzles that my son had a blast playing. The house was a great location in Brunswick and we were super close to the surrounding islands. Great communication with Mary and truly very helpful with info about festivities and food options. We will definitely be staying here again. Thank you Mary!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Vey welcoming. Would love to visit again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary has thought of everything. The beds and linen were good quality, the internet was fast and the furniture throughout the home was quality and comfortable. I didn’t see a bug the entire time inside the house. Overall, I have a very picky crew and we were all pleased with our stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect location in the historic district of Brunswick. We like to island hop between Jekyll and St Simons and this spot is a quick drive to both. It was such a beautiful and peaceful property with a fun tree swing in the backyard! The renovation was very nicely done. Master bath is pretty small but they worked very well with the space available. The beds were comfy. And Mary was a gem to work with and super hospitable. She even left us a professionally decorated cake that said Welcome to London’s Playhouse! So thoughtful! Stay here! You will enjoy it!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house and location. Walking distance to historic downtown and short drive to the islands and beach. Mary is a perfect host. Can’t wait to come back.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location with quick access to downtown Brunswick and Jekyll Island. Lovely screened porch and huge back yard for our pups. Very quiet street, plenty of parking. Comfy beds and the AC keeps the house nice and cold."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay if you are traveling with pets. Fenced in yard is rare to find on Air Bnb. My only issue is the thermostat is set to 70 and it’s password protected. You can not adjust it up or down. Otherwise, the stay was great."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,London's Playhouse is a wonderful property for anyone who wants to relax and enjoy a stress free time near the coast. It was perfect for our family and dog. My kids loved the backyard that is huge and spacious with a wonderful swing. The screened in porch was the focal point for us and we used it a lot. The house itself is lovely and can accommodate a family and has all the amenities you would expect. You will not be disappointed if you chose this property and the icing on the cake is The Host. Mary provides timely and prompt communication and is so thoughtful. She is a host that Airbnb should use to train new hosts on how to create a great an experience for guests. It is the small things...Thank you Mary.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for the 6 of us. Very clean and comfortable. Our dogs loved the big fenced back yard and grand daughter enjoyed the rope swing!!

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay here was way too short! We will definitely be booking again here, we had such an amazing time on my bachelorette party! The house was so cozy and felt like home, our favorite area was the back porch and the backyard! We cooked chicken and veggie skewers on the grill the first night. The second night we ate at Marshside, and then brunch at Palmers Cafe for our last day. We also visited Driftwood beach which is gorgeous! We had never seen a beach similar to it before! We can’t wait to be back down in the area again. Mary was the sweetest Host and we hope you love your flowers❤️"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's house is ideal for visiting the Golden Isles: close to both Jekyll and SS, as well as to downtown Brunswick. The back yard and back porch are awesome.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at London’s Playhouse! It was super cute, clean and quaint. Our dog really enjoyed the fenced in backyard and felt right at home for our stay. Jekyll’s island and St Simon’s island were literally right by us so it was very convenient. And the islands are all VERY dog friendly. The neighborhood was nice.
Our host communicated very well and timely. And even had cookies waiting for us when we arrived, such a nice touch!
We definitely recommend this place to any dog owners for a nice little getaway!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location to enjoy downtown historic Brunswick and also get to either St. Simon or Jekyll Island within 15 mins. Place is surrounded by beautiful live oak trees and Mary went out of her way with thoughtful touches to include a cake and welcome card.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"London's Playhouse is a quaint and stylish home located in a diverse urban setting along Georgia's Golden Isles. The location is well suited for exploring Saint Simons and Jekyll Islands. The property is tastefully decorated and comfortable. The neighborhood has some areas can appear to be sketchy. Nonetheless, the property itself is a terrific value and our family of 6 enjoyed the home and its amenities (awesome screened porch and huge back yard with an epic rope swing)."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean and relaxing. It was a 3 minutes drive to many nice restaurants, shops and bars in Brunswick. I would recommend anyone to stay here. It was dog friendly and our dog enjoyed the fenced back yard."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to fletc. Great location, amazing kitchen."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We really enjoyed our 6-week stay in Brunswick, escaping Chicago winter. Mary was a fabulous and friendly host. The house is solid, safe and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and everything we needed (in Covid times) was 5-10 min away. We especially enjoyed walking the dog down Union street with its historic homes. My husband and I were working remotely, so solid wifi was important. While there were some issues the first week, due entirely to Xfinity, Mary was relentless and got it fixed so there were NO further issues. Mary was kind enough to secure two bikes for us when we asked, and a desk for me. Over and above board. The back yard is huge, fully fenced and beautiful for playing fetch with our dog. Easy proximity to tourist attractions like St Simon’s Island and Jekyll Island, which were delightful. The bedding was high quality and very comfortable."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, nice space. It was perfectly located for us while visiting both family in Brunswick and Jekyll. We were happy to have our dog with us. The backyard was great and the rope swing was a huge hit."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"London’s Playhouse is absolutely wonderful and felt like a home away from home, great location and a Host that knows her stuff. She added all of the special touches since we traveled during the holidays and was very knowledgeable about local events. We will definitely be back."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a nice house on a quiet street but very close to everything. Updated appliances, huge yard for the dog, easy code door lock, nice sun porch in back, very clean. She got me a cake for my 40th birthday and gave helpful tips for the area when i asked. Only 1 tv in the house but it's a smartv with Prime and Netflix and we weren't home often. No complaints at all ;)"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"It’s a nice house, Mary was an excellent host, the house is very spacious and the backyard is amazing, location is excellent, we had a great time there. We noticed the floors were a little dirty with dog’s hair but probably who have pets don’t care about it, and the master bedroom toilet seems stained. Pets owner are going to love this place."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a nice, quaint location. Short distance to downtown old Brunswick. Convenient location to visit the islands. Loved the big backyard for the dog."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay. We were close to the things we wanted to do and bring our canine family as well. Mary made sure we were in during checkin and the little extra touches were really nice. It was a quiet and peaceful place to stay.
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for simple comfort, great space and a yard for the dogs! Mary was a great host, who stayed in contact and even gave us a welcoming gift.
My only suggestion to those thinking of staying here, is that if you’re used to hearing a fan blasting in your bedroom, you may want to bring one. The ceiling fans were very quiet and not super powerful, and made for EXTREMELY quiet (and not terribly chill) nights."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A true gem with an awesome yard!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was better than expected, so much so we stayed an extra day. There was Plenty of extra blankets and bath towels.

I would recommend this home and would stay here again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house is great location for shopping needs and to head in any direction needed and easy to access St Simons.

It’s in a very convenient location right next to downtown Brunswick and a 15 min drive to either Jekyll island or St Simon’s Island. The house was very clean and had a great backyard for our dog to run and play. Great place if you want to bring your pup. Also she had a bottle of wine waiting for us which was a nice touch. We had a great time, would highly recommend if taking a trip to the Georgia islands."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was all we needed and more. The backyard is HUGE and our dog had so much fun running around and playing with the dog toys that Mary left! I would definitely recommend this house to anyone wanting to visit the Brunswick/Jekyll Island area.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The London's Playhouse was everything that I was looking for in a weekend getaway. I was able to relax and unwind. There was nothing lacking in amenities, I had everything that I needed. The neighborhood was quiet, close to local businesses and only a short drive to Amelia Island. I loved the mossy oak trees in the back yard, and there was even a tree swing. I highly recommend this location. Also, Mary was very responsive and courteous!!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute house in town. It’s right in the middle between Jekyll Island and St. Simon Island. We had a great time. The owner was very responsive and available.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary’s place in located in the center in Brunswick. Perfectly situated between Jekyll Island and St. Simons island is high is approx 20 minutes in each direction. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and dog treats for our friends dog. Towels and toilet paper were lovely which doesn’t seem like much to some but we’re very important to us.
Wonderfully appointed home that is spacious, but still cozy."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a blast
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host, very responsive and willing to help make your stay perfect! The house is located in a quiet neighbor walking distance to historic downtown and a short 15-20 minutes drive to both St Simons Island and Jekyll Island. Five stars all around!"

The location is perfect, 15 minutes and you’re on the beach at Jekyll Island, or shopping at St. Simons. The place was very clean and had everything you could need. Lots of little things that made our stay very nice. The big backyard was great for my dog and the neighborhood is quiet. I’m actually checking the availability of this house right now so we can stay there again soon!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect home away from home!
This was a beautiful place centered between St. Simon's Island and Jekyll Island. We originally chose this location for a conference, but when the conference was rescheduled we decided to go anyway and we're glad we did. Once Mary found out about our canceled conference she offered us suggestions for what to do in this beautiful town.
I also get nervous when bringing my dog along. She's well-behaved, but I still worry. Mary had treats laid out for her as well as dig bowls and balls. All those little details definitely made it feel homey. People traveling with dogs that there are some barking dogs in the neighborhood, so if your dog is quick to bark, you might be mindful when you let your dog out into the wonderful, secure back yard. Also, dogs aren't allowed on the furniture, which wasn't an issue for us but could be for a few people traveling.
Thanks to Mary for being a very gracious host!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You won't regret stay here, our stay was simply amazing and oh yea our pets had a great time as well. Marley, my son's dog send her thanks for the accommodations. Great home, great location, and amazing host."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"London's Playhouse is the perfect place for a quiet weekend away with your loved ones, both furry or otherwise. The place was immaculately cleaned, the yard is expansive and securely fenced for the dog, and the little touches (like including local restaurant menus) made the house and neighborhood very comfortable. It's a great house, and I'll look to stay again if I'm headed back to the area with my dog."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,London’s playhouse is a great place to stay! Mary is a great host and was very thoughtful and quick to respond. Great family room and kitchen area. Would definitely recommend staying here!
,,,The house was very hot and muggy. They did not turn on the A/C until we complained. There is a very very strong smell of a male cat spraying some where in the house even tho she says no cats are around. My allergies kick in after being there an half hour.
,,,"The room is cute with windows facing the patio where there is a swing and people are expected to gather. There are only sheer curtains though, so you feel completely exposed to anyone walking in and out or sitting in front of the windows. No privacy whatsoever.
The self-serve coffee bar is unusable. You have to get water from the bathroom sink. Also, the espresso maker is manual. Who is going to want to figure that out while staying somewhere for one night?
Mini fridge was dirty and freezer needed to be defrosted.
Finally, the bathroom was disgusting. I mean, hair all over the sink, tub and floor and DIRTY toilet. It’s a shared bathroom but no one was renting the other room, so there is no one to blame except the host. After I complained, the “concierge” was sent to clean but it looked the same afterwards.
My money was refunded, minus the fees."
