Would definitely love to stay again…"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hotel Rossville was a great place to stay away from all the craziness in West Lafayette with graduation. Loved all the extra amenities in the place especially the super soft and cozy bathrobes. My husband and son absolutely loved the old style video game machine. Wish we could have stayed longer and had time to use the firepit and cornhole game.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hotel Rossville was amazing the only biggest downfall was all the dust, spiders, spider webs. the patio was ok I think we could have eatually enjoyed it if there wasn't a 1000 ants and bugs taking over. the house itself was amazing. It was so peaceful and the host provides games and cards for guest to enjoy while they stay. I was so impressed host quickly Lori responded when contacted that alone it's 10 stars."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,2nd stay at Hotel Rossville. Will definitely recommend to others!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,absolutely awesome place! love it every time i stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori's place offers an excellent and highly comfortable stay for families. The well-designed and immaculately clean rooms provide a pleasant experience. The kitchen facilities are superbly maintained and spotless. Conveniently located just 25 minutes away from Purdue University, guests can enjoy a serene environment away from the university hubbub. With thoughtful touches like a Gramophone and a collection of delightful songs, board games for kids, Lori adds a charming ambiance to the stay. The secured and private backyard, with parking space for up to two cars, adds to the convenience. Additionally, guests have access to two bicycles for exploring the surroundings. Overall, opting for Lori's place over accommodations near the university proves to be a worthwhile choice for families seeking quality time together."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique and cozy place for our family to rest. More than what we expected, definitely recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay. Fully stocked kitchen; there are even spices available for use. Fun record player and vinyl album selection. Lots of space.
Of note is the fact that there are two bedrooms to sleep four people. The remaining two guests sleep on a blow-up mattress. It is of good quality and there is PLENTY of space for it in the living room without being cramped."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely gorgeous! So happy i got to enjoy this place! i cant wait to go back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was completely amazing. The gated parking area was an added bonus for an out of town stay. Every detail has been thought of. The decor is all seamless and current, nice modern furniture, bathrooms were immaculate and rainfall walk in shower was an added bonus. Our kids loved the table top video games. Also we enjoyed some time outside on the patio with the outdoor seating and fire table."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Hotel Rossville was just a perfect spot to meet up with some friends from across the state. There were options for dining out or having a drink nearby. The place itself was so well thought out, beautifully decorated and so clean! I really loved the modern industrial vibe and just the classic hotel touches made by Lori! I would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am an Indiana native. My brother lives in Lafayette, my sister in Kokomo and my mom in Logansport. While I had driven through the area multiple times and gotten pizza at Arnie’s, I never would have imagined there was a place like this is Rossville! It was comfortable, homey and absolutely perfect! The bathrooms were my favorite! It felt like I was in a spa! This place is literally in the middle of a quaint little town and just a short drive to both Kokomo and Lafayette. The kitchen had everything you would need. The plush robes were a perfect touch, especially for this now, Floridian!
Cheers!
Brooke Mirenda"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite places. Love, love the atmosphere. We are just in awe of the building and the light fixtures. Love the bathrooms!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had family come to town to celebrate the Christmas holiday and needed additional beds. We ended up using the location to create memories centered on food, family, and fellowship. Much easier to create in this setting compared to a hotel stay. Small town feel but anything forgotten was easily obtained from businesses nearby."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly one of the coolest Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at stateside! Cool old buildings are our jam and this one was done so well! 100% will stay again! The holiday touches and local business gift card greeting were beyond and incredibly thoughtful!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you need to be in Rossville!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"I wish I had an excuse to stay here longer - I didn’t want to leave. The overall design and amenities were just top notch and luxurious. It was fun, trendy, and accommodated every need!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay for the whole family! Lori had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here againif we are in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will stay at the Hotel Rossville again when visiting our daughter at Purdue.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this unit and will book again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We didn’t get to enjoy everything at Hotel Rossville. We had a late check in due to a wedding, but we do know we want to stay again. A beautiful and absolutely cool place. Next time it will be for 2 nights during the weekend so we can enjoy everything. Can’t wait for our next visit!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,HR is a lovely place to stay. We were visiting my daughter at Purdue for Parents Weekend and this was a wonderful place to stay. Very modern and chic and a real breath of fresh air from the hotel scene. Lori was a terrific host and I’d highly recommend this place- and we are very picky! Very creative use of space. And really only a short drive from Purdue. Thank you Lori! We will be back-
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a quick stay and loved this spot! Very clean and fun inside!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at Lori ‘s place. The decor and updates in this Airbnb are so cool! Industrial modern look, etc. We loved the surround sound system in the the rooms. We are huge music fans, so that made this place even more amazing! The place was super clean and tidy, which are very important qualities to us when being away from home. The beds and pillows were SO comfy! It is hard to come by comfy beds and pillows these days. We loved the super soft and comfy robes in each room. Speaking of soft and comfy, the bathroom towels were super soft and comfy! Loved the look of the modern fire pit out back, but we didn’t get a chance to use it. Our only complaint about this amazing Airbnb is that we didn’t get to stay long enough! One night was simply not enough! We look forward to staying there again some day!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s hard to write in a few words what we experienced at Lori’s place however I wouldn’t be surprised if Lori had a degree in Hospitality across multiple disciplines such as Interior Design and Hotel Management. The attention to details was unparalleled and the overall experience was superb in every aspect.
P."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique space that is high end & very welcoming! I really enjoyed the local artwork, music throughout & the relaxing patio. The bedrooms & baths were unique and provided quality sleep & relaxation.
This would be a great space up for up to 6 people & for an extended visit. Hosts provided everything you could need & you can’t beat the Main Street location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our 2nd stay here and it is always wonderful! Comfortable, trendy, absolutely love the back patio!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Neat place. Lots to do in unit. Decor really modern. Lots of room for four people.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to stay in Rossville. great location, comfortable bed, and plenty of living space. I will definitely stay at Hotel Rossville again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It was Great!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place in Rossville was so thoughtfully furnished and decorated. We loved our stay for Purdue Parent's Weekend. Nice to be away from the hubub when we needed a break.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to stay in Rossville or near Purdue, this is a wonderful destination. Lori has thought of everything to make your stay perfect. Would stay there anytime in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique place, well appointed and comfortable. Lori supplied us with all of the information we needed to make our stay trouble free. Thanks"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay - clean, great atmosphere, fun video game machine! A definite favorite out of the places we've stayed."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Highly recommended! I received so many kudos from my family for finding this lovely place :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are in need of a place to stay while visiting the Purdue or Lafayette area this is a must! An easy 30 min drive and way better than staying in a hotel! The gated area for your vehicle was great so you didn’t have to park on the street or an empty lot. The ease of getting in was good too! They didn’t skimp on any details! From the layout, the small mirror/getting ready area in the one bedroom, the outside sitting area all the way down to the silverware and soaps was well thought out. We will definitely be back!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this cool, sexy, small-town/art-installation style “hotel” justice! The hometown vibes mixed with elevated design was a home run. Everything is gorgeous and comfortable and interesting and just WOW. We’re very design-conscious and picky and this is by far the best airBnb we’ve ever stayed in—and who knew it would be in small-town IN?! Reminiscent of the Prada “store” in Marfa, this place is not really a “hotel” because you’re the only lucky guest, but looks and feels like a spacious designer hotel. From the tech-savvy sound system for playing music in all the rooms (even the bathroom!) to the lo-fi record player with a wholesome-chic selection of records, there’s something for everyone. Now, the amenities: we enjoyed and appreciated every single one from the bikes, to the cornhole, fire pit, shaded back patio with rockers and sectional, outdoor movie projector, to the sit-down arcade game—there was never a dull moment! Functionally, the 2 full bathrooms and 2 bedrooms were spectacular, as was the washing machine and dryer and dishwasher. A short drive from Purdue (12 miles?) it’s an absolute must if you’re in town for college or just want to harness your inner hometown nostalgia, stay at the Hotel Rossville and prepare to be WOWWED as well!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect home away from home. Lori thought of everything. A must stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super awesome space that breathes relaxation and creativity. 100000% recommend staying here.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and appreciated all the amenities and commonly forgotten necessities the host thought of and provided. Our only issue was that's it's not a good place to sleep in late or take a day time nap, being located on a main road the traffic rushing by is fairly loud on the inside."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best place in the area to stay!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you want to treat your group of six with a modern rustic decor in a spacious posh flat, it is worth your while to spend at least a night at Hotel Rossville. Just 15 miles E of Purdue, prepare your meals indoors with state of art kitchen, entertain outdoors on the private patio, includes spa bathrooms, thoughtful amenities. Hostess is on it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely every detail was thought of. Beautiful, fun, place! Would definitely stay again!! Host is great too!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful airbnb. Location was perfect for us. I grew up in Rossville and we returned from Arizona for a visit with family. Lori made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Definitely will stay there again next time!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant place to stay
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thorntown was quiet and peaceful. Ginger's home was smartly decorated and the beds were as advertised and (previously reviewed). They were super comfy and the air conditioning worked excellently. The downside is that the home could use a little TLC. The walls, door jams, baseboards, etc... all need to be cleaned and painted. The carpet, vinyl (in bathroom & kitchen) and living room drapes are all stained. The rug is so worn that it is buckling in several locations. The bathtub itself was in very good (and clean) shape. But the shower curtain liner was mildewy and needs replaced. The toilet seat probably needs to be replaced too because it was super wiggly. We didn't really use the kitchen, but it appeared to have all that one would need for a stay. I believe if the property had been in better shape, we would have rated it much higher as it is a quiet house in a great location with easy access to Indy and Lafayette."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we've stayed at many places in the last 4 years and this was the most comfortable. we would definitely return if it was available
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciate the lights on because we had to check on very late. I requested a late check out, she responded very fast and allowed us to check out later."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ginger’s place was just what me and my husband needed. A nice comfortable home right by a cute little downtown area and good WiFi so I could work remotely! Thank you so much if we ever come back to the area we will for sure be staying again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay for a visit with family.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ginger's place is a gem!. It was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. She responded quickly to a last minute schedule change and was happy you accommodate us. We have family nearby so will definitely be staying here again.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,I had a really good stay at Ginger's place. She is very friendly and helpful! The description was accurate and a good value. I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again!

Will be back"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great quiet and cozy house in a slow and picturesque farm Town. May have to turn up the heat in the winter to keep all parts of the house nice and warm, but the system's able to keep up and the stay was very comfortable. will definitely rent from Ginger again when in town."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ginger's place was very tastefully decorated. It was a good first Airbnb experience.
Our only concern was that it stayed a bit cooler inside the house than we liked. We're from the mountains of Virginia and enjoy keeping things cool back home. It was comfortable inside sometimes, and other times too cool. Especially in the bedrooms. We are thankful to Ginger for hosting us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your home is amazing I loved anyone who would be delighted by your home
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ginger’s place was a clean, comfy place for us to rest after full days of visiting with family. Even though it was cold, we enjoyed walking our dog every day on the nearby rail trail. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect stay! My husband, pup, and I loved Ginger’s place as our home base for attending a sporting event in nearby Crawfordsville. We had such a relaxing time and the house has everything we needed for our stay. We will be back!"

JC Cucina’s restaurant right around the corner is an excellent place to eat as well."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have say the bedding Was so soft? I slept like a baby. The house was clean, easy, access to everything that We Needed Ginger was easy to contact and ask questions and was very sweet."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as described. Older home that felt like grandma’s house with some modernizations.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love staying at this place!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, a nice place to stay. The house was very cute. Beds were comfy but pillows not so much. It was very hot in the home even with fans on. The host was responsiveness upon arrive

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Safe neighborhood with easy check in. The carpets are stained, but the home seemed clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet little house was just the right fit for a recent trip with my 4 year old and 8 year old. They loved the record player, especially the 3 Little Kittens record! Being able to walk to Dollar General, a playground, and a few restaurants was a treat in a small town. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed and the beds were comfortable. This is the secomd time I have stayed in one of Ginger's properties and both times she was a thoughtful host with great communication."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quick business trip, not a single problem. Great host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I’ll admit to a bit of skepticism when I saw the exterior of the place, but the interior more than made up for any underwhelming curb appeal. Ginger was responsive, and inside the house was a very informational booklet with instructions, recommendations, and information. It was a cozy stay for a good price, and the record player was a quaint touch. You can’t go wrong here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Darling little house. My family just loved it. It had everything they needed. Great location to my house! Would definitely book again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Prefect host! Ginger is awesome! Zero complaints. We love the bed, linens and bath towels. She just put in a new couch, very comfortable! Looking forward to our next stay! It’s our home away from home.🏡 Thank you Ginger"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ginger’s place was perfect for our needs. We didn’t spend much time there as we had events in West Lafayette all weekend, but the space was comfortable and clean and we enjoyed our stay. The beds and shower were better than most airbnbs we’ve stayed at and the neighborhood was very quiet and safe. There is also plenty of parking."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ginger went all out to make us cofortable in spite of an error I made on the dates of our stay. There were some extra favors we asked to use and she very happily agreed to (storing my electric wheel chair until we got back). Neighbors made us feel at home. This is our second stay with Ginger and we love everything about the accomidations. Ginger is like an angel and should get
angle for her work."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at Ginger’s and it was just as great I’d not better than the first stay. Just as listed, small town vibes, easy drive to the city, great staycation for our little family."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed here at least 3 times and the house and host never disappoint. Wherever I am visiting family in Thorntown I check to see if this house is available. Quiet, tidy, and most important…a very comfortable bed."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house to stay at. Ginger made checking in and out very simple and fast. She always responds right away with any questions. We had a great stay at her house. As a Dad traveling with my boys for a basketball tournament we managed to forget a few things. :) Ginger had shower supplies to use, and I was happy to see some coffee in the cupboard to use. Plenty of nice bathroom towels to use. Beds and pillows were nice and comfy. Highly recommend. Thanks Ginger! Looking forward to staying again in the future."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ginger has such an outstanding property. Located in such a quiet rural town in Indiana, it provided my family with just the right amount of space and relaxing time we needed. We loved our time in Thorntown. It was such a wonderful reminder of how we all need to slow down from our busy lives. Ginger was an outstanding host. We have never experienced such responsive communication from an Air BNB host before.
We will book another stay with Ginger when we return to the area.
Randy"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was so quaint and adorable! All the small little touches and decor were perfect. The house was SO CLEAN!!! The bed was great and we slept well. We were able to watch movies all night with the Roku. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. We didnt really go out of the house but the Dollar General staff was incredibly nice and helpful.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect place to get away with a small group of friends or family. Couldn't ask for a better location. House was just as described. Sharon was super responsive and even brought over some extra things that were missing in the house when pointed out to her. Only thing (and it was a small thing) was that the kitchen could use a deep cleaning. Some sticky handles and cabinets, but like I said, a small thing. It's a special place and I'd highly recommend it. Would be awesome for football weekends!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sharon was extremely helpful and flexible in making arrangements for our stay.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This vrbo was very spacious and extremely convenient to Purdue. The beds were reasonably comfortable. The ￼area was nice and quiet.
The main issue we had was that the water for the house as well, water, and it smelled pretty strongly of sulfur. ￼ We relied on bottled water for drinking and brushing our teeth. ￼￼ On a more minor note, one of the bedrooms seem to have a large number of ladybugs creep into the house for some reason.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A serene location that has the space needed for a relaxing weekend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Quiet comfortable place to stay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We found Sharon’s place when looking for a place to stay following the Purdue / IU basketball game. We loved that it was just a mile west of campus. It was a beautiful, peaceful and private setting. There were 4 of us, and we were each able to have our own bedroom. We spent time at the house watching basketball on the SmartTV, played Euchre with the cards provided, and got in a couple rounds of Pac-Man. There were a few other board games as well. We didn’t make any meals, but the kitchen seemed well equipped if you wanted to do so. Overall, it was a great place to stay, and Sharon was an excellent host. Would stay here again 💯"

There was ample, clean, comfortable beds for my guests & 3 bathrooms so no long waits for showers, mother nature calls, etc. Bedrooms had USB port bedside lamps. Between guests that stayed at the AirBnb & ones that came for dinner, we were able to easily park 6 cars.
The large, well stocked, kitchen had plenty of counter space. We had dinner catered & was able to place all the food out with space to spare. Between the dining room table & the 6 person outdoor table on the spacious, lighted, deck, seating for dinner was easy. The living room space was comfortable, open & relaxing as well.
The checkout requirements were simple & easy. Sharon answered each question I had in a prompt & friendly manner. I highly recommend her & this property to anyone traveling to West Lafayette."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very well furnished and equipped. The furniture and beds were very comfortable. The host was quickly responsive to any questions we had. Our 3 month stay made us feel like it was home. We'd easily choose the Little Blue Cottage again if we had to.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best Airb&b we’ve ever used! Host was proactive, available, and kind. The home exceeded our expectations! New furniture and updated inside and out, and most importantly super clean top to bottom. It’s in a convenient location to anything you need and a park right down the street for outdoor enjoyment. Easy check-in and check-out. Spotless inside and plenty of space so you don’t feel cramped. I can’t say enough great things about this house. It will NOT disappoint! All 5 stars no question"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kevin’s listing was very accurate, and the house was pleasantly stocked with everything you needed. The location was less than a 5 min walk to the city park, filled with activities such as courts for basketball, pickle ball, and tennis. Swing sets and other children playground equipment were available. I highly recommend Kevin’s house for small family vacations - it was ideal for us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kevin’s house was absolutely beautiful! I am from Lebanon, and wanted to surprise my family and not worry about where the 6 of us would stay. So glad we stayed at the Blue Rose Cottage. The entire house was tastefully decorated and we were not disappointed. The beds were so awesome & the linens high end. Keven responded quickly to my texts. Would definitely stay there in the future!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a great location, close to downtown. Newly renovated, plenty of space, quiet & clean. We were in town for a wedding, better than staying at a hotel. If we are ever in Lebanon again, we will book this house! We had a great weekend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow, one of the nicest Airbnb properties we’ve stayed at! Home was beautiful with modern decor & appliances, perfect for a weekend with family. Upstairs & downstairs spaces made it comfortable for our big group. Kids loved the large community park nearby (walkable). Great front & back porches for enjoying coffee & very quiet neighborhood. Easy drive to Purdue for a graduation. Kevin was super responsive & welcoming. Highly recommend this home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the home to stay at if you are anywhere near Lebanon! It is ABSOLUTELY beautiful. The interior design is so tasteful. My family and I stayed at this home for my sister’s Nursing school graduation weekend. This home makes you feel at home. The pictures are exactly what you get plus some. The home is near a park and the neighborhood was nice and quiet during our stay. Kevin was swiftly responsive with any questions or concerns we had. It was so nice meeting our friendly host. This home is worth staying at because it is nearly perfectly located between Indianapolis and Lafayette. I would highly recommend Kevin as a host and his beautiful home as a stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is amazing! It is newly remodeled with so many wonderful features. The decor is gorgeous with such attention to detail. Everything is new and so comfortable. I rented this for my daughter’s wedding weekend at a venue 20 minutes away. It was perfect! So much room to make preparations for the wedding. One larger kitchen and a smaller kitchen downstairs. Plus an extra fridge in the garage. Kevin was so prompt and accommodating. It made our weekend so much fun! I can't say enough wonderful things about this venue. This is the place to stay if you are near Lebanon!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Second time staying here and would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay. Great host and a great house.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kevin was an excellent host with a beautiful home. Any issues or questions were resolved quickly and politely! I would highly recommend a stay and will definitely be back again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend stay at this peaceful cabin. Check in was easy, and the hosts were responsive and proactive (a storm came through the day of check-in, and they came out to make sure everything was in order). After that, we were able to be by ourselves in a beautiful setting. The cabin was cozy, and had everything we needed. The DSL internet was adequate for our needs, but was noticeably slower than some high-speed internet. We were still able to watch some movies by downloading them first, but streaming would have been lower quality. Overall, we loved the place, and we will keep it on our short list if we come back to the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Cabin at Rossville! It was very cozy and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped. We had everything we needed! We enjoyed eating out on the screened porch. The property is beautiful. We appreciated the firewood and fire starters for a campfire! The zero entry to the cabin was nice as well as a grab bar in the bathroom for us seniors! This was a very easy and relaxing trip. Kevin was quick to answer any questions I had. Instructions were very clear. I would highly recommend the place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great lil hideaway in a beautiful setting.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another awesome visit to Kevin's place. We really enjoyed ourselves here and had everything that we needed for a nice little getaway. Looking forward to returning soon!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and peaceful! To save money on our trip went into town to get groceries. There was everything we needed for cooking meals!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for a weekend going to Purdue football game.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We always have a wonderful time at Kevin's cabin. I have no complaints but just a suggestion; a can opener in the kitchen would be helpful when cooking.
Highly recommend this place and my Husband has dubbed it ""our home away from home"""
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin's place would have more to offer in the summer or at least warm weather. We were unable to take advantage of the lovely porch and outdoor fire pit.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very interesting to say the least. This is a cabin hidden away off the street. The outside area is definitely rustic - lots of rusty, old farm equipment and 'different decor', but interesting. Kevin did equip the cabin beautifully. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook full meals - and he thoughtfully equipped the bathroom & everything you would need. We were there for an alumni game at Purdue & travel time was minimal. A great Dollar General Market down the road had everything we needed. Corn field in the back of the house was fun, sorry we had no time to have a big campfire in the back yard. Funny thing...my husband i both got in the bed & felt we were headed 'downhill' (cabin may be sinking - ha!), so we switched the direction we slept in :-). Nevertheless, this was a GREAT stay & we recommend this for anyone who is not too fussy about their surroundings!!! Very comfortable cabin Never got to speak or see Kevin, but thanks!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice and peaceful Airbnb. Very memorable experience. Thank you
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a nice cozy cabin in the beautiful location. Hammock and fire pit and corn field on the property are perfect for a weekend away. The place is larger than we expected. Large dining area and living room, screened porch. It was easy to find, close to Purdue University and had a real cabin feel."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s such a cute spot tucked right across the street from the old Apple Orchard which it looks to me that they also have pumpkins now too. The creek sounds and wildlife made our stay very peaceful. Rossville is my home town- and I didn’t even know this cabin was tucked back there. The host is very responsive. We had fresh brown eggs provided in the fridge, firewood included, comfortable bed, and it was all very clean. If you’re staying here to visit Lafayette it’s only a 20 minute drive up 26. I will definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to rest and relax
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"heaven on earth
makes for a great escape"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most peaceful and serene Airbnb locations I've ever stayed. Complete with an old school hammock, a bubbling creek, and a super-friendly resident feline who seems to have adopted my husband. We stayed here as it was convenient to an event we were working at nearby, but it was so nice that we'd like to come back again sometime to decompress. Thank you for sharing such a lovely space!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely worth a a stay folks! I live in the country my whole life and I still want to go back . So if you’re looking to get away from the everyday hustle.
This is a d a spot for tranquility.
Thanks Kevin"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had another great stay here, this time for 3 nights. Was able to relax. Saw lots of wildlife, a red squirrel, wood pecker, chipmunks and even a hummingbird"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to get away from neighbors, loud noises or irritating people. Was able to cook several meals in the kitchen. We really enjoyed the brown eggs that Kevin was so thoughtful to have in the fridge. I have never had brown eggs before and found them to be delightful!! Loved the Kurig with the vanilla creamer. We ate all of our meals on the patio where we heard nothing but the bubbling brook and an occasional bird. There was a very friendly cat who would visit us every day. The decor of the cabin was very inviting and you can tell Kevin has taken great care and consideration with his property. We were blessed to be able to get away to enjoy this. I would also like to say that the 2 chairs in the front room are super comfortable. The bed was the best and I have not slept so well on years. The bedding Kevin provides is clean and you can smell it. The whole cabin is very clean. Shower is small but water pressure is awesome and stays hot!! Thank you for everything!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a peaceful, relaxing weekend.
Never disappointed when staying here. We look forward to returning again in the future.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet place in a great setting. this will fit the bill. Not unexpectedly, the cabin was slightly musty. Kevin did have the dehumidifier running, so not sure if more could be done. Either way l, enjoyed the stay. Kevin was very responsive and the cabin was easy to get to."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised. Beautiful, peaceful, clean and very relaxing cabin."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Graduation weekend at Purdue and finding something that was close by AND reasonably priced proved to be quite the challenge! Nevertheless....we found it!! We were repeat guests here and were VERY happy to stay again!!! Peaceful, clean and comfortable!! The farm fresh eggs were such a treat!! Thanks for providing a great place!! Would LOVE to say we'll be back. AND we will, if we end up traveling through!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely wonderful place to stay! The creek is beautiful and the bridge overlooking it is darling. It is a quiet and quaint place. We loved how close it is to Hillside Acres!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful cabin in a peaceful, beautiful and easy to get to location! The cabin has everything you can need for a quiet getaway!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful and relaxing place to stay. The cottage is just the icing on the cake, the outdoor space was something you have to experience for yourself. It was the perfect location, close to what you needed, but felt like you were more remote. The host thought of everything. We loved our stay and hope to stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an absolutely lovely place to stay for the weekend. Quiet and idyllic. I would love to come back sometime!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay this summer. Perfect getaway from the city. We love sitting on the screen porch listening to the creek and watching the birds. Hot and sunny or cool and rainy, it's perfectly comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need, but we cook at the firepit at night. We will probably be back next summer."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic find - very clean and tidy and in a great location. We made s’mores on the firepit and enjoyed napping in the large hammock. Would definitely stay again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful scenery! Definitely a hidden gem!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,STAY STAY STAY 100% would recommend!!!!! This was one of the cleanest places with so much amenities. I would travel back just to go to this place. This place is peace and quite and just a beautiful surroundings ❤️❤️❤️
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We retired in TN 4 years ago after living in the Lafayette area for 40 years. We had a couple of events to attend and were surprised to see the cabin as an option to stay. The location was perfect. Quiet wooded area with small creek. Many different types of birds to observe. Cabin was very quaint. All necessities provided. Including a dozen of fresh eggs. We experienced great weather so did not have to use AC as temperatures dropped into 50s at night. Enjoyed a morning campfire as we ate breakfast. Overall a wonderful experience.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolute gem! We brought our son to Purdue, and this airbnb is only 15 minutes away from Lafayette. It was a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of campus at the end of the day. The birdwatching was amazing! several species of woodpeckers, nuthatches, cardinals, goldfinch, and robins, to name a few. Bring your binoculars, but you won't really need them as birds are right outside the porch screen. The sound of the creek and the fireflies twinkling at night were wonderful. We will definitely come back to this little red cabin in the woods."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful gem tucked into a beautiful farm.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful & beautiful location! Kevin was very helpful and responsive. The house had everything we needed. We look forward to coming back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So beautiful and relaxing. I agree with other reviews that the pictures don't do it justice. It's a cozy and cute cabin with everything that you could need. I loved watching all of the birds coming to the well cared for feeders (hummingbirds, woodpeckers, and everything in between). The bed and seating were all comfortable. Everything was very clean."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great cabin and very peaceful
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little quiet place to rest. I greatly enjoyed my stay! The cabin is comfortable and cozy. The land is beautiful and the host really took their time thinking of all the outside things guests could want. It rained while I was there so I read out on the porch listening to the water in the creek. The fresh eggs in the refrigerator was such a thoughtful touch. Thanks for the stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd visit here and was just as lovely as our 1st visit. Would recommend this to anyone. Very peaceful and has everything you need.
We will be back.
Thank you
Darlene & Erik"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great find! Secluded, peaceful, perfect!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very nice, the outside was very peaceful and quiet. This was exactly what we were looking for. Also if you need to go into town for anything you are just 15 minutes away. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was clean and beyond relaxing. A perfect getaway from the city. I haven't seen stars like we saw Saturday night in a long time. A perfect retreat for couples.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came in town for a wedding and loved being surrounded by Indiana in bloom. The property was alive, in bloom and beautiful! Loved the bird watching and listening to the creek flow. Very relaxing."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Honestly it’s one of the most peaceful locations I’ve had the pleasure of visiting. It’s a great way to disconnect for a bit!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice peaceful creek side location. Would come back.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super host, very accommodating and great caretaker of an amazing property."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean, quaint, getaway place! Cabin was clean and peaceful. Descriptions were accurate!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and relax. The bedroom was very dark. Enjoyed sitting in the screened in area reading.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing, great weekend getaway. Clean cabin.
Peaceful.
Great communication with owner."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to unwind and reconnect with one another. Watching the creek may have been one of our favorite things to do.
A great place to stay!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. thank you Kevin
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures actually don't do it justice. It is beautiful out there. We loved how private and secluded it was, but still 20 mins from a bigger town with every store you would need. It was clean, and had a kitchen stocked with all the dishes you would need. We will be back!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this country cabin. It was secluded enough, situated next to a creek in the country, while still being close enough to places we could stock up on necessities. There is DG market, pharmacy, and a small restaurant in town just a few minutes away.
We enjoyed the screened-in porch, watching the birds at the feeders, and laying in hammocks listening to the sounds of the creek and the woods.
There were a few things that could be improved: the shower is very cramped and the showerhead quite low (I'm 6'0"" and 180 lb); the furnishings are comfortable but dated; and the plug-in air fresheners were a bit overwhelming, to name a few. But if you set your expectations as if you're going to someone's Grandma's cabin, it's a nice place to stay.
Kevin responded quickly to questions, and was flexible on check-in and check-out. If you are not looking for luxury, but just need a peaceful getaway, this cabin is a good option!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. Very peaceful. No TV.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This beautiful property is the perfect get away for couples. I look forward to coming here again in the future!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, serene place to stay for a weekend. From morning coffee views in the sunroom to the beautiful creek/nature outside, this is a great place to find peace and to relax. Kevin had everything laid out before arrival to the cabin to understand about property for the weekend, and was helpful when needed. One is guaranteed a great time here. ⭐️"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rustic setting was just what we were looking for! We brought chairs out in front of the door to the kitchen and sat almost all day just listening to the sounds of the breeze in the trees and the birds, insects and critters along with our own music.
There is noTV which did not bother us at all! We had an iPad and could easily watch what we wanted using the WiFi-no problem.
I would recommend this to anyone that is comfortable in the rustic cabin ambiance."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to this hidden gem. Great place to unwind from your everyday life.
Cabin has everything you need and is surroundedby nature and the soothing sounds of the running water in the creek. Also close to stores, restaurants etc. We most definitely will be back.
Darlene & Erik"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is one of my favorite stays. The property is absolutely beautiful and the wildlife we got to see was stunning. Sitting on the porch in the morning was fantastic. We will be back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful spot to enjoy some playful rest and relaxation! A well kept cabin and grounds with a ton of wildlife and charm. We enjoyed our visit a ton and would love to go back again!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nature lover’s oasis! The cabin is cozy, quaint and well provisioned :)
If you’re looking to disconnect and unwind from the rat race of today’s society and social media, this is the place to do it! Secluded enough to feel you’re in another world, yet only a few minutes from Lafayette and Battle Ground.
We will definitely book again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin with lots of thoughtful touches. It was so peaceful and pleasant staying there during our son's graduation at Purdue.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very good get away and definitely worth the money spent. Would love to go back...
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and relax.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin in the woods!! Very quiet and peaceful.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at the cabin. It is the perfect getaway for a couple nights. I liked how we could control the temperature of the cabin with a separate heater for the bedroom and with the fireplace in the main room. We used the amenities to our fullest advantage - grill worker great, fire pit was nice, and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed - just add food!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty rustic, but very cozy and clean with everything you might need to unwind and unplug. The kitchen is not pictured but it is up to date, and is well stocked with tools and utensils. Kevin is quick to respond to questions. I had totally forgotten that I mentioned we were coming for my husband's birthday and when we arrived there was a birthday balloon to greet us, which was a thoughtful touch. The cabin was tastefully dressed up for fall with pumpkins and cornstalks and overall it has a quaint and cute cabin vibe, which is just what we were looking for. We picked a great weekend for some changing leaves and crisp campfire weather. In walking distance to an apple picking place with a corn maze, etc, which we skipped this time due to Covid, but in better days would be ideal. The only small issue was spotty wifi (we didn't care since we came to unplug and could still get 4G)."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this cabin justice. It is super adorable and peaceful. Kevin was very accommodating, responded immediately, and when we had a small issue was over within minutes. We would definitely stay again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay. The bridge was great overlooking the creek.
Surprise.. figuring how to turn on the lamp in bedroom. We loved the small touches. Well worth the drive. Justva few minutes outside Lafayette."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The rooms are large & clean & not cluttered up. Yet it was cozy & we were very comfortable. We felt welcomed & appreciated because the owners left generous supplies for us. Thank you for having nice supplies available instead of generics. Things like nice Kleenex’s, nice toilet paper, extra pillows & the kitchen had everything we needed & more. We enjoyed the back room with the ping pong table too. The large deck was inviting & I wish we had more time to enjoy it while we were there. Your place is really refreshing & we felt safe. The rooms had plenty of separation between them which we also loved because my grandchildren can be loud sometimes when they don’t want to sleep. This place has very nice things in it & it all seemed like new. We considered a hotel suite but they are small and not very roomy & cost much more so this place was perfect. Thank you so much for everything & I hope you will continue to host this place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed the location. We came in for the Indy 500 and got to spend time on the deck with our family Saturday night! Great space and they are very responsive. House was clean and well stocked.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,MoJo’s Properties’ place was exactly as described and spacious! They were quick to respond and very clear in their instructions!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"always a great experience here, very quiet and walkable space with great views of the county courthouse. plenty of room in the unit with great amenities and appliances, TV in every bedroom plus two in the common areas. very responsive host, makes your stay feel like home. addition of new security system since my last stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location. Easy to walk to food and fun. The place was beautiful and spacious. I loved that there were many places our family of five could spread out or be together. It was less expensive than renting 2 hotel rooms (since no hotel in the area would allow five guests).
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect! It was in a fantastic location, and we were able to walk to dinner, to the grocery store and to the brewery for happy hour. It snowed the last night we were there, so we woke up to a white dusting everywhere. The place is adorable, it’s a great size for 4-6 people, and it has a wonderful view. I can’t recommend it enough. My only note is that there are steep narrow stairs up to the place. If you have a problem carrying your things up the stairs, it could be an issue. For us, it was absolutely no problem."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is very spacious and comfortable! In a great part of town, lots of restaurants within walking distance.
Only suggestion for owner would be a few throw blankets. The temps were really low when we stayed. Extra throws on the bed and/or couches would have been nice. Overall it was a great experience, we would definitely stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"love this place, great loft feel with good amenities and well equipped kitchen. in the center of Lebanon, very walkable with decent restaurants in the square and good access to I-65. Great night view of the historic courthouse with illuminated dome and no neighbors for a peaceful/quiet rest. One of the best hosts/managers on Airbnb, friendly, proactive and most accommodating. they ask for comments and improvement recommendations and act on them to make the unit and your stay better.
I've rented 20 times on Airbnb in the last 6 months and by far MoJo has provided the best experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"stayed here before under different management and will definitely stay here again on the new management. The place was great, quiet in the evenings without any neighbors, yet right in the center of town close to restaurants and bars with easy access to I-65. the apartment has a great loft vibe, is very well furnished and comfortable and with all the needed amenities, including well stocked kitchen. the host was very accommodating and friendly. they proactively identified issues and addressed them immediately, keeping me informed of everything that was going on so it had no impact on my stay whatsoever. I had a great experience and will stay here many times again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was great for our Purdue football reunion weekend. Tim is a tremendous host. He responded to every query promptly and with detailed answers.
The location was great for the football game. Easy to get to campus and park in about 15 minutes on game day. Easy to get back without too much traffic delay.
The house was in perfect shape, everything working and was as described. Bedding and towels were new, clean and neat. We used all four bedrooms and the fold out bed/couch downstairs. All were excellent.
We easily parked four cars in the driveway and a fifth along the circle behind the other cars without interfering with the neighbors. When a friend stopped by to visit for a bit, we parked another car along the curb on the opposite side of the circle without blocking anything for the neighbors. We had no complaints from any of them (of course we didn't throw any noisy parties).
Overall our visit was perfect, especially because of Tim's friendliness and responsiveness!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd time renting Tim's home. Tim is and always has been very responsive! I appreciate how promptly he responded both before and during our stay. The house was not just comfortable and clean, it was immaculate and super organized! The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need for your stay. The added touches of personal care products in the bathrooms and very explicit instructions on the operation of the appliances and electronics really made our stay carefree and relaxing. Our family of 7 had plenty of room for together time and the space to be not always together! Our 3.5yo granddaughter even remembered being there last August as she knew which room was 'hers' for the weekend! Thank you, Tim for sharing your home another fantastic Miller family weekend."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was very relaxing.
Tim was very informative and detailed with the details of the stay.
If you’re a smoker though, there is NO smoking allowed on the premises. You can have a bonfire but not a cigar while enjoying the bonfire. Found that out after we arrived!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim was very responsive and made it feel like he really cared about the guests staying in his house!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I am a local resident in the process of relocating for work. My youngest just graduated from high school, and I was looking for a place to host her grad party. Tim graciously opened his home to my family, and it was the perfect place. It is a beautiful home that is well taken care of. There was plenty of room for my family. The neighborhood is quiet. Purdue, restaurants, shopping, and things to do are just a short drive away. I highly recommend his home if you are looking for a classy, quiet place just outside of town."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tim was so prompt and responsive! Our original place to stay for my sisters wedding fell through and so the day before she got married we requested this Airbnb and within 15 minutes of booking Tim’s place he responded and warmly welcomed us! His place was spacious and homey and perfect for our big family to stay. There are many great coffee shops and places to go in the area and this stay was such a life savor for us all! We would all highly recommend his place!

This was great for multiple people including our teenage son who liked having the basement room to himself away from the adults! We recommend staying here! We did not have any problems and loved the house.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place to rent for a large family, when gathering for an event. We were in town for our son's wedding at Purdue and were able to use this as our 'home base.' Tim was very easy to contact, had a local person there to deal with any issues that might arise, and has set up the house so it's very user friendly - clear directions and notes in the various rooms and nice touches like complimentary toiletries, in case you've forgotten an item.

Tim, the owner, provided excellent resources which allowed us to enjoy his home (including projection movie viewing). We hosted family members who had traveled from the south and the north in the well appointed kitchen and living spaces. The number of bedrooms/bathrooms was perfect for the groom and immediate family to get ready for the big event. I highly recommend this home!"
2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a great place to go to.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim was an amazing host and his home was perfect for our reunion with friends! From the very beginning, Tim was very quick to respond, detailed, and helpful. There were 3 families that stayed overnight (6 adults and 3 children) and 1 family that was there for half a day (another 2 adults and 2 children) and there was more than enough room for everyone. The kids loved playing in the backyard and in the large fully-finished basement. The kitchen was very spacious with a huge refrigerator and plenty of counter space. It was nice to have so many bathrooms in the house; throughout the day, we utilized the powder room on the main floor and in the evening, each family had their own bathroom either in or right next to their bedroom. I can't say enough about how perfect this house was for our large group with children and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable place to stay. It was definitely our home away from home!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay for our two families. Perfect amount of room for everyone to spread out or get together, quiet neighborhood, and easy to get to. Can't say enough about how nice it was and that we'd happily stay again."

We had a great stay in this very clean and perfectly equipped home. Spacious rooms equipped with a lot of love, several bathrooms - we felt at home with our 5-person travel group. The communication with Tim was very good and straightforward. Ample parking right in front of the house. A great stay, warm greetings from the 5 boys from Germany!!!!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim has been a great help for us, will definitely come back again!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our group of 9 was at Tim's home for a work conference. We were only there overnight, but we had a great stay. His home was very clean and spacious, and he supplied food and toiletries. There was more than enough room for all of us. Our only complaint was that we could not stay longer!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was very clean throughout. The house has a very large well-equipped kitchen. There was plenty of counter space for food preparation or setting out snacks, fruit, and sandwich fixings, which is what we did. Adjacent to the kitchen is an good size eat-in area. Next to that is a large family room with plenty of seating. These areas are where our family gathered most of the time. In addition there is a dining room-living room area with more space to gather. The basement has a large rec-room with adjacent bar and counter for additional space if some in the group wanted to hang out there. There is an additional bedroom and bath in the basement, and a pull out sofa. Two of our group slept in the basement. We did not use the yard, but the lawn was quite green and lush. Coming from climates that are much drier, we were amazed by the lawn. The house has 3.5 baths, providing 3 areas to shower and 2 bathtubs if desired and a half-bath on the main floor. All the bathrooms helped as we all needed to get ready for a wedding at about the same time. Each of the bedrooms was larger than expected--with queens or double beds and space in the room for putting suitcases, etc. The beds were comfortable, with lots of extra bedding if needed. Tim provided a house manual, telling us where things were and some instructions on how to operate the heating/cooling, for example. Our family group (adults and an infant) had room to be all together as well as private places to sleep, etc. The house is in pleasant, safe neighborhood. There is a WalMart grocery store and a Payless grocery store each about 5 minutes away. Tim responded quickly to all my questions. He provided a new PackNPlay for our infant grandchild. For our family group this house worked out more conveniently than several motel rooms would have worked. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this house to others without hesitation."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was great from start to finish. Tim was great with communication and and was incredibly helpful about finding things in the area. House is incredibly large and perfect for family or multiple couples traveling. There was plenty of money my house feel like a home away from home. Tim met me and walk me around the house. It felt very personal and I truly love what you expect wait these rentals.
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our group loved the house and the big roomy spaces to hang out in. The neighborhood was great for walking. Tim was amazing at being reachable and was wonderful to work with. We truly felt at home away from home here.

2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great host. Tim couldn't have made it easier for us. Also super easy to get ahold of."
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim was awesome and so helpful during our stay! We came to town for a game and he made sure to be available early for us to pick up the key. The house was wonderful for our many guests, plenty of space and we LOVED the movie room! He had a manual with answers to any questions we may have as well as emergency resources-very thought out and great to have! We will definitely be staying again when we are in town. Boiler Up!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Easy directions for audio visual equipment. Family oriented neighborhood. Host was easy to contact and had back up contacts as well."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim was an absolute pleasure to work with, and his house exceeded all of our expectations. The house is in a quiet neighborhood about 10 minutes from campus, and it made for a very easy game day commute.

The house itself was clean and everything was ready for our arrival; the beds were made up and the bathrooms were stocked with fresh towels. Tim also left us a great guide to the house that let us know where everything was so that we could find anything. He is very accessible and easy to get a hold of.

I have no doubt that our group will be back in the future. Thank you!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house instructions were very clear and Tim was willing to help me out with anything. Moreover, the house was very tidy and big."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything worked well. Tim was very communicative prior to and during our stay and ensure we were able to get into the property. There was plenty of space for our family with a nice sized kitchen to make food. There was not access to a coffee maker, so bring your own if this is something important to you!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything was better than expected!!! going to stay here again and recommend it to whoever in know!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy little space. Perfect for our trip to Purdue to see our granddaughter's graduation. Tiny little suggestion - would have liked to get the code for the lockbox the day before so I would have all the info I needed to get in prior to getting on the road. Had to wait until that day to get it when we were on the road traveling. Besides that everything was perfect.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Needed a clean and quiet place for one night. Once I got access to the space, it was big enough for 1-2 people. Would recommend updating the bathroom and it would be a 5 star. The small fridge, microwave and teapot were appreciated. Saw a couple of small bugs but Im not squeamish so not a big deal. Location was quiet and was not that far from Purdue. Major stores are within a 5 minute drive. In my opinion a fair price for what you get."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great for a single person on a solo journey to rest up before getting back on the road. Loved it and thank you again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Private. Clean. And Jean was accessible and responsive. Would definitely book again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! It was the perfect size for us. We only needed a place for one night, so this room was exactly what we were looking for. Jean thought of everything and had the pack n play set up for our baby when we arrived. It was cutely decorated and made us feel right at home! If we are in area in the future I would definitely book it again!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our one-night stay! Check-in was really easy and the space was comfortable and private.
My only suggestion would be that the curtain panels on the main door (glass) should be wider because you really have to fiddle with them to get them covering the whole door."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was just what I needed for a short visit in Lafayette. An easy 20-25 minute drive to visit my daughter in West Lafayette north of campus. The bed was very comfortable and I appreciated having an electric heater and a hot water kettle with instant coffee, teas, cream, sugar. The bathroom felt like it could use some attention, but overall it was clean and worked for a weekend stay. If you play pickleball, we had great luck at nearby McCaw Pickleball Fields only 10 minutes away."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even though I didn't meet Jean and her family during the stay, I felt as though I was staying with family. Place was welcoming and private yet I knew I wasn't alone. Thank you for a great stay!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place would def stay again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All good. I would have liked to have been a bit closer to the Purdue campus but only because I had no car. Jean did say it was 15 minutes away when I booked, however & the price was very reasonable for a football weekend in West Lafayette."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even though our stay was short it was lovely, Jean was very proactive with communication so we knew all the ins and outs, felt safe and comfortable checking in, and had no problem checking out.

I’m so very grateful for meeting jean and staying with her for the last 14 or so weeks."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and dad stayed at Jean's place two nights for my daughter's wedding. They said Jean was very helpful and communicative and that the room was spotless, the bed was very comfortable, and the setting was peaceful. Thanks, Jean!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jean is such a delight to stay with! I am a traveling medical professional and have stayed with Jean weekly for the last few months. I could t have asked for a better place to stay. I’ll be recommending her to all of my traveling buddies.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"On our cross-country travels, we often stop in Lafayette to break up the trip.

It was so clean and cozy and well-appointed -- they have thought of everything to make your evening is a restful one. We loved our stay so much we're staying here again on our journey home in a week."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jean and Scott were wonderful hosts. The room was very nice, very comfortable and private. Access and entry was easy. It is located in a beautiful setting in the outskirts of Lafayette and is a great value particularly on a football weekend. Be aware that it can be as much as 30 minutes to the Purdue campus depending on traffic but all things considered that is a minor point."

So peaceful, accurately described and clean comfortable place to relax at the end of a long day walking around campus. Well stocked and what scenic views! My only regret is not being able to enjoy the unit as i only come home to sleep. Maybe next time.
Jean is an awesome hostess - very accommodating and responsive. I checked in very late and the light was on and i was given detailed instructions so check in was a breeze even at 3:30 am! Thanks Jean for your hospitality.
Highly recommend this place."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Located in a quiet subdivision, the name really does sum up the description of this place. It was very much a home away from home for my wife and I while attending a wedding in downtown Lafayette. Even though it is a country setting, it is only minutes from the conveiences of the city and an easy trip to downtown Lafayette and the Purdue campus."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had such a lovely stay! The room was very welcoming and the bed was super comfortable. Purdue and all of the great things around Lafayette and West Lafayette were a quick drive away. Jean was prompt in responding and is indeed a super host. Thank you!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jean’s place was perfect for us! My son and I were traveling between Illinois and Kentucky and wanted a clean place not far from the expressway.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough! We were in a stressful situation of moving from one home and another.

I will definitely recommend to out of town friends.

2018-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for 2 nights while in town for work. Being close ro the job and having a private entrance and bathroom was nice. However the lack of access ro a fridge and microwave was challenging.
Space is downstairs, so I could at times hear them but never saw them."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a comfortable, well appointed space in a quiet neighborhood, that’s out of the way, but close to town. It was very clean, and a good value for the money."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very economical, private, nicely decorated. Good storage for a longer stay. Good option for visiting Purdue. Close to inexpensive dining options and to expressway."

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott and Jean provide a terrific B&B experience at their Country Resting Place! They provide a well-lit private entrance for their guests complete with off-street parking, a lock box for easy come & go, an outdoor area with table & chairs, plus a porch swing! Inside, you'll find a nicely furnished bedroom with free Wifi, a desk, dresser, nightstand, a fresh and comfortable bed, extra blankets if needed, and even some books! The PRIVATE bathroom is sparkling clean, with gorgeous fluffy towels, shampoo & body wash, nice shower -- all which made for a very comfortable stay. The private hallway closet with tray table, shelving, and hanger space was very convenient. The full-size mirror in the bedroom is an especially nice touch. Breakfast bars and bottled water were provided to help me get on my way quickly in the morning, which was just what I needed.
Jean was absolutely delightful in her hospitality. The location was perfect for me: just minutes from West Lafayette and all the eateries and convenience stores imaginable; and yet, the house is located on a very quiet cul-de-sac with lots of land. I took a nice walk in the beautiful neighborhood.
I highly recommend Scott & Jean's Country Resting Place for all travelers in the Lafayette area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second experience with Nickel Plate Flats - this time to facilitate our annual trip to attend the Indianapolis 500. I grew up nearby and I am still pleasantly surprised that this type of convenient, quality accommodation is located in Frankfort.
Conveniently located near I-65, one can easily access events at Purdue or in Indianapolis in less than an hour. Closer accommodations have fewer amenities and cost considerably more.
A drug store and the popular local favorite Arni’s restaurant are both mere steps away.
The strongest compliment I can pay is that this beats the heck out of an expensive, antiseptic, cookie cutter hotel in Lafayette or Indianapolis. To have a full kitchen and a washer/dryer makes this choice a no-brainer for multi-night stays. There is absolutely no sign of prior bookings, which is practically unheard of in the hotel industry.
Kudos to Leslie and the team at Nickel Plate Flats for providing an affordable oasis in a convenient location!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,First 3 days we slept with the window open. Then switched to AC. very comfortable both ways!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Leslie was responsive and helpful during my husbands medical emergency. We will come back many times!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had 4 rooms for two days and one for one day. I'll only submit this one review.
After some communications problems everything went well. Leslie was very helpful from her side. There was a confusion which prevented my responding to her instructions to complete changes. That was due to the fact that texts were sent to a landline phone. I think its number must have been acquired from previous stays. And, different numbers were picked off because I made two reservations and three from different computers. This resulted in wrong message for the same credit card."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what I needed for the week.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in downtown Frankfort with a super friendly and gracious host.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very comfortable room to live in.
I will rent it again next time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was perfect, even though we stayed just one night and didn’t spend much time there, the building was very easy to locate, everything was clean, and the we couldn’t hear any of the neighbors!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in this complex 3 different times. Each of the apartments was clean, and just as described on the site. Whenever we come to Frankfort we will continue to stay at Nickel Plate Flats."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Solid place for a short or long-term stay in Frankfort. Host was responsive to questions and helpful. Location-wise it’s as in town as you can get. Well accommodating for 1 or 2 people. 3 people would get cramped after a few days. Only issue is the noise. Walls are thin and you can hear everything going in your neighbors unit. Additionally, on the street-side, emergency vehicles seem to come through about 3-4 nights a week and woke me up every night, and there are occasional trains you will hear."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I somehow created a second account, but have stayed at Nickel Plate flats several times since they opened in 2018, being one of the first renters, and six years later the upkeep of the place has been pristine and it’s just as good as the first stay. This was my first time staying alone without my family and I stayed in the one bedroom. I felt safe and secure. I stayed during winter weather and even arrived back to the apartment just before midnight and they were being very proactive with shoveling the sidewalks even that late at night. I am so glad Frankfort has this Airbnb available for my trips back to my hometown."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, easy check-in, clean space, comfy bed. We stayed here while in town visiting family, so we were mostly there to sleep. This is our second time staying at this building and it’s our go-to place to see if it’s available when we visit."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! Your place was perfect for our weekend in Clinton County for my high school reunion. There were a lot of little extras that I haven’t seen at other places we’ve stayed, such as coffee and creamer, travel size amenities, etc. This was a super easy, super nice experience!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A spotless, beautiful apartment! Leslie was very helpful with all the instructions for check in/out. Their apartment was a perfect place for 2 to enjoy and get away for a peaceful weekend. We had a well spent weekend coming to visit Purdue (only a 35 min drive)!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very smooth check in/check out. Leslie was very quick to reply to a question that we had. Located with in walking distance of a breakfast place and a couple of lunch/supper places. The unit was very clean.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodation. Everything was clean and well appointed. Located on a he square in downtown Frankfort. A bit of outside noise noted at night, but not too distracting. I would recommend it as a place to stay in Frankfort."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location was awesome, right in the middle of all the action, which made it super convenient for exploring and just living life to the fullest!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed being on the Frankfort city square though early morning traffic was louder than we'd anticipated. The apartment was well-suited for our needs but we'd chosen the property to make us of the rooftop veranda and were disappointed that other tenants were hosting loud parties each evening.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location overlooking the central town square. Roof access was a nice bonus. Very clean and comfortable. Walkable to restaurants. I personally love the sound of a train through town, others may not. I slept peacefully and don’t recall it at night. The only challenge during my stay was finding a walkable coffee shop on a Sunday morning. Would stay here again for a place reasonably close to Purdue."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Leslie for hosting, place was nice and comfortable"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This space was very fitting for what we needed it for! The apartment was clean, well decorated and stocked without being cluttered. Having laundry accessible in the unit was a HUGE plus!
Our only complaint would be the surrounding noise level. Our baby stirred often when sleeping between 8pm-8am because of a nearby railroad track, emergency vehicles and the morning and evening commute traffic. We did bring a sound machine which was helpful and there was a sound machine in the bedroom as well. All in all, a great stay for a great price!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and ready for anything

Kitchen was a little dark for cooking, but the bar was nice to eat at with the dangling lights above you. One table lamp was missing a lightbulb, not a big deal at all. People were nice, lots of sidewalks. Definitely cleaner and more modern than a hotel stay for just a few bucks more!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a nice stay at the Nickel Plate Flats #218. The space is roomy, clean, and the bed is comfortable. Just be aware that the unit faces a very busy street. Suggest having a ""white noise"" machine to drown out the road noise. Would love to see a TV in the bedroom, and a few framed pictures on the walls to make it a little more homey. But, all in all, it is a great value and I recommend it."

We had an unfortunate incident wherein the keys to this house fell out of my husband’s pocket at a location 45 minutes away and it was late at night so we had to knock on their door and wake them up (!) to let us in! We were so embarrassed but they didn’t make us feel bad about this! They even offered us a new key the next day but the first thing we did in the morning was go back to our prior location and luckily we did find the key! I wish every Airbnb was this nice and every host this accommodating.

Our hosts were kind enough to make up the second bedroom couch for our toddler, there was very easy to access to laundry which was awesome as we had been traveling. And the backyard! Oh my goodness it's like a park. Overlooking pristine farmland - relaxing swings, and a fire pit.

It wasn't at all an issue for me - but do note that there are many steps to get up to the apartment.
Communication with Stacy & the co-hosts was wonderful. Super fast & responsive. Check in & check out was super easy. Had an issue with the internet and got an instant response and it was fixed pretty much immediately.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place we loved it!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb itself was clean, spotless and great amenities. Stacy gave very clear instructions and we were able to check in and check out without confusion. Although there seemed to be a bit of miscommunication between the other cohosts about the parking situation. WiFi was a bit slow to do anything besides streaming Netflix but that's all we used it for so it was fine. The town itself is very small and there isn't much to do there, although there is a small little park over the river which was a nice walk. Overall experience was good but Stacy wasn't very responsive. Also, something to note. There are neighbors that live next door. When they walk by they can see you through the window if you are sitting in the living room couch as well as if you're in the kitchen."

this review is based on her responsiveness and attention to detail. I ended up not staying at her place (because of my issue, not hers).

Jennifer and Forrest were very gracious, kind, and flexible. We had to change our reservation and they were very accommodating.
If you have the chance, you must stay here. We will be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An absolutely wonderful little farm outside of Lebanon.

There are beautiful animals all over the grounds; friendly cats and chickens aplenty! You have the opportunity to interact with more friends on the farm, if that’s your thing. We loved it! Our hosts were incredibly kind, thoughtful, and helpful. The cottage was exactly as described! It was well appointed and cozy and so quiet. I couldn’t have dreamed up a more perfect experience if I tried. Forrest and Jennifer are really on to something special at Heavenly Acres. I would absolutely recommend and will definitely stay here if I’m ever in the area again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Heavenly Acres for the total solar eclipse. The added activities were well organized. Forrest and Jennifer were so welcoming and friendly, opening their farm to us and other visitors for the event. We got an awesome farm tour where we met and learned about the animals, had a hayride on the property, took strolls along the creek, and had a lovely space to rest in. I even was able to purchase some yarn that came from one of the animals. The cottage itself was very clean and exactly what we needed for a 2-night stay. It was fun to wake up to chicken and donkey sounds. If it weren't so far away from us, we'd definitely make more trips to hang out with Forrest and Jennifer on the farm."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My mother and I were searching for a unique activity to do with my 11-year-old niece over her spring break. During our online search, we discovered Heavenly Acres Farm. My mother had grown up on a farm and it was delightful to see her back in that environment again. My niece had always wanted to pet a chicken, and with the help of Jen and Forrest, she was able to fulfill her wish. Jen and Forrest were outstanding hosts and ensured that we were comfortable throughout our stay."

Jennifer kept up immediately with our communication and was waiting to greet us with a smile when we finally arrived! We loved our stay! Our itinerary only allowed us to be at Heavenly Acres to sleep. It was very nice to start our trip and end our day in a cozy home with a comfortable, warm bed! We'd love to come back again when we have time to take a tour."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This was a good little rental unit. However we traveled in for an event and we were really only there to sleep so it worked out fine! The place was clean. The beds weren’t the best but again that was okay since we were just there to sleep. Also there are not doors to the sleeping spaces so keep that in mind when booking. Loved the animals around the farm though.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot for us. We felt comfortable and right at home. Appreciate the fresh eggs on arrival and hopefully next visit have time for animal visits. The owners have did a great job with this space. Appreciate you all hosting us.

I got to help out with the morning and evening chores and interact with all the animals. Both Forrest and Jennifer answered all my questions and provided in depth education about the operation of the farm and care of the animals. Bottle feeding the adorable baby goat who was the runt of triplets was a wonderful highlight. This stay surpassed all my expectations and I loved every minute of it. Would love to return in the future with my husband and other family members."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heavenly Acres Farm was a perfect place to stay. It was a close enough drive for us to get in to Indianapolis for events and it was a nice relaxing place for my mother to stay while we were at events.
They were very nice hosts and informative when it came to us learning and helping out with the farm animals."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where to start? Jennifer and Forrest's place is a refreshing stay with all of the amenities you need, but the tranquility of a farm with animals who are friendly and loved. Jennifer took the time to introduce us to daily chores for all the animals and made it very fun for our 4 and 6 year olds. We loved the farm fresh eggs! If you are looking for a hands-on farm experience, dont hesitate to book here! Both hosts take pride in their farm and hosting visitors."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Forrest and Jennifer were both very nice and purchasing the farm experience was worth it for our girls.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Forrest and Jennifer's place was absolutely wonderful!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our experience was absolutely wonderful! Forrest and Jennifer are complete gems and were more than willing to show my son all the many facets of farming.

It was the perfect place to stay while visiting family and we hope to come back when we are in Indiana again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for us to stay. It was centrally located for what we needed. Only thing I would have changed is at least a curtain for the bedroom doorway. That was the only drawback for us. Jennifer and Forrest were great! Very friendly and helpful. We didn't have much time during daylight hours to be there, but we did enjoy the animals. I would stay here again. 😁"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and hosts. We were in the area for a graduation at Purdue, and loved being away from the hustle and bustle and on the peaceful farm. great hosts and a comfortable cottage."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent a weekend at the farmhouse and not only my 3 years old son, but we enjoyed the stay a lot. The house is small, can accommodate one family. It doesn’t have a kitchen but has fridges, griddle, microwave etc as mentioned in the listing. Forrest and Jennifer are very responsive and always answered out messages in 2-3 mins. As part of your stay you get a unique experience of helping them in all their work. We fed the Alpacas, goats, cows, donkeys, chickens and ducks. There are miniature horses and pigs as well. Forrest and Jennifer answered all our questions and taught us so many stuffs our son was so excited in helping them in their work. Also, you will see few friendly cats who will lead you in your walks.
Overall, it worth a visit to the wonderful farmhouse to spend a quite and unique relaxing time.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a truly wonderful couple of days! And an especially wonderful experience for children and young families. I brought my son and 2 year old granddaughter for the farm visit. They loved it. But I did too! Very relaxing. Nothing like waking up to the sound or roosters and the clucking of hens and the quacking of ducks! Jennifer and Forrest were available, generously had us helping with the animals and shared so that we all had a sense of being a part of. It was a wonderful opportunity."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a WONDERFUL time on the farm! Jennifer and Forest were so kind and let us be as involved as we wanted to.

We will absolutely be sharing the experience and encouraging friends to check it out!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jennifer and Forrest were so warm and welcoming from the moment we arrived. They were amazing with our kids and allowed them to fully participate and get hands on with the animals. Jennifer took time to show us how they process fiber and let us try our hands as well. They were easy to communicate with and coordinate the various activities with us without ever making us feel like we had to do something. The property is beautiful and we enjoyed walking the mown path and watching the animals. I was worried about the forecasted rain but the weather mostly cooperated and the bits of rain we did have didn't stop us from having fun. It was a dream trip and my kids are plotting how to have their own farm.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Heavenly Acres. Jennifer and Forrest are wonderful hosts and helped create lovely memories for my kids. We have recommended our friends visit and look forward to returning.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This farm is full of life! Goats, pigs, sheep, turkeys, geese, donkeys and miniature horses. And then there were countless chickens and many cats that welcomed us as we pulled up the laneway.
We joined Jennifer and Forrest every day for morning and evening chores during our stay and we came to understand that the animals are very well taken care of and their feed is of the highest quality. Their knowledge of their animals and the love they showed for them was evident. Jennifer and Forrest were gracious with their time and provided us with information and answers to all our questions. It became a great learning experience for our young girls.
The barn is classic and reminds us of our agricultural heritage. The buildings and pens are quaint and the scale of the farm was appropriate to showcase their sustainable and environmental farm practices.
The accommodations were clean and well equipped with a country feel decor. The animals were nearby and we loved walking to the pens and hearing all the farm activity. Jennifer and Forrest provided a flexible schedule that worked for both of us.
An amazing farm vacation experience that we highly recommend to all families.
Again, thank you, Jennifer and Forrest, for your wonderful hospitality."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a wonderful time! The kids absolutely loved “helping” with the farm chores and our stay even inspired my husband to get a chicken coop! We stayed for our daughters’ 8th and 6th birthdays and it was so special. Jennifer and Forrest surprised us with cupcakes from Titus which were such a sweet touch. We will definitely be back! Thank you!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had to come that way for a wedding. So I decided why not try a farm. We grew up in the city, and I thought my kids who are five, seven and 10 months would enjoy being on a farm so many animals. They had a blast. The room was very nice. I agree with one of the posters, the pictures don't do it justice.
Forest and Jennifer were very accommodating. If I could give them six stars I would. For the price, we paid, this was a bargain."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best experience and stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the farm for three nights.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend loves goats and he got the Best Birthday Surprise of a weekend stay at Jennifer & Forrest’s Heavenly Acre Farms and cottage! Being able to meet the goats and to hold Skunk, a 3-week old goat was such a delight for him. My daughter loved feeding Tiny, a 3-week old lamb, learning about each of the animals, learning how to milk a goat and how to spin llama fur into yarn.
We went into Thorntown to enjoy a dinner at Stookey’s restaurant. All 4 of us enjoyed our meals. We shopped at the Dollar General for the weekend meals. Our family enjoys playing cards so when it rained, we had a wonderful space to relax, snack and play cards.
My honey would have LOVED to buy Skunk and bring him home with us; however, our neighborhood HOA feels otherwise. We hope Skunk finds a loving home soon! 🐐"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a must! Jennifer and Forrest are so hospitable and knowledgeable. The care of their animals is amazing! I can’t recommend them enough.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really loved staying in the farm house at Forrest & Jennifer's Heavenly Acres Farm. We stayed at an extension of the farm house which was really pleasant and private to hang out with the family. But at the same time we were close to Forrest and Jennifer should we need anything.
The farm experience was an absolute blast. Our family enjoyed relaxing but having hands on experience of helping Forrest and Jennifer take care of their animals was truly one of the best experiences we have had.
The weather was a little rough and having sturdy boots to switch to was key. During our stay there were some new residents being born which was exciting. Our kids also got to participate in a really fun Easter Egg hunt! This was truly an amazing experience that we cherish and highly recommend for the kiddos."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! My 4 year old had a great time helping with things on the farm. The space was clean and comfortable, and just over a 1/2 hour from downtown Indy."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the farm! Forrest and Jennifer were very kind and thoughtful. They gave the girls (and I) a wonderful experience. They were so patient with the girls and took the time to explain everything and answer all questions. The cottage was perfect! We can't wait to visit again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect stay and experience for me and my seven year old son. The cottage is so sweet and cozy to relax in after an afternoon tending to the animals. The hosts were so welcoming and kind. We fell in love with this little farm and will definitely be back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and quiet Jennifer and Forrest were very helpful and loved being to look out the window or door and see animals and chickens and love that the cats will just come up to you would definitely recommend and will definitely stay again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place as exactly, even better, than advertised. We had two adults and three kids, and all of us were able to sleep comfortably and had a great time. There is space enough for everyone, and the farm experience was awesome for the kids. Forrest and Jennifer will walk you through the daily chores of feeding the animals, and will answer any questions you have. Our kids loved it!
Forrest and Jennifer were also the perfect hosts, very friendly and accomodating. Book here with confidence."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is fantastic! Forrest and Jenifer were very hospitable and the cabin was clean. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay here and hope to swing by again if the future allows it.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest and Jennifer are incredible hosts -- they are thoughtful and kind, and genuinely want families to have a great experience at their farm! Highlights from this visit included: a long walk by the creek and fields on the property, a bonfire that Forrest helped us set up, 2-week-old lambs, and finding some surprise-eggs in the barn.
This was our second visit, and we'll definitely be back later this year to check out the Easter Egg Hunt and maybe the Fourth of July fireworks, as well!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful time on the Heavenly Acres farm. We only wish it were longer. The location was straight forward to find. The room was safe and comfy. There were alpacas, sheep, goats, donkeys, horses, mules, pigs, chicken, duck and lots of friendly cats. And oh the alpacas! They were the most beautiful and sweetest creature to pet and feed. Our hosts are the warmest most hospitable people that shared their animal farm life with us and told us many eye opening anecdotes. Because of the weather, we had to cut our stay short, Forrest and Jen accommodate us anyway despite that a two days minimum was listed. We are so lucky to be able to celebrate our new year eve this way!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Expect a warm welcome from both humans and animals. Everything is included that you might need..even coffee.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a week from Georgia, to visit with family. We loved staying here as opposed to any hotel. We didnt enteract much with the hosts, as we were spending more time with family, but the couple times we crossed paths Forrest was incredibly friendly and great at explaining all the farm fun facts to us and our children.
We will keep this place in mind in the future when we come back up to visit."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful farm stay and cozy Airbnb! We had a great time meeting Jennifer and Forrest and all of their wonderful animals, and sharing their farm with our family and friends. We would definitely recommend Heavenly Acres for a peaceful and educational farm stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Forrest and Jennifer were wonderful hosts. They made our visit feel like visiting friends. Our kids really enjoyed interacting with their animals and didn't complain about getting up in the morning to help out with the farm chores ... it was an adventure for them. We would highly recommend this trip to anyone interested in getting away to the country or being introduced to small farm life.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hi. we loved your place, my kids wanted to stay longer. We enjoyed contact with God's creation. Your farm is really nice and the apartment is modern, clean, comfortable. thanks."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely long weekend away for our family! Jennifer and Forrest are awesome - generous with their time and encouraging with kids who are eager to ""help."" They made us feel like old friends in town for a visit. The animals are friendly and quirky: a pig who likes belly rubs, cuddly farm cats, guard donkeys who like their butts scratched, etc. We were thoroughly charmed by the entire menagerie. The cottage is cute and comfortable - the pix don't do it justice! There are four beds: 2 fulls in 2 rooms, and a day/trundle bed in the living room. The kitchen has a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, electric griddle, and there's a grill just outside for easy meals. There are also lots of places nearby for take-out/dine-in: Stookeys, Titus, and Greeks were all great. Dulls Farm had tons of run-around fun for kids, Spencer's Farm had a HUGE pumpkin patch, McCloud Nature Preserve had a surprisingly-tricky prairie maze, and Starlight Theater is an awesome drive-in. Overall A++ for a fun, fresh-air-filled farm stay with two awesome hosts. Highly recommend!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third trip to Jennifer and Forrest's. We were warmly greeted and enjoyed getting caught up on all the news at Heavenly Acres. The apartment is immaculately clean and comfortable. We bring some simple microwavable meals or items to prepare on the griddle--there is also a corner gas station store with convenience items walking distance from the farm There were fresh chicken and duck eggs in the refrigerator and coffee waiting for our breakfast, too! My 13 year old and I enjoy participating in the farm tour, which is a close up experience with the animals, helping with their feeding, learning about their care and personalities. Back at home, we are still enjoying the eggs we bought from Jennifer. This is a great place to relax, connect with nature, read a book with a cat curled up next to you and learn with your kids about sustainable and ethical farming. Jennifer and Forrest are so kind and welcoming--We can't wait to go back. *Note-bring boots if you're doing the farm tour:)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can't recommend this farm enough. This is the second year we've brought our oldest to visit the animals and work on the farm, and it's by far her favorite experience of both years. She's already talking about coming back next year!
Jennifer will make you feel welcome, teach you about farm life, and provides you with a clean, comfortable space to stay.
Plenty of restaurants and shopping within 10 minutes and lots of nature to enjoy. 11/10!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful spot, wonderful people. This was a family trip to experience a working farm. The interactions with animals were well thought out and enriching. The housing was great for a family with children. Some good restaurants nearby. I highly recommend booking the farm experience with the visit."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay and it was as wonderful as the first. Both of my sons learned so much and had such a good time. (Wish I could get them as excited to do chores at home as they are to do them here!) Jennifer and Forest are great at making you feel a part of the farm while letting you have as much privacy as you want at the same time. The accommodations are comfortable and the extra touches make you feel welcomed.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The air bnb is connected to the house, I really thought from the pictures it was a separate house. Also the two bedrooms have no doors, so that was interesting. Also if you have small children this is not ideal.. my kids would never sleep on the pull out couch away from me, and my son is to young to do so. We had another couple stay with us, and after they filled up the other room and the pull out couch was pulled out, there really wasn’t any room left. I had to scramble to find a place for my kids to stay the night, I was honestly pretty upset. I did not realize how small it was, and there was no stove, so don’t plan to cook to much. This was my wedding weekend and the water was well which is normally fine, but it smelt like sulfur. The hosts were very nice and helpful when we got there, I just wish the description for this place was more accurate. The pictures that were taken of the front of the house do not show that this is connected to their main living space. The space is cute, it is just not really what we needed for this weekend."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the farm! Jennifer and Forrest were fantastic hosts and taught us a great deal about taking care of the animals. My daughter loved getting to feed and pet the animals, and most of all collecting the eggs! Jennifer took us around three times during our full day so my daughter could have lots of time with the animals. It was a great, relaxing experience! I’d highly recommend for anyone with young kids."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I are so grateful for the opportunity to visit Forrest and Jennifer's farm! Forrest met us upon arrival (even though we rolled in past 10 pm) and let us know everything we needed to know about our stay. We loved ""helping"" with morning chores and interacting with the animals. If you're looking to indulge in a quiet, rural vacation, this is the spot!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for some peace and quiet, this is your place!
We loved meeting the animals and getting to know the workings of the farm.
A+ time!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is gem. It’s quiet but hosts are willing to share their farm and animals. We would certainly recommend to other travelers.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts!
Our kids loved to stay there. Jennifer was so good with communicating kids, she has some fans now.
The house has two bedrooms however they are very small. So if you are looking for a place to stay where you work in a separate room, it might not work for you. On the other hand, working outside was so nice; also their good internet connection allows you to work remotely without any problem.
Additionally, you will see so many beautiful animals and learn about them.
Thanks for everything Jennifer & Forest!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Heavenly Acres Farm was great. The cottage was the perfect size for our family of three. It was comfortable and clean. I had wonderful conversations with Jennifer and asked her a ton of questions. My husband and son enjoyed exploring the farm. We all enjoyed helping with the daily chores and interacting with the animals. My family is extremely appreciative and grateful for Jennifer and Forrest opening their farm others.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing farm experience for our city kids (parents loved it too!) They absolutely fell in love with the baby goats and have not stopped talking about ""Banner"" all day! We loved getting to be so hands on, and Jennifer and Forrest made us all feel right at home!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First impression wasn't so great, but as we spend more time there, we fell in love. Forrest and Jennifer are truly two of the nicest people ever, and the animals are super sweet and fascinating. We loved the overall feel of the place, and look forward to more visits there in the future. We only live 30 minutes away and love the welcoming atmosphere that makes it feel like we can visit again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a fantastic time on the farm! I have a 9 year-old daughter and a 6 year-old son and we all adored helping out on the farm. Jennifer and Forrest were extremely helpful and patient with us. We participated in morning and afternoon chores everyday! My kids enjoyed feeding the cats, pigs, donkeys, miniature horses, goats, sheep, and alpacas. They loved letting the chickens and ducks out of their houses and were so excited to collect the eggs! We all loved bottle feeding the baby sheep, milking a goat, and trying goat milk! The barn cats were very entertaining and all had their own unique personalities which we loved. We were all surprised how much we liked the cats...because we are dog people! In the evenings, we enjoyed walking the perimeter of the property and taking in all of the beautiful sights and sounds of the farm. One night, Forrest and Jennifer took us on a hay ride! I'm not sure if they do this a lot for guests, but the timing worked out for us. We had so much fun! The cottage was lovely. There was plenty of space for everyone to sleep, and everything was very clean. I was nervous about going in the heat of July, but there was some central air conditioning that kept the cabin cool, plus a portable air conditioner that really cooled the place off. It was only in the 80s when we were there, so sometimes we didn't even need the additional air unit. We cooked one dinner in a fire pit, and two other dinners on a grill inside kind of like a panini press. The microwave was very helpful as well. Jennifer and Forrest gave us chicken and duck eggs which we devoured for breakfast! During the days, we found plenty of adventures in the towns nearby. We hiked at Turkey Run State Park (Trail 3 was awesome!), went to the Sea Shore Water Park, and took a canoe float through Sugar Creek Canoe Company. This was a fantastic outdoors vacation that we strongly recommend for families that want to get outside and enjoy nature. Bring boots! My kids and I wore rain boots during chores which were perfect...easy to wash off! My whole family wants to return to Heavenly Acres!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful farm experience for our family. Kids loved every minute of the farm chores. My father grew up on a farm so said he’d done everything before... except spinning alpaca fiber - so even he learned something on this visit. Jennifer and Forrest were very generous with their time and super patient with my family. Overall a great stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great area. Very clean. Centrally located to explore towns within a 10 - 30 minute drive. Would stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jennifer & Forest are wonderful hosts! Our family had the best experience on their farm! So many animals to learn about and we were able to participate in the farm chores which our children absolutely loved! They are easy to communicate with and are very responsive. We highly recommend a stay at their farm. We plan to be back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an experience! The cottage was perfect, had everything we needed. Jennifer and Forrest were very welcoming, extremely hardworking and they absolutely know what they are doing with the farm and the animals. The farm experience was for me very calming, for my kids it was absolute heaven. They would play with the animals from morning till sunset. Very safe. Watching my 4 yr old there reminded me of Fern from Charlotte's web. It was my 7yr old's birthday and he said he had the absolute best time of his life(the farm visit was his request). The kids(and us) milked goats and sheep, walked the alpacas, played with cats and chickens all day long. The farm is a result of the Jennifer and Forrest's hard work. We will keep going back"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The name doesn't lie, it's a small piece of heaven. If you're looking for a great farm experience/stay, this is definitely it! Forrest and Jennifer are fantastic hosts, ensuring that their guests have the best stay possible. The guest suite is very comfortable with a lot of thoughtful touches throughout. We had ample opportunities to help out with anything there was to do on the farm or to do nothing at all. The animals are amazing and Forrest and Jennifer make sure their guests are safe while enjoying them. This is a place my family will continue to go back to."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It is great for someone is looking for a peaceful vacation this is IT.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time on the farm! Our toddler loved watching the Alpacas, Goats, Chickens, Ducks, Pigs, and Cats. We forgot to pack the rainboots but just accepted that our feet would be muddy and all was well. The cottage was the perfect size for a small family or a few friends. Forrest and Jennifer were very kind and accommodating!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time at Heavenly Acres Farm. The farm activities were a perfect introduction to animals and farm life for our toddler, and Forrest & Jennifer were kind and generous. We plan to return again and would recommend it to others."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a repeat visit for us--we LOVE coming to Jennifer and Forrest's farm. Jennifer and Forrest welcomed us in person and updated us on all the farm news since our last visit:) They have breakfast items--including fresh chicken and duck eggs for guests and generously share their time and talent--we've learned so much from them. We again joined them for a Farm Experience/Tour that allows up close interactions with the animals and help with feeding( and a lot of learning)--a really great experience for us, and well worth the fee, and then some! Can't wait to come back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I had a wonderful time at Heavenly Acres Farm. The hospitality was fabulous and I gained everything I'd hoped to in time and learning about the animals. Both Forrest and Jennifer gave more than expected in attention and availability and were just delightful to talk with. They will feel like friends you have know for a long time... and have ideal personalities for hosting.
The animals here are many and varied. We were so fortunate to have exposure to very young in chicks and lambs and a baby goat as well as all the others. Any learning you desire is provided and getting up close and involved with all of them was just what I wanted. The animals are obviously well loved and cared for.
A bonus plus was seeing the process for processing and spinning alpaca fiber.
The attached two-bed residence was very cozy and farm decorated. We were comfortable there. Bring your farm boots for rainy days and soak in the atmosphere of rural living. It provides a quiet and restful night's sleep!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"A country home away from home! Comfortable accommodations and beautiful views. Our family enjoyed spending time with the animals, and making new friendships."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very pleasant time at this farm. Jennifer and Forrest are very nice and kind people. Jennifer is so attentive and patient with little kids. She is a good teacher. The place was cozy and clean with many snacks provided. They also gave us eggs from their happy, pasture-raised chicken and ducks. Our little girl still keeps telling us that she wants to go to the farm!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest and Jennifer were warm and welcoming. They also checked with us a couple of times to see if we needed anything. When they learned my husband and I were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary, they presented us with a card and some fine chocolates. It was also cool to experience the alpacas, chickens and goats. We could go into their animal yard any time we wished. The cottage was clean and comfortable. There was a little problem with water pressure, but they called someone in to take care of it. Becky and Dick"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had special moments there. And for sure we want to return one day.🥰
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying at Forrest and Jennifer’s farm. Our kids were interested in the “farm experience” and had a blast helping with farm chores and learning about making fiber from the alpacas. Forrest and Jennifer were so kind and patient with the kids and made us feel right at home. The perfect end to spring break! Thank you for sharing your home with us. We hope to see you again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This farm stay experience is not to be missed. My kids (and I) had an amazing time feeding the many animals that make their home at Heavenly Acres. We were given the opportunity to help feed and tend to the well-loved animals both mornings and afternoons, and we had plenty of chances to coax the barn cats and occasionally unwary chickens into receiving petting in between. In addition, we were given the opportunity to learn about different breeds of the animals, and even try our hand at spinning some alpaca fibers into yarn. My kids are still raving about getting to walk two of the little goats on leads—a hands on experience that I particularly appreciated.
The space was cozy and accommodated us easily. I especially appreciated the collection of coloring books and board games that made the visit extra kid friendly. I actually got my kids off their electronics for the entire duration of our visit. We had access to a creek side field where we picnicked as a family. The hosts also kindly left us fresh eggs in the fridge at check in and a list of local restaurants for dinners and groceries.
For your trip, you’ll want to know that the primary means of cooking here is via microwave. The location doesn’t have a stove or oven, but it wasn’t difficult at all to feed the three of us during our stay. The bath is a walk-in tub, but it was easy for us to use and the hosts kindly offered to assist with answering questions at any time, so just ask them if you have questions.
In short, I am very grateful for the experience we had at this farm stay. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience farm life or learn about animal husbandry, or simply get away from it all."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"we visited the farm with our 2, 4, and 6yr old. they had a blast and keep asking when we can go back! Forrest and Jennifer were great hosts, and their hospitality was over the top! It was a screen time break the kids needed."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was exactly what we were looking for to take our ""chicken farmer to be"" on a farm experience! Forrest was very patient with our autistic son while he helped with the chicken and duck chores. The cottage was comfortable and easily accessible. The fresh duck and chicken eggs for breakfast were wonderful! We plan on visiting again next spring. This was our first Air bnb stay and we were not disappointed!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Forrest and Jennifer welcomed us upon arrival to their modern, comfortable cottage(formerly in- law apartment). They are so lovely to stay with! Jennifer and Forrest offer a farm experience that we loved--being able to have close up contact with all of the animals, learn about their care, and about the Alpaca fiber process. The cottage is comfortable with a new bathroom and kitchen area(microwave and griddle for cooking, fridge, sink, dishes, coffee maker). We stayed on property enjoying reading, taking walks, enjoying the animals(alpaca, chickens, ducks, donkeys, miniature horses, sheep, goats and cats), and lovely conversations with Forrest and Jennifer. Bring your boots if you want to venture into the barn yard. We already booked a return visit!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay with children. Excellent hospitality.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the BEST getaways I have had. A great getaway from the city to see nature and animals of ALL kind. Jennifer and Forrest are both so welcoming and sweet kind people that we’re always available for questions or if I wanted to see some animals or wanting to know how to sew they would stop and show us.
The best thing about it was the unexpected surprise of seeing a baby goat be born and being able to hold it. I will never forget this!! Absolutely a must to stay in their lovely home!!
Trying miss the farm cats trouble and Freeloader haha"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Heavenly Acres! Even over a chilly weekend, we felt cozy and warm in the cottage. My 5-year-old son especially enjoyed participating in chores around the farm in the mornings and evenings. We were delighted to see alpacas from our window and step outside to be surrounded by friendly cats. Jennifer and Forrest are gracious hosts and answered all of our questions. We are already planning another visit!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is even cuter than the pictures. Forrest & Jennifer helped me and my partner out when we needed a last-minute place to stay. They responded right away and were generous and kind. The cottage has quite a few sweet touches — an electric fireplace, fresh duck eggs & chicken eggs, frozen meals, etc... This was the perfect place for us to stay on our cross-country road trip."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful farm stay with personal tours and hands-on experiences! I held a bunch of the chickens and ducks, fed alpacas (Alf is the 'modern grey' baby and he is so soft), and milked a goat! Jennifer and Forrest were amazing hosts that were kind and truly love hosting at their farm and were welcoming and warm. Jennifer let me try spinning alpaca wool (harder than it looks but she is a patient teacher) and they also let us help with chores and taught us about caring for their many animals. It was a great weekend to relax and slow down (we used it as a chance to unplug from work but the wifi and cell services are good). The 12 barn cats are all so friendly and fluffy, the chickens and ducks are docile and don't mind being held, the goats let you milk them without complaint and follow you around. I had such a great time and would recommend it! Bring your barn clothes and boots and get ready to have a great time!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great little place to get away from the city and unwind.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was a great hostess! made us feel like family! place was clean and comfortable.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely experience staying on the farm. Reading the reviews and description of the farm is really helpful in setting expectations for the stay. It is not a luxury stay, but the hosts are very kind and hospitable. The animals and farm experience is what really shines here. Our toddler loved it! Jennifer and Forrest were so great with her. Bring your muddy clothes. Everything needed a good wash when we got home, shoes included. But it’s a farm! We stayed 2 nights which was good for us. It’s small town Indiana so there isn’t tons to do. We were there to get a bit of fresh air outside of the city and this trip allowed for that. We would return!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great and fun place to visit! Our kids loved helping around the farm & spending time with the friendly animals.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a ""heavenly"" time at this Alpaca farm. The lodgings were better than the pictures, and the hospitality was out of this world. Jennifer was an amazing host and taught our oldest to look after the animals, gather eggs, clean up and feed everyone. It was an amazing experience for her and Jennifer really took the time to transfer her love for the land and animals to my daughter. She can't stop talking about her weekend at the farm and is already begging to go back!
No oven or dishwasher so if you want to cook be prepared to use the griddle and microwave and wash dishes by hand. It's a half hour drive from Indy, pretty easy to find and there's plenty to do nearby. Check out Stookey's in Thorntown for some amazing fried catfish!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, especially the option to be shown around the farm. The animals are all very sweet and docile and their little lips ticked my hands when I hand-fed them. There's a few little restaurants around and a chocolate shop, but the main attraction is the farm itself."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time interacting with the animals, feeding and petting them and learning about caring for them. Jennifer was very selfless with her time and made sure my daughter and I were always comfortable.
The unit we stayed it was super cute and had all we needed to be content. We enjoyed the fire place and daybed.
We also received fresh eggs from the farm, which was a nice touch.
I'd say the beds are very firm so plan accordingly. There's also a griddle and not a stove, which is my preference.
Overall, those inconveniences were minor in comparison to the wonderful opportunity we had to learn about life on a farm. It was truly a memorable stay.
Thanks so much Jennifer and Forrest."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was terrific. Jennifer and Forrest went above and beyond to make our stay and experience truly amazing! They were infinitely patient with our 5 year old daughter. It was the most perfect getaway and learning experience we could have asked for. We can't wait to return!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just returned from staying here, and I highly recommend it. We stayed 3 nights Sun-Wed, with 2 parents and a 3.5 year old boy.
Everything was easy! Communication is quick and easy. It was easy to find the place. It was easy to see any of the animals.
We had our own ""guest cottage"" that is on the back of the farmer's house. We had our own entrance. Almost everything we did or saw was outside (we did go inside the barn). The ""guest cottage"" is adorable, much cuter than photos. Everything was comfortable.
We stayed 3 nights, and we brought food that was easy to assemble and heat in the microwave.
The sleeping areas don't have doors, so if you have any loud sleepers everyone will hear them.
We did the farm experience: we fed Alpacas and chickens, we gave donkeys and miniature horses treats, our 3 year old collected chicken and duck eggs. We played with a baby goat. We pet so many animals.
Jennifer and Forest are so kind, friendly, and helpful. They are truly wonderful hosts!
Wifi and cell phone coverage is not great. Don't plan on attending meetings while you're here.
Nice bonus: It's 10 degrees warmer here than Chicago and Northwest Indiana!
Some tips for other City people (we learned these things the hard way):
Bring rain boots or something similar for each person
Bring 2 pairs of socks per person per day
Don't wear puffy jackets (turns out their material easily snags on fences)"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forrest & Jennifer's place was a great experience because of their warm hospitality, the animals, and the clean, charming accommodation."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer and Forest went above and beyond our expectations. They helped celebrate our kids' birthday - 8 and 11-year-old. We just wanted a weekend away with little to know electronics. (They have strong internet if anyone does need to work or use it for Zoom meetings.) The kids learned all about the animals. We were lucky to have a baby alpaca born while we were there. We went on a hayride, feed the animals, milked a goat, learned all about the animals they have rescued, had bonfires, grilled, and enjoyed walking the property. The accommodations are very clean and modern with a country farm feel."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Forrest and Jennifer was extremely giving if their time. They spent so much time teaching my 7 year old the ways of their animals. Even with his short attention span, they were extremely flexible. I feel they went above and beyond. Highly recommend staying here, especially if you have kids. We got to do so many extras and never felt we were inconveniencing anyone. The place was clean, got extras in our room we were not expecting and had free range of the farm. My son LOVED it, barely touched his iPad which is amazing in itself. Thank you both for making us feel welcome and at home."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Forrest and Jennifer were the perfect host and hostess! We truely enjoyed our stay and were made to feel as if we part of the family. Very peaceful and relaxing!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Forrest & Jennifer's farm because we wanted to find place no so crowded during pandemic time, and my 11 year old likes animals too. We found out it's a great place to spend weekend with family, especially if your kids like animal. Forrest & Jennifer have many different time of animals, chicken, ducks, goats, sheep, pigs, donkey, alpacas etc. Forrest & Jennifer are very friendly and very patient to introduce animals to my daughter. Jennifer also demonstrated how to spin wool to yarn and we learnt to make wool ball or simple toys. we really had a great time there."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is super clean and comfortable! It is like a studio++, with 2 small spaces for each bed, and is a shared entrance patio with the hosts. Also, there is no shower. Rather there is a walk in, sit-in, high tub with jets and stuff. Overall, it is very nice and the hosts are super accommodating!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at the farm! Jennifer and Forest were incredibly hospitable and our kids loved doing daily farm chores. It was a beautiful and comfortable space and we all slept amazingly well during our stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Forrest and Jennifer are great host. The cottage was clean, well organized and a great get away from the noisy city. Initially just wanted to get our kids outdoors and having fun with the farm animals, but farm experience was so much more than what we expected. Forrest and Jennifer did an amazing job engaging with us and getting the kids involved with the farm. They are very passionate about hands on learning and patient with out children. Our kids loved the opportunity to do chores at the farm and can’t wait to go back. Jennifer and Forest are dedicated host, flexible came up with wonderful alternatives for the kids. They surprised the children with fireworks and s’mores.
Thanks again,
Medina Family"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forest and Jennifer were fantastic hosts! While we were not staying for the ""farm experience"" we loved hearing all about the animals. For those who want this experience or for families with kids, this would be AMAZING! Forest and Jennifer are knowledgable, warm, and friendly.
The space was super clean. We appreciated that. The small touches (like a dozen farm-fresh eggs in the fridge) were ""above and beyond.""
Forest and Jennifer were responsive, quick to communicate, and sought to ensure our stay was great. We would recommend this space to anyone!
It is important to note the one small ""inconvenience"" and I hesitate to even call it that. However, the bathroom tub/shower set up is a walk-in tub with a shower wand. Not bad, and maybe perfect for some, but not ideal for everyone. We would stay here again even with this, but it is important to note."
,,,Short easy drive to Ironman MX. Comfy beds. Good value
,,,The accommodations were nice but the apartment smelled heavily of cigarettes as if someone had just finished smoking in there for several days. We were very uncomfortable due to this. Our friends stayed down the hall and didn’t have this issue. There were also dirty handprints above the bed. Other than that we were happy with our stay. It was probably better than anything else in the area and convenient to the wedding location we went to.
