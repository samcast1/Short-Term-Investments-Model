2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed during our eclipse trip. The hosts were very friendly and helpful recommending places we could watch from and eat. All good.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"5/5 stars all the way around. I had gotten a last minute air bnb for my 2 year old and I. Shantell and her parents were extremely friendly, welcoming and had great hospitality. Shantell’s (host) mom and dad (cohosts) stay in the upper part of the house that has a separate entrance. Upon arrival my tires were really low. Kevin had noticed and filled them up to make sure my daughter and I were safe for departure. Jaki had made us an amazing breakfast in the morning making us feel even more welcomed. Although a short stay; I wish we could’ve stayed longer! Definitely would stay here again and recommend to friends coming to visit!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very cozy loved the house didn’t want to leave
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have a very comfortable place and everything Serca is left.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, have everything you need."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying in Hannah’s house. It was perfect for us. Beds were so comfortable, loved the lay out of the house and decorations were adorable. Hannah was great to work with. We hope to be able to stay here the next time we’re in town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had three coworkers split the house, plenty of space and privacy."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and Hannah was a great host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay and friendly host for our work travels in the area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice place. Full basement and updated upstairs. There are 4 queen beds but she also provides two air mattresses in the closet that you can set up anywhere. Hannah provided excellent service and provided extra towels and sheets. The beds are extremely comfortable and spacious. The entire place was well cleaned. The only thing I would warn you of is the driveway which has a very large dip so beware if you have lower cars. I have a Nissan Sentra and it did scrape a couple times. But overall this place is amazing and well worth the price and time.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Hannah had excellent communication with us. Highly recommend staying at her home. Convenient to a lot of restaurants and shops.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,#1 thing I noticed is the beds were really comfortable. I usually have a terrible time sleeping in any bed other than mine. I slept so well during my stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little house on the outside but lots of room inside. We felt right at home.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Hannah's place was homey and welcoming. There were only 3 of us staying, but this place could easily sleep a much later group. Probably better for a big active group. We stayed in most of the time as my husband was recovering from surgery. Therefore the only negative for us was that the kitchen and dining area was minimally supplied. If your group is active and out and about most of the time, this shouldn't be much of a problem. However, we ate in and tried to cook a Christmas dinner there which was a bit of a challenge. We were warm and comfortable and the beds are great. It's just that this place is a better match for a larger group that eat breakfast and lunch in and goes out for dinner. Loved the old hardwood floors."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay with our dogs for a few nights. Convenient to a lot of restaurants. Clean and hospitable inside.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home is lovely and spacious
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying in one of Hannah’s places, beds are like cloud and it’s exactly what we needed"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was exactly what we needed when we visited family in the area for Thanksgiving. We wanted a clean, convenient, and dog-friendly place. The home was exactly as described and was very clean. Thanks Hannah for a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to Youngstown to visit family. It was very convenient for our visits. Spacious, so our family could spread out and have their own space. The entire house was decorated beautifully and very clean. It had everything we needed - including a corkscrew and wine glass to unwind at the end of the day! We felt safe and right at home. Would definitely go back again!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Hannah was a great host!!
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,No comment
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice quiet place for me and my family, hide very clean host quickly responsive 10 out of 10"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house had a clean fresh smell about. Not a chemical smell, just fresh,"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's place is exactly as it is described and exactly what the photos show. Hannah's communication was amazing and almost always responded in less than an hour. For the most part it was a great stay. However, there were 2 big things (big for me, might not bother others) that made me rate it 3 stars. Privacy is important to me and my family. We traveled with young children and all the curtains in the living room and kitchen are see through and there was no window covering over the window above the kitchen sink. Especially at night with lights on. Anyone could easily see straight into the house. The other thing that really bothered us was that we couldn't turn off the porch light. This made bugs a huge problem as the porch light and the living room light was right next to the front door. therefore Everytime we opened the front door mosquitos and other bugs came into the house."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was very responsive and helpful. The home was clean and the location was convenient to restaurants, shopping and beautiful Mill Creek Park. The beds were extremely comfortable as everyone else says! The only downside was the lack of seating for our group of 8 but we managed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah was an exceptional host with great communication, recommendations and a phenomenal response time. The home was perfect for our business trip. I would recommend this Airbnb and would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was lovely, comfortable, clean, and very conveniently located. I would stay again if I could!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cozy home in a neighbourhood very accessible to all of the shops and restaurants in Boardman. Really good Wifi throughout the house. There are four double beds, but keep in mind that there’s just really seating for a maximum of four adults in the living room, and there’s only a small table for two in the kitchen. Lovely towels and hot shower. Huge front and back yard and plenty of parking in the driveway for several cars. Thanks, Hannah & Gator, for a great visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was just as pictured. It was clean. The beds were SUPER comfy, and there was plenty of space for my family of five (including a teenager & two tweens). We will definitely stay here again the next time we’re in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was the second time we have stayed here. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Hannah’s place was great. We were there for a family reunion. The home was spotless and everything in working condition with some food staples available. We did have a problem with the upstairs too hot even with the air on and a lack of towels for 6 guests. Upon contacting the host early in the morning, Hannah was there within 2 hours or so with extra towels since other guest must have “ borrowed” them, and with 2 exhaust fans for the upstairs windows as well as a circulating fan to help the air condition cool off the upstairs which made it comfortable to sleep upstairs. She was very friendly and set up the fans and left blow up beds if we still had an issue. She was in and out within 10 minutes or less as not to encroach upon our visit. The beds were extra comfortable and we all slept well. We were feeling just like home, then it was time to leave. We would stay there again if in Youngstown."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Convenient, safe, and spacious for our short family stay. A few small issues that did not bother us. Overall, had a pleasant and affordable stay. If we are ever in the area again, would return back again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very comfortable and the accommodations were perfect for our three-day stay in town for training.
Clean, quiet and comfortable. Lots of room and comfortable beds. I recommend Hannah’s home for any length stay I. The area."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house did what we needed it to for the convention i had to work at but my wife had to clean the bathroom the minute we got there the beds had hair on them like the sheets didnt get washed as well as stains and the kitchen had a bad odor and alot of half empty products im assuming from previous guests also alot of dead bugs in the house
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was just as described. Cute little cozy house. Very quiet neighborhood and not far from shopping and dining.
I would definitely stay there again but with less people. 6 adults and one bathroom got a little uncomfortable at times."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,comfy beds.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,This house was very clean and easily accessible to many surrounding cities visited in Ohio. It’s in a nice neighborhood near beautiful Mill Creek Park walks and hikes. We’d come again as it was as advertised and then some.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The beds are insanely comfortable and felt right at home! Awesome place
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Very quite area but close to all the amenities that you need. Our stay for 2 1/2 weeks worked out great and if going back would definitely check to see if this place is available.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great wonderful host! Will stay again! Thanks
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was just as advertised if not better. We felt safe and the area was peaceful. The bathrooms were spotless. The kitchen had everything you would need to prepare meals and snacks. The beds were unbelievably comfortable. The tv had Hulu, Amazon Prime and HBO which was lovely for the kids. I'm thankful that this cozy spot in Boardman was available and it fit our needs perfectly. Hannah was so responsive and easy to work with which is appreciated when you are from out of town. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable and great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely stay at Kelly’s place again. It was extremely clean & styled nicely. My stay in Youngstown was due to a family member’s extreme illness and it was so wonderful to have a place of respite to stay that was nice, peaceful and calming amidst all the tension and chaos of dealing with Medicare and the medical system. Kelly was very friendly and helpful. She was an excellent host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A nice clean place to rest and relax. I would stop again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We can’t recommend enough!!! Kelly's home was extremely clean, with super comfy beds, excellent amenities & so well appointed!!! We felt right at home!!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,In town visiting family. Nice little house for our family of 3!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice area, quiet. The fenced in yard was a plus having my dogs with me. There is a huge ceiling bubble in the kitchen ceiling which grew concern thinking it would burst with water. Very tidy place, but not alot of privacy because the neighbors can see right into the home with lack of curtains. Some food left on couch from previous guests. I'd stay again just because the area is quiet and the fenced in yard but this place needs alot of improvements."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Comfortable place.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay for my groups business travels!

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The only issues was the 1.5 baths and it only had 1 unless it was behind one of the locked doors in the basement. Otherwise great place! They are very responsive and helpful!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We made a great choice by booking Kelly’s home! The inside was clean, modern, and charming! We had everything we needed and more! The decor was modern but cozy! The kitchen was very accommodating for us to be able to cook vs going out.
The beds are so comfortable and with television in each room it was perfect for relaxing!
I was able to work remotely since there was good wifi and a workstation!
We will be booking this home again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelly and her family were very kind and always responsive when I messaged her with whatever it was. They have a binder upon walk in with instructions, WiFi, literally everything you’ll need for the stay is in that binder. The house smelled amazing , was very clean, and super cute inside. I will say if you shower put about two towels down as thier isn’t a shower door so to say so water gets out easily with the kiddos. Other than that our stay was literally perfect! Also definitely check out Millcreek Park! The “Cinderella Bridge” is beautiful!!!! We would definitely stay here again, thank you Kelly!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this quaint little house. Very clean and well decorated. The kids were excited that there were games and puzzles. The tvs in every room were an extra bonus! It felt like home.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kelly is a great host! I absolutely loved staying at the home. The space is very clean and has everything you need during your stay. My family and I felt very comfortable, it's private and its way better than staying in a hotel. I would definitely stay again and will recommend this space to anyone coming to the youngstown area!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love Love Love
This was an awesome find for our family and doggie. It’s within 5 min of groceries, gas, pizza, our favorite church Sovereign Grace Chapel, and a new coffee shop. There are new appliances, a washer and dryer, Roku TVs in every room, a cozy electric fire place, fenced in back yard, and THE BEST MATTRESSES in every room….we slept like kings lol.
We will def be saving this location for our future trips to Youngstown.
Kelly was also such a wonderful host. We had to come to Ohio for a family emergency and ended up to stay longer for an unexpected funeral. Kelly was very responsive and kind and really just helped us feel like she was family. Thank you so much."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kelly and her family’s place! Kelly was very responsive and was extremely flexible with us about our trip. We appreciate it immensely because it allowed us to see our family when we couldn’t for Christmas. We brought our two dog travel buddies, who also loved the place, and probably our favorite part was the beautiful and large fenced back yard. The fence was fine for our big dogs but may not work for a little dog/ escape artists. The place was clean and cute and we felt right at home. We really appreciated the coffee and snacks. Would stay again :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My coworkers and I stayed here, and needless to say, we cant wait to book it again! The house was absolutely stunning, gorgeous, and exactly as described! The photos dont do justice to how open the house felt. Great Feng Shui! The house felt very inviting, and the amenities were excellent!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kelly was a great host and the home was super clean and comfortable. Nice touches like a fully stocked coffee station and washer and dryer in the house. Would definitely recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was wonderful! We really enjoyed our stay! Definitely need a better system with the open shower concept.. was hard to keep the water off the floor. That was the ONLY thing we had to work around! This place is beautiful and it was a great way to end our week long vacation to wrap up the Christmas/New Year holiday! Thank you Kelly & Family for being such gracious hosts! 10/10 WILL recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Pink Door while in town visiting family. It was the perfect place for my husband and me, our three kids (ages 13, 15, and 17) and our dog. The beds were comfy and a nice surprise was that the third bedroom/office had a bed instead of a pull-out sofa so our son was excited about that. The decor was so cute, especially in the living room and kitchen. Everything we needed was provided and Kelly was super communicative throughout the entire booking process. An added bonus is that it’s less than a mile from our fave pizza place - Belleria! Would definitely recommend The Pink Door!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect stay for my family and I for the holidays. Host was nice and responsive unit was well stoxked , cozy and spotless!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly is a great host, and I would recommend her and the place to anyone. The place is clean. Lots of extras (snacks, water, spices for cooking, etc.) Kelly keeps the lines of communication open and always promptly responds to anything I ask her in a very timely manner.
I would totally recommend her place, and the environment surrounding this place is quiet and peaceful.
Thank you again, Kelly. We really enjoyed our second stay at the Pink Door.
I hope to deal with you again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two day stay for a girls weekend. Kelly was super responsive. House itself was very clean. Lots of extras such as coffee, snacks. I highly recommend and would stay again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was agreat place to stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kelly’s place was the perfect location for a holiday visit with family. It was clean and well stocked. She goes above and beyond with including some snacks, coffee pods and basic items you won’t need to buy if a short stay. The beds and sheets were super comfortable. The home was decorated very tastefully. She even has some games and books. Also we really loved the smart tv that we could just log into our apps and it would log us out at check out. Usually we have to use our fire stick. Kelly also was super quick responding to any questions we had. She even allowed us to check out a little late when my husband had a work meeting that morning. We would definitely stay here again when visiting family."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay again! We actually extended our stay while we were there. What a cute place! We absolutely loved it. The accommodations were so thoughtful. It was a safe residential area. The backyard was huge. It just felt like home. Definitely worth the price.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly’s place is exactly as described and central to all of our needs while visiting/caring for elderly parents in the area. Kelly and her husband were available within minutes for any and all of our needs and/concerns.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our employee's love staying here! Kelly is an amazing host with a incredible home.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was exactly what we needed for this trip! We came to see family over the holidays and the house was a peaceful getaway amid lots of visiting! Our kids had plenty of space to play and unwind - they loved the games, books, and snacks provided. They also enjoyed playing in the back yard (when it wasn't raining)! My favorite part was the heated floors! The house was a little harder to find (gps told us to turn earlier than we were supposed to), but the lights were on and everything was ready for us! We are thankful that we had the opportunity to stay at this house!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always have a wonderful and relaxing stay at one of Kelly’s homes. The home was clean, pristine, and comfortable. The beds are super comfy and my mother-in-law said she hadn’t slept that well in years. The home is in a great location and the neighborhood was quiet. Another great stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This a great stay for business travels. Perfect location and fully stocked!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Pink Door was just as described. Easy to find, in a quiet neighborhood but close to shopping and restaurants. Kelly was very responsive and the price was unbeatable! Updated and pristine condition with lots of little touches to make it feel like home. Snacks and water were available in the kitchen as well as laundry facilities. TVs in each room, and a high chair and playpen made it great for our granddaughter. I highly recommend staying at The Pink Door and I will return."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and doesnt over charge. Most places expect you to strip the beds and wash all laundry. She does not. Just clean up after yourself. Very quick to respond. Very nice. I just wish i could handle firm beds. If i could i would use her place every time we had an Antique show up that way.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very nice and we enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house had everything we needed. We will definitely stay again when we are back in town!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The perfect Airbnb! Really cute set up and decor and very clean!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was an excellent place to stay. Kelly gave us all the information and directions needed to make our stay great.
Everything was spot as in the listing.
When I did speak with Kelly, which was very short, she was very friendly and caring.
I would definitely use this place again next time I go back to Ohio.
Thank you Kelly for a great stay!!!! We totally appreciate it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice location and clean house.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in this newly renovated cozy house. It was just the configuration we needed for us, our daughter, son-in-law and their babies. Everything was clean and new, and the kitchen was stocked with all we needed to cook a few family meals together.
We were there for a wedding at the nearby Maronite Center and it was super convenient. I have already recommended to our friends that they use this place when they need more housing for visitors.
Kelly was flexible about our early check-in, too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place to stay!!! 5 stars for me!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pink Door at Kirkhaven Estates was a wonderful place to stay for our weekend getaway. It was easy to find, quiet and peaceful, cozy, and EXTREMELY clean!! We were out and about quite frequently, but the house felt like home while we were there. While it was not in walking distance for us, it was just a short drive to get where we were going - a great place to stay for an event at the Covelli Centre. Kelly was super friendly and helpful, and responded quickly. I would stay here time and time again when visiting Ohio!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked at the last minute so my expectations were not too high. I was extremely impressed. My parents are elderly and have a difficult time maneuvering around. This home was accessible for them. No steps to climb and a walk in shower. This home was worth the stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Kelly, for letting us stay in your beautiful house. We truly enjoyed everything about it. Would definitely stay in that house again when visiting Ohio."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly did a wonderful job insuring her guests were made comfortable. The home was spotless, all appliances and fixtures and furnishings are new including the floors and carpets. The beds are very comfortable. There is a very nice patio off the kitchenette to enjoy the large backyard. Roku TV in bedrooms and living room was great! If you are looking for a place in Austintown or Youngstown this is definitely the one to rent!"

Kelly, I loved your home. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were visiting Ohio for a wedding and were bringing our puppy with us so we wanted to stay somewhere like home. This place was perfect!

It’s also close to many places which was so nice! We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa was an exceptional host. She put her all into making our stay amazing. It was spotless, smelled beautiful, and actually the floors shined. it was perfect. Came for an event and will gladly come back. Everything you could need she thought of. Thank you, from New York"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay. The house was spotlessly clean. It was in a great location and worked well for our needs. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great, will plan to stay again if needed. Only very minor issues with the house, no bath soap or body wash. Each bath had a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. Finally found a bar of soap in a box in one of the drawers but if you want body wash bring your own. Also we didn't have any need for additional toilet paper there was enough there, but they don't provide additional so might need to get some for yourself depending on length of stay. Finally, only other very minor issue was lack of working light bulbs, it seemed that just about every light fixture was missing 1 or more working bulbs. In master bath half of the bulbs above sink were out. House was very clean, plenty of room for our needs, kitchen had everything needed although the coffee pot provided worked but needs some attention."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s nice place. Very homie. It’s hard to locate when you’re not from the neighborhood.. the traffic isn’t really bad getting in and out the parking. But I enjoyed my stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whenever my husband and I visit our family, we always stay in Theresa's place. It feels like our second home for us."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything awesome as usual. This was our 5th or 6th stay here. Never an issue and the place is spotless. Location is great.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy place, large kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, master bathroom, plenty of closet space. Extremely clean. Plenty of extra linens, comfortable beds. The digital keypad made easy entry for both of us families arriving at slightly different times. Easy access to major highways. Owners were very reachable and friendly for checkin and a simple question we had. Neighborhood felt safe.
Location is a bit noisier than a neighborhood, as it is on a 4 lane 35mph road. Wifi is DSL and isn't extremely fast, but was adequate for normal surfing, not sure if remotely working would be smooth or streaming multiple HD video streams, but that's not why we were there. It's probably all that is available in the area.
Overall, this is a great place to stay in Youngstown and we would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family has stayed at Theresa's home for the last 3 visits home. Our family of 4 which includes 2 adult children love the fact that the home has space for us to spend time together and privacy when needed.

2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great area great home. Close to just about anything you need. Very clean
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Theresa easily accommodated our last-minute booking (we were in town for a family emergency) and was very patient as we communicated with her about potentially adding other family members to our reservation. We weren't able to meet her during our stay, but she checked in on us and we were able to check-in easily.
The space is immaculate and wide-open. It was well situated for our needs, and we loved that we were so close to Mill Creek Park. All of the basics were covered!
Our only negative feedback is that we did not find the beds or pillows to be comfortable. I know this is frequently a matter of preference, but looking back at the listing photos I can actually see some sagging that I didn't notice before I booked. To be fair, we did not make the time to contact Theresa during our stay, so it is possible that they may have tried to correct the problem if we had--we simply didn't have the time or emotional bandwidth to handle that among our family obligations.
Otherwise, we wholeheartedly endorse staying at Theresa's place! Thanks again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is exactly as described, however the description does not do enough. The small touches that are included such as dog treats and while I did not have a dog the thoughtfulness is worth mentioning. This thoughtfulness continued as extras in the bathroom linen closet, laundry room, the kids play room and coffee for us early birds. The mattresses were very comfortable and my husband slept better than at home. Thank you Nicole for all you do and thoughtfulness. We will certainly stay again if in area."

We couldn’t be happier with our choice. The house was great. An old colonial with good bones. There was a dedicated playroom for the kids the play, which was much appreciated. The owners were super nice, responsive, and always quick to help! Our stay made a difficult time much easier!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay if you are in the Youngstown area. Less than 10 min from YSU if you’re visiting a student. Plenty of room inside for a family.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole was an amazing host. She was super nice and extremely responsive to the few issues we had while we were there and even before booking. We were coming in town for a particular event and needed to know how far away it was-and she was so helpful . While we stayed there, we did have two issues. The WiFi didn’t work for us and the sink in the bathroom was clogged. Nicole did offer to call somebody but it was the half bath, certainly not worth a weekend fee to fix. 🙃 But she responded quickly and offered a solution to that particular issue. The internet never did stay connected. The 🏡 was older & did match the photos. There are improvements that should be made that would help the value paid. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling down and around the sink and toilet it was dirty. The windows and the screens need replaced in the bedroom areas. Nicole had mentioned this being a new listing (I think) and I am sure these little attention to detail things will work as time goes on. ❤️"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice and responsive. We appreciated her home for the weekend.

Her house was cozy, had historic charm, and a playroom that kept my children having fun. The beds were extremely comfortable and the shower had great pressure.
Great location - close to restaurants and stores, but located in a quiet, historic neighborhood. Checkin was very easy.
Would definitely recommend this stay to anyone and would stay here again. Nicole was very accommodating and super friendly."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I used this house to get ready the morning of my wedding and it was beautiful! It was so cute and spacious. We were able to get some absolutely beautiful pictures before leaving for the church. We had 11 people getting ready with 3 hair and makeup people and a breakfast spread and still had room to hang out and watch TV when it wasn’t your turn. We easily logged into our streaming accounts to watch what we wanted. I also loved waking up there the morning after. The curtains keep the bedroom dark enough to sleep in but the sunlight comes in so beautifully downstairs. I also felt very safe the night I had to stay there alone. Nicole was so sweet and helpful and check in and checkout was so easy and smooth! Couldn’t recommend more!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Nicole was a wonderful host. She was proactive about sending check-in and out instructions and very responsive to any of our messages. The house was perfect for what we were looking for - a quick work weekend getaway. Highly recommend!

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place if you're staying in the Youngstown area. Plenty of off-street parking, clean, close to stores. Nicole was very nice, responded quickly, and accommodated our early check in request."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed for one night on our way through on a road trip, so we weren't there for very long, but it is a charming older house. Everything was as described and Nicole was a pleasure to work with. We would definitely stay here if we're passing through again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Lots of room and very peaceful. The playroom was a welcome amenity! So nice for the kids to have a little space! Perfect for a short or long stay! Either way it has everything you need! Friendly and attentive host. A+ rating in our book!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a lovely stay at Nicole’s place. It’s an older house but don’t let that put you off - well renovated bathroom and kitchen make a big difference. Beds were comfortable, Wi-Fi was good and there are three-pin plugs in the dining room so work was easy. Lovely neighborhood, easy parking on the pad, simple code entry. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Very quick to respond if I had any questions. Zero surprises when I walked in. I knew exactly what I was getting from the pictures.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, easy to find, and in a nice neighborhood. I recommend it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing host and amazing house. Our family had a great time and we really enjoyed ourselves. Super beautiful house tastefully decorated and super clean. AAA plus!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was great! Kids loved the playroom and everything was cozy and clean! Thanks!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless. It is an older home, but the bath and kitchen were updated. We did not have kids travelling with us, but the playroom would be perfect for families with young children."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The house was clean , well stocked, and in a quiet neighborhood. Nichole responded to my text and checked in a few times to make sure everything was good. I would definitely stay here again when I am back in the area visiting family."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole's place was perfect! The little play area was a favorite with the kiddos, we had a great nights stay on the comfy large beds as well! The bathroom was nicely updated with great water pressure in the shower! We loved this house!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay immensely! While the house is older, the kitchen and bathroom is well updated and the kids playroom was a great bonus! The kitchen was also well stocked which was super helpful since we were cooking our own meals."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Nicole’s home. It was clean, comfortable and perfect for our multigenerational family. Would highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place has that old neighborhood charm. we enjoyed the space and the privacy. The beds are on the firm side, and everything worked and was well kept. We would recommend to families looking for space to spread out and enjoy their stay near Youngstown."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole is a true super host! Loved the clean, roomy , lovely environment. We enjoyed our family gatherings and our stay included all amenities needed. Neighborhood-serene and quiet with pretty trees and homes of beautiful architecture. So glad we found Nicole’s Airbnb!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my niece's graduation and this was very convenient to Youngstown State campus, roughly 15 minutes. It's on a quiet tree-lined street with cute older houses. It was a little hard to find when we arrived after dark, so thank goodness for GPS. The house has been updated somewhat, particularly the kitchen. It has plenty of amenities if you want to cook. There's plenty of space in the living area, a good place to hang out with a few family members. There was a kid's play room with some toys, which was nice. The bedrooms were a good size and the bed was comfortable. It's memory foam, which isn't for everyone, but it slept nice. The main bathroom was spruced up and worked well. Of course the shower head is a little low, but it is an old house. It was a little warm while there, so having a newer AC system was a plus. Overall a good visit and a cute little house to stay in versus a cramped hotel room farther away. Nicole is a great host, very communicative."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful quiet place. The home was clean with wonderful bright natural light, quite spacious."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay, close enough to tons of stores, restaurants, and parks but was in a residential neighborhood that was quiet and easy to relax. Nicole’s home was just as described, had all the things you would need. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks for providing your place!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole's been very helpful and kind to us! The home is lovely and would 100% recommend it to anyone.
Hope we can go back soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole was great, home was in good neighborhood, sidewalks walkable."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to host our grand daughter and little ones who live locally!
It was so comfy and kids enjoyed the TV and especially the toy room!!!
I was able to cook her favorite food while there. Large crock pot came In handy!
Very charming historic house with beautiful wood floors.
The bed was divine!
Highly recommend their home! If your staying or passing thru.
Easy communication and check out!!!
Great host!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super responsive host. Great stay. Convenient and close to Covelli Center/downtown, as well as main shopping area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect for a group of us to stay together. Plenty of room to have our personal spaces but also room to lounge and hang out together. Nicole was a wonderful host and messaged back quickly both times I had a quick question. Everything was super clean and the street/neighborhood felt very safe! Would 100% stay there again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house has been updated and yet maintains its original character and style. It was perfect for us. it was nice for us to be able to bring our dogs as well. Nicole was an excellent host and worked with us closely to help us through some extraordinary circumstances.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very comfortable place to stay while visiting family. Really nice appliances and pots & pans in kitchen. She though of everything when it came to supplies and necessities . LOL no toothbrush and of course my son forgot his again 🤣. But obviously would not expect one 😊
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in Youngstown to visit family after a death in the family so being close to family with a place to hang out in between was key. The house was really roomy and as someone who lives in an old house, I can say the bedrooms were unusually large and easily fit the king beds with room to spare. Certainly not necessary for us, but nice in comparison to our small bedrooms back home. If you're a runner, it's about 2 miles from Mill Creek Park, so run from here, or easily drive to the park to start your run. Mill Creek is one of our favorite places to run, and we've run in a lot of places! We did do all our cooking, and were cooking some for family. Plenty of room to cook and a full size slow cooker was great. Because we cooked so much, we did need some cooking tools not there, but for most people doing basic cooking, you are fine. Really a great short term living experience during a difficult time. Loved this older house in a residential neighborhood."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town with our two kids for a hockey tournament & by far it was the best experience this season so far! We will definitely be booking with Nicole again! The house was darling, clean & welcoming! Perfect for a family with younger kiddos, the play room was such an awesome extra you don't find often! Beat staying in a hotel with young kids! You'll love the home & the peaceful experience it brings!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nicole’s place was wonderful! Check in and check it out was easy, the house itself was great and Nicole was super friendly and responded very quickly!! She even gave us a local recommendation for breakfast, “The Mocha House”, which was so good! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole was very accommodating and responsive. The home was clean and comfortable, and in a convenient location. We felt at home, and that was so helpful to us. We are glad we found this place to stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place for toddlers.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nicole was great host! She has a lovely house and was super helpful and responsive whenever I had any questions! This is the perfect house if your traveling with little ones!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place for a Airbnb in Youngstown. Stayed there for the holidays to visit family. Worth a stay if you need a place to stay in the area. Would stay again if I’m in the area
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Large home with wonderful kitchen and bedrooms. Peaceful and safe neighborhood. Nicole was very responsive to messages and very accommodating. Dog friendly as well!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. The house was in a good location and was very spacious and clean ! I would definitely recommend staying here !
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying in Nicole’s nice home. It was centrally located near everything we needed. Home was warm and cozy and the beds slept great. We would definitely come back if in the area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole's place was the perfect spot for my sibling's family and mine for Thanksgiving. The kids' room was clutch! Perfect for the little ones, and the house had enough space for both families to co-exist peacefully. Would recommend and will stay again next time we're visiting Y-town."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect house for our family with small children. Will stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great experience at Nicole’s place! Nicole is very responsive. I grew up nearby and still have family in the area, so we visit at least twice a year. Her house feels safe, is spacious and perfect for a family, well stocked with baby and kid gear and toys. Best Airbnb/hotel experience we’ve had in Youngstown! Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed a quick and comfortable stay at Nicole's place, and really loved the character of this old house and the neighborhood. Enjoyed walking the dog (who was also welcomed and provided treats and water/food bowls) on a beautiful tree-lined street. Everything is as described, but we were surprised at the spaciousness. Usually AirBNB's are smaller than they seem in the pix but this one was bigger! I'd say the place is VERY well suited for long term stays.
Excellent communication from Nicole: prompt and friendly. I'd recommend her place and would definitely stay there again. Thank you Nicole!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were there for just one night and it worked for us. Beds were comfy, so we got a good nights sleep."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nicole’s place is beautiful! It has the charm of an older house while being very clean, well decorated, and has all of the modern amenities! It is on a gorgeous street which made for a lovely morning walk and we were shocked at how close it was to hiking, vineyards, and breweries. Nicole was very communicative and made checking in and out a breeze!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Everyone in our group really enjoyed their stay! The home was located in a safe area and was extremely clean. We will definitely book again 😊
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Nicole's place was great! We weren't there long, but the little touches through the house made our stay with an infant very easy. If you're traveling with kids, you'll love the play room with toys, kid's dishware, and high chair. The house itself is older, but the amenities are up to date."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, nicely decorated, ideal for our visit to Youngstown. Would stay there again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, comfortable home in a cute, quiet neighborhood."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. The neighborhood was sweet. This home was full of charm and unique touches. How many times will you see the milk man’s compartment, coal chute and mail slot with a bell? The furnishings were comfortable and attractive and the playroom was perfect for the grandchildren."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location will get you anywhere in the Youngstown area in about 10-15 minutes. Tree lined street with historic houses, quiet neighborhood, and lots of charm.
I didn't realize how big this property is but a family, or small group, would be able to stay here quite comfortably.
The decor is so cute, the place just feels like a home the second you walk in. I'll stay here in heartbeat again and highly recommend it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had such a great stay in Nicole’s rental. The home was so beautiful, on a historic stretch of homes in Youngstown full of young families. A charming and spacious home, well decorated, with beautiful and comfortable furniture and lots of great natural light. My trip was brief but we will be sure to earmark for future visits when we pass through Youngstown again. Location was excellent - close to everything you could need!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nicole is a great host and we really enjoyed our stay. We arrived early from a 7 hour drive and was allowed early access without an extra charge. The house has plenty of room for the whole family, nicely decorated, well stocked with TP, soap, coffee, etc. and even had dog bowels and treats. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood with plenty of privacy. Our dogs loved the backyard and walking the neighborhood too."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, quiet location, and wonderful play area for children. I also appreciated that the driveway area was well lit during hours of darkness."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nicole is great . House is great and clean ! Beds were comfortable !
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Such a great place in a quiet neighborhood that is close to everything! We got some groceries for our stay (there are 4 grocery stores within a block from each other!). Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Sandusky, Canton, wherever you want to go is an easy drive to this centrally located gem!
This quaint house was very comfortable with six people staying for a week without feeling like we were on top of each other. The laundry in the basement was nice (and we got to teach the younger generation about laundry chutes!)
Overall, a great stay and would definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Went for my brother’s graduation in Youngstown and Erin’s place was perfect for our stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin was very happy and helpful. staying in an old school house was very unique. It wasn't my first time falling asleep in a class room but it was my first time with a bed. If I ever have a reason to return to Youngstown, I won't hesitate to go back to school."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful and comforting space. Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and space!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town on business for a few days and did not want to be trapped in a hotel. Erin's place is spacious and bright with room to work and spread out. The instructions to get in were clear and easy to follow, though it helps that I knew the area a little before arriving. Erin was 110% responsive to any questions I had about amenities or the space. The building is being rehabbed (beautifully I might add) so during the day there were a few work people around. But the building is solid as a rock so it was no disturbance to me. Thanks for a comfy stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s was an amazing open huge space !! The vibe was definitely peaceful clean and vintage+
The record player was a nice touch! The high ceiling and the huge windows had me enjoying a lot of daylight
Im a simple man and this place had it for me
I love is since I walked in"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! It was a last minute reservation due to another reservation that got canceled very last minute and Erin was fantastic. We lucked out because the location was great and very convenient to get into downtown. Highly recommend and would stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was incredible and exactly as described. We all loved the convenience and the great open space with extremely comfortable beds. Loved all the nostalgic touches and would definitely stay again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin's place was much nicer than expected! It is a very large space, with 15-foot high ceilings, flooded with wonderful natural light (from west-facing and north-facing windows); with gorgeous warm-tone old wooden floors; comfortable furniture (nicer than what the photos show); a kitchenette with an induction cook-top, microwave, and coffee maker; a fireplace and modern heating; a shower with a pebble floor; nice towels and linens and very comfortable bed. The space was perfect for yoga, dancing, photography, relaxing. It is in an old school building that is being renovated/re-done; on a road with some traffic noise; in a neighborhood that is old-industrial, just off the highway -- none of which bothered us at all. We found it to be peaceful, relaxing, eclectic. And super clean. Kudos to Erin for transforming an historic old school building into an attractive, unique place to stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool downtown location. Urban feel and good location.
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place has great potential but needs a lot of work. Much of the building was being renovated so looked unkept. The exterior was run down and felt a little unsafe when taking the dog out late at night. It is walking distance to downtown Youngstown,YSU and Mill Creek MetroPark (less than a mile) but nothing super close. The bed was amazing and shower was great. Loved the record player with all the albums."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Huge lovely space and very caring host
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,always a pleasure to stay at Erin's place. Very unique and very cozy. Just an incredible host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,another great experience at Erin's place!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Based on the listing pictures and description I thought this was a fully renovated old school with a bunch of nice apartments in it, but it's really more like a demolition zone with a few finished rooms. The kitchen was a bit rundown and the furniture isn't new and modern like it is in the pics - all the couches and chairs looked like old garage sale buys. The high ceilings were awesome, but the floors are thin so it was hard to sleep through all the noises from the person above me (but it's also not the host's fault that they watching movies UNTIL 4:30 AM with the volume up - I also love Rush Hour 2, just not at 2AM). There's also a lot of traffic noise from the street and the highway, so all in all it was not a great night's sleep, but the studio itself was spacious & warm, the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was nice and looked like it was recently redone. It would have been fine for the night, it was a cool space - just a bit more shabby-chic than I was expecting!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Tons of space and everything you'll need for a nice stay in Youngstown!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin is the best, as always. Love staying at her place. I'll be back for sure!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came into town to visit family for the holiday and Erin’s place was a exactly the quiet restful place we needed to decompress. By far the best part of our visit. The bed is honestly so comfy and the wide space was so relaxing and open. Such great vibes. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute, unique space! Would stay again. It is in a large, old school-- so cool! Thanks, Erin!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Over all a fine stay. Lights and noise from the street might be a bit much for light sleepers. Very clean, spacious. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. Everything was very clean."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place worked great, very clean and large!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for an inexpensive stay near a factory I was visiting for a business trip. I needed something close by the factory that had reliable internet and a kitchen and wanted to avoid a hotel so I could buy groceries and make my meals. Erin's place was exactly that. It was very inexpensive compared to a hotel. The bonus for me was that it was a beautiful light-filled space that was inspiring and had character. Working on the road can suck the life out of you -- especially in a cookie-cutter hotel. Erin's loft was unique and beautiful and the inside was large and had amazing wooden floors and a personality to it. I enjoy shooting photography as one of my favorite hobbies and the interior and surrounding area nearby were so interesting to photograph. Full transparency...this area is not bustling with nightlife or a pristine, new development. It has a little bit of grit to it but in a way that I appreciated. Erin was friendly and I had a smooth stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, responsive host. 10/10 A+++"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stay here!
It’s practical and eclectic, and situated in a fascinating historic and antique building. Wildly spacious, gorgeous natural light, quiet and comfy, homey and peaceful. I stayed for 2 weeks and didn’t want to leave.
Host Erin is warm and welcoming. Quick to respond and loaded with interesting info about the space. Definitely make time for a quick chat.
I’d stay again in a heartbeat."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! Loved the space so much.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Erin’s place was very clean and well maintained. It is a nice spot. Issue is location and level of noise. While others had noted the area was more industrial, I did not see mention of the road and highway noise. Again nothing Erin can control, but for someone like me looking for a night’s sleep after a lot of driving it just wasn’t the proper space."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much Erin! This visit to Youngstown was incredible and magical and none of it would be possible without the incredible hospitality at your place. Truly an incredible airbnb, in the most generous and inspiring town.
Cant wait to come back for a visit in december!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was such a unique and cute place while also being very clean!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely old building within walking distance of downtown. Erin was responsive and friendly. A good place to stay and well worth the money.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Interesting place!! Good location - it is industrial like others describe, but close to restaurants, bars, highway. Shower is great - nice design!! Some FYIs, there is street noise. The building hallways are going through construction/renovations. The photos of the loft don’t match - different furniture and kitchen does not have a stove like the photo shows. There is a micro, toaster oven, and single hot plate. We didn’t need to use the kitchen so wasn’t a big deal for us but would imagine it’d be hard to make a hot meal. Otherwise, for our purposes, met our needs."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fantastic stay! The converted school building is a lovely building, and the apartment is beyond beautiful. With plenty of comfy places to lounge and sleep, the beautiful hardwood floors and sweepingly high ceilings, the apartment feels palatial and is filled with simple pleasures-- beautiful art, a wall of wonderfully curated books, and a delicious selection of LPs with a simple record player.
What's more, you are only a 15 min walk to the wonderful park, filled with trails and beautiful sites, and the main street in Youngstown. Would have been happy to have spent a few more days just living in the room. Excited to go back next year and looking forward to seeing the wonderful work Erin is completing.
ALSO! Erin is rad. Super helpful and friendly. Would love to go back and pick her brain about the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"clean and humble space, had everything we needed"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Huge space! Clean, chill environment. Plenty of parking."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's place was awesome as usual. great, unique place to stay close to everything in the youngstown area. She is very responsive and helpful. I'll be back. Again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin's apartment is actually more amazing than it looks in the photos. it's a huge space with lovely high ceilings and enormous windows that bring in lots of light. Everything was clean, the furniture was fun, the bed was comfy, the shower was great. We loved playing records on her record player. We got delicious takeout from a great Caribbean restaurant that Erin recommended called Dalia's. It's best to call to order - they came just after seven, when the cafe closed and that was perfect timing for us.
Erin was super communicative and helpful - when we accidentally left our dog food and pills behind, she was quick to offer to send them to us. She went above and beyond.
I highly recommend this space."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would stay again! Thanks!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second stay with Erin. I loved it, and we'll stay again if possible."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique yet comfortable place to stay, responsive host. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will return
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very eclectic! If you love old architecture this is the place to be. HUGE living space. Industrial area but never felt unsafe. Walking distance to downtown
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If we ever need to stay in Youngstown this is the only place we would stay!! thank you!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My 2 teenage children enjoyed our stay. I was a little concerned at first about the building and location. Once inside, I really appreciated the space and setup. Nice to be so close to YSU and downtown."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Eclectic open space with huge windows allowing plenty of light. Very comfortable bed with a window air conditioner and four ceiling fans capable of providing plenty of ventilation and temperature control. Unappealing commercial neighborhood that was safe to walk. Some of the furnishings were not in good condition and needed refurbishing or replacement. Bathroom had a nice shower although bathroom had a peeling ceiling and inadequate lighting. Fireplace was nicely done and would be a wonderful addition in the appropriate season. Good accommodation that could be better.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"About what I expected but some of the furniture seemed a little worn. Shabby chic, I think."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really beautiful, unique, and large space!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A wonderful place to stay if you’re visiting Youngstown. A beautiful building. Immaculately kept.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"went for a wedding, didn't see much of the surrounding area but it was so convenient and just what we needed"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"absolutely love this place you could walk to the Youngstown amphitheater the neighborhood looks sketchy,but that is not the case, we felt safe at all times.
oh absolutely stay here again loved loved loved it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our third time staying at Erin’s place! It’s our favorite halfway point when splitting up our long drive from Chi to NY. This building has so much character and history and the space is charming and whimsical. We’ll be back again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Erin is a fantastic host, couldn’t say more. She has great communication skills. I’ve stayed here a couple of times as well as the other space Erin has listed. It has been a great space for my family and accommodating for our 2 small pets. The building is beautiful. It has by far been the best AirBnB experience I’ve had while travel nursing in Ohio. Thank you for your hospitality and kindness!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in town for a wedding and this place was perfect for us. Erin was great and very helpful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Neat and comfy studio apartment in a former school building with lots of character…great value in price and location and very cozy. Erin was a great host and we appreciate her hospitality.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was really spacious and cute! The location is practical, the shower pressure was great. We were greeted upon arrival which was lovely! I cant wait to come back to Youngstown and book with Erin again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Best AirBnB experience I’ve had. Super cool spot. Would want to live there! Just what I needed after a long drive.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a lovely peaceful space. We really enjoyed our stay, the beds are comfortable, the flat open and light filled and Erin is so kind and welcoming."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Erin was very friendly! The location was very close to a highway exit. Parking area is very big. The room has a great space. The kitchen is very convenient. Our stay was restful. We would recommend her place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Erin was very accommodating during my extended stay! I had the pleasure of staying in 3 of her units and they were all great! I would definitely stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Erin's beautiful loft. Youngstown was such an interesting neighborhood and Erin decorated the space really beautifully. I would have loved to live in such a stylish & industrial loft if I were still single :) We were traveling with a dog and we appreciated the space accommodating pets. Would recommend to anyone.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything was great
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Erin is a terrific host, very accommodating and we LOVE her place. Thank you for a wonderful time!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience as always
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We definitely enjoyed our stay! It was a unique spot with lots of natural light, which is always a favorite thing for me personally. The kids really enjoyed it as well and it felt spacious. We especially loved the record player and the kids were so intrigued by it. Erin was so kind and we had very pleasant interactions with her."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin's place was great, a throwback and unique experience. Once you got acclimated to the space and checked in, you felt comfortable. And its proximity to downtown Youngstown and The Westside Bowl venue was perfect."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Erin was great! I would recommend to anyone.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space is unique. The host is an excellent communicator and was kind enough to let me check in early.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Erin was very responsive. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very unique place with relaxing atmosphere. a must stay if you are tired of hotels. Erin is a fantastic host, the place is clean, and it is very affordable. would definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was probably our own fault, but we had a hard time finding the door to get in. Other than that, everything was perfect. Such a great space!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay here with our 4 children. The space is large yet cozy. Everything we needed. We will definitely stay here again when we are in that area.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Erin’s space was amazing. It has a very cool, artsy vibe and close to downtown Youngstown for some cool places to eat and drink. I enjoyed the open space, all the beautiful natural light and fireplace. Definitely a unique place to stay. Loved it. Thanks Erin❤️"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We’ve stayed here twice now and will likely return in the future. The rooms are very large with high ceilings and planned out thoughtfully. Both rooms are chic and minimalist in design and quite cozy. Erin is a great host!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really cool space and a fun experience for the family. Comfy beds and linens. Appreciated the children’s books, teas, nice conditioner and body wash, record player and lps. Some noise from nearby traffic and vans backing up for a nearby business but that’s a reasonable trade-off for staying in a more interesting and beautiful place.."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place is really cool, very high ceilings and heated by gas fireplace heaters. The only thing that was different is the stove/oven was replaced with a toaster oven."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really loved staying with Erin! The loft is in a great location in Youngstown--close to restaurants, hiking trails, and breweries. This place was perfect for our stay during the holidays & we were of course excited how dog friendly they were. The loft is huge & really has a cool vibe with lots of historical books to read and several fireplaces around the rooms that creates a great ambiance. We come to Youngstown often to see family and will absolutely hope to stay here again next time we are in town!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I absolutely love our stay here. Will be back. Erin was such a great host and her place is absolutely beautiful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Very spacious and beautiful. It was nice that there is a separate area our daughter could stay in
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another successful stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Erin is an absolute gem. We loved her property and she is more than accommodating. An absolute must stay!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This flat is a fantastic way to stay while in town. Loved the building and the flat was warm and cozy. Its a favorite for me any time I am in town for sure. The pictures are spot on and you can go to a beautiful park, it's causeway starts across the street."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easily one of the coolest, unique and comfortable lofts I’ve stayed in. We found Erin’s spot while moving across the country with our 3 cats, all of whom loved to explore the huge space.
Beautifully curated, charming, unpretentious, and fascinating building with an interesting history worth looking into and worth appreciating. After reading a bit about it, Erin seems to be doing something really important and admire the effort she’s put into the space and her project at large. I’d much rather give Erin my money to support this place than some average AirBnB slumlord.
No TV is a non-issue, so I don’t particularly understand the gripe with that — in my opinion, the space is much more oriented towards congregating, talking, listening to music, reading, and so on. If you want to watch something, use a laptop or something. Any street noise was negligible — I’ve stayed in residential neighborhoods that were louder.
In all, Erin was great, responsive (got a bit turned around with getting in the building, but Erin clarified in like less than 2 minutes), parking was convenient and safe. Had a great coffee and lunch on our way out. We liked Youngstown. We’d come back. 10/10"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice big space
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really interesting place to stay. You are in an old school building and it really shows, but in a good way. The room is very, very spacious and cute. The area that you are in does not seem to be the best, but that may just be because I've never been there.
We chose this room as a last minute stay for me, my husband, and our dogs for a local concert. It worked perfectly for us, but it was definitely a little pricey for the area we were in.
If we ever attend a concert in the area again, we would probably stay again simply thanks to the communication and accomodations from host Erin. Thank you so much!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place was beautiful! would reccomend someone to stay here in future
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Be prepared to feel cozy in this space! We stayed in early October and enjoyed the warmth from ample heat sources in this big airy loft space. Clean and inviting location for exploring Youngstown. Would stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cool space! It’s beautifully decorated. It’s inexpensive. It’s easy to get to. There’s parking. It’s within walking distance to downtown and a lot of awesome restaurants.
I wish that I had more time to explore Youngstown when I was there. I really enjoyed it there!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming place. We loved it.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Completely happy with my beautiful, soulful suite at Erin’s building. All spacious, retro, cool, artsy and rustic—perfect. Don’t expect television and all of that noise. This place is for your head and your heart. Bring friends and lovers. Books and an acoustic guitar. It’s meant to share. Get to know a deeper level of Youngstown. Your world is cool, Erin. Thanks for sharing it!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A very cool space. Minimal but functional. Three people slept fairly comfortably. The wide open space was pretty cool. You definitely need to get downtown to find anything to do (since this is located in a more industrial-use area). Easy to get in and out of the room. Definitely neat since it is located in an old school. We saw a concert downtown and this was pretty much a 15 minute walk to the venue, which was great."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a beautiful and historic place to stay in Youngstown. I had family staying here for my wedding and they had a great time - really enjoyed the space and location. Erin was very communicative and accommodating!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place!! Perfect for our stop on the way to NY.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect space! so cozy and peaceful. Will definitely be somewhere I stop at if I am in the area!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m a Youngstown native and had a couple of friends in from Cleveland to introduce them to the city. The location of Erin’s place was perfect as it is walking distance to all of the main attractions like the Butler, the Museum of Labor and Industry, etc. It’s also directly across the street from Youngstown’s first protected bike lane that leads to Mill Creek Park, Youngstown’s crown jewel. The space itself was spacious, clean, climate controlled, and had plenty of charm due to it’s adaptive reuse. Would absolutely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the coolest and most unique places I have stayed at. It’s very spacious, well lit, and comfortable. Erin was very helpful and made sure we had everything we need. 10/10 would recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect accommodations for a weekend stay in Youngstown. You won’t be disappointed!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! Beautiful high ceilings and lots of windows. Wanted to move in.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous location and perfect creative space.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay again 😀
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed with our kids (ages 10, 7, and 3) on our way back to Chicago after a road trip out east. A very clean and unique space that was perfect for an overnight in Youngstown."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Erin’s place- both times on our way to another destination, but now we are talking about coming back and making Erin’s place THE destination. The building is truly unique, and the lofts are impeccably designed- every corner, every detail- so beautiful, so calming. Erin is an amazing host- she was readily available, and super accommodating (we had some wishy washy dates due to work and Covid.)
Erin’s place is wonderful. Period.
Either as a stop along the way, or THE place to stop, and stay, and take a breather- you can’t go wrong here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really cool place in one of the weirdest neighborhoods I've visited. At first blush, safety felt like a concern, but after re-reading reviews I felt at ease, and there turned out to be nothing to worry about.
In the end, I found Boxcar Lounge within walking distance (I think downtown is only a bit further), and had a great evening. If you're so inclined, walk over and visit Mike, Peggy, and Kim for a drink and a delicious burger. Super nice folks, with a good collection of bourbon and gin."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful space. Large open area which was just what we needed. Erin was helpful and quick to respond. I will definitely stay here again!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place was great - clean, spacious, comfortable, with plenty of thoughtful touches. Check-in was easy and apartment was well located. Thanks Erin!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is close to downtown and a lovely park (Fellow Riverside Gardens). The apartment had everything we needed. The building was fun to explore and learn about.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, a nice and pretty cool place to stay, but a bit over priced at over $100/night in an empty warehouse district without any special amenities; as well, the furnishings are quite worn and a bit rugged, but clean and tidy. Definitely a unique stay, and would return. This is my hometown, so I get the vibe."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Spacious and bright. Really open and lovely spot.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is a very clean and comfortable space that is very close to downtown restaurants and Mill Creek Park.
The layout is unusual but it worked well for us, and with the high ceilings and big windows the room is very spacious and bright.
I would absolutely stay here on a future visit and will recommend it to my friends in the area."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,No tv threw me off a bit. Other than that it was a very cool place to stay. The parking lot being right there made it very easy to take our stuff to the room.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space, clear and easy instructions for entry, very spacious rooms, perfect location for visiting/attending an event in downtown youngstown. I’ll be back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay here, very unique well furnished place. Downtown was a short, easy walk and Erin was very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again"
2022-06-01,2.0,Group trip,"Host entered room while guests were sleeping a whole day before checkout. Host did not give time for clean up, instructions were unclear on areas we could use. Was not allowed to use the room the second night and so was charged over $400 for one night in the end and had no place to stay for the bands I booked in town. Reflects badly on me as concert promoter. Absolute Karen of a host. Hair cut and all. Nice facility but there are far better hosts."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, large studio. This place was so cozy and comfortable and Erin was really communicative and gave a lot of clear check-in instructions."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved staying in this loft for many reasons, but most of all for its history, charm, artistic touch, and vast space. Erin was kind enough to make sure we had enough beds for our large group. The tall windows, eclectic furnishings, and little touches were the icing on the cake. We had everything we needed. We'd definitely stay again if we were traveling this route."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My 2nd Home 🙏🏽
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Top notch couldnt ask for anything.more
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve booked here twice now, such a great and unique place! A real gem in the Youngstown area!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed my stay @ Erin’s place. Nice open space. Erin did well communicating all the needed details. I appreciate the flexibility in scheduling, I explained what I needed and Erin was happy to help. The sunlight through the tall windows was a bonus, beautiful plants. My dog and I couldn’t have been more comfortable. I’ll definitely stay here next time I’m in Youngstown."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful spot with amazing character & beautiful light!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space in a super cool historic building. This place was a great stopover for us on a long road trip from CHI to NY with little kids. When we first entered fairly late at night, the gas fireplace and heaters were going and the room was lit with a warm glow… it was dreamy! In the morning, the tall windows brought in so much light to fill the tall, main room. Wonderfully curated space and well kept. Thanks Erin!
Please keep in mind that this AirBnb is located in a building that is essentially a community center. The gym was in use both nights we were there… it seems like there’s typically other activity going on in other parts of the building."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my third stay at Erin’s place, and I can’t wait to come back again! It’s a great space and Erin has done such a great job putting the rooms together. Definitely the place to stay in Youngstown!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Erin’s place is a wonderful spot for anyone looking to stay in Youngstown. Truly one of a kind - it offered us plenty of space to spread out and relax. Erin was a great communicator and accessing the building was seamless. Though our trip was short, it was wonderful and we’d love to come back."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place is a bit noisy but I live in the country so not used to city noise. Heat..ac..ceiling fans..made for a very comfortable environment. If you have kids and looking for readily available TV..maybe not the place for you..there was a small TV but not plugged in/ hooked up. Plant life is strewn throughout the yoga studio which I found reminded me of home. Nice blackout curtains provide a dark sleeping environment. Overall I would rate this a 4 out 5 stars.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cool loft space! Close to downtown Youngstown and some coffee shops and restaurants. Would stay again!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Calvin Center is a fantastic place to stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A huge, historic space with lots of light and plenty of room. I love finding unique, interesting places like this!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently loss my dad and needed a place to stay when I returned home. At this airbnb, I felt a sense of calmness and at peace. It was very cozy and exaclty what I needed during this difficult time. Erin provided clear direction on wifi, check-out, etc. She also made clear that anything that you had questions on or needed help with that she would be free to help do so. Great accomodation!!! Thanks again Erin."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,my favorite Youngstown getaway
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely beautiful! The high ceilings and open floor plan made it very relaxing. The decor was charming, so many plants throughout which brought me joy! Many books lined the shelves in the extra bedroom i wish i had time to read the ones that intrigued me. The kitchen was stocked with tea and coffee, which I appreciated very much. I didnt sleep in the side room but the bed and the couch and chairs were quite comfy! There were mutiple heaters to keep the place warm!
The wood floors are gorgeous and the lighting is spectacular if youre into photography! You can hear the sounds of the cars outside but it was so peaceful inside that i didnt even notice them!
I would live in this place if I could, 100% coming back"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures are amazing, but when you visit in person it’s even more jaw dropping than anticipated. Beautiful decor and space overall!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful unique space! There is plenty of space for everyone and the decor is quaint yet pleasant. I was in town for an art show drop off and had plenty of room to finish framing my work for the show. Erin was extremely prompt to messaging and was very helpful. Something extremely noteworthy is that even with how large the studio is, the host has gone to great lengths to make a very climate controlled environment! Having stayed there in January it was so warm and cozy."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, cozy spot to stay!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We’re so glad we got to experience a slice of Youngstown from Erin’s school house retreat. It was unique, comfortable, spacious, nicely supplied, and clean. Booking and check-in info was great."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely creative space, and it was delightful to wake up into a vast open bright room. I stayed overnight and the space had all the essentials. I had a very comfortable stay. Light sleepers should know that traffic noise is audible late into the night, and that there is a smaller room if you want a darker sleeping experience."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is well kept, size and ceiling height was incredible. Our dogs loved the space. The host was very responsive and pleasant to work with. The location is central to Poland and Boardman with easy freeway access. We would definitely stay there again when visiting family in Boardman."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Erin was a great host, easily reached and very accommodating. the apartment itself is beautiful, a large studio apartment with all the essentials. The unit is in a charming old school building converted into a multi-use building including a theater. The missing star is just because I was surprised a couple of the nights there was an ongoing play which made the hall outside of the unit crowded and noisy. But even this didn't spoil an overall positive experience"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome, big, open room! Our one-year-old daughter had a great time running back and forth on the open floor. We slept well, we were warm, we even delayed our desired departure time just to stay a few extra minutes. Very cool and beautiful room."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This review is for the 2nd floor studio airbnb ""Old School Loft"" located in the same building. I had initially booked this 1st floor ""Creative Living"" space, but Erin was kind enough to give me the heads up that a performance was happening on the same floor. She offered the option of the old school loft for more quiet and made it easy to switch my reservation. It is a lovely, HUGE space. I liked the high ceilings, preserved wooden floors, blackout curtains and remote controlled temperature control. I loved that the space is in a renovated school house that also houses a theater and gymnasium. Great communication and easy check-in/check-out. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a truly unique stay near (i.e., a two-minute drive) downtown Youngstown. The space is large, beautiful, and stylish. There was also a gas stove and two portable heaters to keep the space warm on a snowy night.
The main bed is more than acceptable, but my only complaint regards the flimsy mattresses in the small room off of the main space. Upgrades there are probably needed.
Other than that? A real gem!"
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The host was quick to reply when asked questions and the space was very large and roomy and the fireplace was cozy.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is beautiful and spacious! It gives off a chill vibe and looks much better in person. I would recommend.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Huge place definitely a quiet place to relax no tv or distractions just open space.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, will continue to book"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean & nice with a lot of character
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is such a neat space, definitely would not pass this spot up!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,hip clean awesome unique space. We will return next time we visit Youngstown.
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,They fail to mention that this is still an active theatre and you may be dealing with a lot of noise late at night during your stay. Do not book if you are in need of a quite place to sleep.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Erin is a great host! We used the space for my nonprofit group’s meeting and the space was perfect. Erin rolled out the red carpet for us.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem considering the dearth of AirBNBs in Youngstown. Location is extremely convenient if you’re traveling to campus. Very close to downtown Federal St. “strip” with lots of bars and restaurants. I don’t know how safe it would be to walk per se but a very short car, bike or ride share. The spade itself is huge and very unique. There’s a little second room with 2 small beds that would be perfect if you were traveling with kids. Erin was a gracious and supportive host for our stay as well."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated space with to-die-for wood floors. If you love artistic old buildings with tons of character, this is the place for you. I was in town for the Youngstown Lit Festival and found the location is super convenient to downtown and campus. There is a vibrant community afoot in the building. :) I found it charming and everything was quiet by bedtime."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were pleasantly surprised by the size and location, about 2 minutes from YSU campus and only 10 minutes from Niles Ohio. Very clean and comfortable space and tastefully decorated. Would 10/10 stay here again. Perfect for a group of 5."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Erin was very nice and welcoming when we arrived. It is a very nice space and we had a great stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great for our one night!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described, beautiful spacious studio"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place to stay, light and spacious and simple."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place was a great spot for me during my work trip. Central for me to get around to meetings, and easy parking. It was perfectly clean, and the layout was charming."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space, quite relaxing as well. Talk to owner about the building. Very informative and cool"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated space! Love the location and the host is a delight! I highly recommend this place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is super cool! I would definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay very unique & convenient.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at Erin’s. It is a unique space!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very unique historic spot, close to downtown Youngstown, Ohio. It’s more of an Extra EXTRA LARGE studio, but definitely enjoyed our time and worth the price. Highly recommend this location."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The photos almost do the place justice. Great open space and dog friendly was a huge bonus for us as we were in the middle of moving. Minutes away from downtown for all your local food/beverage and YSU needs. I look forward to staying again.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay but wish the bed was a little more comfortable. Checkin and out was super easy.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Erins place a perfect little place to stay. I will definitely be back!
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome open space with tons of room, very clean, lots of natural light, and really fun during the day. However sleeping here is very difficult because of people leaving the gym shouting, cars revving engines, loud music from cars, etc. So during the day, 5/5 stay! At night, 2/5 at best."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a nice place! It’s so open and spacious! Our dog absolutely loved it too! The owner is so helpful too. Would book again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique stay, would return if in Youngstown."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best AirBnB place and experience we have had in a long time. The space is relaxing, huge, inspiring, well-furnished (both furniture and kitchen/bathroom) and the best thing I can say is that we would happily go out of our way to stay here again. Erin was super friendly and accommodating and communication was a breeze. You will not regret staying here period."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very unique and beautiful!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Was a great place and had great vibes. Loved the schoolhouse renovation. The parking lot did have limited lighting. Other then that it was beautiful and I would stay again.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erin's place was fantastic. It was as described. It is in a great location, in a unique building. The space had everything we needed and a lot more. We also highly recommend going to Pressed for some coffee and food in the morning."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The studio seems to be a part of a larger recreational center and the walls are pretty thin so it was a bit hard to get some sleep with all of the different things going on. Other than that, Erin was very helpful during our stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for an OUTSTANDING visual experience check out Erin's place in Youngstown. What can I say, except that it a truly beautiful space filled with natural light and architectural curiosities. Location was very convenient for our travel purposes, but the place itself is what sets Erin's place apart."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was dope. Great location off the highway.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice-looking space with quirky ""art loft"" appeal, probably best for a younger clientele who can sleep anywhere and/or longer-term visitors (we mid-40s parents and our kids actually only stayed for one night on our way through from one destination to the next) who are willing and able to travel outside of walking distance for amenities. It's a bit rough around the edges and a bit loud (in-home care service next door sends vans in and out all night), but as a base of operations for Youngstown visitors with a taste for the urban art/yoga space lifestyle, it definitely has its charms."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderfulplace to stay. Close to the freeway for easy access. Erin is a great hostess.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great open space!

I would recommend anyone stay here! The home was well stocked with anything you might need to sleep comfortably, feel at home, and cook well. All of the check in and out instructions were easy and readily available. We felt safe because of the security measures taken.

The house was clean, and stayed very cool despite a hot summer weekend. We found the beds in the rooms we used to be very comfortable! While we did not use the second bathroom in the basement, the bathroom on the upper level was spacious. The water pressure isn't very strong, but it did get nice and warm. We felt very safe in the house and appreciated the smartlock for ease of access for multiple adults.
The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, but I would note for anyone unfamiliar with this area that it can be hard to get an Uber at times, so you'd definitely want a car if you plan to explore! Rachel's guidebook offered a lot of great suggestions of things to see and do in the area. There was a lot of room to park multiple cars."

We had our 4 kids with us ( ages 8, 7, 5, and 3) and this house worked out perfectly for us! It was charming, well maintained, beautifully decorated, and had everything that we needed to enjoy our stay. We ended up cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the kitchen. The Mill Creek Wick Recreation Park entertained our kids for hours with a splash pad, playground, and sand area. The Oh WOW! Center for Science and Technology was a great way to spend a morning. Definitely check out the Fellows Riverside Garden. The library inside had a cute children's section that was great for our kids when it started to pour."

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really wonderful, comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood. This house was a perfect central location for my PA/OH family to meet. The space was large and welcoming. Comfortable beds and furniture. The house was super clean and obviously well cared for and attended to. The host was available via text for a few minor questions, with immediate responses. The neighborhood was quiet and walkable - we even walked to the supermarket a half mile away for a forgotten item through the pleasant neighborhood. Bedding and towels were good quality. The kitchen was very well prepared for a family gathering with homemade meals. The Craftsman style home feels warm and personal (speaking as someone who lives in a Craftsman home). It has a very ""homey"" appeal. My sister probably said it best, remarking ""this just sort of feels like we are 'at home.' "" I will absolutely try to plan another family visit here again. My thanks and gratitude to our hosts."

She and her husband are excellent communicators and were quick to help when we couldn't figure out the AC that first night. Rich even offered to pick us up a few things from the store since that's where he was when we called. Rich also suggested a museum our toddler loved. Visiting the Amish Market was his idea, and we were NOT disappointed.
The neighborhood felt safe and the neighbors were friendly. The house is beautiful and well furnished. The kitchen has plenty of gadgets and dishes, and Rachel had plenty of snacks around and bottled water in the fridge. There's lots of natural light and the claw foot tub is beautiful.
It is worth noting that the bathroom is on the second floor in case you've got mobility issues or find it difficult to do stairs.
Book at Rachel's place, enjoy some coffee on the porch, and have a blast in Youngstown!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment had everything we needed. Was particularly happy with the provided coffee. It meant I didn’t have to go buy some. There was also a variety of shampoos and conditioners although we didn’t need them. That was a step above other places. The kitchen was minimal and not a place for cooking but we only needed the fridge so it was perfect for us. The bed was comfortable but there was little room for hanging clothes. We would have preferred a tub over the shower stall. The apartment was facing a commercial area and we were a little concerned about that but the road quieted down at night. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, enjoyable home, tastefully decorated and nicely laid out.

I liked it so much that I did not even want to go back home! The sheets are so clean, the mattress is so comfortable, no noise at night, and I am pretty sensitive to noise - I slept like a baby! The internet super stable, everything one needs - coffee, tea, shampoo, soap, etc. - is right there within arm's reach.
I really enjoyed my stay at Irina's place and I will certainly will be coming back again!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, clean it has all you need and the host communicates well! I don’t see any issues if you may need something Irina will get back to you quickly. The only thing that one should know is that the bungalow faces and is right on a 4 lane major road that has a lot of traffic. It is noisy. It may be an issue for you or it may not be. The time we stayed there were lots of sirens and road noise over night. I had a hard time sleeping but than again I’m not used to noise at night. Other than that you can’t go wrong here bed was comfortable, heat/ac easily controlled. Has just about anything you need for a short stay. Would recommend as long as you know about the busy street and it’s on with you than you will have no issues here."

Room was nice and cozy, with plenty of room to store clothes and belongings (dresser drawers, closet with rod and hangers, etc). Even though it was January and single digits outside, the room was warm and toasty. The coffee maker was utilized daily and the mini-fridge was the perfect size. Thank you again Kathryn for sharing your home! Blessings!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely place and great stay thank you so much
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kathryn is a delight! Hospitality at its finest and a cozy welcoming home to boot. I enjoyed chatting with Kathryn upon arrival and she showed me around. The room was as described and the bed is super comfortable. It truly felt like coming home but in the middle of a long solo road trip. I couldn’t have asked for more. I only wish I had more time to visit and chat with Kathryn and enjoy visiting with the dog a bit longer.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only stayed for one night on my way from NYC to Chicago, but it was the best night’s sleep I had in a while. The bed was so comfortable! The house is old but sooo cute and has a really homey atmosphere to it. Kathryn is a great host. She was there to greet me when I arrived and showed me everything. Parking on the street is also no problem at all. I would definitely recommend staying here over a hotel any time!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good host, friendly and affordable"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very quick, I could only sleep a few hours and then I had to get back on the road, but for the price it was sooo much nicer than a hotel! With a warm and welcoming host and hostess.
I did have some trouble getting the instructions because I don’t have a smart phone but Kathryn was very helpful in figuring out how to work my quick stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathryn’s place was just what I needed for a nights rest before the last leg of my journey driving to New York - probably the best part of my stay was the host - she was super accommodating and hospitable as well as very flexible with my check in time as I arrived a couple hours later than expected.
The location was perfect for anyone driving on route 80 as it’s near the highway and there was plenty of free parking on the street. The room had cute English touches which is part of why I booked it since it reminded me of being back in one of my favorite countries, England!
Communication was great - everything was outlined on how to enter the property, where to park, etc. I even had the chance to chat with Kathryn for a while before I left and it was nice to get to know each other and bond over alot of similarities.
Overall, I’d recommend Kathryn’s place to anyone passing through."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Kathryn's place is one great place to be even tho covid 19 is around. She keeps the place clean and is always a great host.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Why so many reviews and so little time. This is my go to place to stay as I'm working at the shell cracker plant. Why do I have so many reviews because Kathryn 's place is my go to place to stay out if the other places I have been. Her place is the best for me because in life it's not every day you meet beautiful people in your travels and Kathryn is one of those one in a million. Not to leave her family out because they are wonderful souls also.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is the best super host Airbnb you could stay at. Kathryn makes me feel so much like the family that I couldn't imagine staying any where else unless I was at home in my own bed. She has a great personality and a heart of gold.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is one nice place to stay I love it as much as my house.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love this place it's a great place to be and if I'm in the area I'm staying at Kathryn's.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Using Kathryn’s place as a base for an eight-day stay in Youngstown was a Godsend. Even though I only needed a place to bunk down at night and prep in the morning had I needed more this would have still been the right place to go. It felt more like I was actually living at home rather than visiting somewhere. The accommodations were perfect, bed was great, amenities were beyond reproach and even Kathryn’s two “greeter” pooches were perfect. The address is in a quiet, residential area but still gives a feel for Youngstown as it used to be with former industrial areas nearby, YSU and Mill Creek Park a short ride away and sources for whatever you might need within a short hop. All-in-all I think I lucked into a definite cone-back-to place."

Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. Thank you Kelly!"

The location is perfect for restaurants, stores, and Youngstown State. We will certainly stay at one of Kelly’s homes while we visit Youngstown on our many trips to see our daughter who attends YSU. Kelly is always so kind when you reach out and that in itself is priceless."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kelly was amazing she went out of her way to accommodate me and my family. I truly appreciate her prompt response to any questions I had. I can't say enough about how much she made my trip so much easier from check-in flexibility to other accommodations I asked about during our stay. She even went out of her way to recommend another place if I needed an extra night. Thanks so much Kelly and family. I hope to stay again when I come home for another visit.

If we are back in the Youngstown area in the future, we would certainly try to obtain reservations with Kelly at The Pink Door. House and entire property well maintained and very clean.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and very nice home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time staying in an Airbnb. When my friend and I entered the house, it was very clean. I liked that Kelly had some snacks and water in the fridge as well as toiletries, kitchen supplies and laundry supplies already in the house. I loved that she allows pets since we were traveling with our dogs. The house is in a nice dog friendly neighborhood where you can walk your dogs except the sidewalks are in need of repair. We loved being so close to the lovely Mill Creek Park. We went hiking 2 different days. I would stay there again if I am back in that area again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home with every amenity you could have asked for. A lot of thought went into every detail and the home has been renovated from top to bottom and done beautifully. We stay in a lot of Air BnB’s and this is one of the top we’ve stayed in. Comfortable bed, super clean inside and out and lots of beautiful details right down to having plug in lamps on the bedside tables as well as a printer and office supplies if you are working. Bonus of having TV’s in each bedroom (a lot of places don’t). The neighborhood is lovely and felt very safe. We look forward to staying again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for cozy, modern, fun rental in Youngstown, this is the place for you. We felt so at home in this beautifully decorated home. The kitchen is spotless and well equipped to make a home-cooked meal. The basement is perfect for relaxing with it's big screen TV, pool table and comfy couch. In the backyard we saw an adorable bunny and a black squirrel, it's very quiet and peaceful.The house is a short drive from Lanterman's Mill and the Butler Art Museum, and a pretty rad retro arcade as well!

We will definitely be staying here when we visit our daughter at Youngstown State for the next few years."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect and very nicely renovated!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"One of the most beautiful and clean airbnb's i have ever stayed at!! Absolutely gorgeous! If you are looking in the area THIS is the place to stay! All of the beds are super comfortable, even the sleeper sofa! The area is very nice and quiet. My family felt comfortable being outside even after dark. The host provides everything you need to feel at home! 1 and only thing is that if you are traveling with more people and need to use the basement pullout couch just know that the basement is SUPER noisy! The shower is directly above the sleeper sofa and everytime someone showers, uses the sink or flushes the toilet you WILL be woken up. Also the air-conditioning kicking on is like a mac truck coming through the basement. However, if you are only using the upstairs bedrooms this will not affect you AT ALL. That being said we had an amazing stay and would 100% stay again when in the area! Thank you so much for the beautiful CLEAN home!!"

She also left 2 bundles of firewood for us to use for our night of s'mores and hobo meals! Oh, and the Airbnb had puzzles, board games, and books to read as well."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was very clean and in a decent neighborhood. It was nice to have use of the garage to park our car in. The water, coffee and snacks were thoughtful touches and much appreciated.
We enjoyed morning and evening walks with our dog around the neighborhood. A word of caution, the neighborhood sidewalks are very, very uneven so best to walk on the street if possible. It's also a short walk to Mill Creek Park.
The home had mostly everything we needed. What wasn't there, we made due.
We had a relaxing stay and would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a family wedding and Jody’s place was perfect for our stay. Very clean and amenities were exactly what we needed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the “Pink Door” for my friend’s wedding in Youngstown. I was happy to find a place that was so conveniently located. It was perfect because my friends were getting married at the Fellowship Riverside Gardens and the house pretty much borders multiple entrances to the park. It’s an older house, but you can tell a lot of thought went into the renovations of the space. It is very clean and modern while still staying true to the traditional neighborhood that it is located in. The beds were very comfortable and the shower had great pressure. It was very nice to be able to sit on the back porch, drink my coffee, and enjoy the birds and wildlife that live around the area. I will definitely be booking Jody’s “Pink Door” house whenever I have another event in Youngstown."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very nice,clean, and, comfY. It was better than I expected. I would definitely stay again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house was beautiful inside and out. They had a thoughtful care package upon arrival and we loved the space downstairs to visit with our family. Everything was thought of for our stay when this home was put together. The best part was the shower pressure and they welcomed our service dogs. Great stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our Anniversary celebration.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Pink Door at Newport Lake was fantastic! The entire home was beautiful and comfortable. The amenities were outstanding, and you truly feel like you are staying in a home away from home. We were so pleased with the decor and the little touches that Jody, our host, brought to every corner of the home.
The location of The Pink Door could not be better. It is within walking distance of Lanterman's Mill in Mill Creek Park, which is a must-see for nature lovers. We also found that we were walking distance to an amazing local co-op called Common Goods Studio, which showcases local vegan food, clothing, candles, and crafts. We enjoyed a Mamalagels Sriracha Everything bagel and coffee, both of which were amazing.
Jody was there for us our entire stay and made our arrival and departure a breeze. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be staying at The Pink Door at Newport Lake again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and liked being a few blocks from the park entrance.
The house was very comfortable and perfect for our family of 4."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at Kathryn's warm cozy apartment; it's so comfortable and private. She is my first choice in that region of Ohio, I'll definitely stay again on my next trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place definitely has way more value than what your paying for. We only stayed for one night. It is a very well thought out air bnb. It was nice to ba able to watch TV and rest after a day of hiking. The place felt like it was in a safe neighborhood. It's a very unique space. More of a cabin in the woods feel. The stairs are pretty steep. We loved it. Would stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kathryn’s such a great host. My mom and I stayed there for the weekend. The house is so cozy and homey. Loved the place

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathryn was very easy to communicate with, responsive and proactive. For instance she phoned to make me aware I could incur a parking fine given I had unknowingly parked next to a fire hydrant in an effort to avoid blocking the newspaper box. The water was HOT and abundant, bed and linen was comfy. The neighborhood was quiet, so quite you could hear the soft rain and outdoor crickets."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay at Kathryn’s Airbnb. The property was charming and peaceful, and just what I needed after a long day of driving. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed only for one night, but it was perfect for a peaceful night’s sleep. Eclectic, but comfortable furniture. Be aware that the flight of stairs are original to an older home, so they are narrow and steep. The handrail was secure, but take your time going up and down.
We would stay here again if we have the opportunity."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay. easy and accessible. great deal for the price.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place and a super responsive host. We only stayed for one night and didn’t spend much time in the room, but it was perfect for our visit. Not too many Ubers in the area, but that’s clearly not the host’s fault"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay and very close to everything you need in the area!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Kathryn enjoys hosting as is evident by her efforts to make the apt cozy and to communicate with guests, even left a personal message. I needed a quiet place to complete a digital project, which I did. The place is older, perhaps built in the 30s or 40s but very clean. Neighborhood, quiet, water pressure, strong and water, hot. I recommend her place but I would feel better mentioning some things as full disclosure. Refrigerator is a hotel size, not apartment size. Don't plan to buy many groceries that would require refrigeration. The windows in the bedroom and bathroom opened which I liked. Night was quiet. I was a bit surprised that two of the apartment windows, original to the house, were pulled-to with string but didn't close all the way. There was a gap of about 2-3 inches and stuffed with insulation. It looked as if they had been this way for a while. This is not something I expected to see. I appreciate the clean accommodations and Kathryn's kind communication."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a quiet, evening!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Came about Kathryn’s place because we had tickets to an event at the Covelli Center and it was less than 10 minutes away. The place was extremely cozy, conveniently located, and had everything we needed. We got some snow overnight which made the quaint area even more beautiful. We were only here for a quick stay, but what stood out and made our stay so special was how hospitable Kathryn and her husband were! She went out of her way to recommend local places nearby, offered to help us start up the fire pit outside, and even cleared the snow off our car the next morning. Now THAT is a SUPER HOST! Thank you Kathryn for making our stay so special. We will be back soon ☺️🫶🏼
P.S they have a great selection of games including YOUNGSTOWN monopoly 😍"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Kathryn’s was great! I absolutely loved the added touch of a coffee bar. Utensils/ dishes / appliances were available as well as some spices and seasonings. Cozy and functional living space. Attention to minor accommodations that make a big difference (board games, coloring, plush blankets). Some spaces were a bit tighter than expected and there were stairs leading up to our space- this was fine for our family but may not be ideal for others with mobility restrictions. My biggest criticism would be that there was a decent bit of dust (blinds, ceiling fans, some less used surfaces) although the space was tidy and clean otherwise. Grocery and general stores within short driving distance. Great local nature trails and waterfalls!"

Perfect for one or two people. Comfortable bed, hot shower with good water pressure. I was there in summer and there was good AC. Very quiet neighborhood, the only thing I heard were birds outside.
Great communication, very clear instructions (via the app and also in written form inside the unit). Kathryn has made it feel very homey and she provides many amenities to make your stay comfortable. I was ready to move in for good!"

Place was completely secluded from the main house and we felt warm and cozy on that snowy night. Definitely a cozy place for a couple wants a getaway. We spent more time on sofa bed front of the tv.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m originally from Youngstown Ohio. So when I return I’m visiting family and old friends. Kathryn’s cabin-like apartment Is one of the most calm, peaceful spaces I’ve ever found myself in. Additionally, I travel all over the world and stay in Airbnb’s. I have to say I think this is one of the coziest , warm, welcoming places I’ve ever stayed in my life. The Decor is so perfect. I’m not sure if Kathryn studies feng shui but her space is not only cozy but nurturing. I cannot believe this space exists in Youngstown, Ohio. I was so sad that I had to leave. I will definitely be booking in the future, when I return to visit Youngstown!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice little cabin feel. Other rgan the birds it was a nice stay. They tell us about the stairs but didn't show pictures of them. They are steep so make sure you can handle stairs well before you book. I should have double checked that part as my mother is handicapped.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Great location and price. Had all amenities I needed as well.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy little upstairs apartment! In a real nice neighborhood. Quiet Street. Comfy bed. Real close the the Covelli Center! Will look up again on my next Youngstown trip!
,,,"I don’t think the location, or the actual apartment matched description. Safety was a big question: It is an old building, used by the local community without deadbolts to all external doors: It didn’t feel safe.
