2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect!
The location is absolutely peaceful and close to many good trails."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Super cute place! Beautiful location
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,It was a very beautiful cabin and the setting was so peaceful. It had everthing I needed for my little get away. There were just a couple things we had problems with but nothing terrible. We just had a little trouble with the hot tub temperature button. But once we got it to temp we had a blast. Then the other was the mattresses. Unfortunately for us they just weren't the stlye for us to sleep comfortably. They were very clean but just not comfortable. Only thing I would change from my trip would have been to make it at least another one or two days longer. Very beautiful cabin and scenery.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thanks for another great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"I just love staying at Broomsage cabin! It's close to town but far enough out that is peaceful, pretty views. We seen several deer and even seen an eagle! The antics of a couple squirrels had us laughing.
The hot tub was amazing! Definitely enjoyed that a few times during our stay.
We will definitely be returning!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing time for our Girls Weekend Getaway! The peaceful & relaxing atmosphere was exactly what we needed. The cabin is so cozy and welcoming. The wrap around porch is where spent most of our time, listening to the sounds of the woods and we were lucky enough to see deer a few times!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was fantastic. The cabin was beautiful as were the surroundings. Tresia was a great host also.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay here. Host was very responsive to questions. The cabin was full of amenities that make for a very comfortable stay, including the kitchen which had more than everything you’d need (from aluminum foil and Tupperware to icecream scoop and kids utensils)! We loved having a washer/dryer. There was plenty of room to spread out in the cabin and to sleep for our family of 6.
Beautiful property. It was lovely to sit on the porch in rocking chairs with coffee and watch nature and the kids as they played.
The kids really enjoyed the hot tub. That especially made the stay worth it!
Locally, we explored the Bluespring Caverns (a gem!), Spring Mill State Park, Paynestown and Hardin Ridge recreation area, and parts of the Hoosier National Forest.
Very much worth staying here!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Such a beautiful house and a beautiful location!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for our girls trip! The host had the entire place child proof before we got there, we extremely helpful during our stay, and quick to respond to any messages. We can’t wait to come back!!"
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,Planned a weekend get away with a small group of friends. It was a nice little break from reality right in our own backyard. Such a cozy atmosphere with amazing views. The only complaint is the hot tub was not staying at proper temp but that wasn’t a huge problem as we had plenty of other stuff there to do and I’m sure it was a simple solution. Tresia is an amazing host and has every thing you could think of needing there. Everyone had an amazing time. We would love to come back for another visit soon. Thank you so much for sharing your property with!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Beautiful and comfortable
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway at Tresia’s cabin. We absolutely loved the seclusive property and view, the charm of the log cabin with plenty of amenities, and the joy of being in a warm hot tub while watching the sun set! Tricia was an excellent and responsive host and we would absolutely love to come back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very private and secluded down in the valley. Very clean and updated only down fall was the small shower. Hot tub was nice.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family of 5 and I absolutely loved staying at this cabin! So many great things about the property from sitting in the hot tub watching the sunrise over the valley to playing the provided board games for hours after dinner each night. The kitchen was very well stocked and ready to use but it is just minutes from many stores in case you need something. Although we didn't use the outdoor firepit (it was January) there we camping chairs in the cabinet also which would have been great to use. You can tell lots of time and planning went into prepping this cabin for guests. The property was updated and spotlessly clean plus everything worked perfectly. We will be back as there are many State parks to explore in the area also!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tresia’s place was great. Beautiful view, tucked away in the valley surrounded by trees. The place had incredible privacy to allow a very peaceful and relaxing stay. Tresia was very responsive, helpful and kind. I stayed here for three weeks for work and it was really nice to have this place to come back to and relax with my family. Great experience all around."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A secluded and spacious cabin. Plenty of character. Lots of privacy. The hot tub was on point. Would stay here again.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived late Sat. pm in absolute dark but didn't have any trouble locating the house. We immediately got into the hot tub,  but didn't stay in long as the temp was basically luke warm and outside was below 40. 
We struggled for about 2 hrs Sat. am to get the hot tub warmer. The hostess responded quickly and sent the prop. mgr over, but it never worked. We gave up on the tub and (gratefully!!) sat in the jacuzzi until the aches from the previous day's hike went away. 
There's a few ponds in the valley below the cabin that are probably gorgeous in the summer. It was quiet and serene with no outside noise. There were squirrels and birds to watch, and a sm herd of deer on the opposite hill.
Unfortunately,  my hsbnd had to work at 4am Mon, cutting our stay short,  so we didn't get to wander the property or explore the area. We had intended to stay until dinner but ended up leaving before lunch.  
We wish we could've stayed the 2nd pm!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"highly recommend Andrew and Amy's places!!! already refereeing them to other co workers!! great place, up to date plus more!! would definitely stay again when I'm back in town! thanks Andrew and Amy."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We needed some place to stay while major plumbing repairs were done on our home. This was the perfect place. Such a cute house! Full of charm, very welcoming and comfortable. Close to work, and easy to go back and forth to our house for things we needed. My grandma lived in this neighborhood many years ago, so it brought back sweet memories. The house is larger than the photos show. It’s been very nicely updated, while also keeping the original charm. Very well stocked with towels,etc., very nice coffee maker in the kitchen (I use k-cups breakfast blend black tea and there was only coffee-but I brought some of mine from home). Lots of charging stations for all our electronics. Best of all were the 3 gigantic tv’s! We would stay here again if we needed a place, and will keep it in mind for when our daughter and her family visit from Oregon."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to Bedford specifically for the total eclipse in April 2024 but I would come again to this sweet spot. What a cute town and lots to do.

We had requested a blender prior to the visit for our morning smoothies and they happily provided one for us. We also requested a box fan , something we typically use at home , and they provided two of them for us. Our stay was for one month , they communicated when they needed to come to the house to mow the lawn or take the trash toter out/back and were always respectful of our privacy. A wonderful bonus was use of the garage to park our vehicle."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, would definitely rent again"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as promised. The house was remarkably clean, even the yard was tidy! It had everything we really needed--very satisfactory--but few frills (ex: no DVD player, nightlight, or office supplies--tape/scissors). The layout of the house was nice. Our kids loved the bunk beds. Master bedroom was nice. The neighborhood was so-so, but we didn't have any problems. Some traffic noise at night. Very convenient to walk to the delicious pizza place. Parking was convenient. Intro message from Donna was friendly and complete with local recommendations and all the necessary info to access the house, etc. Worked out great for us! Would stay again!"

House was well cleaned and everything was great. We really loved our stay. Dedicated garage parking, patio with chairs. Would love to stay again and definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting Bedford or nearby area"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a charming place to stay while visiting our daughter at IU! It was about 30 minutes away from campus, but well worth the drive when compared to the cost of hotel rooms! We enjoyed a lovely walk to breakfast and overall had a very relaxing weekend!"

They also provided several extra touches that made our stay even better, such as some snacks and waters waiting for us upon our arrival, as well as suggestions for great locally owned places to eat. The property is in a great location; being close to IN-37 makes it a great home base for a wide variety of day trips. You will love staying here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in-between homes (selling and buying) and the time in Donna's home allowed us to feel like we were home.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No surprises when entering the home, it is just as described and reminds me of staying with my Gram when I was younger. It may sound silly but the towels, soap and even carpet in the bedroom was just like Gram's home. Thank you for our stay."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"May 13-16 All exactly as expected and more. Even with 3 days of rain we were able to skirt the storms for a bit and see most of what we came for. Even in the rain, the cabin was comfortable and spacious for us to sit back and enjoy. Red headed woodpecker a real treat to watch on the bird feeder. Numerous birds, some squirrels, and even a little chipmunk. Not to mention the turtle and resident frog. Restaurant suggestion by Mary was spot on. We ate there all 3 nights. When you come, you will be in a forest of trees, and beautiful landscaped gardens. Lots of extras! Thank you"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry and Mary were great hosts! We were in need of a steamer for our daughter’s graduation robe and they were more than happy to allow us to borrow their personal steamer. The cabin was very private and peaceful. We were on the move most of the time, but we did have a little time to enjoy the birds and wildlife. Great place!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This quaint cabin was wonderful for our few day getaway, although we wanted to stay longer! The cabin was spacious; I brought 2 kids with me, they played hide and seek throughout the cabin. Plenty of places to sit and relax. Beautiful large windows facing the East, great view of the sun/moon rise and the East Fork White River. A relaxing porch, with a couple of rockers, off of the kitchen great to watch the sunsets. Kitchen had everything I needed to make our breakfasts/dinners. Jerry and Mary were wonderful and accommodating hosts and had wonderful touches to the cabin to make us feel at home, you can tell they enjoy hosting. Since we visited in early Spring, we were able to enjoy the abundance of gorgeous Daffodils.We were able to walk down by the river, just be aware it is a steeper grade so know your limitations, if you can't make the walk down no worries you will still have breathtaking views from the house. Close to all the day trips we planned."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was utterly magnificent, we had such a beautiful time. This place was honestly better than I expected and hoped for. We wished that we could have spent more time here, but we are planning another return. It was very nice being able to read everyone's entries dating back almost five years ago! It is very private and out of the way, but it is also very close to everything you would need. I absolutely adored this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true gem! Our only regret was not having booked a longer stay. Well-appointed cabin with all the amenities you might want. Loved the kitchen, which was stocked - bring your own spices! The living room was incredibly comfortable: gas fireplace, large east-facing windows overlooking the river and trees, plenty of seating. The outdoor firepit was perfect for taking off the evening chill. Plenty of firewood provided. The location is very private. It's a 10-minute drive into town for provisions and several restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed a 20 mile round-trip, out-and-back bike ride on the Milwaukee Trail from the center for Bedford to Williams Dam. Slight uphill most of the way out. Nicely maintained rail-to-trail. Finally, Mary and Jerry were excellent hosts. They obviously love their property, and live nearby. They checked in, offered suggestions, and even left a nice welcome arrangement of their daffodils. Perfect."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin on historic property overlooking river in the Indiana wilderness. Serene stay.
10/10."

The ceilings at the front of the house were low, and made for an interesting shower! The cabin being built in 1920, my guess there weren't many 6 foot people around. The living room was beautiful and we really enjoyed the outdoor patio and fire pit. Jerry and Mary were helpful and gave us our space too."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Red Rock was the perfect stay to celebrate my husband's birthday. The pictures did no justice to the true beauty of this property and the cabin itself. We enjoyed two amazing days taking in the beautiful surroundings and spend some quality time relaxing with the windows open, listening to the rain, and looking out their gorgeous giant window into the trees and at the river. We are already planning out our next trip back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jerry and Marys’s place is a slice of heaven tucked away in the woods just a mile from the road. It’s tranquil, private, and great views. The cabin itself is perfect for a couple or small family. It is incredibly clean!!! The kitchen is also full-size and the cabin comes well stocked—we happened to forget baby bath wash, bug spray, and Qtips but it was not a problem bc those supplies were already there! The outdoor space was very well done and has a grill, fire pit, and lots of seating. Indoors we took advantage of the wide variety of DVDs and board games when we needed a break from the heat. Jerry happened to drive by when we were outside and let us know we could pick some flowers from the garden before we left. River Rock is a great value and easy proximity to other places like Brown County, Bloomington, French Lick. I would absolutely stay again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderfully cozy cabin in the middle of a beautiful Paw Paw forest! The outdoor spaces are unmatched with a plethora of birds, butterflies and hummingbirds to capture your attention.

Thank you for a wonderful stay :)"

You can tell that Jerry and Mary REALLY care about the place."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a scenic and peaceful cabin getaway River Rock Cabin is definitely the place to be!!!! This cozy, beautifully decorated cabin will not disappoint!!! We enjoyed all the little touches throughout the cabin and property. The beds were super comfy & the kitchen was fully quipped and had everything needed including spices. We enjoyed sipping sangria around the fire pit & cooking dinner on the gas grill. Mary and Jerry were fabulous hosts that went above and beyond. On the day we arrived a rainstorm had come through bringing cooler temperatures with it... the gas fireplace had already been turned off for the season but Mary and Jerry were kind enough to turn it back on for us. This was an added bonus because we were able to stay indoors and play board games in front of the fireplace. The family room is also full of windows and beautiful panoramic views of the property which is abundant with wildlife and gives you the feeling that you are outdoors. We could not have picked a better place or better hosts for our annual girls trip!!!!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at this cabin for 4 nights in late October. We greatly enjoyed our stay! We brought food to cook and this was the first Airbnb rental we’ve ever stayed in that had every single kitchen item you could possibly need for cooking. We loved the living room and the fireplace. The bed was comfortable although it did squeak loudly any time we moved; this did not bother us but might bother a light sleeper. We would stay at this cabin again!

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Words can't describe and the photos don't do it justice! From previous reviews and photos I expected a nice cabin atmosphere, but seeing and experiencing was even more impressive. Jerry and Mary thought of many small touches that make it feel like a home away from home, from a well stocked kitchen, toiletries, spacious seating outdoors, dvds, and many throw blankets and pillows for relaxing. They were quick to respond and even checked in mid stay to see if we needed anything. The grounds were beautiful while also kid friendly, we especially loved the river view and trails. I would definitely recommend and plan to stay again!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin and property is amazing - truly a gem. We had a wonderful time in and outside the cabin. We actually loved that there was no wifi! It helped us detach from the world, enjoy creation and reconnect as a family. Though it was cold, we visited Spring Mills Park and were so happy we did! The rugged trails rewarded us with so many incredible surprises along the way. We hope to see it all again when the weather is a bit warmer and flowers are blooming."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect get away to unwind, relax and disconnect!

Seriously, if you're looking for a place to stay in this area, I can't suggest this cabin enough."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient to major roads but yet still feels secluded. Historic nature of the cabin gives it a very southern Indiana feel. Highly recommended.

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a delightful stay in this charming cabin while visiting family in the area. It was perfect for getting together for visiting, preparing meals together, and much of our time was spent in the cozy living room by the fire place. We found a well-stocked kitchen for our needs and plenty of towels, reading material, and we enjoyed the Christmas decorations and beautiful setting outdoors. Jerry and Mary were so accommodating and friendly, and we are already looking forward to our next visit to the area and staying here again."

2018-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,great hideaway!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is really special, cozy and serene. We wanted to be secluded without being remote and this location is perfect. The hosts are gracious, responsive and friendly. Everything was clean, charming and comfortable. The river view was tiny because of the season, but we could still see it. It will be much larger when some leaves fall. It didn’t matter because we could see the trees, wildlife and flowers, as well. We were traveling a lot so didn’t get to take advantage of the space but there is everything needed for cooking, grilling and outdoor living. We wanted to have a fire outside but it was too hot, even though it’s October. They have wood available and it’s ready to go. Crazy weather. The fireplace is gas so it’s a breeze to use. I did turn it on one morning, for a little while, and it heats the cabin in minutes. The television was perfect for my husband’s evening sports fix and we didn’t miss internet because the cell phone service was fantastic. There are many brochures available if you need ideas about activities and I appreciated the map. We went to Lincoln’s Boyhood Home Memorial and West Baden Springs Resort along with a lot of antiquing. This cabin is perfectly located for so many southern Indiana day trips. We just loved it and will definitely return. Upon leaving we did meet Jerry and he regaled us with some history of the cabin and the land, making it even more special."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent get away, beautiful area, beautiful cabin and close to shopping g and resturants."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great choice if you want to relax, take in the beauty of nature and actually enjoy each other’s company. An “authentic” cabin that is full of added touches to make everyone comfortable. Everything we needed was there. Fresh cut flowers out of the beautiful garden was a very nice touch. Games, puzzles, cards and a big TV to watch the ballgame if you have to. :(
Easy drive to Bloomington. Super clean.
The only thing it needs is more beds so more can go....or maybe not."

2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerry and Mary's cabin is peaceful, secluded, and beautiful. The views are incredible, and we were able to walk right down to the river from the back porch. Each room is well-appointed and spotless. The garden surrounding the cabin is incredible, too! I loved the feel of staying in an authentic log cabin while being within fifteen minutes of a grocery store. We enjoyed hiking in the nearby Jefferson-Washington forest and relaxing in the cabin's great room. Jerry told us all about the history of the cabin when we checked in, and we loved that. I couldn't imagine a nicer host. We will definitely be back!"

2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jerry and Mary’s cabin was perfect for our long weekend! The cabin was charming and close enough to town to grab last minute items (which was basically only groceries- everything else we needed was provided). Mary greeted us when we arrived and gave us some suggestions for places to eat and was readily available if we needed her or had questions. We will definitely be recommending this place to others that need a break from the hustle and bustle and would love to return when it’s a bit warmer so we can more thoroughly enjoy the patios and view! Thank you for a wonderful weekend!!
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The River Rock Cabin is a quaint little place on the river. I would imagine it is stunning in the summer. We went during the rainy spring season before anything but the thousands of daffodils bloomed. Jerry gave us a tour of the property and even suggested some local restaurants.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"River Rock is a great cabin and beautiful spot! The view overlooking the river is much more stunning than pictures can show. Mary and Jerry are kind and welcoming hosts, you can tell a lot of thought and care went into making the cabin comfortable and welcoming. This is a great spot to visit Spring Mill, Hoosier National or just to relax and unwind. The fireplace was wonderful and we would have loved to build a fire outside but the weather didn't cooperate. We also enjoyed the decor and collection of cool rocks and geodes outside the cabin!"

2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Jerry were fantastic hosts and we had an absolutely wonderful two-day getaway from the city. Response time was excellent. Once Jerry found out we were coming to the area to explore Hoosier National Forest he very kindly went to the National Parks office to get us information and maps on trails before our arrival. We also took his suggestion to explore Spring Mill State Park on our first afternoon, an easy 10 minute drive from the cabin, which gave us a great couple of hours in the woods. We took a 12 mile hike in Hoosier the next day, enjoying the beautiful view of the river and the gas fire place at the cabin for reading and had an outdoor fire later in the evening. Mary and Jerry provided more than enough wood and we had everything we needed in the kitchen for cooking in both nights. Highly recommend this cabin for exploring the area and a quiet, relaxing time away! An easy 4.5 drive from Chicago. Thanks again!"

2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and cabin. Nice accomodations. There is a steep drop off so the recommendation for older children is wise. All you truly need is your personal items and food. The outside areas are as nice as inside. Loved it!

---
I recently stayed at this wonderful Airbnb and had an amazing experience. The place was super clean and had so many great amenities that made our stay very comfortable. It was incredibly cozy, and we especially loved the jukebox and fireplaces. The setting was peaceful, and the nature scenery around the property was beautiful. A special touch was the host making fresh cinnamon rolls for us, which were delicious. I came here to spend time with my mom, and it was the perfect retreat for us. Highly recommend this place!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daryl was a great host and the place was very peaceful and clean! Thank you for having us!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved staying here! The home was so peaceful and private. The porches are very relaxing, loved the electric fireplaces and jukeboxes and the house was very spacious and airy. Perfect little getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little house in a very quiet and beautiful area. Comfortable and more spacious than expected. The cinnamon rolls were absolutely a plus! You may want earplugs as the water heater can be quite loud. Absolutely would come back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed at Daryl's house on a hill to experience the solar eclipse, and this was the only airbnb or hotel we could find that didn't suddenly charge an exorbitant sum to cash in. In fact, Daryl did not raise his very reasonable rates by even one dime! We had a wonderful time. Surrounded by natural beauty, and the beds are comfortable too! I can't guarantee there will be a rainbow to greet you as there was for us, but who knows!
I cannot recommend highly enough."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daryl’s communication was wonderful. He exceeded expectations for that. His place was really nice and peaceful. Only issue I had was the wi-fi. I had to work one of the days that I was there and I was able to get done what needed to be done, but I was kicked off a couple of times. Was not a major issue given where the house is located. Overall, a great experience!!!"

He loved fishing & hiking so it was a perfect place to be & a perfect weekend in Avoca. The historic tour from Mike was so special & all the work & time that was put into the Hamer House and the park was such a wonderful story. Your community should be so proud & really help to take care of it for future generations!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Daughter’s wedding so we found this house close to the venue. The house was big enough to hold the immediate family. The place was big and spacious. Staff is kind and friendly. Loved the waterfall on the park property.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Jan’s house was beautiful and there was plenty of room. The accommodations were exactly what we needed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Autumn walks along the spring, Goose Creek, and through the woods are a great compliment to the historic house. Twenty minutes to Spring Mill and 30 minutes to IU. Loved listening to the creek at night from the porch and back deck."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you Mike, for all your help. You saved the day. Loved the shelter house for the wedding. It was secluded and we made it look so beautiful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The surrounding grounds were wonderful. We enjoyed walks in Tempe morning and cups of coffee on the big porch. Mike, the steward, was kind and incredibly informative about the history of the space. The home was perfect for what we needed with ample space for quality family time. Would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was even better than the pictures looked. The park is gorgeous and kept my children entertained outside from sun up until sundown. You could feel the history in this 200 year old home. we loved our stay here and are looking forward to staying again!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We were met by Mike to give us a tour of the location and he did a great job telling us about the history and the renovations made to the 200 year old house.

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Hidden Gem! We had a quick weekend getaway with some friends and are happy to have found the Hamer House!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Jan's place with our daughters and their families and a brother-in-law. There were eight of us and we had plenty of room to spread out. We enjoyed sitting in the rocking chairs on the large front porch or roasting marshmallows in the fire pits which were well stocked with wood. The location was perfect with easy access to relatives in Bloomington, Brownstown, and Seymour and close proximity to parks, like Spring Mill, walking trails and the gem and rock show in Bedford. The grandkids loved being next to the playground and the ponds and the big yard. We cooked most of our meals in and the kitchen had pretty much everything you would need. Jan was very responsive and her brother met us at check-in and explained everything about the house. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay in a wonderful 200-year-old colonial style house. The house is surrounded by the woods, streams, trails, ponds, and old stone structures of Avoca Park. We loved having coffee on the back porch, listening to the spring-fed creek. Jan and Chase were very responsive on the site. Avoca is a nice small town. Groceries and restaurants are less than 10 minutes away in Bedford.
The house has lots of room. Our group of seven was able to spread out. There are several comfortable gathering places in the downstairs rooms. The inside is clean, bright and freshly painted. They did a fantastic job restoring it. The house has updated furniture, decorations, and new linens and appliances alongside the 19th/20th century charm.
We made a day trip to Spring Mill State Park that really rounded out the visit, as we learned more about the Hamer family in the museum there. At the end of each day we walked along the ponds and watched the sun set over the woods. Can’t wait to return!"

The cottage was gorgeous, and the grounds were beautiful and well kept. Jan surprised me with a birthday flower boquet when we arrived as we were traveling for my birthday. She provided us with donuts from the local bakery, which were absolutely delish. 10/10 will book again in the future. If you're looking for somewhere to get away for peace and quiet, Woodcrest Farm is the place to go! I grew up in the area and didn't even know this gem existed, I am so glad I found it!"

Their cabin is so cute and clean, and we especially loved the sunhouse.

Super quiet, yet close to many interesting places to visit. We would definitely visit again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan & Mike’s cottage is so quaint and peaceful.

Jan and Mike make it incredibly easy to have a wonderful experience at their cottage.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately we had to cancel our plans to stay at the Pine Tree at the last minute, so I cannot comment on th accomodations. However, Jan was very accommodating and was very responsive and communicative. I hope we can stay there in the near future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the Farm. This is a special place. The cottage is well-stock, clean and cozy. The Garden house is a perfect setting for morning coffee or a romantic dinner. The property is gorgeous and well maintained. It’s quiet and peaceful. A bonfire under the stars is a must-do.
Jan and Mike are great people and wonderful hosts. They are responsive and accommodating. They provided a lot of information about the property, the surrounding area, and the nearby sights to see, as well as really nice little touches. Hilly, twisty, beautiful drives to Huber’s Orchard, Winery & Vineyards (Starlight Distillery), and short drives to Lake Monroe or Bedford. Be sure to stop at the Limestone Cafe in Bedford and the Salt Creek Brewery.
If you’re looking for a place to unplug and unwind, this is it. Just book it!"

I also loved walking the trails around your peaceful Christmas tree farm. Thanks to Jan for being an amazing host and thinking of ever little detail. We would love to come back some day."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was first class all the way! It started when my wife and I booked Pine Tree Cottage for the two of us.for a football weekend in Bloomington. Then two dear friends chose to join us for the weekend. I messaged Jan to see if there would be space in the cottage for two more people. Jan said the Cottage is just for two, then added that she would see what she could do to help us. Her solution was to upgrade us all to a new and much more spacious place on her property, “Pleasant View Lodge”, at no additional cost! This Lodge is newly built, finished by she and her husband during the few weeks leading up to our visit. What a kind and generous thing to do! And Pleasant View exceeded anything we could have expected. Attractive, roomy, just perfect for the four of us. Additionally, Jan made sure that we were stocked with absolutely everything we could ever need for our comfort. We would not suggest a thing that was missing. And the scenery on the property is just breathtaking!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location: Charming, clean, functional, beautiful. Great hiking trails. Property is meticulously maintained. Was such a blessing to spend a weekend here. Thanks Jan!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible stay at the Pine Tree Cottage! Jan was a phenomenal host who went above and beyond at every turn. The cottage was cozy yet plenty spacious (the photos listed simply don’t do it justice). The large, well-stocked kitchen was a great surprise. Jan had a spread of snacks and beverages set out, including fresh-baked muffins and mini cinnamon rolls. Sunlit mornings in the gorgeous garden house were a bit like something out of a fairytale ~ the whole experience was. Don’t hesitate to book a stay at this very special place. Thank you Jan, for your wonderful hospitality!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pine Cottage is a diamond in the rough in Bedford Indiana. Everything in the pictures is completely accurate for this little slice of heaven out in the country. Jan is a wonderful host and you want for anything!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space is very clean and adorably decorated. It has everything you could need, and more. We also enjoyed the garden house and walking around the farm. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating, and are quick to respond to you. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a clean, peaceful, oasis of restoration in Southern Indiana. The accommodations were spacious, comfortable, and well stocked. The location is secluded yet close enough to Bedford to easily enjoy the town. The hosts are easy to talk with and attentive to needs. They are present yet allow you your space. It is an easy decision to return and stay again. We look forward to it!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautful place to stay. Surrounded by peace and quite. Love the interior of the cottage. Jan was a super host. Followed up on any and all our needs. Jan and her husband are wonderful poeple. They helped make our stay so pleasurable.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful cozy place. Would definitely stay here again! Jan is an excellent host…goes above and beyond. Hope we can return some day!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After local power outages, our host upgraded us to a much larger lodging on the property. It was beautiful. The garden house was the most romantic place I've ever made my man take me. Allowing us to pick blueberries and roam the scenic walking path mown through the old christmas tree farm, it was just the ultimate relaxation. We had such a wonderful time hanging out at your place, we didn't get to see a third of the area attractions I'd earmarked for the trip. The host provided a light breakfast to start our daily adventures as well as a bountiful array of brochures, maps & advice for our travels. It feels very rural finding this place, but it's only minutes from a great ice cream shop and several restaurant choices (if you don't feel like cooking for yourself). There is a fire pit for roasting marshmallows and meeting any other guests, if they're out. Overall, I would say this is one of the best AirB&Bs I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend this place. There's plenty more in the area that we never got to see so we fully intend to visit this place again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan and Michael are awesome hosts. They will insure your stay is comfortable and you will have access to everything you need and even some things you didn't think you needed. The Garden Shed is the perfect retreat to start your day with a coffee and the birds chirping. The flowers smell amazing!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot. Quiet, clean with lots of attention to small details. Hosts were attentive and responsive. Had a great weekend here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike’s little cottage was even better than I imagined. After a very difficult week, it provided a peaceful, safe-haven that was just what we needed. The area certainly has plenty to offer, but we found we most enjoyed slowing down and sitting on the porch, listening to the birds and watching the kitties. The kindness and hospitality we encountered was unmatched and we are looking forward to a return visit to Woodcrest Farm.
Additional info: The cottage is much bigger than the photos imply. Plenty of room to stretch out. The kitchen would be great to use if someone was inclined to do so. Lovely gardens and property. Great hiking in the area."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the cutest place to stay. Such amazing hospitality.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike are wonderful hosts. Always quick to respond, and go above and beyond to make sure all is well and guests are comfortable! Thank you so much!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike are great hosts. They think of all the little extras you didn't think of. The place is restful, and the cats are great! On top of all of that, the place is always sparkling clean! We have stayed twice, and will be back!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend! The bed is super comfortable and all the little touches make it feel so homey!

The house is large, the property is gorgeous and the hosts really go beyond in order to accommodate you and make sure you are settled and have everything you need. We felt so lucky to stay at the farm and have Jan as our host. We will certainly be back next time we are in Indiana!!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Woodcrest Farm is BEAUTIFUL! Jan put the most wonderful touches on the little cottage. It was so homey, clean, and welcoming! From the warm welcome, the helpfulness for anything we needed, and the warm cookies when we left, our trip was perfect! Highly recommend visiting this little oasis in Southern, IN! ❤️"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Michael were incredible hosts. They met us upon our arrival and gave us a thorough tour of the cabin and information about the grounds. The refrigerator was full of goodies and the cabin was clean as a pin. We had a wonderful time relaxing, sightseeing, and walking the grounds of the farm. We also enjoyed chatting with Jan and Michael and learning about their retired tree farm business and the various buildings on the property. We had a wonderful stay. The cabin was cozy and inviting. We loved sitting on the front porch and watching the cats interact. We had our privacy, yet we also knew Jan and Michael would be there if we needed anything. We can't wait to visit again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike were such kind hosts - they greeted us as we arrived, brought us snacks and baked goodies and saw us off.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike were such gracious hosts meeting us at a later check in time, having many more amenities and breakfast options than expected and such a beautiful property! Both the cabin and the garden house were amazing and so beautifully decorated! Hosts were attentive but not at all intrusive. Definitely recommend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect stay at Jan and Mike’s cottage! They were accommodating with our late arrival, helpful with thoughtful touches around the apartment, and mindful with masks and extra cleaning products for our peace of mind during the pandemic. There’s also a full kitchen (no stove top but a hot plate) so we were able to cook our meals easily! The property is gorgeous and peaceful and the hikes in the area were so nice. We can’t wait to come back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place on a beautiful farm, Jan and her husband were terrific hosts and gave a once in a life time opportunity to experience their little cottage on their retired Christmas Tree farm. The garden room was too die for and her homemade muffins were a fantastic touch. 10/10 would go back to relax there and experience it all over again"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is just what you need it to be if you’re traveling to southern Indiana. Jan is an excellent host - good walk-through of everything when you arrive, available to answer questions (super promptly), did a bonus cookie delivery, but was otherwise quite hands-off. Like great restaurant service... magically there when you need them, leaves you alone when you don’t.
The only thing I missed was a closet or some drawers (it’s just a luggage rack situation at time of writing).
The farm cats are cute, the garden house is magical, the walk around grounds is nice and not strenuous.
This place is not fancy. But it’s 5 stars because it’s exactly as described, really clean, adorable, and comes with the best host."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem. The walking trail around the property is wonderful. The cottage had everything we needed. The garden house and surrounding gardens were delightful. We enjoyed stepping out to see meteor showers in night skies. The faux fireplace added delight to the evening's relaxation.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing experience-- you won't be disappointed! Jan is a wonderful host, suggesting great local tips and was even sweet enough to offer to do crafts with us on a rain day. The space is perfect with lovely touches and a beautiful bath and kitchen. The outdoor space was probably the greatest highlight for us. We loved walking around the blueberry patches and sitting in the AMAZING sun room. Oh, and don't forget the wonderful company of the barn kitties! Sitting on the porch in rocking chairs with the sweet kitties for entertainment was just what we were after. The entire property is so peaceful and quiet. The perfect retreat!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This space provided for a lovely, rejuvenating, cozy, beautiful weekend. The farm and the property blew us away, as did all the beautiful scenery and hiking trails in southern Indiana. Jan and Michael were outstanding hosts, and they provided many sweet touches to make us feel welcome. This was one of the best Air Bnb experiences I have ever had."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! The beautiful secluded property of a once operated christmas tree farm converted into this stay is cozy and thoughtful. Jan is a great host that mase sure we had rverything we needed.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike are great hosts and are genuinely committed to provide their guests with a nice experience! The pine tree cottage is beautiful and perfect for a romantic getaway. We loved picking fresh blueberries from their farm right outside the cottage! They also shared many handy tips on things to do (and avoid) in the area. In all, we would absolutely rate it more than 5 starts if possible :)"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at during my time using this service. The Airbnb is a separate building on location that feels separate from the entire farm next to a beautiful outdoor eating area, a fire pit, and rows of blueberry plants that you can pick fresh blueberries in the morning.
Inside the area is a nice large open space with all the amenities and more including a breakfast bar with cinnamon rolls and fresh blueberry muffins as well as other assorted snacks. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern.
The location is near spring mill state park which is easily a two day adventure there as well as blue spring caverns which is an underground cave river that is truly a unique experience.
Finally, the hosts were hospitable and helpful and ready to provide any needs necessary. The conversation was nice when checking in and checking out and felt like if I needed anything they would do their best to help.
Highly recommend!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great hospitality, quiet and secluded. Very peaceful, great bed, wonderful shower. You feel right at home. Comfortable living. Wish I could stay longer."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was outstandingly amazing. If you like waking up to a beautiful surreal view this is a place for you. The host is so sweet and puts so much care into making sure you feel at home and all your needs are met. The value of the place is amazing. 5 stars isn't enough, if I could give 50 stars that would be a start."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, close to highway 50, clean and beautiful views."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage is tucked away and very private. I loved seeing the sunset over the tree farm and barn in the morning. The bathroom is updated-- I loved the shower! Only 5 mins away from the town, so perfect distance to have some peace and quiet. Jan is super kind and easy to work with. This cottage was very clean and perfect for work trip stay or romantic weekend."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most cozy air bnb I’ve ever seen. Jan’s extra special touches, make you feel right at home when you walk in the door! It’s quiet and private, and a wonderful place to get away!"

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A setting right out of a ‘Hallmark’ movie, this sweet cabin nestled on a retired Christmas tree farm is run by a sweet woman with attention to detail. Meticulously clean and delightfully quiet, Woodcrest Farm is the perfect get away. The owner provided home made banana bread and cinnamon rolls on a breakfast bar complete with coffee, tea, hot chocolate and apple cider. Snacks, fruit, wine and chocolates also available to enjoy in front of the fire place or after a shower complete with a heater. Surrounded by white pine, spruce, and cedar trees you can enjoy the acreage and return in June for ‘pick your own blueberries’ from the more than 200 blueberry bushes. This is the perfect couple destination anytime of the year."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and relax. The property is beautiful and the house is almost a dream in how wonderful it is. If you want a weekend get away or just a nice place to stay I can't stress this enough this place is where you want to go. The near by town of Bedford is a great small town. Also I would recommend the breakfast bar it's amazing.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Pine Tree Cottage was great! The extra thoughtful touches of water, coffee, snacks, and mini breakfast bar were greatly appreciated. The location was so peaceful and quiet and the cottage was cozy and warm on a chilly fall night. It is really close to Bedford so amenities were not far at all and also not a long drive to hiking trails. I would highly recommend a stay here !

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Pine Cottage was so welcoming, comfortable and cozy you almost don’t want to leave. Sitting on the front porch was as peaceful as it gets.
Jan goes the extra mile to see to the details a guest might need while traveling. The assortment of snacks and goodies were delicious.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jan's place exceeded our expectations! It was clean, well maintained and nestled between blueberry bushes, evergreens, and a beautiful garden. It's conveniently located just a few miles out of town and close to numerous attractions, such as Hoosier National Forest, Bluespring Caverns, and Spring Mill. Jan left us breakfast and enough snacks to keep us energized while we explored the area. She was available if we needed anything but gave us plenty of privacy. I will definitely keep Woodcrest Farm in mind the next time we need a break from our routine!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan was a wonderful and pleasant host. She was very thoughtful in putting together this cottage for guests. The land and cottage were beautiful. I cannot wait to have another little getaway there. Thank you for everything Jan. 😊

The Garden House was a delightful bonus where I enjoyed some quiet time on my own. We hope to return again in the future."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can not say enough about this cute cottage. It was exceptionally clean and decorated so nice. Perfect for a couple. The surroundings are peaceful. It is located a quick little drive from Bedford. We enjoyed motorcycle riding around the Hoosier National Park down to the Ohio River and up to Brown County. The owners are sweet and very accommodating. They know the area very well and have great suggestions. They also have a 2 bedroom home next to the cottage that can also be rented. This would be good for families traveling with grandparents that need a break from the kiddos. My husband and I loved everything! We highly recommend staying here!

2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Jan’s cottage, was an unexpected treasure. When we arrived we were immediately drawn to the porch with two rockers, which faced a lovely garden room about 200 feet away, with a beautiful chandelier and comfy sitting area. It was very “Martha Stewarty”. Inside our cottage, there were twinkle lights all around the room, flickering candles, an abundance of pillows and throws, a breakfast nook with fruit, fresh pastries, cereal and coffee. Just a few steps away from our cottage we’re rows and rows of blueberry bushes. It was such a treat to be able to pick a few fresh blueberries and enjoy them in our cereal the next morning! Everything was exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the bathroom/shower was perfect. While we spent much of our time sitting on the porch enjoying the company of their sweet farm cats, we especially enjoyed our conversations with Jan and Mike. They were very accommodating and treated us like old friends instead of guest. We would recommend Jans cottage to anyone who enjoys being surrounded by natural beauty, the smell of pine trees and serenity. Thanks so much, Jan and Mike, we look forward to our next visit!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jan and Mike were great hosts. They made us feel welcome when we arrived. The farm is peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed exploring the property and picking some blueberries. Town is a quick drive and we explored hiking trails nearby as well.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan and Mike are the best. We were in the area for a wedding. My husband left his coat and tie at home. Luckily Steve and Mike were almost the same size. Thanks for the loaner. The cabin and is beautiful. I want to come back when we can just stay at the farm! Looking for a quiet get away? This is your place!

The pictures don't do it justice. The completely fenced in yard was much larger than expected and our 2 city dogs loved playing ball and just running and roaming. We swam every single day of our stay and loved watching the sunsets each night. The firepit was great for our hotdogs and smores night. The Pavillion was great to relax or just to get out of the sun. There were so many personal touches to this place that really made our stay fantastic and wanting to come back again. Heidi and her husband were great hosts and were very friendly. They met us at the property to make sure we were comfortable with everything. Thank you for an amazing vacation with our 2 sons and 2 dogs before everyone goes back to school.

Check-in was seamless - we got the code in advance and had zero issues getting in. The house was spotless upon arrival and everything we needed was in place as advertised.
The view is spectacular and the neighborhood is awesome. Beautiful sunrise and sunset views.
One of the neighbors was having a party on one of the nights of our visit. Kelsey gave us a heads up - which was much appreciated. It was relaxing and fun to hear the music and see their fireworks. Obviously, that’s not something every guest should expect to experience, but we enjoyed it.
The AC worked great as did all of the appliances and utilities. The beds were super comfortable.
Thanks again to Kelsey for hosting and for being so responsive."

Great place, even better people!
Thank you all for the last 13 weeks."

The full kitchen, nothing was needed, condiments, kitchen utensils, pots and pans, cutlery.
The house is cozy, nice, impeccable cleanliness, the area where it is located has a wonderful atmosphere, lots of green area!!
This is Bloomington, just 20 kilometers away. It's a very healthy area between Bloomington and Bedford.
We went to both cities, we bought both cities and people very but very friendly and respectful.
I leave it in two words:
BETTER, IMPOSSIBLE."

We were quite comfortable- just like it was our own place. The driveway was cleaned off and we appreciated the concern for our safety during the bad weather. Great place- Awesome Host- Thank you Jan."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a terrific stay! We appreciated how gracious and welcoming you were. Pleasantview Lodge was well appointed and comfortable. We loved walking the perimeter of the larger property. The bird song and gorgeous bare winter Sycamore trees are great memories. We loved the kitchen, too, where my family always ends up, with lots of cooking and everything we needed to do it. Thanks again for being such considerate hosts!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here before and was as accommodating and clean as the first time we stayed. Jan is a great host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful people, a wonderful comfortable place to stay, you won't regret it."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and Mike were excellent! The place was spacious, comfortable, and plenty accommodating. We felt right at home and wish we could have stayed longer! Next time we are in town we will be looking here."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan’s place is a fantastic place to stay. The house is very much a B&B and Jan provides many more accommodations (specifically in the kitchen) than typical Airbnbs. Jan is incredibly inviting, kind, and hospitable. We will absolutely stay here again when we are in the area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! Best ever!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely the most amazing place. Beautiful serene setting with rolling hills. Jan welcomed us with the most contagious smile as she showed us around in her beautiful home. You lack nothing, she thinks of everything. This is a 10 star review."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! If you’re ever in Bloomington or the surrounding area, or just looking for a get away location, this is the best possible place to stay. Jan was an amazing host and the house is simply beautiful. We will definitely be returning."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There are so many amazing things to list about our stay. A great place to stay with so many extras provided that we haven't seen any where eles. Jan and Mike were great to us and we are already planning a return visit.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is absolutely a 10 out of 10 host, location, and residence. Our second stay here was as fantastic as our first. This trip we had an elderly parent with us, and he found the house very easy and accomodating. Our hosts were, as usual, very attentive and helpful while maintaining the visitors privacy. We recommend this stay hands-down! Close enough to town for convenience yet it is private and in the country. Star gazing - bird watching - deer on the lawn - nice peaceful surroundings. We believe you will not be disappointed!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,would stay again
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan and her husband Mike were the best bnb hosts we’ve ever had. Relaxed, down to earth, and super friendly. The home is lovely and well equipped and the location amazingly beautiful. We spent so much of our stay on the front porch enjoying the view and sounds of nature around us, rolling hills, towering trees, beatiful bird and other wildlife. We had a doe and 2 fawns gamboling on the hills in front of the house on our last day there, so much fun. A wonderful rural location with Bedford just 15 minutes away.
Our family was there for a funeral and Jan was so kind and considerate, making a tough time that much easier to bear."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and welcoming host on beautiful land. We enjoyed every night here!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jan is so wonderful and sweet. The house was beautiful the property was amazing. We didn’t want to leave.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A real five-star experience, the hosts are organized, helpful, very communicative, and just provide the absolutely best stay we have ever had.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jan has a true gift for hospitality. The space is wonderful, and Jan made it extra special with her thoughtful touches and great communication. Truly a 5 star experience and a wonderful property."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our visit to a very clean and well appointed home. The owner provided many extras that we very much appreciated and put to good use during our stay. The home was decorated tastefully for the Christmas Holiday. We found plenty of room to entertain our family while we were there. Having a garage to park in was great! Country life is something we aren't normally used to, but it was so nice and quiet out there. The farm provides some opportunities to explore, which we hope to on our next visit. Overall, the stay was very pleasant. The owners just simply are very accommodating in every way, and we appreciated it."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan is so accommodating. We needed a few extra items during our stay, and they were provided quickly. Our stay was wonderful. We took a walk around the property, and it was so relaxing."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won't go wrong staying here, its so clean and new with the best of everything. And Jan and Mike make it extra special."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away from the noise and the lights of the city, this is the perfect place to be. The farm is tranquil and a beautiful setting. Jan and Mike allow you to walk around their entire property and even let us pick veggies from their garden to add to our meals. You will be greeted with warm hospitality and welcomed with fresh baked goods and so many amenities. The accommodations are lovely, the front porch so inviting with a wonderful, peaceful view. You will be ""off the beaten path"" but not far from shopping, sights and places to eat. This is a wonderful place to relax. At the hosts' recommendation, we took a short drive to Spring Mill State Park which offered beautiful fall colors of old growth trees. Thank you, Jan and Mike!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Not far from Bloomington and downtown Bedford is very cute!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We recommend the house, place and Host.
They go out of their way, in order to make you feel at home.
The house is beautiful, has everything that you need and more.
Jan & Mike are very nice, they make you feel at home."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rowena is an awesome host. Very friendly and a great cook! Makes you feel right at home. We stayed for our son's graduation from Indiana University and she was very accommodating with our schedule. Her breakfasts are fantastic and she just a delight to converse with. Her home is beautiful. You don't want to miss out on staying here!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena is an amazing host!
My husband and I were in town for one night and we made the perfect choice when we booked with Rowena. The home is beautiful and full of history. The attached jail is like physically walking through a door back in time. The food was delicious. Within walking distance to The Rusty Gator restaurant (as well as other bars and restaurants) where we met some great locals. If you get the chance I highly recommend visiting Bedford, Indiana and staying with Rowena is a MUST :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Bedford for three nights for the eclipse and Rowena’s place was the perfect place for us. The sunny turret room was great, the included breakfasts were a wonderful start to the day, and Rowena was very warm and welcoming. We spent time relaxing on both the front porch and in the sitting room. Although Bedford is not a city we would have chosen to visit under regular circumstances, it became the perfect place for us to hang out and we even decided to view the eclipse from right there to avoid big crowds closer to the center of the path. Rowena opened up the gate to the vacant lot next door, which gave us the perfect view. We followed her tips on where to go on the free day before the eclipse and had a wonderful time and she even showed us around the jail attached to the B & B, which was fascinating. Rowena was the perfect host and her place added tremendously to our wonderful eclipse weekend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came in for a caving trip! Was delighted to have had breakfast included! Will definitely be back! The room I stayed was near a street, some cars with loud mufflers going by, might need ear plugs. Bed was comfy, Rowena also had all the little extras like snacks and waters and drinks too!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely outstanding place & host! Truly FUN and eclectic mix of the Host’s international travel and local history, being in a historic residence. The pics are only a taste of the fabulous B&B - location is downtown and super convenient, the history is fascinating (ask Rowena for The Sheriff’s House Jail Tour!), and the breakfast was tailored to our requests and over the top! Easy access, comfie bed and so much more than the pics show - our bathroom floor was even heated. Absolutely will stay there again when in the area - Loved It! :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena has a great place with a great history. The room and bathroom were squeaky clean as was her house and the common area. I definitely would stay here again if needed. Thanks Rowena!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a tough day at work, all I want is peace and quiet. This is the place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena was a friendly host and we enjoyed stay. She happily accomodated our schedule and prepared a delicious breakfast both mornings. Everything was spotless and tidy. It was incredibly reasonable for an IU graduation weekend and was an easy 30 minute commute. While we won't have cause to return to IU any longer with our daughter graduating, I would give 2 thumbs up for anyone looking to stay in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Once again, a peaceful and quiet place to stay after a long day at work. I would highly recommend this."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Quiet and peaceful. Just perfect after a hard day at work. I so appreciate the time and effort she has obviously put into this place. Hands down a place I will return to.

Great place with lots of history and charm."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena's accomodations are fun and interesting. If you love history, antiques, artwork, clean rooms, a safe enviornment and great coffee, you will be very happy that you stayed here. My mother is in the nursing home in Bedford, Indiana and staying at Rowena's is a nice distraction from the stress and sadness of visting my mom. My sister and I always look forward to our vists to see our mom and to stay in this beautiful and fun place. Rowena and her husband do a great job hosting their guests."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's always great staying here when we visit Indiana. Rowena is super friendly, and her breakfasts are always delicious. We will definitely be staying here next time."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute wonderful stay. Rowena was extremely responsive and always got back within minutes. The breakfasts were delicious and she always checked the menu with us the night before in case we had a concern about anything being served.
The location was unique and fun, which made for an interesting stay.
This was a MUCH better experience than staying at a similarly priced hotel. I will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay! The home was comfortable, interesting, and welcoming. Everything matched the description well. I highly recommend visiting and definitely recommend getting a tour of the jail. 😊"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Exceeded our expectations…communication, amenities, breakfast and interactions with our hosts/historical bldg were incredibly enjoyable and much appreciated!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Massively undervalued.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another fantastic stay with Reza & Rowena. They are perfect hosts and took the time to make me feel welcome and safe. I stay in the Tower Room every time. The bed and bedding are very comfortable and the room is impeccably clean. The bathroom is roomy and has its own heating vent, a lot of outlets and a big window for natural light and also great lighting above the sink. The location is close to the square and surrounded by tons of history. If you are looking for a cozy, historical and easy going place to stay while you are in Bedford, then I’m sure you will enjoy Reza & Rowena’s limestone residence and their relaxing front porch. I give it a 10 out of 10."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would rather stay in this tower than at any of the hotels! I got in a little late and Rowena was ready and waiting for me when I arrived!! I stayed in the tower room which has its own bathroom. Bed was comfortable! Rowena prepares a great breakfast! I was the only one who stayed a few nights ago and she worked around my morning schedule and made me eggs, bacon, fresh homemade blueberry muffins, fresh fruit cut up, delicious coffee, juice, and water!!!! It was a delicious spread of food!!! I highly recommend this historical place to stay!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rowena is a great hostess. The Sherrifs house is a very neat place to stay. Breakfast was excellent! Great place to stay! Don’t miss the jail tour!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"While looking for a place to stay for my class reunion, I came across this listing. As someone who grew up in Bedford I was intrigued by the fact that the former county jail was now a B&B. I knew right away this was the place for my husband & I as we are both retired law enforcement. Rowena was an exceptional hostess, greeting us at the door and immediately making us feel welcome. Our room, with an en suite, was on the second floor in the tower. There was a small refrigerator and coffee station located outside of our room. The rooms were tastefully decorated and clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Rowena communicated with us regarding our likes and dislikes for breakfast and had it on the table at the agreed upon time. After breakfast she gave us a tour of the old jail.
The house is located close to the Bedford square, food and shopping. Thank you Rowena for opening your home to us."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena is the hostess of all hostesses. She is very quick to respond and so accommodating. We enjoyed our visit at the castle with her! Breakfast was amazing. We enjoyed learning some the history and tour of the jail. Don’t wait! Book it now! We would definitely stay there again!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a total gem. The room is wonderful and had everything I needed. The bed was so comfortable I was shocked at how well I slept. I have food allergies and our host was able to make the most amazing GF / DF breakfasts. Every day was a different meal. What a fabulous cook. We took a tour of the old Jail and learned some old Bedford history that made it come alive. As long as our host is taking guests I will never stay anywhere else while in the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the best Airbnb. The architecture was fun, complete with a turret and a coat of arms. The host is kind and thoughtful. The breakfast was the best on the trip. The room was immaculate. Definitely recommend."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena is Amazing. Great host, clean house, quiet and safe. The food and the Atmosphere were undescribable. I would give 10 stars if I could."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible stay!! Rowena is so gracious and kind. I loved the tower room—adorable and comfortable. Loved every minute of my stay. Rowena is an amazing cook! She made me vegetarian gluten-free food daily and it was absolutely delicious. It was like having a private chef! I truly felt welcome and like a princess. Would absolutely stay here again!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I slept here last night. I had helped Larson move into an apartment at IU. It’s a B&B in Bedford Indiana. It was the county jail in 1857, originally brick, stone was added in 1901. Breakfast was made to order. Eggs with mushroom and coby cheese, (five options of cheese) 6 slices of thick cut bacon, blueberry muffins, freshly sliced fruit in a b bowl (Strawberries, pineapple, kiwi and grapes) orange juice, coffee, and water.
Leslie Shamblin Parkerand I are already planning a weekend there sometime when it’s cooler.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We've stayed here before and certainly will again. I wish we had restaurants which could provide a pampering breakfast as good as Rowena's.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great stay. What a fun place to call it a night after a long drive. Wonderful hosts with such an interesting home. Very accommodating and went out of the way to make my stay comfortable. Surprised with breakfast in the morning. Clean and spacious room and bathroom. access to the living room/piano/TV. I even got a behind the scenes tour or the jail section of the building. I would recommend this place for those who like historic buildings and a little something different, off the beaten path. You will not be disappointed."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Breakfast is amazing, the host is a great cook and will make a great meal for you.
The house is quirky, low ceiling at staircase, full of oddities and stories!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena is a wonderful hostess. This will be our first place to check availability for future visits to Bedford to visit family. Not only does the home have wonderful character and deep history, Rowena provides wonderful breakfasts and hospitality."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place to stay in. The breakfast set up is super fancy and beautiful. The breakfast itself is just absolutely delicious!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena is fabulous, the room and home was spotless, cozy and welcoming. The bed was super comfy and bathroom floors were heated which was nice in the cooler months. Her breakfast was spectacular and we even had seconds. Location was convenient and I would definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena is such a welcoming host. This place is more a B&B than a typical Airbnb stay, the jailhouse is a unique place to stay, and she was so kind to both pick me up from my bus and drive me to my next stop due to a lack of public transportation. Would go out of my way to stay here again next time I’m in downstate Indiana."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena is a wonderful host! If you are in the area you will not be sorry if you choose to be her guest. She goes the extra mile to make you feel special. The room is spotless- and so is the attached bathroom. She will treat you to coffee brought to your room in the morning and a tour of the jail!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Just an amazing stay in every conceivable way and I only wish I'd been able to stay longer. The room was spotless and the vegan breakfast Rowena prepared for me was incredible. Bonus points for the tour of the old jail full of folkloric tidbits and historic anecdotes. A perfect destination for history wonks intrigued by the weird and the macabre.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in the tower room. It was a very clean and spacious room. Breakfast the next morning was delicious! It was nice chatting with the other guest during breakfast as well.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! My husband and I were looking for a place to stay near the Bedford area as it was centrally located to all the state parks and forests we wanted to hike. I came across this Airbnb and thought it looked like a neat place to stay (who doesn't love a tower room?!). I am so glad we found it! Rowena and her Tower Room helped make our 7th anniversary trip extra special. The home-cooked and hot breakfasts were delicious and something we looked forward to each morning. They also kept us full until dinner time, allowing us to spend more time on the trails. The room was cozy and clean and we spent a happy afternoon there on the one rainy day we had, reading and resting. Rowena was an excellent communicator and made us feel at home from the start. We stayed Monday through Friday and wished it was for longer!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was probably our fifth stay at Rowena’s home over the last 6 years. She is an amazing host and the home is always clean and cozy. We love to visit and catch up with Rowena when we sit down for her warm, homemade breakfasts! Her place is only 25 minutes south of campus, never any game day traffic driving into B-town. A hidden gem! Thank you again Rowena!
Kert & Karrin"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was short but the service was perfect. Rowena was easy to contact and offers an outstanding breakfast served with such kindness. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. We were able to hear the history and see some of the old jail which was intriguing. We would recommend this place 100%. It is right next to many downtown shops and more.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful weekend stay! The room was very comfortable and clean. Best breakfast I’ve had in a long time!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable room, charming hostess, and wonderful breakfast."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an outstanding experience. The location is one of a kind in itself. Rowena did not miss anything. She uses up to date things such a lighting convenience (automatic lights) to help guests Thanks so much. You are a jewel.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,You will love it.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed five (5) nights in the Tower Room and I would have stayed longer if I did not have to get back to work. The room is bright and cheery. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is bright and new. The entire home is spotless. From the time you ascend the stairs on the street level and walk across the sidewalk to the front porch you feel like you are in a special place. This is confirmed when you enter the residence and see the beautiful old staircase that leads to the Tower Room. The location is a short walk to the town square with fun shops, restaurants and the Lawrence Count Museum of History. http://lawrencecountyhistory.org/ If you appreciate historic buildings then this is the place for you.
Rowena and her husband Reza are very interesting to talk to and their presence brings an added sense of security as they live onsite. They offer breakfast in a classic dining room or you can have a pot of coffee delivered to your room on a beautiful tray with antique cup, saucer, creamer and cookies. Very classy and a very fun experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you love historic places you will love this place.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena is a gracious and accommodating host that allowed me to arrive late. Nice clean room and excellent breakfast. Perfect stay.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect, clean, welcoming bnb:) Rowena was so accomadating and made the best brunch ever!! Thanks for such a nice getaway!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister & her husband stayed here & this is what they said:
Very pleasant host. She was very accommodating with changing meals for my picky husband and my health issues.
She shared the history of the house and let us tour the jails.
My husband was thrilled. He worked as a jailer in the military.
I had reserved the place for them.
My husband & I were also invited for breakfast & the food was delicious. Rowena made you feel like you were at home as soon as she met you.
I would highly recommend Rowena & her place to stay.
Shirley Layo"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,If you want to feel like royalty while visiting Bedford Indiana look no further. Rowena met us at the door of the castle with kindness and excitement. We had a wonderfully restful stay in a historic home. This place has been updated in the right places while still having the charm of an older structure. The breakfast was great and the entire home was very clean. We loved the use of art from different cultures around the world.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here. Top notch food and perfect hospitality, a lovely room and bathroom. The bed was really comfortable too! I love this place!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot sing high enough praises for Rowena and her place. My room was spotless and contained unexpected toiletry items that I ended up needing. The breakfasts were AMAZING and much better than any restaurant could provide. I mentioned to her that she should publish her cookbook, it was all so yummy! My daughter and I had the most pleasant experience and look forward to another stay in the future :) Hands down, the best Airbnb I've stayed in to date!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable room. Bathroom is spacious and immaculate. Lovely hostess. Highly recommend for your stay.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rowena’s place is PERFECT and she is a spectacular hostess. The room was spotless and very spacious. The morning conversations and breakfast rivaled everything else as the best part of our short trip to Bedford.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The host set up an extra bed for us; a real bed! We'd like to come again some time. Quite a posh breakfast .. delicious. Lovely house.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The special attraction for us was that it is part of the old Lawrence County sheriff’s residence, adjacent to the original jail. During the 1870s several characters from my book (“The Terror of Indiana: Bent Jones & The Moody-Tolliver Feud”) were frequent guests. The host, both career U.S. Foreign Service workers, have done a magnificent job of restoring the home. The Tower Room is larger than it appears in some photos and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Most of all, their hospitality can’t be outmatched. Karen and I look forward to future visits."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great as always. 2nd time visiting in two months. I would definitely recommend making this a stop in your travels!
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stay couldn’t have gone better. Rowena was very welcoming and the place reached beyond expectations. Room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast the next morning was excellent.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena is a very charming host and an incredible cook! The Sheriff’s house and Inn is indeed her passion. The Amish made mattress is quite comfy, we slept very well.

The whole house was clean and kept up, the breakfast was delicious.
Highly recommend and would stay again!
Also, make sure you say hi to Mr. Fuzz when you first get there, he’ll probably be waiting for you on the porch."

The house was spotless and comfortable, exactly what we were expecting. She went out of her way to prepare individual delicious breakfasts, from scratch, which we of course did not expect! And she was absolutely lovely about it. A delightful and charming woman with great conversation and a lovely home. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Thanks!"

The room was spotless and the private bathroom was a plus. The tour of the old jail behind the house was a great end to a relaxing weekend getaway. We would definitely stay with Rowena again!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena was awesome! Room was great! Breakfast great! We were in town for a wedding and this was the best lodging in town! We loved touring the jail and hearing all the stories! Rowena has a passion for history and travel. She was a great source of information on the surrounding area and gave us wonderful ideas on things to do! She is the hostess with the mostest!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena is a such a delightful host!! She cooked us the most amazing and extravagant breakfast! We felt so spoiled. We are both gluten free and I am lactose intolerant and she went out of her way to bake us gluten free/dairy free muffins. So sweet!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Really a joy to stay here. Respectful and personal. Architecture very interesting and comfortable. Loved the breakfasts, a different experience each morning. However Rowena and Reza will accomodate whatever your taste. If you have time, recommend getting to know your hosts. Very welcoming, interesting, and enlightening conversation. Already, booked another stay. Highly recommend."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay. I felt like I was coming back to visit a friend. Rowena gave me a tour of the old jail which was so interesting. She goes the extra mile to make her guest feel welcome. Thank you so much.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had such an enjoyable stay. Rowena is an excellent host. The house is beautiful, clean and historic. This is a great place to stay in bBedford."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a unique experience. The residence is beautiful. The hosts are welcoming. Breakfast was wonderful. Highly recommended if you find yourself in Bedford.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena is a great cook with the most pleasant personality. This is the most comfortable BnB I have ever stayed in. You will appreciate all the little extras, she has thought of everything. You even get a historical tour. Couldn't have asked for more. I will be looking forward to staying here next year."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay. Excellent rooms, excellent host, food was fabulous."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena's welcomed us and made us feel comfortable! Everything was excellent and as described. She had drinks, water and snacks available and her breakfast was incredible and delicious..fresh fruit cup, OJ, homemade blueberry muffins, egg casserole and hot coffee! She graciously gave us a tour of the jail. Bed comfortabke and her home was fun to stay in; and if we go through this area again, would look tonstsy here! A great Airbnb host!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This airbnb option is a very rewarding experience. Hostess Rowena is highly intelligent, very personable, & a creative, accomplished preparer of bountiful, original breakfasts made with very fresh ingredients.
The rooms are very nice & afford plenty of room w/private baths. The former Sheriff's residence w/the attached former jail is just full of character & kept very clean & furnished w/interesting aesthetically pleasing furniture.
Although we live a couple thousand miles away from Bedford we're already looking forward to another stay @ Rowena's B&B & more touring in the scenic Hoosier Hills."
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena is a courteous host with a great place to share. Glad we stayed at the ""jail""."
2017-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool, quirky place to stay in a small town!! We loved the local history of the place and it's central location as well as the original antique architecture along with the modern amenities (like heated tile floors in the bathroom of our turret room!). The breakfast was a delicious spread and we loved getting the personal tour of the kitchen and jailhouse too! Rowena was so pleasant and accommodating. I'd suggest this to anyone wanting an unusual, but very comfortable place to stay when visiting Bedford!"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host was perfect breakfast was better than a 5 star hotel.
We attended a football game in Bloomington ( 20 minutes from Bedford ) easy drive.
I would definitely stay here again and again loved the hostility, stay here you will not regret it!!!!!!!"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was like visiting family! She was so welcoming and made my husband and son feel very comfortable. With a freshman at IU, she will be seeing much more of us over the next 4 years! So grateful to have found her."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tower room was a charming and very comfortable room and Rowena was an outstanding host. She was very accommodating, the breakfasts were outstanding and she even packed a ""to go"" breakfast for me to take to my son who is a freshman at IU. We had interesting conversations and she told me about a tucked away hiking trail, which was fun to find."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. She supplied much more than we expected and was a gracious hostess. The breakfast was so good and filling it kept us most of the day. We loved hearing about the history of the place. It was close to where we were going and there are stores close by also. We will stay again if we are in the area again. The bedroom was a good size and the bath was up to date. Really enjoyed our stay! Vicki
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena was absolutely the most welcoming, warm, and gracious host. She communicated well all throughout. The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. And what a unique experience to be staying in this historic building! Just wait until Rowena gives you the tour of the jail! But to top it all off is her cooking. I'd come back just for her breakfasts! I couldn't recommend this place any more to anyone that needs/wants to be in the area. A wonderful experience all throughout!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay in this unique ""castle"". Everything was squeaky clean and well kept. Little personal touches such as the handmade soap in the en suite bath, a basket of snacks and cold drinks and water in the personal fridge made us feel welcome and spoiled. Our hostess has traveled the world but she came back to her hometown roots with her family to rescue and restore a beautiful piece of local history. We really enjoyed learning more about the area. She's a good cook too! Breakfast was delish!"
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oh my, what an amazing place to stay!
Rowena was amazing I got a tour of the old jail a recommendation for BBQ a wonderful room and a 5 star breakfast. Plus a few stories about the house and her time in the foreign service.
I wish I had more time to stay! If you are near Bedford it's the place to stay."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena was a perfect hostess! The place was incredible, our room was clean and comfortable, and the food was so delicious! That quiche! She took us on a tour of the old jail and shared some of its history with us. If we ever find ourselves in the Bedford area again, we will definitely be calling Rowena!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rowena was a great host, graciously accommodating our son's wedding party of ten--in two guest rooms. The tour of the jail gave our son and his groomsmen a pre-wedding night they will always remember."
2016-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Rowena was such a great host! She made an amazing breakfast and gave my wife and I a tour of the old jail house in the morning. The room that we stayed in was much nicer than we expected and staying in a castle was just awesome. There is a lot of very cool art in her house and she will you about it if you ask. She was waiting for us at the door when we got there and was very welcoming. The experience/place was even better than we expected and we loved staying there. The neighborhood does not have much going on. We stayed there on a Sunday night and the whole town is pretty much shut down on Sunday.
2015-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Neighborhood was definitely city and initially confusing with one way streets. Views from windows were blah But the jail bars on window were cool. Loved the room. Loved Rowena. Wish we had more time to sit and talk about her travels and adventures. Wish we had more time for tour of house but our schedule was tight. Next time we will allow more down time. Bloomington was full up with Michigan game so although out of Bloomington situation was great for us. Everything pristine clean and welcoming. Very accomodating with our schedule.
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast was excellent! The room was very clean and spacious! It was very comfortable and cozy! Thank you sooooooo much!
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rowena called me when I was late arriving ( due to an extended Airline delay) This small gesture was appreciated and representative of the overall Bedford, Indiana hospitality!"
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have enjoyed B&B's all over the country. This particular one is full of character, history and a charming host.
What made this a unique experience for me was the high quality, home made food.
My wife and I agreed (this doesn't happen often) that it was a great bed and a great night sleep.
Rowena was happy to show us around the now empty jail cells of the past as well as the sheriffs home they now occupy. She is a most interesting person and enjoyed her company.
2 thumbs up!"
2015-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great accommodations! Spacious, clean room and updated bathroom equipped with all the supplies we needed. Breakfast served in formal dinning room in the morning was fabulous - much more than I ever expected - juice, coffee, quiche, hot blueberry muffins, large fruit dish, etc… Rowena has a very pleasant personality and was a great hostess! Bedford pleasantly surprised us - we were expecting a small community with limited businesses and found that a number of well-known businesses are along the main road entering the city.

We stayed here as we were attending the graduation of our daughter at Indiana University - Bloomington. Price was RIGHT! Would have been double or triple the price in Bloomington. Drive to/from IU campus about 30 minutes."
2015-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I purchased this as a gift for my son and his wife. They agreed, it was a wonderful time.
Rowena was an absolutely wonderful hostess. They loved the bed, all the extras like special soaps, a stocked fridge, coffee, hot chocolate and snacks. I heard the breakfasts were incredible.
Rowena even made what my son said were the best gluten free corn muffins he has ever had, and the rest of the breakfast was amazing.
They thanked me for choosing this Air BnB spot and told me there was nowhere else they would rsther be than in Bedford with Rowena.
I think I may just have to go myself!"
2015-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found Rowena's listing when looking for a place to stay on our way through the area. She warmly welcomed us into her beautiful, historic home upon our arrival. There was hot drinks & snacks waiting for us that night, right outside of our tower room. The room and adjoining bathroom were exceptionally well-decorated, clean, and cozy with a very comfortable bed and down comforter. We enjoyed a FULL breakfast the next morning - breakfast casserole, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee, and juice - which was fantastic as well. After breakfast, Rowena graciously indulged our curiosity about the home's history, giving us a tour of the house and adjoining former county jail. We were thrilled to see what she and her husband have already restored in the home, and hear of her plans for the future. Overall, it was an exceptional visit in an equally unique home. We definitely hope to return, and highly recommend this place for those looking to stay overnight in the Bedford/Bloomington area. Thank you, Rowena!"
2015-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Rowena's home, which should speak for how much we enjoy it there. Just as the time before, our entire stay was excellent! She & her husband prepared us another delicious breakfast, while catering to our dietary needs. We stayed very cozy & warm there during a frigid snowy weekend. Can't wait to visit again in the future! Thanks Rowena!"
2015-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Rowena's Midwestern castle during a weekend getaway in January 2015. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better hostess. She was very accommodating without intruding in our weekend plans. She greeted us with a warm welcome and showed us to our very spacious room with attached bathroom. We were pleased with the drinks and the snacks made available to us in the mini refrigerator next to our room. We had access to the living room and used the space to watch a movie before going to bed. We enjoyed so much about this B&B but our favorite part of the trip included getting a tour of the old jail that is attached to the house. Learning the history of the house and the jail proved to be very interesting and Rowena was happy to share her knowledge on the place. The tour was great! She also let us explore her home and we were able to climb the ladder to the top of the tower. Her house and the view of Bedford from the tower are beautiful, and I suggest to request a tour of her home. Also, we LOVED the breakfast that was served. She catered to our dietary needs and fixed a vegetarian breakfast that we are still talking about a week later. It was delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone (and already have to a few people). The location is perfect for a quick trip to Bloomington, IN. We plan to visit again soon since we visit the area often. Our stay there was lovely."
2014-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Rowena's B&B while visiting our daughter at IU Bloomington. We were welcomed with a friendly smile and the smell of homemade brownies, fresh out of the oven. We were given a tour of her beautiful home and then shown to our room on the second level. The room was plenty spacious with a large closet, dresser, and cozy desk and chair. We were also impressed to find a binder with all of the information and history of the home, that goes back to the late 1800's. After a freezing day outside tailgating, we were thrilled to change into our warm, cozy sweats, and enjoy college football on her large flatscreen tv in the private den on the main level. Rowena had previously asked my husband and I what we preferred for breakfast, which we replied we would be happy with anything. We woke up the next morning to the smell of a wonderful breakfast! Fresh cut fruit bowls, warm, homemade blueberry muffins, yogurt, a wonderful vegetable quiche, orange juice and coffee. Once finished with breakfast, we were given a tour of the Old County Bedford Jail, which is attached to the Old Sherrif's Home. (Rowena's House) We couldn't be more pleased with our decision to stay in Bedford, a quick 35 minute drive south of Bloomkngton, away from the hustle and bustle. We will most definitely be staying in Bedford again, in Rowena's beautiful Midwestern Castle! A home with a wonderful host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful apartment in Downtown Bedford. We immediately felt at home. Everything super clean, friendly furnishings and perfectly equipped.
Communication and check-in was super easy.
Would highly recommend the apartment!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice area, located about 30 minutes from Bloomington. Beautiful space, seemed even larger in person. Super clean and smelled amazing just walking in. Located right above a coffee/pastry shop, perfect for mornings. Although the pad was stocked with coffee & snacks! 10/10 would recommend to anyone needing a place in Bedford or close to Bloomington!!! Host was amazing, super friendly and extremely accommodating."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little apartment was just perfect for our girl’s getaway! White, wide open, and clean, it was so peaceful. The views of the square were lovely. Alison was responsive and helpful. Check in and checkout were smooth and easy. We hope to go back again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an absolutely wonderful stay and Alison is a great host! We have already recommended our family stay when coming into town!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay! Such a cute place!!
