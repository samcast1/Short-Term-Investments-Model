2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in the area to visit family. We really enjoyed our stay! This space felt like a home away from home. Troy provided a perfect description of his home.

It smelled awesome and was incredibly peaceful. It‚Äôs evident that the host takes pride in his listing and is committed to providing the very best experience for his guests. The neighborhood is quiet and close to everything. There‚Äôs a cute patio where you can sit and drink your coffee- the only drawback was those Boston Red Sox and Celtics placards on the fenceü§£."

Troy was one of the most communicative and responsive hosts we've ever stayed with. Definitely made us feel at home with the welcome he provided our group along with helpful suggestions throughout. We even gathered lots of intel on the tournament thanks to his recommendation to go see Byron at the exchange. Without that info we would not have had the same positive experience at the tournament.
100% recommend Troy's home and should we ever be lucky enough to return we'll be booking here."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place! Kept up well, many little bonus things around the house (take and keep and use and leave baskets in bathroom). All switches were labeled well. Easy to keep temperature perfect in the house. Host was responsive but not overly helpful. Asked about local recommendations, he just pointed me to his posting instead of having a conversation. Was paranoid about parties in the house. Message before we arrived to make sure we knew not to have a party and there was postings in the home as well. Some 1/2 used items in the fridge. Good location but a little tricky to get in and out of the neighborhood (easier if no traffic). Overall it was great! Would recommend staying here to others looking for a nice stop along the way. Very nice little house! Thank you!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean place. Just the essentials as far as furniture goes, which is great for kids and pets. Lots of open space in den/family room area and no rugs to worry about staining."
2022-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Five of us were in town for my daughter's graduation from Augusta University, school of nursing. The locations is very convenient to most everything. I would say the area is lower middle class, but was surprisingly quiet, considering the number of tightly packed units and parked cars. Parking is tight, especially if you drive a larger vehicle. There is room for two vehicles, but that is it. The place could have been cleaner, especially the living room floor, it was very dirty and sticky, I have to think Jimmy was not aware, because I can't imagine he would have left it that way. A few other fairly minor things, but the bottomline is that it was priced right and in a seemingly safe area convenient to everything. It suited our needs for our weekend stay. We would definitely stay there again, if the price stays reasonable."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"JoAnn's place is amazing. In town, but you wouldn't know it once you're there. Feels like you're deep in the woods when in fact you're right next to quite a busy thoroughfare.
My drive to JoAnn's place was harrowing at best. Rained for over 7 hrs straight. I realized that despite the rain i was going to arrive early. I really wanted to be off the road so I reached out and JoAnn immediately replied that I could come on over and provided an temp code for me to get inside.
The place itself is fabulous. Bathroom is amazing with seat and rainfall shower. The bed is adjustable which was a very pleasant surprise. The views out are fabulous though i didn't get to sit outside and enjoy due to all the rain.
You cannot go wrong staying here if you're stopping over or staying a few days. There is a small fridge, some snacks and water so keep that in mind. If you desire big meals you will have to go out or bring something to cook in the provided microwave. All in all an A+++ experience."

Joann is an ideal host. She makes you feel welcome from the moment you book, until your departure. We did not meet face-to-face but I felt her hospitality in the way the room was prepared, the clarity of communication, amenities...everything was setup to make me feel right at home.

Still, a thoughtful gesture.
Fast internet and washer/dryer with washing pods were appreciated."

We stayed with our mini poodle, Bailey. Often, when we stay in a pet friendly place, we can tell there were pets there before - but that was not the case here - it was immaculately clean.
One of the highlights for us was feeling tucked away in private retreat while being minutes away to downtown and spaces to explore. We especially enjoyed the parkland seeing some alligators at a park in Augusta.

The cottage was clean, but not pristi√±e.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded, clean, and peaceful cabin. My husband and I were traveling through Augusta and spent two nights at Rob‚Äôs. We initially had planned to stay one night but the cabin was so well appointed and comfortable that we decided to spend another night. Rob agreed to extend at the last minute since it was available. He is very attentive and the place is well kept and is very comfortable. We don‚Äôt have any negative reviews.
The kitchen has nice sized dishes, a clean fridge and dishwasher. The bed is comfy and the shower has good pressure and hot water.
FYI The place is at the end of the road, the gps told us we had arrived but the neighbor told us to keep going past the ‚Äúprivate property‚Äù sign (take the right after the sign). Plenty of space to park, and a great deck with views of the woods and a fire pit awaits you. We enjoyed walking the North Augusta Greenway Trail (3 min drive). The parking lot is a little hidden (past the pedestrian bridge). Don‚Äôt go into The Rapids neighborhood."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob is an awesome host, he made recommendations such as places to check out near by, also suggested I brought binoculars to enjoy the wild life, I am glad I did! There are many birds, I saw a cottontail rabbit during my stay a couple of the days. The cottage is very cozy and modern, a perfect place for a couple or small family. The location is great, while you are very close to the city and anything you may need, it is a hidden gem nestled in a wooded area. I am a coffee drinker so the coffee and coffee maker were much appreciated. I enjoyed my mornings on the deck drinking my coffee and watching the cardinals and squirrels, very peaceful :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is an absolute gem! As is Rob! He was super helpful with recommendations for food, golf courses, and even a few nearby dog-friendly trails/parks. The place is very clean and looks just like the photos. Checking in and out was simple and straightforward.
We loved being able to walk our dog around the pond and watch him go on a little sniffari. There‚Äôs an outdoor shower as well as a hose, which was great for cleaning off shoes and paws. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about our stay here!
DOG OWNERS: Knowing there was a pond and a high probability of mud, we packed a towel for our dog. I highly encourage anyone else bringing their dog to do the same. Rob kindly provides white towels for his guests. Now, white or not, I wasn‚Äôt about to potentially ruin someone else‚Äôs towel by using it to clean dirt/mud off paws. If your dog is joining you, keep this in mind and please be considerate and respectful of Rob and his place."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin had wonderful views- (small pond visible from porch), was very clean and easy to get in and out of. It was perfect for a quick overnight stay. It was very convenient to town. Upon booking I received house rules that included more than visible prior to booking - including an extra fee (pet). This caused it to be more expensive than anticipated . Rob was considerate about this and offered a refund. He also helped me figure out how to pay the fee with Airbnb. Rob was very responsive to messages."

It was clean inside and very private. It is a kitchen with everything you need for simple meals (we whipped up pancakes one morning for example). There is one nearby trail called Greeneway for a short stroll. We recommend Rob and his Airbnb for a short getaway weekend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The area is beautiful and enjoyed waking up to the sound of birds singing and walking trails.
The cottage is conveniently located to grocery, clothing and most everything else you would need. With a car you can enjoy many activities for all ages. We were pleasantly surprised to find out the cottage was only a few miles from the Georgia border.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rob‚Äôs private oasis is exactly as described. This modern clean cottage had vaulted ceilings which gave the living room area and kitchen a spacious, yet cozy feel. The kitchen contained just about everything anyone would need to cook and major stores for food shopping were not far. The fenced front porch deck overlooked a beautiful pond several yards away that one could view between the trees which surrounded the area. My dogs enjoyed lounging on the deck and the walks on paths around the pond. Just a short distance away is the Greeneway Trail that has 7 miles of paved trails for walking, jogging or bike riding. This was a beautiful quiet place to get away and relax. I would definitely go back and I highly recommend this beauty"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob and the Oasis Cabin are truly awesome!
We were traveling from Asheville with our three dogs to support family and attend funeral services for a loved one. The Oasis served as a comfortable and comforting homebase in the midst of dealing with the logistics of everything and it made our difficult time a little easier.

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This stay is super cute! The inside is exactly as pictured. Perfect for 1-2 people or if your on a business trip. There is a cute outdoor space at is your own and since I was there in the spring there was a beautiful tree from the neighbors yard that bloomed over my patio that made it like a garden space. Everything is updated on the inside and very functional for the space.
The only negatives I‚Äôd have to say is that some of the dishes I used I had to wash before I used them because they were dirty from the previous person. There is no dishwasher or oven if your a longer stay person. Lastly, the area is not that great. A little sketchy at night after dark, so if you go out just be very cautious.
Overall, I‚Äôd stay again. It‚Äôs a great stay just small negatives that don‚Äôt bother someone like myself. It was great for my business stay!"

The bed is comfortable, and there‚Äôs even a reclining La-Z-Boy chair to enjoy the large television on.
Outside your door is a patio with a table, large umbrella and two chairs. There is also a barbecue grill.
The location is excellent, it was literally close to everything I wanted to do. I never had a problem getting a parking spot right outside the house on the street.
Laundry is available. This is quite possibly the most well designed small space I‚Äôve ever seen. I would definitely stay here again."

The kitchen was perfect size, the desk was spectacular and big so I could get a lot of work done. The place looks like it has just been updated and has great little features. Alot of outlets, control of the fan and heating and cooling, and the tv was def was also a great addition. Super great stay!"

the living space was VERY comfortable, clean, & accommodating.

(didn't even know those existed lol) on top of that there was a a mac computer available if you would like to use it, a library of DVDs, & even an Xbox 360 with games if you just wanted to play.
We were in town to DJ a wedding in Augusta so we were LITERALLY only there for a 10-11 HOURS (at the MOST). I stinks we couldn't have stayed LONGER & REALLY gotten to enjoy the comfort of this place to the full.

Let me say, Travis keeps an immaculately clean home. Our communication was spot on. Even though I was driving in late he still had the space available early. It was easy to get in and out.

The apartment was spacious and very private and we stayed with our toddler who loved having room to run around after the long drive. The beds were comfortable with softer pillows but if you prefer firm may want to bring your own. The apartment has its own heating/ac and was easy to control. The 2nd bedroom did get cooler but we left the door opened and that seemed to help. Travis was quick to respond to questions and let us know we could check in early and provided very easy check out.

In the bathroom there is shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. In the mirror cabinets you will also find some body lotion. You can also read some books that are supplied or watch some movies. Overall my stay was great, it was incredibly clean and I‚Äôm sure Travis will try his best to accommodate you. I really hope that you can have the amazing experience I had. Thanks!- Anastasia"

2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We stopped in at Travis' place for an overnight stay before heading on to our final destination. The place was just as expected and a good value for your money. It was clean and quiet. I probably wouldn't suggest it if you have young kids (ours are 2 and 9 months). We felt bad because our baby was teething and had difficulty with being fussy and we were stressed because the owner lived below. It was decorated adorably but again that was hard with having young kiddos as they want to touch everything. But if our kids were older we would happily stay there again. It was comfortable and the perfect stopover.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely place! Right in the heart of a historic neighborhood. Great park and playground nearby. Wonderful restaurants less than 10 min away in downtown area.

Don't worry about bringing K cups as David has that covered. Will definitely stay again when in Augusta!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,the Hosts were Very responsive. the house was so beautiful and much larger than expected. the photos just don't do this place justice. I highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had a wonderful weekend at David's Augusta historic but modernized home. Old home feel with modern amenities. The master on-suite was out of this world! We will be back to visit Augusta and will definitely book this home again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay! A group of us (9 people) stayed in Augusta for a wedding weekend. We all slept comfortably and the house was great. The first night, we walked across the street to Midtown Tavern. Great food and drinks! We also went to Buona cafe, right next to the house, every morning. The house was beautiful and very well-decorated. Everyone was in awe over the high-fashion decor and interior design. The house was very roomy, with multiple sitting rooms. We even hung out on the porches because the weather was so nice. The hosts were extremely responsive (even facetimed us when we had a quick question). Will definitely stay again next time we visit Augusta!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were great, very responsive and helpful during the stay. The residence looked exactly like the pictures. It was well decorated and designed. There were a few hiccups during our stay that they were able to resolve quickly. The heat, electricity, and hot water went out a few times during our stay but this issue was resolved in a timely manner. There was a ladybug infestation in the upstairs rooms, mainly the master bedroom and bathroom. I pulled back the curtain to find an outlet and it was about 15-20 dead ladybugs on the window sill. There were a few flying around the first night but by a couple nights in there were clusters of them on the bathroom window, bedroom ceiling and curtains. There were also spiders and other bugs in the master bedroom. Again, the hosts were very friendly and advised they will be exterminating after our stay due to the smell. Lastly, the first level bathroom could use hooks or shelves to put your things on. Overall I enjoyed my visit. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is very beautiful and they have very nice decoration! and clean, the host answers very quickly. It has many things that I have not seen in other Airbnbs such as bathrooms equipped with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and in the laundry room laundry soap, softener, dryer sheets and more... the area where it is located for me was the perfect place. I booked for a specific time and needed extra days and they facilitated the process very good communication."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Great places to eat close by. Very comfortable beds to get a good nights sleep! See you next time we are in town.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely cottage with great hosts. Very nicely decorated with thoughtful details like nightlights with USB ports, a baby bath, kitchen and laundry supplies, lots of blankets, black out curtains in the back bedroom and a drawer with toys and games. The garden is lovely with lots of roses and other flowers. Very easy to walk to the local stores/restaurants from here and easy to park outside. It is on a main road but the noise is negligible and the garden is fenced in which is a nice feature if you have young kids with you (like we did). The hosts were super responsive and helpful. Overall, this was my best Airbnb experience ever and I would happily stay here again when we next visit North Augusta."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Staying on a Houseboat was a fun affordable adventure and we‚Äôre not sorry we did it. Everyone in the area was gregarious and welcoming. Sadly for us, the weather took a turn in that a cold front moved in and there‚Äôs no insulation on a boat. Thankfully the AC unit is also a Heating unit, which was helpful."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, scenic location. Overall, we were very happy with our stay - it was exactly what we were looking for."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Greg was such a great, responsive host. The Savannah Rae is absolutely gorgeous and the location is spot on!!! Much to do in the surrounding area, restaurants and shopping. This was such a beautiful and peaceful stay, would go back again and again!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Augusta for a regatta held at Augusta Rowing Club. The location was fabulous. A short bike ride to the venue. We were able to watch the rowers rowing up to the start and race down the course at 2500m We were warm and cozy while it was wet and freezing out. Best way to watch a head race. Greg was super responsive and helpful with places to eat. Amenities were exactly as described. Honestly, I was worried about it having a smell and it did not! Very cozy, hot shower! Will visit again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time every staying on a house boat and it was an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING experience!! Location was BEAUTIFUL, peaceful, within walking distance to restaurants and the Marina was an added plus. Greg is very accommodating to check in and check out times and timely with responses to messages/questions. It was a FABULOUS first experience and I WILL be returning! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always an huge pleasure to be in the friendly and beautiful surroundings of the marina. The weather perfect, food truck festival was amazing. Always something going on, in or near the marina. Just love being on the Savannah Rae, welcome aboard."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend. Just as described, quiet (mostly) and a beautiful view."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This boat was very clean inside and out. It appeared to be well maintained. In my opinion, it is located at the best slip in the marina. It is close to an elevated railroad track; a relaxing rhythm of the wheels occasionally rolling down the track was a beautiful complement to the ducks and crickets singing. I was fortunate to be there on a full moon. The moon reflected river flowed very slowly, It felt like it was pulled from a movie set. I took pictures and videos to show my friends how lovely it is. I felt very welcome and safe. As a female traveling solo, it was especially nice to know there were many boat residents close by, keeping a watchful eye. They were all friendly and yet, respectful of my privacy. I don't want to talk this place up too much because I don't want it to be booked when I want to stay there again. (-;"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved this stay! The boat was so comfortable and peaceful. Loved spending my mornings on the deck watching the sunrise. Greg was a terrific host! Great communication and checked in to ensure that I had everything I needed and that I was comfortable. Easy walk to downtown with restaurants and shops. I would highly recommend the Savannah Rae.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean and nice. I would definitely stay again. Our host Greg was fantastic and very responsive.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Unique opportunity to stay in a cozy houseboat on the river. Coffee on deck was a treat. Well located with easy parking and within walking distance to much Augusta has to offer. Bring earplugs, as a train does pass right by at night sounding it‚Äôs horn. The train only comes a few times though, and it is a fine trade off for the pear with of being on the water. There was no shower gel, shampoo, or hair dryer that we could find, so be sure to bring yours. There was water in the fridge and coffee and tea, which were nice. The shower stall was a nice size and the bed was comfortable. All in all, it was a nice stay. If you want luxury, stay elsewhere, but if you want a cozy, place on the water, don‚Äôt hesitate to stay here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time. Beautiful view!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We totally loved it!! Everything was there and the beds were great! Sat outside, sipping a drink, watching the river. Perfect!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greg's Houseboat on the Savanah River is definitely an oasis! The best part of our trip was just hanging out on the decks and enjoying the breeze. Make sure you read the listing carefully to ensure you come in with the right expectations and you will not be disappointed with this selection!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exceptional experience from start to finish! My husband and I stayed on Greg‚Äôs amazing houseboat for one night and it was just perfect. Greg was the perfect Airbnb host - excellent with communicate and responsiveness, very kind, and maintains a pristine Airbnb! We loved our stay and the kayak tour that was available just steps from the houseboat. We enjoyed watching the sunrise over the river from the back of the boat the next morning. Overall a 10/10 all around and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay on the boat house! It was way more spacious than we expected. It was so relaxing to have coffee on the back porch in the morning.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic location. We loved it. Would return if the opportunity arises.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steven and Greg were great! Super responsive and very flexible. The Savanna Rae was really comfortable, clean and perfect for me. Being able to sit on the deck right on the water, watch the sunset and chill was the best. Would be nice to be able to cook but not that big a deal since there‚Äôs a bunch of restaurants within walking distance on Broad st. They run the cool little shop there at the marina with drinks and snacks as well. This is better than glamping."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg and Steven‚Äôs listening was amazing! Very peaceful, very clean, so cozy and comfortable. I loved it and plan to return real soon. It was the perfect getaway for me."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Savannah Rae was an amazing stay. It was beautiful being on the water and enjoying the moonlight. It was very quiet and peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable time at Greg and Stevens house boat! They gave us great dinner recommendations and walking the river walk was very enjoyable. They also let us use their kayaks which was super fun! The place was gorgeous and watching the sunsets on the top deck as well as sitting on the back porch was our favorite part. The AC worked great and there was plenty of hot water. There are spiders and ants around the place but it wasn‚Äôt anything too bad. If you want to go somewhere that is fun with great views this is the place to go!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We spent a wonderful day here. The place was perfectly clean and such a unique place to be down on the water near the riverwalk and close to downtown restaurants. Great hosts! Would come again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hosts Greg and Steven‚Ä¶
What an absolute amazing house boat, roomy, beautifully decorated, comfortable bed, awesome top level sunset view, grilling and spacious outdoor areas on board.
Lucky to witness a family of river otters and ducks around the boat.
Immediately felt at home and our hosts made sure we were.
Highly recommend a stay on the Savannah Rae ‚Ä¶ an absolutely wonderful experience‚Ä¶
Thanks so much for everything!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Greg and Steven were very accommodating and were as nice as could be. Great hosts! Great views of the sunset right from the property.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a unique experience and incredible place to stay in Augusta! The boat only is on the end of the marina, offering incredible unobstructed views of the river and bridge. Greg and Steven were extremely responsive and proactive. They even invited us on one of their firework and sunset kayak tours the night we arrived but we already had reservations somewhere üò©
The marina has a shop and food cart which made getting drinks and snacks convenient during our stay.
We saw birds, rover otters, ducks, turtles, and other animals out on the water.
The marina is at the edge of the city but very walkable to all the restaurants and attractions in Augusta! I would definitely stay again!
Because you are on the water there are a fair amount of spider webs around the boat and some harmless small spiders inside the cabin. I have an irrational fear of bugs and was able to overlook this and relax during the stay. The cabin is clean and spacious but just be aware."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do you start‚Ä¶we had the best time ever! We are in love with the river. Greg and Stephen are absolutely the best host, just outstanding. We were looking for something cool to do July 4th and this was it! Everything was picture perfect! We love nature and this is a must stay again soon :) it was perfect üòç I would not change anything."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying on the Savannah Rae. Perfect location. My husband is 6'5 and he was very comfortable in the space. Really like the close proximity to everything. Ordering dinner and sitting on the deck watching the sun set was amazing. We will have wonderful memories and will be returning. Thank you so much Steven and Greg for making us feel so welcome.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed being able to kick back and relax. Beautiful sunsets! The bed was amazing, very comfortable.
We will definitely book in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We weren‚Äôt able to stay at this adorable house boat due to some unforeseen plumbing issues, however, Greg still tried for hours to rectify them and that says a lot. We will try to book again in the future! The boat was super clean and well decorated."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying a night on the Savannah Rae gave us the opportunity to easily and quickly explore downtown Augusta and the Riverwalk.
We arrived in the early evening and were able to easily park, get into the boat, and walk a few trips of luggage down the boat ramp and onto the boat. The boat is very close to the parking lot. After quickly checking in, we immediately embarked on the Riverwalk as the marina is basically at its entrance. The walk got us closer to a few downtown pet friendly restaurants to choose from. We still had time to make it back to the boat to watch the sun set. It was beautiful and the setting was a little funky and rustic in a good way!
All in all, staying on the Savannah Rae was an effortless experience that provided immediate access to downtown Augusta. The unique setting on the water was beautiful and was just the icing on the cake!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg‚Äôs place was amazing! Views were even better than listed. The kayaking experience was perfect and so easy to access. Great view of fireworks, great distance to food (including easy delivery). The place was as described and had great music, lights, perfect for a great weekend getaway. Highly recommend to anyone!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique experience‚Ä¶it is cool to stay on a well kept houseboat which are very difficult to maintain. The owners are friendly and helpful. Neighbors are also friendly. Make sure you bring shampoo, soap, etc. The key is to understand you are staying on a boat. They are clear in their explanations."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A unique and relaxing experience on the river.
The space is exactly as pictured with a couple updates since then.
The location is perfect for experiencing the local restaurants and walking along the river.
Easy access to N August, South Carolina as well as downtown Augusta, GA.
We enjoyed our weekend stay and would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hosts and a great place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Def one of the most unique airbnb‚Äô I have ever stayed in. It‚Äôs an absolute gem, quiet little hideaway sitting directly on the river in downtown. Can‚Äôt beat the view or the rate! The boat is very clean and the managers are very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed on the Savannah Rae for one night after a long drive and we really enjoyed the peaceful evening with a glass of wine and a delivered pizza on the back deck. We had a great night sleep and definitely would stay again. Greg and Steven were great hosts and very accommodating.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly how pictures looked, we had a wonderful stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying on the houseboat. The location is beautiful and Greg and Steven were great hosts. They were helpful and had everything set up nice for us. They even left a treat for our dog, which was very much enjoyed.
Just a side note: the train track has running trains and they come through all hours of the night and use their horn."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place is amazing. we had a great time on board. The hosts are absolutely awesome.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVE, LOVE, LOVED staying here!!! Literally couldn‚Äôt get enough of it an wanted to stay another night. They were so accommodating, even though they were booked they helped us get settled with another airbnb just a few boat slips away. We also took advantage of the kayaks they have and they were so helpful getting us in and out of the water. Highly recommend and we hope we can come back soon. üíï"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great experience! I was sad to leave!! Only one night, but I was wanting for more! Beautifully decorated and a prime location great, walking down the Riverwalk, which is gorgeous! We even saw a train on the train track! Thank you for being such great hosts!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was honestly the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in! Because of how the address is listed, when I got in the area, I called to get clear directions‚Ä¶..üëåüèæhost was on point. Everything was explained and I‚Äôm such a humble uplifting way. Once I arrived, everything was direct from there. All instructions of how to operate things, are clearly listed and with just a call, anything else unanswered, you got a response. And fast!! From I stepped foot on the dock, I felt free and it was the same feeling the whole stay. This was my getaway trip. At night, looking out at the lights and water was the most peaceful thing I‚Äôve ever felt to be so close to the water and nature while I went to sleep. The second night, it rained so I sat on the back and the sounds were so soothing‚Ä¶.to top it off, fireworks were being released at an event nearby which made it even more beautiful! The train‚Ä¶..ü•π great! Everything was just on point!
Thank you all for having me!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg and Steven were great hosts. When we arrived, Greg was available to answer any questions we had and help in whatever way was needed. The houseboat is within walking distance from the farmer's market, which is awesome. We tried gator tail, which was FANTASTIC ! You have to visit. The boathouse itself was quite spacious and very clean. Even though we were asked not to use the stove, we did not miss it. between eating out and having other appliances to use, it was not an issue. As an extra bonus, Greg invited us to go kayaking down the river where we saw fireworks, a lovely way to cap off the evening.
We missed the otter who left us a present on the deck üòÜ.
Thanks to two guys and a boat! we had a lovely trip to Agusta. BTW downtown is great!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay and experience as part of it. Greg and Steven were great hosts, awesome detailed communication from start to finish, great local recommendations, and there are many options right off the dock including Kayaking the river, a gift shop, the river walk park, and restaurants are a plenty nearby all walkable. The place is as pictured, but the view just can't be captured. Sunset was amazing, Sunrise was nice, and then to top it off, fireworks by the baseball field around 9 or 10pm, depending upon game schedule, right from the roof of the boat. The bed was very comfortable, so were the many (6) pillows on the one bed. Great features inside the place, everything you need including a ice maker that was dedicated and not in the fridge. Hot water and water pressure was great. Ceiling fans in every room and on the front of the boat covered patio, and they were great ones with high speed and non of the noise on shaking like so many have, and so peaceful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you like Glamping, this place is for you! Wonderful setting on the beautiful Savannah river. Thank you Greg, Steven, and The Savannah Ray!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a pretty good find for the out of ordinary lodging location. Boat was in good shape and the views were great. Very peaceful couple of days. 2 couples is about the max you can fit here, a little tight for 4 grown men visiting the Masters."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved being able to stay on the Savannah Rae for a few days.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely magnificent!!! This is how I will describe our stay.
I celebrated my birthday with family and friends during this visit. It was everything I could have imagined, and then some. Greg and Steven are extremely accommodating and very proactive with ensuring our stay had all of the keen qualities needed for a real getaway‚Ä¶..and adventure, with their ‚Äúkayaking tours and services‚Äù, that we participated in. And, kayaking was a 1st time for me‚Ä¶something I never thought I‚Äôd ever do in this lifetime‚Ä¶.lol. It was so much fun!!!
Thank you, Greg and Steven, for giving me a birthday I‚Äôll never forget, and for making us feel like a part of your family‚Ä¶.lol.
Can‚Äôt wait to return!!"

Thank you for a really unique hospitality option!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great views . great experience we will be back
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wowww! I wish I could‚Äôve stayed even longer. This was my first time staying on a boat and it was amazing! The place was so comfortable, beautifully furnished, and little touches like wine glasses, adult beverages, and water filter were great to have. I was so pleased with our stay and will absolutely book again the next time I‚Äôm in Augusta!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greg communicated with us along the way after booking and answered any questions/concerns. Some of the appliances were out of service and it was mentioned in description of booking. Fortunately.... I can adapt to NOT cooking on a stove/oven and can manage without a dishwasher. LOL!! They were very accommodating and easy to talk to. Loved the location and privacy we had on the boat....it was JUST RIGHT for the 2 of us and would book again in a minute if we decide to head in that direction again. Thanks guys for the wonderful weekend away to celebrate our 6 years together!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was great, clean and very convenient! I Will definitely book again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The boat was very clean and readily available for the early check in that I paid for. The host was very helpful and kind. My kids and friends loved the experience and we all will be back for a 2nd round. Thank you guys

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Savannah Rae was the perfect place to stay for our trip to Augusta! The location was extremely convenient and Steve & Greg were the perfect hosts!! We ended up staying an extra night because we loved it so much!! The weather wasn‚Äôt ideal (cold & rainy) but we couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed our stay any more! Most of our time was spent on the back deck just basking in the beautiful surroundings!! Thank you, Steve & Greg for sharing such an amazing place with us!! We will most definitely be back!!
If you‚Äôve never stayed on a house boat, you should make plans to stay on the Savannah Rae! You can thank me later!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've enjoyed our stay. Celebrating my wife's birthday and this was the perfect gift. The minute she walked through the sliding door she was in awe! We talked about staying on a boat in the past but we just never found one worth staying until I found this listing. It has everything that you would look for when staying in a house. This choice was better than a hotel because you have water views all around you. That's why we chose to stay here. I love staying by the water and you can't get any closer than this. It was close to the Riverwalk. Bed was very comfortable. Waking up to the water was awesome. Open floor plan was quite comfortable. Being able to eat and enjoying the water views are priceless. Lastly I saw the local news interviewing our hosts on their contribution to the community and how they do a once a month cleanup around the Riverwalk. It shows the true character of the people you are renting a houseboat from. They are really nice people who cares about their community.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This stay was amazing!! This houseboat was a fun and perfect little get away for me and my boyfriend and our dog. We had a great time! Greg and Steven were awesome and very professional. This was also by far the cleanest AirBnB we have ever stayed in. I would give 10 stars but they only allow 5! Thank you Greg and Steven! We will be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely LOVED IT!! A local to Augusta, I needed a place for a work retreat and the Savannah Rae was ideal! Thanks so much, Greg and Steven, for your hospitality and this awesome space! I plan to be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Would absolutely stay here again! We more than enjoyed our 6 Night Stay on the Savannah River aboard the Savannah Rae! Greg and Steven are excellent hosts, making us feel right at home. 5 Star in our book! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming boathouse was probably our favorite Airbnb thus far! We highly recommend it for the beautiful views and cozy feel. The hosts were so kind, attentive, and helpful during our stay, making sure we had everything we needed."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greg and Steven were excellent hosts!! The information they provided allowed for an easy check-in and check-out process. The accommodations exceeded our expectations. My husband and I wanted a cozy place for a weekend getaway and we couldn't have made a better decision. We will definitely be back.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a peaceful & wonderful weeklong stay in Greg & Steven's houseboat... couldn't have asked for a better trip and will gladly stay again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was great, the peace and quiet was amazing. Greg and Steven are good people."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay on the Savannah Rae was amazing! Greg and Steven were very helpful and very quick to respond when we reached out about details of our trip. The boat is very clean and cute and the view is beautiful! We will absolutely be staying there again!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An incredible little stay on the river aboard the Savannah Rae. We had a great experience & recommend it to anyone staying in Augusta. Greg & Steven were awesome hosts, we couldnt have asked more. They provided great instructions to make everything very simple and easy. 10/10 Thank you Greg & Steven!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice stay for a night driving through the state
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean nice and peaceful with enough space and great host Highly recommend
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. The view was amazing and it was very quiet. We would definitely recommend!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Instead of driving a few hrs to a coastal destination, my wife and I instead chose to spend the weekend here at home in Augusta. Best decision we've made in a long time!
We couldn't speak any more highly of Greg & Steven...
Extremely friendly, attentive, and super accomodating. As perfect as anyone could hope for in a host.
The boat has everything you might possibly need to fully enjoy your time there. Be that relaxing/playing games/eating outside on the front & back of the boat, taking in the incredible views & surrounding sights, relaxing inside, in a completely warm, comfortably appointed interior.
The views are spectacular, particularly in the bedroom (super comfy bed and pillows) giant windows face the old railway bridge, & the new footpath on the 5th St bridge in full-view through the glass sliding doors.

We live here in Augusta, so she and I are familiar with all the local attractions/destinations/eateries, but suffice it to say, you could spend a week aboard the boat, and have a completely different culinary experience for every meal, and never drive more than 5/10 min.
All of Broad St and everything it has to offer is well within walking distance, and if you're visiting here there is some really great stuff to take in. The comfort and convenience of staying aboard the boat honestly makes anything you might want to do extremely easy/stress free... It's was an amazing experience.

We just left yesterday, and we‚Äôre already looking forward to the next time we come back!

Thanks again guys Jeff and Laura ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, peaceful, easy lovely walk to downtown along the river. Greg and Steve were very friendly and helpful. We met the mayor which gave us an opportunity to brag about all of the locals we met- it is a must see and stay!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greg was great. The boat was great. If you are looking for something within walking distance from town, but not just another hotel or house it is perfect. they have everything you need and if it isn't already on board they will get it there. Will definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Greg and Steven these guys should be super hosts. From me having to push my check in time back twice to getting lost these guys worked with me and was very kind. Communication was very precise. Amazing boathouse. The view was beautiful. Very romantic, quiet and peaceful. It's a home away from home. The sunrise is a must see. It's very indescribable. The toilet system is different but neat. The air is very refreshing. You literally want to sleep with the windows open. I don't suggest that as the bugs are plentiful out there. Staying on a boathouse makes you want to invest in one. You won't regret staying here!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great Place to stay, thank you"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our first airbnb experience. We were only there 2 days for a graduation. The house is clean and cute and works great to allow you the comforts of home away from home. Our only problem was it is not easily accessible for my mother in law who is on a walker. I thought I had asked about a bedroom on the main floor but it required up or down a few stairs to get to a bedroom. The bathroom upstairs was a walk in shower which was great. We made it work and would come back if we didnt have our mother in law with us. It was definitely more cost effective and a million times more comfortable than a hotel.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location and the property was absolutely beautiful. Perfect. For hosting a gathering with family and friends Nearby Any and everything you're looking for To have rememberable time.

This place was exactly what we needed: a spacious and easy-to-live-in house with a big fenced yard for family with dogs and children.
Very comfortable beds! And no demands about excessive tidying up before leaving. That's what the cleaning crew is for - which makes the 10:00 checkout doable. Thank you! A pleasure being there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here two nights for a wedding. The set up for our family of 6 was perfect! Natalie had no problem letting us bring our doggie, who was also very happy.

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and centrally located cottage. It was a 10-15 drive to anything you wanted, restaurants, grocery, parks, golf courses, etc. Great for a quick getaway. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in the area. Very walkable and friendly. The cottage is just the right size for 2 people. Rose was very responsive to any questions or requests that we had. She is a great hostess. We will be staying here again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small, but well designed to make the best use of the space with a nice big dining table and TV watching area in the bedroom. Not much within walking distance, but short drive to good restaurants and the riverfront area."
,,,house was filthy and host was rude
,,,"AVOID! This is either a scam or a very unsafe situation. 3 hours after we left, the owners contacted us with pictures of the place not as we had left it and demanded a ridiculous amount of money. None of the damage was there when we left and it surely wasn't caused by us. We met the owners the day before check out and had a conversation with them where they asked us all about our jobs and what not, joking about how much more money we must make since they just rent kayaks and what not instead of having careers. How ironic that the next day they come after us for money for damages that we have nothing to do with. If the damages are real, it's due to how unsafe the situation really is there. We have stayed at tons of Airbnbs and never encountered such a horrible situation or accusation.
Here is the issue: The boat sits unlocked in a busy public marina with lots of foot traffic. The front door is left unlocked at check-in and check-out. The back door is unlocked 24/7 because the latch is misadjusted and does not secure at all. In addition to the public traffic from the marina, the foot ramp to access this boat is less than 20 feet from the entrance to a large city park. Any one of the nine homeless people I passed on my morning walk the day we left could have easily gone in for a look around or to do whatever unfortunate thing that went on to cause the damage after we left.
Besides the security issues, I lacerated my hand on one of the sharp edges of internal trim in the boat. This impacted my ability to work for the following week. I did notify the owner that I cut my hand and accidentally got some of the blood on the bedsheets. I put them in the wash when we left and offered to reimburse if it didn't come out. Instead the owner billed us $1600 for other damage that we didn't cause and was not there when we left.
Avoid this disaster and these scam artist hosts at all costs."
