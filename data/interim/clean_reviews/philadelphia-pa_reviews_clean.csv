2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had a great experience.
The apartment has two spacious bedrooms and two full baths as listed. It was pristine and looks exactly as pictured. The apartment is located on the first floor of a traditional Philly row house and centrally located to iconic spots downtown.
One thing newcomers to Philly have to learn is that south Philly is 90% single lane one way streets. Once you get used to it, it is a cinch. Parking was really easy as long as it was before 9pm.
The neighborhood is amazing. Little did I know that 9th street is a culinary haven. We were only three blocks from Pats king of steaks (invented the Philly cheesesteak) and rivals Gino’s. There are a number of other walkable restaurants of mainly Italian and Mexican cuisine as well.
A 24 hr CVS and a full supermarket are 2 minutes away on foot.
Throughout our stay, our host was very responsive and friendly with any issues that arose. Michael and Blessing made great effort to answer all my questions and concerns."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous place at the end of a quiet street. Didn't get to sit in the garden due to rain, but the beautiful kitchen was a close second!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was really cool - we loved the decorations and furnishings. The location is fantastic - just a few blocks from the Broad Street line and close to the Italian Market. The street itself feels like a little hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. This is definitely an older home - the stairs are steep (the kids were careful and navigated them just fine) and there are some gaps in the (gorgeous) wood planks, but this was not an issue for us. The double bed is very firm and the pillows are very soft - to each their own on things like that so it's not a complaint, but a heads up. In addition, this house was **spotless**. Kudos to the people who take care of this home. We did not use the kitchen to cook but it seemed to have all of the required amenities. All in all, a very nice stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia's East Passyunk Rowhome really lived up to the description, it was super charming and very comfortable. The decor is beautiful, very welcoming, with lots of lovely antiques. The outdoor space was especially lovely, with a huge old tree and greenery and nice outdoor furniture. The beds were very comfortable. Everything was great! Communication and checking in and out was easy. It's in a nice dead end street near good restaurants and shopping. Truly a good find!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a great location for our weekend of South Philadelphia eateries, bars and sports, celebrating my husband's bday. We were able to walk to most locations and the on-street parking was great. We even walked home from Citizen Bank Park, with two pub stops along the way.
The house is very cute and the beds were very comfortable. The outside patio was most pleasant.
Our only concern as older people (75+) was the narrow tread on parts of the stairs and the height of the claw foot tub/shower. This is really a matter of confidence and stability so something to consider."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia has been responsive and helpful, place felt like being home. Very well connected with subway. Few nice coffee places around the area. Worth the price."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a great location! Was in town for a big event at the Eagles stadium and was only a matter of minutes to reach via the subway station around the corner. Great food spots nearby and a short walk to city center. Amalia was a great host and was very welcoming. Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amalia was a great host, and her place was in a great location for easy travel around the city. reAnimator coffee is just down the street and the local spot for Vietnamese cuisine, pho 75, is nearby. As others have mentioned, the staircase is narrow at parts, but manageable. We stayed with our 2 kids, and they did just fine. We had an issue with the Keurig machine (which might be resolved by the time of your stay) but opted for the coffee down the street. Amalia is very responsive and amiable if you have any questions or needs."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is very quaint, charming, and aesthetically-pleasing. It's located on a quiet, small street without much traffic or noise, but it's still near a subway station and main road for easy access to Center City. There are shops and restaurants within walking distance as well.
It was easy to check in and out. The beds and rooms are comfortable and well-furnished. We especially enjoyed spending time in the cozy living room.
Just be aware that you have to be open to the quirks of an old house (steep stairs, creaky floors, vintage stovetop). There's also no microwave, but there is a toaster oven.
We enjoyed our stay at this sweet Airbnb and would recommend it!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amalia's place was so charming! Check-in was easy peasy. Comfy beds. Cute decor. 10/10. She was super responsive. Hope to come back.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, owner was available , communication was everything"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amalia’s house is absolutely adorable. I love the charming and historic decor. It was such a peaceful place to spend a couple of days. The street is a great location near a park and lots of restaurants and shops. I was sad to leave!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia’s place is lovely and surprisingly quiet for being in the middle of everything. Lot’s of great restaurants and coffee shops nearby. I would definitely stay again.
Thanks for having me"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amalia’s place is beautiful and comfortable. We loved the brick in the kitchen and the unique art/decor. The place is private yet close to awesome Philadelphia attractions. We’d love to come back in the summer and sit on the patio. Thanks for the great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia has a wonderful 2 bedroom home with lots of interesting art, books, and decor in general. The little garden was a particular treat! I hope to book again. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is perfect, right in the middle of Passyunk/South Philly area - super easy to walk to Passyunk Ave or Italian Markets areas, right next to the subway if you wanted to take that and an easy rideshare to most other areas of the city.
The place itself was great too, it was just my wife and I and we found it had everything we needed. Very cute, would have loved to be there to use the patio/garden in the summer. Was slightly chilly when we arrived but thermostat was easy to use and we quickly warmed up"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia’s house was cozy and beautiful, and well represented by the photos. Had a wonderful time and would highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Airbnb was a delightful blend of historic charm and a few safety concerns. The home's ambiance was cozy and welcoming, and its location was convenient for exploring the area. The decor added to the experience, with intriguing elements that sparked our curiosity.
While we appreciate the importance of preserving historic properties, we couldn't ignore the structural issues we encountered. Holes in the floors, sagging floors hidden under rugs, and wobbly stairs raised safety concerns. The kitchen floor near the stove was particularly alarming, with boards that seemed ready to give way. Cleanliness standards could be a spot better, with noticeable lip marks on cups and neglected shower areas.
While we appreciate the charm of the home, we hope the hosts to prioritize addressing these safety and cleanliness issues for the comfort and safety of future guests. Thank you to the host, they were very helpful with local suggestions and proactive!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home, great location and just as described. House was charming and very clean. I was concerned with the firmness of the mattress at first, but it was wonderful, didn't wake up once and woke up with less stiffness than I have in my own bed. It is located on a quiet residential street with a school close by. There is a nice coffee house located within walking distance. The stairs in the home are steep and winding. I think it would be difficult for those with mobility issues but adds character to the home. The bathroom also has a deep tub you have to step into with a shower. Parking is tight as with any city parking. Amalia's home instructions were clear and detailed, we had no issues finding or getting into the home. She was very responsive and quickly answered a question before my arrival. We were very happy with the home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay! Very cozy space and the house has such unique character that I don’t usually care for as a modern-design-loving girlie, but really did appreciate. Aspects of my stay I did not expect and are things to consider:
Parking was ATROCIOUS 😩 And this is coming from a New Yorker. I was so glad my friend came along with me and could get out the car to make sure all was well while attempting to park. Those narrow 1- way streets were the worsttt - please try to avoid parking on those streets if you’re not comfortable or used to parking with very little roadspace to work with to get into the spot.
The beds were extra firm. I hopped onto the bed thinking it would be nice and bouncy like I’m used to at home, but no - Still had a good night’s sleep but just something to consider. Also I thought one of the double doors in the kitchen was a cabinet but apparently it’s a pretty creepy looking entrance to the basement so don’t open that 😅 STILL - GREAT STAY!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was in a great location. Really quiet street. The stairs are harrowing, but described and pictured accurately in the post. The layout was perfect for 2 old fiends to spend some time together and catch-up while exploring the city."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gem of a place in a great location. It's a beautifully appointed row house on a private, no exit street. Will have to come back in the warmer months to use the gorgeous back patio."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Amalia’s place! It looks just like the pictures and it is so beautifully decorated, you can definitely tell a lot of love has been put into this place. The stairs may be a little tricky for some people, but the location and amenities definitely made it worth it. Amalia was a kind and responsive host. We look forward to staying here again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia's place was absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed the home's character and Amalia's decorations. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. The kitchen was my favorite! It's also a great spot in the city - quiet street that's very close to a subway stop (gets you into center city within minutes) and quick food/coffee spots. Amalia was also very responsive and friendly. I definitely recommend staying here. It's a classic old Philly rowhome -- if you appreciate a beauitful, well-kept and well curated home, that also has Philly character and charm, you will enjoy staying here as well."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying here. It's accurately described and in a very walkable area. It's very small, but very cozy and charming. We had our 1 year old with us and it worked, but it was tight and the stairs are tricky. I would happily stay here anytime if it was just my wife and I. Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amalia’s place was exactly what I expected and then some. The bed was super comfortable and I greatly appreciated her responsiveness and recommendations.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Once we got over the shock of the stairs, we found this place to be cozy and home-y. We had great communication from the host and had a lovely trip overall."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My children and I spent the week and we loved it. It was a charming house on a quiet block. The outdoor space was lovely too.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home in a great location. Host was communicative and checking in and out super easy. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable!
The decor is so fun.
Great kitchen, looking out into the garden, perfect for dining or working.
I was glad there was a washer and dryer available; although the dryer wasn't working, bummer, BUT there was a fun antique drying rack which we used instead.
The beds were comfy and we slept well.
The place has idiosyncrasies, it's quite compact--which goes with the territory for such an old home. The winding stairway to the 2nd floor may not be for everyone.
To me, it felt almost like time-traveling, with the retro decor and wooden floors.
The location is fabulous, a quiet street that's centrally located. We even found easy street parking and we didn't get a ticket, despite leaving the car all day (lucky us!).
I highly recommend Amalia's rowhome!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical little cottage inside. Everything was meticulously curated in the space. It was also impeccably quiet.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,made the trip to Philly relaxing and so convenient to get everywhere! already booked again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home itself is cozy, charming and clean. It’s clear a lot of thought and care went into the decor and amenities provided. Located on a small one way street, it was peaceful & quiet, which is a bonus especially in Philly. Wonderful neighborhood for walking. Amalia is a thoughtful, professional and communicative host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia's place is an absolute treasure. It has such an eclectic feel, something cool to see around every corner. The little mouse house will NOT disappoint. The location is absolutely wonderful with so many places to walk to nearby. Amalia's guidebook was so thorough and gave great recommendations. She was very easy to communicate with. Staying here definitely made me fall in love with Philly! 10/10 recommend booking this air bnb!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a fantastic find for our first trip to Philly. The beds were comfy, house was very clean, bathroom and kitchen were well stocked, and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. If I’m ever back in Philly, I’d definitely look to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amalia’s place was great! Very close to the Septa but on a quiet street. They were very responsive and communicative. Some might find the stairs challenging (they’re a little narrow and twisty); otherwise it’s a great stay with a great host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a TREAT! The neighborhood is really something special. Quaint, beautiful, full of restaurants and parks. Amalia's home is exactly like the pictures, you will feel right at home, we gasped upon entering, and felt like we got to live in a perfectly curated loving home! We will definitely be back to Philly and will plan on staying here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amalia has a real gem here. The decor is interesting, unique and delightful. The patio is unexpected and rare in the city but serene and calm. There was no road noise, no neighbor noise, it was very quiet and peaceful. We loved the short walk to the subway and walkable area. Be prepared for city parking! The description is correct, I would not suggest children or aging/limited mobility folks stay here as the stairs and floors are uneven in places. Otherwise come fall in love with Philly here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jeffrey’s house. The location in Passyunk was perfect. Easily walkable to all the restaurants and shoppes in the neighborhood. The house was exactly as pictured. Beds were comfortable. It was very quiet in the house. Jeffrey was very responsive to our needs and responded immediately when we had questions or anything that needed attention. If you are looking to stay in the Passyunk neighborhood, I highly recommend his house."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well equipped AirBnB but be aware that it is second and third floor of a walk-up, long steep stairs challenging for seniors and toddlers. Challenging coming and going with any substantial luggage."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jeffrey's place was spacious and in a great location. I would definitely stay there again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great; however, I think parking should be discussed better. It stated there was on street parking available, but on a Friday evening, that was nearly impossible to find. I had reached out and Jeffrey provided garages the day before. Because of the difficulty in finding a parking spot, I recommend that garages should always be mentioned."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jeffery was great to deal with and incredibly helpful!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeffrey's place was private, clean and looks exactly like the pictures shown. The beds are super comfortable. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare a meal. Bathrooms was modern. Water pressure was wonderful. Body wash, shampoo and conditioner smells amazing that is provided. A variety of places to eat and is in walking distance ( no more than 1 - 5 minutes). Very friendly and clean residential area. Parking wasn't a problem at all. Parking have to be paid for but for three hours $3.40. Which isn't a bad price at all. I basically paid $12 to park on the street all day (download meterUP app). The beds are very comfortable as well as the pillows.
All in all I felt safe and cozy. I really enjoyed my stay. Will book again when I come to Philadelphia. Thanks Jeffery!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable home in a great location! Jeff was really communicative, which was helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The skyline view from the master bedroom was beautiful. We would rent again. The price jumped up when we added our third person.
It was quiet, clean and comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations exceeded my expectations. It was very comfortable and well appointed. Space is very generous. The views from the master bedroom of downtown Philadelphia quite spectacular. It felt very safe to be in that environment being adjacent to Passyunk Ave what’s the definite plus, with so many terrific restaurants and shops. My favorite was Laurel, a definite cut above. This place was recommended by the Director of Studio incamminati where I took an art workshop and it was an easy 11 minute walk away. I appreciated The host contacting me in a timely fashion let me know about a new thermostat and settings. I would definitely consider returning to this Airbnb."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This apartment was beautiful and super clean. It was in a great neighborhood with a bunch of great places to eat. Jeffrey was such a great host. His instructions about check in and check out were very easy and straightforward. He was very knowledgeable about the area and also was very easy to get in touch with if we needed to. I would definitely stay here again and was sad we could not stay longer to explore the area. Do not hesitate to stay here…this apartment is a gem.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was amazing very spacious. I like the fact that I was able to enjoy the skyline especially during nighttime. Jeffrey was very friendly. I was able to reach out to him and ask about any questions that I had or concerns he got back to me right away I didn’t have to wait which was also great.
I also enjoy the fact that everything was nearby walkable distance I was able to go to the gym. Come back home make myself some coffee. Enjoy a great breakfast. This was an incredible stay I most definitely will book again."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Neighborhood is safe, local restaurants and shop nearby, the Airbnb occupies the second and third floors with lots of steps that is typical of Philly rowhomes. The place is well maintained, and bed/linnens are great."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jeffrey's place was in a perfect location. As someone who grew up in Philly I knew exactly where I was going to be and looked forward to it. The house was very nice and my family and I enjoyed it immensely. When we had questions Jeffrey's response was immediate and very friendly. He did not make you feel as though you were bothering him and was more than happy to help. I would highly recommend this place if you are planning a trip to Philly!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at Jeffrey's place with my wife, our two-year-old daughter, and two other friends. Jeffrey was extremely communicative and available for us, and the place was perfect. It's in an absolutely perfect location in Passyunk, walking distance to anything you would want to do. Walkable distance from public transportation as well. The view from the master bedroom was amazing, and all the amenities were in great shape. We had a really great stay and we will definitely consider going back to Jeffrey's place again. Thank you."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was comfortable, clean, easy to access with clear communication beforehand. The location was even better than anticipated, it was directly off of Passyunk avenue. Beds were comfortable and there was a ton of common space to hang out in. We didn't have any issues whatsoever. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a simple, easy place to stay right off of the main popular south philly area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place , and great location :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb I have stayed in. Will be staying again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was nice! Just like the pictures! Street parking in the neighborhood wasn’t too bad earlier. Perfect spot that happened to be next to south street Christmas lights and all the activities we wanted to do.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay in such a beautiful neighborhood! Jeffrey was an excellent host. He responded very quickly when I requested to stay in his home, and he even contacted ahead to let me know I could check in earlier than the check in time. Very much appreciated.
The home looked as described in the posting and met all my expectations. My girlfriend also joined me and she loved this place as well. Very clean and comfortable. We both enjoyed waking up in the first bedroom to the skyline of the city.
If you stay here any time soon, this neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous to walk around in. From all the fall colors, Christmas decorations, and local shops, it will get anyone in the holiday spirit.
I look forward to visiting Philly again, and would not hesitate to stay with Jeffrey again! Very thankful for this excellent experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jeffreys home was great for the price. Jeffrey was super flexible with checking in. Jeff’s home was perfect except walking up those stairs but looks like Philly homes are all developed that way (Arizona born and raised, so we’re used to one story homes) I loved the fact that Jeffrey had board games for the family, the house was super clean. I would highly rebook this home in the future. Parking was an ease as there was curbside parking in front of the home. There’s a pub right next door to this home! Jeff was in control of the AC Unit/Heater but with a quick message to Jeff he was very fast to adjust the AC/Heater to whatever we wanted."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! Very clean, spacious and well-equipped. The location is fantastic and Jeff was a great host. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Took a trip down to the city of brotherly love and I had a great time. Nothing more special than to get back to a cozy, & clean apartment. Thank you so much for hosting us and can’t wait to come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Good location, few bars and restaurants in the area. Also close to other major neighborhoods. Place is very spacious and clean, would recommend to anyone!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here when attending a concert in Philly and it was a 10/10 experience!! Only a few minute Uber ride to Wells Fargo center. The house itself was soooo nice, two very nice and spacious bedrooms. Super comfy bed. Easy check in and check out. I had a question about parking and Jeffrey answered immediately! Neighborhood was super nice Highly recommend."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience here, everything was very clean and there were all the amenities I needed. The location is also nice."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for two nights. It was in walking distance of everything I needed and I loved how organized the host is. At first I felt weird with the co-living idea but I loved the space. Each room has a keypad on it. The host was also very proactive about things and put instructions around the house so you knew where things went. Hope to stay here again.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just wonderful! Super well stocked with everything a traveler could need and more. Multiple people in residence but set up in a very private way and extremely secure. Host is a delight, super clear instructions, very communicative."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I liked the central location of this place downtown, the fact that I was able to check in so late (8pm), and how clear the whole process was! The individual rooms are more like a walk-in closet than a whole bedroom. It is more of a dorm or hostel vibe, with two shared bathrooms. For the price, quite affordable, clean, and clear instruction - I just wish I had read the description a bit closer and knew the vibe a bit more before booking. Otherwise, I'd have given 5 stars!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,super clean house with well laid out instructions on everything!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most beautiful airbnbs I've stayed at and it was absolutely immaculate--so clean and lovely. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it wasn't possible to control the temperature and there wasn't a window in the room--bit disorienting and hard to wake up. The temp was great in the shared space of the apartment but the room was quite hot. All in all though, I'd say it's great value for money, especially for the location--can't beat the proximity to reading terminal and the convention center."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Long was a great host who clearly communicated every step of the way.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Long's place. Always appreciate the extra effort and focus on details. Will be back again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay in two consecutive weeks and it was nothing short of impeccable! I would highly recommend Long’s place for short or extended stays. The area is vibrant, diverse, and the host is cultured. I appreciate his effort to ensure you feel at home and of course, the other guests!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pristine and well below the true value! Amenities were included, local recommendations and proximity, major attractions were within 5-7 minutes walking distance with SEPTA being a 5-9 minute walk, and in the heart of Chinatown allowing for a rich culturally immersive experience. The host was communicative and provided clear instructions. I would highly recommend this location!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, would stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s worth it
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Long’s Airbnb is in a prime location for the conference I was attending. Being a few short blocks away, it was a welcome retreat to come back to after a packed day.
It is also within walking distance of many of Philadelphia’s sights; there is a lot to do/ see/ and eat in the surrounding area.
The space was very well maintained and clean- in part because of the clear rules that all guests do their part in cleaning up after themselves."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect no frills spot for solo travelers.
Great center city location, within walking distance of many attractions, and close to public transit stops for any adventures farther away. Amenities were basic, but all were spotless and well maintained. Clear instructions from a communicative host made for seamless check in/out logistics.
I am already looking forward to staying here again, the next time I am in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Greetings,
I have loved my stay at Long’s Airbnb! It was really clean and properly located. It is about 2 blocks from Jefferson train station, there is access to buses and all kinds of restaurants. We can also find activities to do or take pictures of the most popular buildings at a walking distance.
It is definitely worth the price I have paid per night!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean and cozy for one person traveling on a budget"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect place for me. I walked everywhere, such a beautiful neighborhood, lots of restaurants (Green Eggs Cafe) and bars.
It is small cute place but perfect for one traveler. I picked this place just for the Keurig machine. This is the best deal in Philly and Jesse is the best host. He called me as soon as I check out to tell me I left my wallet behind......:I will definitely comeback."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse’s place was perfect for my needs and I’m so glad I found it. Jesse had clear instructions on accessing the space, and the room was lovely. The location is superb. There are restaurants nearby (including late night pizza by the slice less than a 5-minute walk!), and within a 15-20 minute walk of many sights and activites. Easy to get Uber for things like the Art Museum, the airport, or if the weather isn’t conductive to walking. Never felt unsafe or nervous, even when walking after dark, which I did one night all the way back from Logan Square. This is a gem in Philly, and I can’t wait to stay here again on my next trip up!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time at Jesse’s place and will definitely stay here again! Perfect for the solo traveler visiting Philly. The neighborhood is awesome and his unit is very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesses place truly is in the heart of it all! I was able to walk for almost everything. I did Uber some but it’s a city, not everything in the world is gonna be all in one spot. But Food, medicine, and night life were all just a few blocks away and some spots were even right outside the building. Jesse is also a great host! He let me check in early since my flight landed in the morning, made sure everything was good even after check in, and let me stay a little late so I didn’t have to sit in an airport for 5 hours. 11/10"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Though the room is small, it has everything you need as well as your own shower and bathroom (Great not to share). Very functional. The bed is on the firm side for those with a preference. I would return."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jesse’s place was super clean and cozy. We had good communication with clear instructions. The place is small, but full of everything you may need…things were very smartly placed. If you are very tall or fairly round in size, the shower might be a challenge, but that’s not a complaint…just a heads up. I would definitely stay again. Jesse is direct, efficient and precise in the way a host should be or at least I appreciate that. There are thoughtful things in the room for comfort and ease. So many things are within walking distance. Another heads up…Parking on the street is difficult, but not impossible. The meters are a good price once you find a spot. All in all Jesse’s place is really cool, very cozy and comfy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jesse was responsive and very easy to get ahold of (in case I needed anything). The spot was exactly what I needed—a great and clean space and close to some cool spots. Will book again when I’m back in town!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small but extremely comfortable space in a fantastic neighborhood.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find! The location is awesome because you are just a few blocks from downtown, but the street itself is more quiet and residential. Check in was smooth and the place was well maintained and clean. I highly recommend for someone traveling solo since most options are full sized apartments which feel excessive for one person."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jesses place is in a great location and he’s a very responsive host. He worked with me to make my trip very easy and accommodated to my circumstances. His messages were very kind and professional. Great value
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location in the middle of it all! Apparently it’s located in the “Gayborhood”. The bookstore next door is a must-visit! One downside is that this place is very small and pretty much a shoebox. It has everything a single person would need for a weekend. (Though smaller people will feel more comfortable here, with the close quarters and twin-size bed.) I would probably not want to stay more than a week here, just due to its size. Jesse was a great host though!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nicely located in the city. just walking distance to the mart, park, and even Liberty bell. The room is very cozy, fully furnished. Jesse is very kind and explained everything I needed in advance. I highly recommend this place."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Among my many Airbnb stays I'd say this was a good solid average. It is small which is fine for me a single male. In general I agree with other reviews.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesses place was perfect for what I needed! Great neighborhood, walkable to most of the city or a pretty cheap ride-share if need be! Jesse was also very helpful and hospitable. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again if I was traveling alone to the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful apartment, location and host. Great communication, would definitely recommend!
Just a small warning for people who are sound sensitive: the airconditioning system of the building next door is quite loud. I personally had no issues with it, but if this is something that bothers you, be aware."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything you could need is catered for in this place - very well thought out. Up one flight of stairs. Super clean. Not a lot of room but perfect for a single. Portable air con worked well. Safe neighbourhood for downtown Philly - everything very close including subway. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean place in a great location. Jesse went above and beyond for me!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great deal for a solo traveler in the heart of a cool neighborhood. Only drawback is parking is a bit of a bear but there are lots and garages nearby.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse was a lovely host. Very responsive and attentive. Thank you so much Jesse! The room is nice and just as in picture. The location is great - quiet and beautiful, close to everything I needed.
A few things I found more challenging:
1) The air conditioner is actually a cooling unit – not quite the same in terms of temperature and noise. In fact, it is a VERY noisy instrument located just near the bed-head, with no ability to control the fan’s intensity.
2) There is only one cup (!) in the room, one fork, and one knife. There are no plates, no bowls, no cups for cold water. It is impossible to wash the one and only cup as there is no dishwashing pad. Even for a single guest it would be nice to have more than one piece of each.
3) Note that the shower is very small, so bigger people might find it challenging to take a shower. Also the water flow is not a strong one.
Having said all that, I do recommend Jesse’s apartment and will be happy to stay there again"

Place was very quiet and AC was great. Jesse was very communicative. I would stay here again, for sure."

Check-in was a breeze, thanks to Jesse's clear and easy-to-follow instructions. It may be a small place, but Jesse has done a remarkable job of organizing the space efficiently. I had everything I needed, and the room was neat and tidy. A hairdryer, iron, and clothes hangers are ready for us to use. The bathroom was clean, and the shower had great water pressure. The shower area itself is a bit small, but it didn't bother me at all.
It’s within walking distance to City Hall and I also walked to PMA to enjoy the city view."

He responded to a last-minute booking request very quickly and put my mind at ease that I would have a safe and pleasant stay. This apartment is in a great location with lots of activity going on nearby, but the building itself was calm and quiet.
This particular apartment might not be for everyone as there is not a ton of space to move around and it's a tight squeeze to get around furniture into the back of the unit where the bathroom is. That being said, Jesse has done a great job stacking the room with every creature comfort you could ask for. I would recommend this room to anyone and highly recommend it for people who are just looking for a place to sleep for the night and don't anticipate spending a ton of time in the room."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse has been an incredible host. The room had anything I could have possibly asking for and more. I had a private bathroom, microwave, fridge, a coffee maker and even an a/c. Pure luxery even in comparison to regular hotel rooms.
The neighborhood is incredibly beautiful, many food shops and very green. Also very central, just like discribed.
I sadly had an accident and had to spend my stay entirely in the room but Jesse went out of his way to help me with food delivery and my suitcase.
He is a wonderful host and I hope to get to stay again when I am back in Philadelphia again. I yet have to see the city after all."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse is an awesome host, super responsive, helpful, friendly and accommodating. So appreciated! Neighborhood great, lots to walk to."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse is a very friendly and helpful host. He responded very quick to any question and didn't hesitate to came to the apartment and showed how the media works.
Unfortunately I had to cancel the booking after one night. The very small size of the apartment caused some health problems, what I did not expect. It's not Jesse's fault because he note in the decribtion that it's small. Jesse was very understanding and friendly."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and excellent location but I ended up checking out early because there was such loud music and construction starting from 8 am on a Saturday

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for exploring Philly. A small, but quiet and nicely appointed place. Perfect for a solo traveler who’s mostly just going to sleep there. Jesse was proactive in his communication and responds almost instantaneously."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Three things separate Jesse's listing from the rest - its centrality, quality of amenities, and value. Quite the perfect lay away for the solo traveller exploring Philadelphia. Jesse was also a responsive host and was lovely to deal with. The only possible downside, and this is speculative, would be having to run the AC during the summer. It's a right racket. While ear plugs are provided, I'd have my doubts about being able to live with the unit in warm weather."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great neighborhood with lost of restaurant, coffee shop and bar options. Easy to get around by foot, subway, and Uber. Jesse was very friendly, helpful and responsive. Room is compact (as is shown and described) but has everything you need. I enjoyed my stay!"

Apple TV was kinda hard for me. All around it’s perfect for the cost and really convenient. Jesse is proactive and always helpful."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jesse’s place is an excellent and quiet location just 3 minutes from all the bars and restaurants. It is great for someone who is just looking for a place to sleep at night. Jesse was very communicative. The room is very small but has all the essentials for a short stay. The only issue I had was the wifi wasn’t really connecting, however, since I had my own wifi and was only staying for one night, I didn’t try to solve the issue or ask Jesse about it."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse’s place was perfect for me, staying by myself in Center City for a couple nights to go to a concert and visit with friends. Everything was set up conveniently: coffee-maker, mini fridge, all bathroom necessities, and at a very reasonable cost as well. He was instantly responsive, too. Couldn’t ask for more! Thank you!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Couldn't have picked a more convenient place to stay, friendly and responsive host, great neighbourhood, accessible, loads of first class restaurants/cafes/drug stores..near subway and surburban trains. I would definitely stay there and higly recommended it to others."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the location! I felt very safe walking home after dark from my event at the Convention Center. It is was an easy 10-15 minute walk. Each morning I stopped into Cognito for my morning coffee. On my return in the evening, I would pick up take out from Mixto, ,a wonderful local Cuban restaurant. (right around the corner. ) And there are many other great eating places within a few minutes stroll. Jesse is a wonderful host, communicating with ease and clarity. The room is small, but so well thought out: with a fridge, freezer, and microwave as well as a small area to work and eat. I loved having an affordable place with a private entrance and bathroom in a perfect location. Thanks, Jesse. Hope to be back next year."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic host on all fronts! All of these five-star views are accurate. One tip: if it’s warm and you plan on using the air conditioner, bring ear plugs due only to the efficient size of the room."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for me! I came in for Labor Day weekend for the Made in America festival and the location and amenities were exactly what I needed. I enjoyed being 2 blocks away from south street and being able to go to cvs quickly for items I needed. While the space is small, it was just the right size to eat, sleep and get ready. I appreciate that there was a microwave, fridge and even a coffee maker. The space is very safe and I was happy to be alone and away from the street. Overall, great experience for a solo traveler and I would happily book it again if I was in Philly by myself."

Never saw any other guests in the building although there are other rooms/apts. Great location close to lots of things. I rented a car. The parking was hard at times but eventually I was always able to find street parking. There is a garage a few blocks away though $21 for the day"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Check in was seamless and I’d definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely perfect for a solo traveler looking for a comfortable twin bed and a clean tiny “pod-like” room in a safe residential area close to everything. I walked around at night without ever feeling unsafe and I saw many others doing the same. Jesse is an extraordinary host who has maximized the space available, he is always responds to texts promptly, and he was generously flexible with my check-in and out times. He rents this place for the same price as a private room elsewhere but this one alone has a private bathroom. Keurig, microwave, and fridge were all appreciated too. One word of warning for those who are sensitive to AC air blowing towards the bed: the unit cannot be redirected, so if you don’t feeling cold air throughout the night, do not come in the middle of a heat wave. But I did not need it for more than an hour or two at the time, as the small space cools very quickly. I will definitely try to book this place again next time I travel to Philly on my own."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a cozy location, but perfect value for a solo traveler in the perfect location for Center City. Streets around it felt lively and safe."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Messrs place is perfect for a lone person for a couple of nights.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re like me and you travel light and solo, and value a place that’s walking distance to your destinations and to a rail stop, then this is the perfect place for you. Jesse has listed everything accurately, is super communicative, and he doesn’t have weird cleanup rules that you sometimes get with AirBnB’s. Very highly recommended if this is your traveling deal."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot within walking distance to the convention center. The surrounding neighborhood is very nice, with lots of eating/drinking places. I was able to find parking pretty easily at a garage about 2 blocks walking distance. Seamless and easy check-in/check-out. Fast internet if you like to stream on your mobile devices. It fits 1 person perfectly. 2 people is probably too many. :)
I plan on staying here for future trips to this area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location! Cute, private room space, and very nice, attentive host. I had a perfect stay!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect little place for a few nights! The location is extremely convenient, especially if you're going to the Convention Center. I was able to walk to the Liberty Bell, Ben Franklin's grave, etc as well. There's definitely some neighbors who don't shy away from slamming doors, and the wifi could get a bit spotty, but for downtown in a major city it was great value.
Jesse is a great host and very responsive! He's done a brilliant job of making good use of a small space. It may not be the best choice for folks who are taller, wider, or differently abled than average, but generally I thought it was perfect for a solo traveler!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jesse's place is wonderful! Location is excellent, many restaurant, bars and attractions close-by and good public transportation. Check-in is easy and Jesse is very communicative, he will make sure you have everything you need and if you have any issues he will address them quickly. The unit is clean and has everything you need for a long or short stay. In my case, I stayed for three months and had absolutely no issues the entire time I was there. I found the area very safe which is a big plus if you are walking at night. I highly recommend Jesse's place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Philly."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jesse is awesome. Very communicative. The location is fantastic. Near a lot of good places to eat. Easy to walk around. The place itself is cozy. Felt private and the check in was easy.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jesse's place was exactly as described. Its central location made me relatively close to anything I needed - from food to shopping to sightseeing - it is the perfect solo lodging place.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jesse was great and so was his place. Great location, easy walking distance to everything I needed. He even went out of his way to make sure I could gain access to the unit when I very irresponsibly lost my set of keys."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Couldn't have asked for more. Jesse was incredibly nice, and throughout the stay he was communicative and helpful.

No issues with wifi and descriptions are accurate
Good spot to stay"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, safe location and very clean"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"Space-style furnished first floor apartment with a kitchen in a not properly renovated basement (door next to the kitchen leads to basement wall and construction leftovers/dirt). During our first rainy weekend rats 🐀 invaded the apartment - not only the kitchen downstairs, but they also managed to open our sealed chocolate upstairs - and yes, our food was still packaged.
Hosts said they would send an exterminator, but he was only available two nights after, as this was no option for us, we had to cancel our stay. The apartment was put for rental again on the next day, I guess in the end its all about the money 💵"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute studio with the bed and living room in one open space. The bathroom is efficient but the very small sink has no countertop space for toiletries. So if you have to put on makeup or have an elaborate skincare regimen, you’ll have to get creative.
The kitchen, down a very cozy spiral staircase, seemed sufficient, but I didn’t do any cooking so not sure how well equipped it is.
A nice affordable place to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Location is great. Walkable to lots of restaurants, cafes, parks, Magic Garden, Giovanni’s Room, Vege, South St, Gayborhood. Also a plus to have our dog with us and a complimentary bottle of wine with a bag of toiletries if needed.
A couple considerations- the back outside area could be cleaned up and trash removed. A critter was heard rustling around near the door near the bed one night. Decor/aesthetics could use a facelift. And cleaning could be a little better. Otherwise, a great place! Well described and comfortable. Perfect for the weekend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob & Kyle's place was perfect for me. It is in a great central location convenient for walking to many sites around the city, but also close to public transportation.
The condo/studio is good for one or two people. It has a nice seating area in the front room. The ""bedroom"" is behind a screen for privacy with the bathroom adjoining. The bed is very comfortable. The kitchen and washer & dryer are downstairs and accessible by a narrow spiral staircase. Being 6' 3' it was challenging at first but was ultimately fine. .
Checking in and out was very easy and messages to Rob & Kyle were replied to as promptly as possible.."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay at Rob and Kyle’s place in Philadelphia. The condo was clean and comfortable. It was a terrific neighborhood close to lots restaurants and other great places. Highly recommend this listing.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Hosts keep the place in good shape and are responsive should there be any issue.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Rob and Kyle were great communicative hosts and their apartment is in a great location for exploring central Philly! Photos are not current in the listing but the bed and sofa bed were both comfortable and clean and the apartment was fairly quiet for being on the street level!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice apartment that is in a great location with a lot to see and walk to!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Came in for a friend's wedding. This was the perfect location for literally all the things.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob & Kyles place was fantastic, Kim was super responsive and helpful. Place was as described, only downfall was parking was a NIGHTMARE. Had to use parking garbage a couple blocks over cost $20+ a day but that’s to be had in central city. Place was very clean, little dirt throughout kitchen and bathroom sink could’ve been cleaner but 100% would stay again, comfortable, safe and walkable location, and again they were very responsive. Will definitely keep them in mind for future stays. Can’t beat a 10-20 minute walk to all the sites! My fiancé and I had a blast!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying in such a fun old building right in the heart of everything! Rob and Kyle sent very clear check in instructions, which made getting settled in a breeze. However, parts of the apartment (namely the downstairs kitchen) looked like they were in serious need of dusting/sweeping. We also did not receive check out information in a timely manner. Overall though, we had a lovely stay in Philly."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place! Host responded quickly everytime!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One can easily stay there without a car. As Rob & Kyle state in their description, there are public garages within a few blocks. Their unit is neat and clean. The second bed is a sofa bed which is not as comfortable as the regular bed that I let my brother take. I would stay there again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a nice neighborhood!
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a prime location. Great restaurants close by. Safe area.
I found the place hadn’t been cleaned well on my arrival. Bathroom and fridge needed attention. Hair and dirt buildup on floor. I was grateful for the host’s quick response to issues though.
There is a narrow spiral staircase to kitchen. Was a bit difficult to navigate. Would be difficult for larger individuals and ppl that may have mobility issues."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay if you’re looking for the full and safe Philly experience. It’s a perfect place for a couple to stay or for you and a friend, the place is cozy and meets all basic needs. I would stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Kyle were very proactive with my arrival and departure. I always knew what to expect and the weekend getaway occurred without snags. Everything was very clean and, most importantly, NO CLUTTER! I had space in the chest of drawers and there were enough towels - also organized well. The property was in walking distance to everything I needed. Thank you for being great hosts."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was great, thanks!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little apartment! Perfect location for getting around, I was able to walk everywhere and wander the city. Neighborhood felt very safe and was an overall fun place to explore. Lots of restaurants in the area to chose from as well.
Apartment was cute, small, but perfect for a weekend getaway and a great deal for the price. Hope to come back someday!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall very nice. Cute little place with a fun spiral staircase from the living/bedroom down to the kitchen area. Very good location, and easy to get around. The place hadn't been cleaned super well, but that should be easy to fix. Parking on the streets is tough, so it may be better just to go straight to a garage on 12th St. All in all a nice stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay. it's Clean, close to restaurants and bars, and the gym. I would highly stay at this location again in the near future . The host was great."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in the apartment. We had everything we needed and it was a walkable distance to lovely restaurants, bars, and the city center. Many thanks!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place in a great location. The whole experience was very smooth and ultimately made for a great weekend trip. I would recommend!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a yes, ~10 min walk to bars, hang outs, food/restaurants, and tourist attractions.
Clean and secure, separate living and sleeping areas.
Going down the spiral stairs into the kitchen takes a minute to get used to but it’s fine.
Bathroom is functional, although without counter space.
If you’re considering it, do it. Much better than a hotel. Will book again next time I’m in Philly"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean space in a great area! I enjoyed my stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Loved my stay here! Incredible location - walking distance to downtown, and close to the Broad Street subway line for anywhere else you may need to go. Was also very grateful for the central air and washer/dryer!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the heart of Philly, clean and cranking air con. Great stay guys!!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, fabulous communication and tremendous value."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,close to downtown and many attractions around.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rob & Kyle were great hosts. Excellent location. Will try to stay there next time I am in town.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, responsive hosts, good size for the price. There are two entrances from the building hallways, so if you want to go down to the kitchen without going through the living space and down the spiral staircase, you can use the alternate entrance, also locked with passcode. Street parking was full every time, we needed it during our 4 days, so best garage is 6 minute walk away next to Seger Park."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was such an ideal place to stay. It's very close to just about everything, it's very clean, and the hosts are very responsive."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overpriced for the quality of the unit. Rob & Kyle were very nice, responsive and communicative which we appreciated and their space was in a very convenient location. But...the unit itself felt cheaply appointed regarding the kitchen and bathroom. The bathroom mirror was so high up that neither my husband or I could see ourselves. The shower was tiny. The kitchen didn't have a lot of the tools that our other Air Bnb's usually had. It had a weird way to access the kitchen, either by a very steep steel spiral staircase or you could enter it from outside your unit via the joint hallway. There was also nowhere to hang your things such as my husband's jacket and my dresses. Finally, when we first arrived, I sat not the end of the bed to put on my shoes and the mattress fell down since the slats came out. I reported this to Rob & Kyle and they were very responsive. They replaced the mattress, but didn't have boxsprings so we slept on a mattress on the floor-not ideal."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location for walkable Philly! The condo was clean and nicely decorated. Instructions were clear for start and end of visit. Full size appliances (kitchen and washer/dryer appreciated. The electric fireplace also a nice touch. Make sure you notice the bathroom is a step down. Shower good water pressure, even soap, shampoo and conditioner provided. Located on quiet street. Multiple coffee bars and restaurants nearby."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I recommend the place and the location great 👍 host nice place to stay quiet it 😊
2022-04-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"We chose this property for our trip to Philadelphia due to the location, reviews, and also the host's description regarding the cleanliness of the apartment. The reviews were all mostly good and unfortunately at the time of my booking, the last review that mentioned the dog hair had not been posted yet. The condition of this property was very disappointing in regards to cleanliness. There was dog hair everywhere (except the bed thank goodness). The apartment overall had a dingy and bad smell. The bathroom was also full of hair and with gunky, grime around the edges of the shower and toilet. The kitchen floor was sticky and both the microwave and refrigerator were dirty with food residue and hair in the refrigerator. I reached out to the hosts to allow them the opportunity to make things right. I sent them a message detailing my concerns and accompanied by multiple pictures showing the condition of the apartment. They said that the apartment had been rented for a month by a single guest who had left the place in really bad shape. They apologized for the condition of the apartment but offered us nothing in the way of compensation. They did state that they would be willing to give us a discount on our next stay. I found this to be unacceptable since the condition of the apartment had had such a negative impact on our stay, making us very uncomfortable, and the fact that we obviously did not get what we paid for and not what the listing stated. After pushing back, they finally offered us our cleaning deposit back but refused to reimburse us anything on our stay. As hosts ourselves, we completely understand that things happen; sometimes the cleaning crew does not do an acceptable job or something is overlooked. I really wanted to give them the opportunity to make things right but unfortunately they chose to act generally aloof to my concerns and offer the bare minimum in compensation. Your guest's experience should be your number one concern and when that falls short, I believe you offer your guests compensation and make an effort to make things right. Unfortunately that was not our experience. I also noticed that they waited until after I complained and pushed back on the refund that they wrote my guest review. It is really disappointing and unfortunate because the apartment otherwise is a gem! The location is so amazing! I would have loved to go back and stay here again. Hopefully they can fix their cleaning problem and others will be able to enjoy this place."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"On the plus side, the location is excellent, in a nice neighborhood very centrally located.
The kitchen as well stocked, and the Netflix, and Amazon prime, were great additions in the evenings.
Rob and Kyle were very responsive if I needed to communicate with them.
Having a dishwasher, washer, and dryer, was a big bonus.
On the downside though…
Parking was a problem, but it is everywhere in Philly.
That spiral staircase is very very narrow and steep. Difficult to carry food and drinks up and down.
if there are people staying in the upstairs unit noise can be quite an issue.
Cleaning could be more thorough. There’s a bit of dog here in the corner is everywhere and on the stairway."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recently had a stay in Philly for what turned out to be a really cold week with the exception of 1 weird day that felt like spring. The heating system, and the electric fireplace really held its own keeping this studio warm. The blue spiral staircase allowing you to connect with the basement level kitchen and laundry room, is the narrowest spiral I've ever tried, and I have been to Paris.
The oven/stove is electric, the washer and dryer are full sized units, your group is somehow 4+ people in this studio these units are well more than enough.
The bed, if you like soft you'll fancy this mattress but I am in need of something more firm.
Check in was easy via the touchpad lock at the exterior door, leading you into a brief, brightly naturally lit during the day and abundantly lit with lights at night hallway that looks recently renovated by way of final cleanup of grout and paint not yet being fully done.
The apt is a door to the left, also with a touchpad. This door has glass panes at the top, so if the effort was made one can peer into the apt, just fyi regarding privacy.
Anytime someone in the apts above flush their toilet, your toilet will burp. You will hear it and your toiletbowls water will flare up, so if you happen to be sitting on your toilet you're going to possibly get some collateral damage.
The living space has a very firm, contemporary couch with two windows having solid light blocking drapes. As this is a near street level studio without blinds only the drapes, you either use the drapes for privacy but get zero natural light, or get the natural light but don't get privacy from foot traffic, you can't have both.
The place is near an intersection with a city bus line and steady vehicular traffic through one way streets, generally posed no problem during my stay as there was zero aggravated drivers. At night the area is generally quiet with occasional pedestrians heading home, or walking their dogs, getting their street parked cars, etc.
Did notice one week night, around near midnight, one guy in a hoodie circling a few times from a block away, passing across the street in the windows view a few times, looking walking through and past, but when a single woman passed him, he spent the time to walk back to the street she cut into, the alleyway street, watching where she headed to and he walked quickly to the intersection corner to turn up the same direction she was going. 5 min later from that, he came back, resumed his looking around.
WIFI worked really well during my work hours, as this is a studio w/o a dedicated workspace, the couch and immediate coffee table made do. TV w/ fireTV and provided netflix account.
The location was extremely walkable and I took full advantage of that to not only get food but so as to burn off the food of Philly.
Hosts were always avail to answer my questions leading up to my visit. The studio is well equipped, though I could not find a oven mitt once I realized I needed one to take out some reheated pizza.
Thanks for having me and I will keep this place into consideration in the future."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely great host who went above and beyond
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a definite stay in Philadelphia. It is a great location, very safe and extremely walkable to everything you need and want to see. This is one stay where the actual space was MUCH nicer than pictured. Tip for parking, I found the signs confusing and depending on when you arrive parking can be tight. If you want to be conservative about leaving your car parked/unmoved for days (as I did) use spot hero and get a garage spot. I left my car parked in a secure, indoor, covered garage for three days for $40. Rob and Kyle are there if you need anything!"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Loft was in a fantastic location and close to all we needed. The place was super warm and cozy. Parking was a challenge.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rob & Kyle's place was in an excellent location, all Central City spots are in walking distance and it's very safe to walk. Communication with Rob & Kyle was fast and easy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was exactly as described. Rob and Kyle responded quickly when we had to up our reservation by one with only a couple of days before the start of our stay. When I asked if there were linens for the couch, they made the extra effort to provide everything we needed. The space was very clean and comfortable. Rob and Kyle even put together a little welcome gift for us. It’s also in a great location, we were able to quickly walk everywhere we planned on visiting. We would absolutely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. The hosts are very quick to respond and was available to assistant and answer any questions.
I also loved all the little simply touches that the hosts added to the room like a welcome bag with toiletries etc.
The location is great due to the fact the ton of restaurants that are within walking distance. But if you have a car this is not the place for you because you most likely won’t find parking."

Patty was also very helpful with responding to any questions we had right away and helped make check-in and check-out very straightforward.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Patty's place. Check-in/check out is seamless. . Patty is super easy to communicate with and extremely prompt in her responses.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The unit was great!! And centrally located to all the sites we wanted to visit !!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was great for the activities we had planned. Walking distance to the Liberty Bell, Tun Tavern placard, Reading Terminal Market, Convention Center, and Mutter Museum. The apartment was clean and cozy. We had no issues locating the place or accessing the space. The host checked in several times to make sure check-in went smooth and to send links for local restaurants/activities. There is CVS and 7-11 at the end of the block for convenience items if needed. The apartment was perfect and the host was wonderful! I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in a great location. The apartment is good size and is very comfortable for two people. All very clean and organized. The neighborhood has several options of cafes, bars and restaurants, as well as being close to several of Philadelphia's top attractions. The apartment is close to a subway station and easy access to various tourist attractions. Patty sent several site tips and always responded very quickly to all the questions. We like everything."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Finding it was easy and getting in the building. The host was very helpful and responded very fast. The place has great spots all around from places to eat to calm coffee shops. The monuments and stuff are all within like a 20-30 minute walk or even shorter if you use the bus. Definitely a great spot for my wife’s and I first time in Philadelphia
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Location
The location is perfect for sightseeing and night life. Because the apartment is central in Old City, it's a short walk to several historical sites and museums. Also, the apartment is very close to Penn's Landing so it was easy to run to the dock and get down to the river for runs (or walks). It's also just a short job over to the Ben Franklin bridge to walk or run across to NJ. The apartment is very close to night life. There are several restaurants and bars about a block away. Grocery stores are nearby, within walking distance. I felt safe in the apartment and in the area.
The apartment was clean and cute. I stayed for a month working nearby during the daytime. It was perfect for 1-2 people. The building is pretty quiet, too. I cooked several times a week, and the kitchen was adequately stocked (I did buy some foil dishes for the oven). The view is excellent. I got to do yoga in the mornings looking at the Christ Church steeple.
Strong recommend!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful apartment and several walkable spots
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed at Patty's Place February 2nd - February 4th as a weekend getaway. Patty was very informative and responsive. Great Host!!!!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patty's place was amazing! it was exactly like described and perfect for the weekend! the area was also great, everything was so close. the apartment was so clean and had everything you could need"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was a wonderful spot to take in all historic Philadelphia has to offer. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so glad I stayed here. The location is ideal, so I'll add a few details about features I appreciated: The apartment was spotless and welcoming. There are a variety of pillows, from firm to soft, as well as black-out curtains. The bed was comfortable and my son slept well on the sofa bed. There is some street noise, but I was in Philly for a conference and was able to work a lot in the evenings - the internet is fast and the building is quiet. I walked to the conference in central Philly, although I could’ve easily taken the subway. But I loved being in the Old City, particularly for the atmosphere. In addition, it is easy to get to the Amtrak station, and you can walk or take the subway to a Megabus stop. You can take public transportation to and from the airport, but I don’t think it’s worth the savings over a taxi or Uber, since the latter are much quicker. Finally, Patty's instructions and guides were thoughtful and informative, and she is super responsive. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd happily stay here again. Perfect place to stay, tons of good restaurants within a five minute walk, even more within a ten minute transit ride. Super close to the MFL stop. Great running just south on spruce street takes you all the way to the unpronounceable river to the west. I used white noise while sleeping and never had any problems with outside noise. Half the price of weekend rates of the reputable hotels in the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Had a lovely time. Spacious, comfortable apartment in a good location for many of the historic sites of Philadelphia and the Convention Centre was within walking distance for Kidney Week 2023! Spotlessly clean.
Patty was a perfect host - very swift response to my queries. Enjoyed the restaurant recommendations - especially Olea which is just round the corner from the apartment. Remember to bring cash though there is an ATM in the store next door!
Cooked a couple of meals as well as eating out.
Philadelphia is a great city to visit."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pristine apartment in fabulous location, walkable to many historic sites, restaurants and shops. Patty was very communicative and helpful. We even decided to stay an extra day! Would highly recommend this spot!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and hosts. I was within walking distance of everything I wanted to see. Parking is a challenge but Patty provided options that worked out for me. Room was exactly as advertised.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Recently remodeled and is located within walking distance of the historic old center city area. Would definitely recommend staying there.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patty is an excellent host. My time at her apartment was just amazing. It is very conveniently located and has everything you might need for a short stay.
Definitely recommended!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a great place to stay if you want to discover Philly, and also a lovely comfortable place to head back to and unwind at the end of the day.
From the moment of booking to check-out this was a great (faultless) experience. A quick response was followed up by lots of advice on where to eat, shop, visit. Check-in instructions were clear and simple... and then you walk into a wonderful apartment (the photos really don't lie, it's fantastic!) I already knew the area, as I've visited Philly before, so I knew it was in a lovely part of Olde City. The location is really convenient for so many attractions, and also for transport links, so it's a perfect base from which to explore.
All in all a truly great stay... so a big THANKS to Patty for the hospitality, and here's looking forward to another visit sometime soon!
Thanks for everything, Gav & Ali X"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for my husband and me visiting Philadelphia for the first time. So many of the local attractions within walking distance, but the apartment was still slightly tucked back from busier Market Street and quiet at night. Patty was a wonderful host and very proactive!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Patty's place when I brought my father to Philly for his 85th birthday. He loved it!
Patty is a gracious and well prepared host. She sent plenty of electronic information prior to our arrival and was always available for assistance during our stay. The unit is very clean. The shower was just right, and both the bed and the couch were comfortable for sleeping. The kitchen is well stocked, but we didn't use it because there were too many good restaurants to try! We particularly enjoyed OH BROTHER for cheesesteaks, Vanderwende for ice cream, and Eggselent for breakfast. We didn't get to try it, but Amada (tapas) was recommended, too! We loved being in walking distance of the water. The PHLASH bus (and many more) stop right on the corner. Drivers were super friendly and helpful. We easily got around town to visit museums and historical sites. Great stay!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patty was an excellent host. Very responsive and helpful with places to see and things to do. We were located in the heart of the Old City.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 5 days at Patty’s gorgeous studio apartment in Old City and I had the best experience. I could not tell if it was an old apartment with a modern renovation or a brand new apartment that had the charm of an historic Old City apartment. It is truly a beautiful space in a safe, central neighborhood near downtown Philadelphia. Located on the 4th floor of a small elevator building, the studio was extra large, super clean, lots of pot lighting, huge windows, had 4 separate zones (kitchen, dining, living room, and sleeping area).
There was so much natural light, and had modern touches like many outlets to connect devices. There was so much closet space and storage options. The kitchen had sufficient amenities for me to cook each night and avoid restaurants. The sleeping area was separated by a wall so it was extra dark for sleeping and offered privacy. Patty was wonderful in her communications. She was kind and offered a lot of useful, local information. Checkin was a breeze."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything perfect - lovely apartment right in the town centre!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I wanted to take a short trip to visit the historical places in Philadelphia. This place was perfect for that. A lot of museums, historical sites, and unique restaurants are within walking distance. There is public transportation nearby as well. Since street parking is not free during the day we left our vehicle at a nearby parking garage for our entire stay.
The apartment was very clean, and felt safe and private. This was a great way for us to visit and explore Old Town Philadelphia!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I came to Philly after a lacrosse tournament in MD. Neither of us had been to the city and Patty’s place was perfect for our first stay. The bed was very comfortable and the couch was decent for sleeping on as well. The place was very neat and clean. The bathroom is spacious and pristine. There were several layers of security and we felt very safe. The place was quiet and the perfect location for walking to historical places like the Liberty Bell and the Museum of the American Revolution, as well as to restaurants and Penn’s Landing.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip to Philadelphia. Patty’s place is in a fantastic location to experience the Old City by foot-everything is very close. The surrounding area and streets are full of so much history and beautiful architecture. There are a great many restaurants and pubs very close. The bed was comfortable, the apartment building and street quiet, and the kitchen has most things you need for simple meal prep. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay at Patty’s place. She was very helpful, but we really had everything we needed in the neighborhood. The apartment is exactly as described. The bed is super comfy, WiFi works great, and kitchen and bathroom were both very clean and updated. We had to keep the window curtains closed to keep the hot sun from making the apartment too warm, but the AC was also available.
We did laundry once and it was easy to do, just needed $3.50 in quarters and some detergent.
We didn’t have a car, but saw several lots nearby. Uber to/from the airport was about $25 each way before tip.
I would absolutely stay at Patty’s place again. Thanks."

Nice, well equipped, well maintained apartment. Quite, clean building. CVS Pharmacy, variety of restaurants, and prime Philadelphia attractions in walking range once you get out of the building.
Philadelphia parking is a nightmare...especially if you are visiting from any one of land rich southern states. This place if perfect with no car. But if you plan to have a car, Patty suggested lots of good options for parking garages and lots that are near to the apartment. Do use that.
The check in instructions and wi fi instructions (and connectivity) were very well laid out.
Appliances, lighting, air conditioning, running water, hot water - all in excellent condition.
Overall excellent value. Will recommend."

When we got tired, we took the bus or subway which took us within 20 meters from the apartment. One little secret for the seniors out there: seniors can get a SEPTA Senior Card which allows the card holder to ride free on all public transportation within Philadelphia. Check the SEPTA site and make an appointment by calling SEPTA to get the card at the HQ on 13th St and Market. The apartment is a ""studio"" where the bed is in the same large room as the living room but the size of the apartment is much larger than your average studio. Very comfortable and super quiet.

Check in involved three separate codes but all were provided in advance and were accurate so getting inside was seamless.
There were a couple issues upon check in but the host offered to address them immediately or after our check out and was timely in her responses.

Place is perfect for relaxing, near enough to UPenn and Drexel, restaurants, museums, public transportation, but away from city noise or crowds.

The surrounding blocks in Powelton Village are some of the mosts beautiful residential streets of the city, with interesting old houses from the 1870s. The apartment is about a ten minute walk to the subway and the University of Pennslyania. We traveled by train and found it easy to get back and forth from 30th Street Station. David was prompt and helpful with communications."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David's place was a perfect launching point to explore Philadelphia! Very centrally located in University City and even walking distance to the museum.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What I love about Airbnb is that you can stay in such unique homes. This apartment must have a lot of stories — the sealed off doorways, the beautiful brick wall. Could the staircase have been for the maid? If so, she would have had the loveliest little kitchen, with a garden view. The patio where you enter the apartment is charming, and the greenery around you is relaxing and inviting. Love the location, close to campus yet with street parking available. I would definitely recommend, and hope to be able to come back soon!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is carved out of an old, much larger home. While the address states Hamilton, the entrance is on 37th street. The outside deck is charming and offers a nice setting for cooler days. Skylights help the small downstairs space from being too dark. The kitchen and bathroom are well equipped with all necessary essentials but both spaces are small so one must be creative in finding spaces to place personal care and food prep items. A
staircase leads to a large, comfortable bedroom. A nice touch were individual lights for reading in bed. The TV selection is fairly basic. One caveat: with the bathroom downstairs and the bedroom up, pit stops a night or dressing after a shower require the negotiation of narrow stairs. The neighborhood is a combination of older homes with similarly small apartments and single family dwellings all on deeply treed blocks. In the morning, commuters head to nearby bus stops or the 34th (or 40th) street subway stations and students of nearby Drexel and U Penn walk to interesting campuses. A bit of exploring can turn up a few good restaurants (Sabrina's, Distrito) and a grocery store. Downtown via the subway is minutes away. Parking can be dicey as most blocks have permit or two hour limits. With luck, a space on the far side of 37th street across from the apartment's entrance may be open and there are no restrictions. The apartment offers a satisfying home base for exploring Philadelphia. (Don't miss the magnificent organ recital at downtown's Macys every day but Sunday at noon and 5:30.)"
2018-08-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is great however there are a number of things that leave you wanting more. The smell upstairs - old house and smoky smell - was off putting.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The instructions to find the place is very easy to understand!
The place looked just as advertised and was very clean.
The host was very responsive."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described and exactly what we were looking for for our one night in Philly. Great location, and free street parking was the best part. Beautiful and cozy home. We had a very comfortable night’s sleep. Would absolutely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like a hotel room, but much cozier and personal. Great location. Very clean. Responsive hosts."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at Matthew’s! The area is close to everything. The unit itself is as shown on pictures. Easy to find and very cute! Very accommodating when we needed to get in a little earlier than checkin. Only issue was the neighbor upstairs can get a little loud but Matthew was able to help us address the issue very quickly! I definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing studio perfect for a couple days’ stay for a concert I was in town for! The mini fridge had a tiny freezer too I was grateful for cause I have chronic illnesses and had to bring all my own food.
Parking is annoying but it’s Philly not the Airbnb’s issue lol. The instructions on finding the entrance were perfect I found it easily.
Only thing is a couple of the coffee cups were a little dirty still, and the hamper was full of dirty linens, I thought that was weird. Otherwise the place was spotless.
It wasn’t listed to be expected but there were no dishes/utensils available just one of each would’ve been nice.
Overall great stay, the bed is SO comfortable, and the TV is easy to use. Would definitely book again. :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Came for an event at the Fillmore and the room was an amazing place to stay. Very cozy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay and will definitely book again! There’s so much to do within walking distance. Parking on the street was a breeze for us. The airbnb was comfortable, cozy, and super clean. The extra touches of coffee and bathroom products were very convenient. 10/10 - we had a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matthew was a great host and the place was very comfy. It was a little noisier than I expected but the complimentary earplugs were put to good use so wasn't much of an issue. Public transport options were really convenient as I was traveling downtown a lot. Would stay again if I am back in Philly!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matthew was a great host! Super flexible and responsive. Everything is exactly as described and listed. Lovely and comfortable place :)

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,walking distance to a lot of great places. went to urban village brewery and enjoyed it. parking a bit difficult but front st parking lot is close by.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication. It will take time to find a parking spot. Since we were warned it was fine. Loved the little touches
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Philly! Was super close to a ton of good restaurants! Also was within walking distance of the Fillmore where we were seeing a show! Would definitely stay there again next time we are in Philly for a concert.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best spot!!! So clean and well-decorated. They are great hosts! Super close to bowling, venues, and great food and public art. Perfect location for concert-goers!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew’s place was very clean and right by a lot of cool restaurants/cafes. This place is not for light sleepers. Neighbors may get noisy from time to time, (to be fair it was St. Patrick’s Day weekend) but Matthew was able to address the issue. Overall good experience. Also the coffee was a nice touch. Much appreciated."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A solid place to stay for a night or two and it’s in a very up and coming area
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great place to stay! Great neighborhood and very walkable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Even larger and nicer than it appears in the photos. Everything was very clean. Plenty of cool places to walk around to. We went to Suraya and it blew us away.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthew’s place was great. We were in the area for a show at the Filmore. It was an easy walk from his place to the venue. Lots of awesome restaurants in the area. Matthew was a great host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect size for a short getaway to the city! Less then a minute walk to restaurants, bars, and fun! If you are just looking for a place to sleep, get clean, and be close enough this is it!
It's the city, there is no where to park, drop your stuff at the place than park at Target. On the walk back you can see all the places to go in the evening!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and comfortable stay in a great neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again. Vaulted ceilings make the room feel much larger than in photos.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 host and location
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good price for amenities and location
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Parking was rough but everything else was great. Follow the check in instructions to a T.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic room in a cool spot of Philly. Great for a weekend trip!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay. Very good location. Surrounded with many restaurants, bars, and concert theater like The Fillmore Theater."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely little pad! The lack of a full kitchen may be a limitation for some, but the little mini-fridge/coffee station was enough for my needs. The host provides lots of very clear instructions on how to find the place and get in and such. I highly recommend this cozy spot when you need a place to stay in Northern Liberties."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay! It’s around the corner from a busy area with tons of restaurants and bars, but I didn’t experience much excess noise - just what you’d expect from a city. Matthew provided excellent directions to find the location and made checking in and out a breeze. The room was also clean and the blackout curtains are a fantastic touch. Will definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and room!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for those looking just for a spot to sleep at night. The space itself was comfortable and relaxing. Parking in and around the rental is difficult. I would recommend downloading and using a parking app before arriving.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot in a hip part of Philly within walking distance of bars, restaurants and several music venues. I’m a touring musician and needed a last minute place to stay for one night in town and was lucky enough to find Matthew’s charming little studio the night before my visit. Matthew was a great host and I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, Matthew’s place was even nicer than the photos. It was like a really nice hotel room, but more personal/homier. Everything was brand new and spotless. The bathroom was super nice and brand new.
The ceilings were probably 15ft? Which added to the luxurious feeling. The space had a huge window (behind those lush velvet curtains) which wasn’t obvious to me from the photos somehow.
We were here for one night for a show and then went to dinner. We were able to walk to both places. Super conveniently located.
Matthew was really helpful with making check in super easy and even provided a map showing which streets are good to park on. We were able to find parking easily an around the corner.
All in all it was exactly what we needed. A lovely comfortable getaway for the night that let us experience a great neighbourhood in Philly like we were locals.
Thanks Matthew!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at Matthew’s place. It looks even better in person than it does in the listing. Will be coming back next time I need easy, comfortable accommodations in Philly."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthew’s place was a great stay! He gave great instructions and the place was clean - would def recommend! Street parking was easy to find.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place and location would stay here again without hesitation
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed in Matthew's Airbnb for a weekend getaway, which was perfect. The walk to the train station was very convenient, and the CVS at the corner was only two minutes away. The bed was by far the best part; it was so comfortable and soft! I personally loved the high ceilings, which made the room feel spacious and free. The couch was perfect to sit on and watch movies. The Airbnb door was very close to their neighbor's door, which was a little awkward, but we rarely saw them at all. Still, their neighbors were nice, and the area was peaceful and quiet, besides the typical city noises and occasional people walking by the window. The place overall was very warm and comfortable, and Matthew was extremely responsive. I had several minor issues during my stay, but I was always able to rely on Matthew to respond and help fix or reassure my partner and me about the issues. We had an amazing stay!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place and location, would definitely recommend !"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew’s place was a great getaway location in downtown Philadelphia. Area felt very safe and there were restaurants, groceries, and lots of things to do at a walkable distance. Parking was hard to find and we ended up using Spothero to pay for parking close by. We arrived Saturday afternoon which was probably a busier time of the day in such a central location. Room was very spacious and clean - loved the high ceilings!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great time staying at Matthew’s place. Awesome location with easy access to great restaurants, bars, and neighborhood spots. Great recommendations of things to do around Philly!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matthew's place was perfectly located with lots to do nearby. Helpful instructions made it easy to find and check in. It had everything we needed for a couple nights in the city.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place — close to fish town, pretty easy parking, clean living."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was here for three nights. It was exactly what I needed. Nice shower, very clean place, very comfortable bed. It was pretty easy to find, had no issues with check-in. It's also in a prime spot, there's a lot in the area, it's nearby the El. Parking was difficult, but that's city living, and Uber wasn't expensive to get around nearby. For anyone who is bothered by noise, Matthew's stay is fairly insulated even for Philadelphia, so there was little noise that I noticed. When I eventually come back to Philly I'd definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot for a couple nights with a lot of walkable options. recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little space for an overnight stay in Philly! Would stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Northern Liberties. Great price and a great location (a bit difficult to find the first time if you're new to the area). Walkable to several restaurants.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,matthew’s place was perfect for our quick trip! the location is amazing…easy walk to so many restaurants & the fillmore! matthew was so kind & helpful too.

I will definitely be staying again."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very nice clean place in a quiet neighborhood, with plenty of restaurants nearby. I would totally recommend and stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthews place was exactly as presented and in a great location to The Filmore. Matthew was quick and responsive!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this Airbnb for my birthday weekend. It was an amazing spot, perfect location easy access to city transportation. The inside was as beautiful the decoration and design colors just loved the aesthetics! I left like I was at a home away from home. It’s was clean loved the water in the mini fridge, and the BED was heaven. Walking the city and being able to come back take a hot shower and just lay in bed was amazing slept like a baby! Thank you for an amazing weekend in your Airbnb!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice location, clean, and cozy bed. Would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about this room was exactly what we needed. We were in Philly for a show for one night only. We found parking right outside the door... but it was also a Sunday afternoon. We walked to dinner and took Lyft for $10 (including 40% tip) to the venue. Proximity is everything!!! Easy entry to the room and thank you for the first floor entry. I have asthma and 3 flights of stairs to get to a room is a NO for me.
The only issue was that the cleaner could not get to our room before checking in. Communication was key and we worked it all out before we arrived.
10/10 will def stay again the next time in Philly!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay if you want to explore Philly! Close to some great restaurants & public transport to the city center. Very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom.
Would absolutely recommend this place. ☀️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is really nice. Really high ceilings and cozy decor. We had everything we needed during our stay. Loved that there are restaurants and bars within walking distance and the area felt very safe. My favorite feature was the door lock because we didn’t need to hold on to a key!
Matthew was available for questions and quick to respond. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect location! check in was easy! tons of great bars and restaurants in the area
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew’s place was perfect for one night in the city. The room was a great size for two people and the bathroom was a decent size too. It would be difficult to stay here for more than a few nights though as there is no access to a kitchen (which is noted on the original listing). The location is great but neighbors to the side and above are a bit noisy, but of course out of Matthew’s control. If I come to Philadelphia again, I will definitely look for this place and see if it’s available!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! As described and more spacious than the photos indicate. Clean and comfy and great amenities. Easy check in and great location near all that fish town has to offer. Matthew was even flexible and allowed us to stay an extra hour to have one less hour to kill before our train.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place was a wonderful spot to stay in Philly! It was comfortable, easy to get in and out, and relatively quiet for being in a big city! The private entrance was very nice. Would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As described! No complaints! Perfect place to rest our head for a weekend in Philly and very near some awesome walkable eats and drinks.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kind and responsive! Very cute and cozy on the inside
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot for a quick stay. We didn't need much, so this worked our perfectly. Within walking distance of tons of great restaurants and bars.
Matthew was very easy to communicate with and provided a comprehensive map and directions for check-in, parking and navigating the area. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and cozy place. Location is amazing. Walking distance to nice restaurants, brewery and distillery. Would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would stay again. Spacious unit located close to everything in the surrounding neighborhoods. While there is lots of parking nearby, note that it will take some driving around to find a spot and not all streets nearby are completely free."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Matthew's place. The apt was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to many great eateries. We will definitely stay here again when in Philadelphia!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super comfortable room within walking distance of restaurants, bars, and activities. I only stayed one night, but would have loved to stay longer. The host answered all of my questions. Only improvement I could suggest is a few more k-cups and creamer."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"sort of greater distance from center city, but close to bus stop and of course good uber access. Extremely clean, good quality amenities, plenty of towels, soaps. High quality sleeping with very good bed. only negative is needs a clock."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and an excellent location - Matthew was very communicative and helpful!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place was perfect - beautiful, cozy, private, and in an ideal location. Walkable to tons of stores and restaurants, and an easy neighborhood to park in. Matthew gave great instructions on check-in and check-out and was very available for any questions. Lovely stay, I highly recommend it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice looking place, cosy and clean. Great location, very walkable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew was very accommodating for our last minute weekend trip. Even upon waking up a bit too hungover, he granted us an extra half hour to get out the door which is much appreciated!! the space was so clean and cozy, it just felt like home, and was exactly as pictured!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew’s airbnb was perfect for our stay. The airbnb itself was clean and nicely decorated. He even provided ear plugs to help with noise; however, we did not need them as it was pretty quiet at night. The location was great-only a short walk to the Fillmore. There were also plenty of restaurants located within walking distance. Parking was a bit tricky (as it always is in Philly), but we found free parking approximately 10 minutes away. The whole experience went extremely smoothly, and I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect little spot! This was my first time using Airbnb and they were beyond helpful. Thanks so much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay! Super clean. Bed was comfortable. Loved the decor, was a very cozy place. Also very thankful for the ear plugs that were provided! Was able to sleep through the night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew’s place was great! Super helpful instructions, and we were able to find free overnight street parking, and walk to the Fillmore. Place itself was super clean and well decorated. It was a little noisy at night because you are on the ground level in a busy area, but we could still sleep just fine."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location great host
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time staying here. We needed a last minute spot and this place was exactly what we were looking for. Very clear with instructions and a clean space. A great find in the Philly area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Convenient location. Nice space.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew’s condo was just right for our stay in Philly. The only suggestion I have is to put better lighting in and spare bathroom paper goods. We ran out.
The place was clean and comfortable. We would recommend this condo."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome host. Quick to respond. Clean and very comfortable. Great location..
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place was great! It was very clean and comfortable, and located within walking distance to lots of restaurants in Fishtown. The neighborhood felt safe to walk around, even at night. Parking was challenging as only street parking is available, but Matthew provided clear instructions on where we could park so it was doable. We had a slight issue with the door locks not working, but Matthew was immediately responsive to our questions and had the issue resolved within the next few hours. I'd definitely consider staying here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s a beautiful spot within walking distance of a lot of restaurants and bars. I loved that there is a CVS right around the corner because I forgot to bring a few toiletries and was able to grab some.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Matthew's place. Location is great and the apartment had everything we needed for a weekend stay. We had some difficulty with the door lock as you had to line the doorframe up perfectly for the bolt to go in correctly but we figured it out. Thanks for having us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the location,clean room, huge space, and right by some great places to eat! Would love to return :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location of this Airbnb was absolutely fantastic! Super walkable in for the Fishtown area and within a few steps of a coffee shop and restaurants. The furniture and bed were comfortable as well!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to crash for couple of days. The communication was smooth. The place is clean and tidy. Everything met my expectation!
Message for other guests; Matthew’s place is located in the big multifamily complex so be sure to read his descriptions/guidebook as you can’t depend much on google map. This new construction doesn’t have the best sound insulation so be prepared to hear people walk by outside or use the ear plugs that Matthew provided."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very affordable place that was well located with a lot of quality local restaurants and public transportation nearby. There is quite a bit of new construction in the surrounding area which I believe led to the confusion on location. We enjoyed our stay and will certainly consider booking with Matthew again if heading to Philly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthews suite was comfortable and thoughtfully put together. We would recommend it for anyone looking for a place to stay in North Liberty.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here and Matthew was a great host!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Matthew's place for a few days while at a conference at the nearby Fillmore and highly recommend it! He was a great host - I appreciated his flexibility letting me check in a bit early, as well as the carefully prepared guide to the area. Check-in/out were easy.
The location was fantastic - easy walk to the venues, restaurants, pharmacy, and public transport (though I didn't use the latter, it was close by). The neighborhood is charming, with lots of cute cafes and tree-lined streets.
The place itself was spacious, comfortable, and well-maintained. The bed and couch were comfortable, especially after full days running around at a conference. As the description says, there is no kitchen (I had no time for cooking anyhow!) but there is a roomy mini-fridge, Keurig machine, and microwave if needed - though again, there are a ton of places to eat nearby.
If you want to stay in comfortable place in a cool neighborhood, this is it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthew was a superb host! The Place is very quaint and it does feel like a personal room. It does get noisy but it’s kind of a part of the experience (plus there were earplugs to use). 10/10 would do again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don't think about it. Book it !
... Now ..."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great AirBnB, extremely clean and the host was responsive and accommodating!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,-
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matthew's place is a perfect little crash pad if you are staying in that area. For me it worked out great because it was exceptionally close to my daughter's apartment and made my stay much easier. I do have to say that philly is not a quiet city. It is very loud on the streets at night.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Matthew’s apartment was awesome for our night stay in Philly. It was very clean, looked like the photos posted, and in an amazing neighborhood. Lots of restaurants, cute parks, grocery store & coffee shops! This area is very walkable. The apartment smelled great- meaning no smell, no fragrance, no over powering smell of an air freshener or cleaning products- more of a fresh- clean feeling!
We were given very clear instructions upon arrival- very easy to get into apartment. Door was a little sticky to shut- my only complaint was that price. It’s the most I’ve ever paid for a one night stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Would go back. Great neighborhood and clean place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the space.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Perfect location. As advertised. Very nice spot. Thank you Matthew.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the place to be in fish-town. Private room with private entrance was the best. Big and spacious and accommodations were amazing. Will love to stay here again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable and convenient
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Central location. Definitely would come back!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our time at Matthew's place! We were in town for a show at The Fillmore and it was so convenient to walk. Matthew's clear instructions were super helpful when looking for parking and finding the entrance. The room itself was gorgeous and so comfortable. We would absolutely love to stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First and foremost, no issues with the space. It was very nicely accommodated and in a (mostly) great location, especially as I was in town for the Beer and Metal festival at the Fillmore, which is an easy 8-minute walk away.
The real negatives had nothing to do with the host or space, but were the parking situation and the lack of late-night amenities in the area. Parking is basically all street parking with hourly restrictions for anyone who doesn’t have a permit. I frequently travel to places like Philly and NYC (and live near DC and so frequently park there) and typically either have some local garage or lot availability nearby, but that was not the case here. There was a public lot a few blocks away, but after I finally figured out how to get into the open entrance, I was told the lot was closed that day (a Friday). It took me 46 minutes to find a street spot that had no limitations.
Also, there are no late-night convenience stores around, so plan for that if you’ll be out late."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"highly recommend for a show at the Fillmore, or just a base to branch out and explore. everything was exactly as described, location great, parking was pretty simple, and place was super quiet."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Picked Matthew’s place based on the fact it was only a short walk to my son’s apt, who I was visiting for the weekend and it wasn’t a far drive to the Met, where we saw 2 concerts. I was very lucky to find parking on same street and did have some trouble finding the place, even using the app, but I have to say it was my fault because I was concentrating on finding the apartment number on the door instead of following the instructions and looking at the pictures. I contacted Matthew, who immediately came to my assistance and pointed me to the right door, of course which I was already standing close by to. Loved the place, which was so convenient to walk to local restaurants and breweries. My son and I went to Urban Village Brewery and Other Half Brewery the first night and had a great lunch the next day at Middle Child Clubhouse, they had great mimosas and pastrami sandwiches. Be warned, no matter how quiet I was coming back after the shows, the dog next door barked alot."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spacious one bedroom. It was easy to get in and out and explore the city. I liked there was a TV to watch and relax when you came back home.
The dog next door does startle you at first, but you get used to it. I wish there were an iron since there is an ironing board. I did have an issue where I washed a stain and needed to iron it but discovered it wasn't there. This would help make the experience even better.
I would suggest adding an electric kettle so you could have instant noodles at home if you want to. Good experience over all."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was comfortable, had nice decor, and all the amenities we needed. The host was incredibly through with directions, instructions, and information on the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation was clean and there were many convenient facilities around. There are CVS, supermarkets, and subway stations nearby!
However, I used Maps and Airbnb Maps, but I wandered around for an hour. I couldn't find Matthew's accommodation notice in the process of automatic translation into another language.
☆Make sure to press the ""Key Icon"" on the accommodation page! There is a detailed and friendly accommodation location notice in the key icon.☆
Matthew's quick reply and kind visit allowed me to enter the accommodation. Thank you so much for your nice response.
The accommodation was good. The interior was pretty and the bed was comfortable. If I visit Philadelphia again, I would like to stay here again :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this bnb is perfect if you like trendy bars, restaurants, and breweries. There are so many great places within walking distance - our favourite being Urban Village Brewery. The train is close by and you can access downtown, the fashion district, etc, so easily. We did have trouble finding parking but ended up using the paid lot which was pretty close. By fault of my own, I had trouble finding the entrance to the place, but just listen to Matt when he says to download the app because there are step by step instructions lol! I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was even better than described in the listing. Very easy to enter and check in. The room was very spacious, and clean, with bright large windows. It had all amenities. The bathroom was equally large and clean. The location was good as well, and quiet at night. It is an up-and-coming area with many little shops and restaurants around. Great place to stay. Matthew, the host, was very polite and responded on time."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew was a very responsive host. The apartment has a private entrance but is actually more like an ""in-laws suite""--there is also an entrance connecting it to the main residence which does not lock from the side of the rental space. There is also no kitchen. This was not super clear from the listing, but Matthew made sure we were aware when confirming the booking. The place still met all of our needs, so we kept the booking. It was clean, well-appointed, well-decorated, convenient to great restaurants and coffee shops. Good value for the price. Thanks Matthew!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely stay! The pictures did the space no justice — it was surprisingly spacious, very clean, and I loved the decor. We chose this spot because we were attending a concert at The Fillmore which was a ~10 minute walk away. There was street parking nearby and the host provided a helpful map to assist in the search. We only stayed one night, but I was able to
leave my car the entire time without a problem. Fishtown is very walkable and we were able to enjoy plenty of yummy food in our 24 hours in the city. I definitely recommend this AirBNB and would consider staying here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful space; exactly as described. Really comfortable bed/linens and couch. Helpful to have curtains that darkened room. Would stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Couldn’t hear the hosts from their apartment which was great given I’ve had that experience before. Beautifully decorated, cozy and perfect for a short stay in philly."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was wonderful! The owner responded instantly and is very nice.
Pros:
- The place actually seems much bigger than the photos, it has high ceilings and is very spacious!
- Extremely cleanly and decorated very nicely.
- Has a microwave, mini fridge, many lighting options, fan options, smart TV- all very easy to use.
- The bed is extremely comfortable
- Provided a designated “makeup” wash cloth- much appreciated!
- Nice shower w/ shampoo, conditioner, body soap.
- Lots of great restaurants/ activities within close walking distance.
- Was actually easy to find close-by street parking.
- Easy to find
- Worth the price
Things to be warned of (very minor):
- Relatively loud mornings (for lighter sleepers) due to construction
- If you are spooked by dogs- neighbors have a frequently barking large dog!
- Door is difficult to open (at first)- you have to REALLY push on it! Like linebacker style!
Overall a great stay. Absolutely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location to explore Fishtown and other parts of the city. Just a 5-7 minute walk from the metro. The place was clean and had everything we needed. The host was flexible and allowed us to leave our bags past check-out time. The only thing to note is that there was some construction across the street, so it was not the quietest in the morning. Overall great value for the stay, though."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay, near some great restaurants and room was well decorated and furnished"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matthew’s place was super clean and cozy. Great place to stay for the night!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. The apartment above was noisy until after 1am. I would assume that is not always the case though.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here after a show at the Fillmore, very easy walk to and from the venue. The room was very clean and quite nice, the bed was very comfortable. Easy check in and check out."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect. Simple as that.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was large, airy and pleasantly decorated. The location was excellent and surprisingly quiet (for the most part) given the central location. I did have a problem finding the entrance but Matt was able to help and i dont think it would have been an issue if i'd had the app. for Abnb. The mini-fridge and microwave came in handy even if we were eating out most of the time. There is some construction going on nearby and the road was actually closed briefly at the time I checked out, normally traffic is light and not a problem due to the new road design. I would stay there again if I was in the area."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was in town for a concert at the Fillmore and Matthew’s was a great place to stay—easy walking distance to the venue, many restaurants, and even the train! I felt safe and comfortable in the apartment and will definitely look to book again next time I’m in town."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew’s place is exactly as described, actually better! The high ceilings mixed with the wonderful decor in the room made the space feel open, friendly and cozy all at once.
The place was very clean, private and the bed extra comfy. Matthew is a great communicator and the place was just perfect for my stay.
Will definitely look to stay again when I am in Philly."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Room was beautiful !! Very clean & welcoming. Matthew was very responsive, and upon our arrival, he came out right away to greet us and showed us how to enter our room. Would highly recommend staying here 😊"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Northern Liberties neighborhood. Central to all types of bars and food options. There’s a Giant neighborhood grocery just a 3 minute walk away. Being that it’s located next to a busy road, it’s actually relatively quiet. Place was clean and perfect for a 2 night stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay! Suited our needs perfectly. The room is big and nicely decorated. Comes with microwave and fridge and coffee machine. Super comfortable bed. Big bathroom. Its very clean and comfortable. Perfect location 1 minute walk from a busy street with tons of bars and restaurants. I'll definitely be coming again. Matthew is very friendly and helpful!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great experience and looking forward to my next stay here in philadelphia. The location is amazing and was an easy way to The Filmore and a lot of other restaurants and bars. It was also super close to grocery stores and convenience stores for other items I needed to buy.
The place was clean and easy to access. Amazing part of this was it’s listed as a Private Room but it felt like I had the entire space to myself. As it stated in the description, I had access to my own private bathroom and my own private entrance, so it really felt like my own space without bumping or interacting with others."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great stay overall! The people at the front desk are incredibly nice, polite, and super helpful! The rooms are also nice"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at the Mint House a few times and love it! The apt is always clean and the location is perfect . We can walk to many restaurants and stores . The balcony is great, especially at night when you can see all the city lights.
We will be back again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"liked my stay, might actually stay there again next time.
Felt like being at home"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Mint House was great! It felt clean and well maintained. Nice activity on the ground floor with restaurant, bar and coffee house. But did not find it noisy. Check in was easy at the front desk. Staff very friendly and willing to offer help in any way. Broad Street train station & bus stops right outside the doors. Found this a very pleasant and convenient place to stay and would stay there again."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I loved my stay overall 9/10. Parking is terrible but that’s normal for broad st. I would book again and invest in paying the extra fee for parking. The hotel in general was beautiful and the staff was so helpful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super responsive host and clean/comfortable apartment unit. I’ll definitely be coming back

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put, fantastic stay. The apartment was spotless, which is something that is harder to find these days. Welcomed with snacks and a nice large tv. It was probably one of the best places I’ve stayed at, period. The proximity to the BSL means all of Philadelphia is at your fingertips within minutes. The woman who checked me in was so kind that she led me to the elevator and showed me how to use it. What a gem."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a place to stay that offers a peaceful atmosphere without being too far removed from the excitement, this is the perfect choice. The cleanliness of the space is impeccable, and the decor is tasteful and inviting. I can't wait to come back here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot in a hotel type building. Parking is not free. Subway is 100 yards away and convenient. The restaurant onsite is an amazing Italian spot! 5 stars! Walls are thin and be mindful of being near trash chute. Can be disturbing. For a 2 night stay it was perfect for a couple. Would stay again; with parking being the one variable to consider
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place! Would definitely return to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was a fantastic stay. the building is awesome, the units are incredibly clean. fabulous location with lots of street parking and very easy address to the broad street line. my ONLY complaint was some issues communicating with whoever was answering messages on the air bnb app - they gave a lot of incorrect information. however, minthouse staff was readily available via telephone to correct this.
cannot wait to stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was terrific! When we arrived, our room was clean and had treats like water, snacks, etc. Our room was on the 10th floor, which wasn't a problem, and it felt nice and private! Would love to stay again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rooms are very nice and clean. Parking in the street was easy. The staff were friendly and informative. We would def revisit if we decide to come back to Philadelphia
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Loft was so nice to stay in. Place was clean, smelled great when we walked in; my wife and I felt right at home. The lobby was also aesthetically pleasing.
The bed was comfortable and linens were fresh and clean. When you check in you might want to turn the boiler on so you’ll have hot water when you’re ready for a shower (was located in an easily accessible spot).
Parking was a hassle, but once we found a spot down the street, we just took a Lyft or walked wherever we needed to go until it was time to leave. There’s so much to do in the area!
They provided silverware, cups, plates, coffee and coffee machine, tea kettle and tea, pretty much everything you need.
The club downstairs could be heard from our room on the fourth floor, but we didn’t mind the noise. They did provide ear plugs though just in case lol.
Overall was a great experience and we’d definitely book again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for what we were in town for. It was a walking distance from the Met and from many restaurants/bars, and any essentials you need. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was like a little apartment inside of a hotel. Very nice and clean and spacious. Had restaurants and coffee shop in the lobby which was convenient. Only downside is parking but that’s Philly.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. Very stylish and clean. Would def return.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room and location are really great. So many restaurants and shops within walking distance and parking around the block was easy. The only thing that was off was that the electricity in the bedroom didn’t seem to work. Wasn’t a big deal though we easily got around it
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to stay in Philadelphia! ￼ Feels like your own cozy home. The service was great, the amenities were perfect and everything you would need is provided for you! Can’t recommend enough!!!￼"

I was so relaxed I did not want to leave. The check in was so easy and the staff were very polite and answered any questions I had.
There is no parking onsite but I got lucky the whole time I stayed and found parking on the side of the building. I definitely would recommend staying here and I definitely will be back but a longer stay."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great clean and lovely place will definitely return in the future
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hotel is very gorgeous. The vintage/antic look was beautiful. The only complaint is how loud it could be at times. At night, we were on the fourth floor and we could still hear the club in the basement. Because of our age, we didn’t really mind it but at times it was frustrating. Took many pretty photos of the hotel and was satisfied. The beds are super comfy!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice apartment. The building was nice and the restaurant staff inside of the hotel were friendly too. Great experience.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked a last minute stay here for my boyfriend’s birthday and it was worth it. The place was easy to check into, only issue you might have is finding parking depending on the day/time you go. Other than that check in was easy, you just show your Id. The lobby workers even gifted me a bottle of champagne after I told them what I was celebrating. There’s also a restaurant inside of the building and a small bar/club area at the bottom. Overall the apartment was super clean and nice and definitely would book again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely love this place. Super clean with a beautiful lobby. Lots to do close by! There’s a small breakfast/lunch spot connected. This place was super accommodating. There was no garage parking close by so we had a walk a few blocks but there is other options. I will definitely stay again!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and historical building with beautifully renovated apartments. We really enjoyed our stay here. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The only thing I will mention is that the building is LOUD. We could hear everything the people above us were doing- could literally hear them going to the bathroom. Walls are paper thin, but other than that- highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pleasant stay

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Hotel!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Mint House was everything the previous reviews mentioned. Very helpful staff, great location and next to an Aldi grocery store in the event of a long term stay. Easy to find parking on the street, spacious apartment, free wifi, and large walk in closet. It felt like a home away from home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay! It was such a beautiful and clean apartment, I really did feel like at home. The check-in was smooth and the front desk people were kind. Parking was difficult as there is not much street parking, and a parking lot nearby was confusing with its hours… but aside from that, I would 100% stay here again if I was in Philadelphia."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, safe area, pretty close to just about everything I wanted to do while visiting!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The reservation was so easy to make and once I got to the main hotel giving them a name and showing them my ID was easy for check in I was immediately give him my key and tell with my room with that and instructions on how to get in. Once I enter the room it was a nice warm feeling it was comfortable it was relaxing and it was clean. The only thing I didn’t understand was the TV their Internet was not working for two days the connection with and link but other than that I had a wonderful peaceful relaxing time. I would definitely book this room again and recommend it to anyone
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect stay for a business trip!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,HVAC thermostat was a bit too sophisticated. was difficult figuring out how to turn the temperature up

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. It was very clean and it felt like home. Check-in was a breeze. I have no complaints. Highly recommend staying here…. I will definitely be back. Thank you Mint House :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located in the historic Divine Lorraine Hotel, this space is a step into Philadelphia history. The Daily coffee shop had great lattes and pastries. The restaurant, Chicala, has delicious food and drinks. The apartment has arched windows and exposed brick that makes the space feel special. Great communication with the host. I also liked the Public Goods products in the kitchen and bathroom. Overall an incredible space and I will definitely be visiting again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"You can easily get anywhere, either on foot or by subway."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed with Mint House before and had a good experience. This time the apartment was very different to the photos. I assume it’s top floor vs lower and this apartment was quite dark. The building reception team was friendly and helpful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay, loved the area"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I booked this apartment for an extended stay and loved it! The place looks exactly like the photos, the host was responsive when I had questions, and they have a café plus a notable restaurant inside. The Wifi was spotty at times but would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"An amazing solution for a longterm stay in Philadelphia. The apartment by itself was so beautiful, it had all the amenities needed and even some complimentary stuff. It was a ~15 walk to City Center, and there are also a subway station and a grocery store right next to the building. I felt pretty safe since it is right on Broad Street, there is a 24-hour reception and you have to put in a code to get inside the building, the elevator and the appartment.
The stuff is amazing and was really helpful every time I needed assistance."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Nice location and great place for a long stay. I stayed here for a month and I was able to find all I needed within a walking distance. The only problem was the apartment was missing a lot of commodity. I would definitely stay here next time i visit Philly.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The room was beautiful, clean, and lovely to stay in. The front desk almost always had someone there. Very good experience!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I spent a month here for work. The unit itself was fantastic: large, spacious and well-equipped with everything you need for a long term stay. The internet download speed exceeded 200 Mbps which was great. This is a renovated hotel with a cafe and a restaurant on the first floor. There is also a reception so I was able to have things shipped to me during my stay and pick them up there.
There is an ALDI right next to the hotel so that was convenient for groceries. The hotel is a few miles north of Center City so you will need to either walk, bike (there's a bike-share nearby) or take the metro which is next to the hotel to get to the center. All-in-all, it was a good experience and would recommend this place if you don't mind not being in the heart of center city"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice property. I really loved the full kitchen with all of the supplies included. The in unit laundry was also very convenient. It felt like I was in my own little apartment. Will be visiting again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was great. It's actually renting a room at the Sheraton hotel (which is clear when booking the room), but was also great because you got all the amenities and assurances of a hotel stay. The room was good, with two beds, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location was also walkable to many attractions in Philly, and it was also easy to catch a bus or rideshare when needed. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, although be noted that it is within a hotel (which was quite pleasant)."

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"To be honesn't there was nothing that made this airbnb stand out - just the basics of a hotel. No Continental breakfasts, not great wifi. We were put in a room that had a door connected to another room and multiple times the next door neighbors tried to open it when they were intoxicated. Woke us up many times. You could hear everything your neighbors were doing - also woke us up often. We were also backed up to the elevators and stairs so we heard them going outside. We also had someone enter our room when we had not checked out to clean which was frustrating. We ended up packing up immediately and leaving to the airport. area had good food around it - Rex's was our favorite. We also enjoyed Nom Wah (a dim sum place). The hosts were communicative, but sometimes it felt like too much. I know coming in when a conference in town can be a lot, and stressful on room accommodations, but I expected a bit moren- next time I'll look more into booking so we avoid coming in during a conference."

Every time I departed my room, I noticed that the door was ajar even when I slammed close. I communicated with the hotel staff and they stated that the door was damaged.

The room is great for 2-3 people with very comfortable beds, very clean room and all facilities a tourist like me would require for a few days' stay. Check in was smooth at the front desk.

There were a few small inconveniences like the tv not working well (even after maintenance tried to fix it) and having to look around for the ice machine the first night. (Although there were signs pointing to ice machines, only a few floors actually had them.) Other than that, this was a great place to stay. Everything was very clean, and beds were the best — super cozy and comfortable! Nice water pressure in the shower too. All the employees we interacted with down in the lobby area were very friendly and helpful, and restaurants and tourist attractions were just a short walk away. Thanks for having us! :)"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'm still not sure what the exact deal is considering this is a Sheraton Hotel. I ended up parking the Garage and it was $78 for two days of parking. Anywho, I stayed here with my family for a Half marathon that was this past weekend. It was walkable (.70 miles to start line) to Eakins oval. We were able to find decent pizza, snacks, and family friendly dinner close by. The hotel room was quiet, even by the elevators. We were on the third floor, same as the gym, and didn't notice any extra noises from people or the streets. House keeping did come in at some point while we were out and about in the morning. I'd consider staying here again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time booking a hotel thru Airbnb. It was essentially the same, except with a host that would answer all questions!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was able to check in early which was super helpful! Very responsive and made sure everything was perfect. Also walkable to so many places. Would stay again. Thanks so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super responsive host, right in the city. I was a bit confused about booking with a hotel via Airbnb, but I was super easy and I just checked in at the desk. Great staff and didn’t have any issues while I was there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who grew up in a Victorian home, I jumped at the opportunity to stay at such a historic property! This was the perfect cozy getaway for my fiancé and I’s anniversary. Walkable to so many delicious restaurants, and of course all of the sites in Philly’s Old City. Would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely quirky and loved the idea of staying here with so much history was awesome.
I would have liked bottled water I. The fridge, we ran out of what we had brought with us. I just used a coffee mug and filled it in the bathroom sink. But, water in the mini fridge would have been a huge plus.
Expect low ceiling and narrow steps my husband is 6’ tall and tapped his head as we were packing. 🤭 I am quite curious about how the alcove came about where the bed is and how it was used.
Yes, you will hear the toddler and people upstairs. It’s to be expected since this is the cellar.
Love this historical spot and happy we got the chance to stay here. TY for sharing your space with others."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The space was great for the fun quirkiness and the history associated with it. Could better if was cleaner and updated a bit. microwave and something that could dispense water other than bathroom sink or provide water bottles. Also provide pillows and sheet for couch (futon)
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, right downtown on a beautiful part of the historic street."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patrick’s place is walking distance to shopping, restaurant's, bars, and waterfront.
Perfect location. It’s located on one of the oldest streets in the US.
The Wine Cellar room was very rustic and cozy. The room decorations reflected Philadelphia’s history. My favorite part was the robes. (You will have to rent the room to see them)
Definitely go back"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved Patrick’s place. Perfect location. So many great restaurants in walking distance. Can’t wait to go back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re coming to see the history and sites this is the place to stay! Everything is walkable and you’re staying right in history! So fun!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great stay - most unique airbnb we've ever stayed in, and it is so close to everything. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go both days without even using the subway/uber. Perfect hub for Philly adventures!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique space as described, really enjoyed our short stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd been looking forward to this stay for months, and the place did not disappoint. I'm a huge history nerd and I work in real estate, so this lil' wine cellar was right up my alley (pun totally intended)! The bed was SUPER cozy and I'd have stayed in it all day if I could have. 10/10 recommend and I hope to be back for another visit! Thanks, Patrick! :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and feel apart of the Philadelphia’s history! Within walking distance to tons of restaurants and the Independence hall park. Super comfortable bed. Would stay again

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really great location and felt like we had an 1700s experience with modern day luxury (coffee, hot water, electricity..). :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a unique and exciting place to stay in the heart of historic Philadelphia with a cool vibe! The space was very clean and I appreciated the dehumidifiers to minimize the potential musty smell of being in a cellar.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really fun and unique place to stay. It’s a little loud during the day because the upstairs neighbors have young kids and a dog, but quiet at night and I slept like a log. The bed is comfy! It’s rustic for sure, but a cool experience indeed. It wasn’t creepy, as I thought it might be. The area is great and it was neat to stay on such a historic street."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful experience. Clean place. So much history. Patrick was a great host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, no problems whatsoever."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. It was cozy and clean and pretty awesome. Patrick was friendly and responsive with messaging. The neighborhood was cool and with lots to do and easy to get around. There was a subway station down the road and the parking garage we parked in was a few blocks away. We walked to the Reading Market about 20 minutes away. There are good places for lunch/dinner/drinks, as well as breakfast and coffee right around the area. Everything was lovely. Definitely recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay!! Such a unique, historic street and neighborhood. Truly couldn’t recommend enough!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay in a historical street. If your a history buff. You will like this stay. The host was 10/10. Check in was good. Plus a solid price. Would recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at this Airbnb on Elfreth's Alley was nothing short of magical. Nestled in the heart of Philadelphia's historic district, this charming accommodation effortlessly blends comfort with the rich tapestry of American history. The hosts were exceptionally attentive and accommodating. This spot is a rare gem that offers convenience and historical intrigue."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just incredible. An absolute gem in a city full of gem. I’ll be back for sure in the future!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staying in such a historic place was on our bucket list and this place did not disappoint. The aesthetic was perfect! Patrick was very responsive and accommodating.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would book again in a heartbeat. Learning the history of your surroundings, and then being able to stay within that history makes for a memorable experience. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay for a show at The Fillmore! My husband and I had a great night and slept well. We’d definitely stay here again, and enjoyed the historical setting!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great price for a historic experience! Host was super helpful. We loved Philadelphia. Overall, it was an awesome stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patrick’s place is a hidden gem in an historical part of Philly. If you are a history buff like me this studio would be the place for you. It’s a really neat and quiet place. I would definitely return on our next visit.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My mother and I stayed at Patrick's place for a few days and had a lovely time. The absolute best part is the location. The actual space is very cool and you feel like you're back in time. It's small, but I think it's perfect for people who are wanting to explore the city and be able to come back to a historic area. It's a little quirky - a bit dusty, and you can hear every step that happens upstairs, but I would still highly recommend this spot. Patrick was very flexible, letting us check in early and leave our bags to pick up later after check out time and we so appreciate that."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay - so cozy and comfortable!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good location
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot for a quick getaway! Thanks Patrick!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Awesome location.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patrick is a great host and theres a ton of stuff in walking distance. It is a basement from 200 years ago tho so do not have high expectations! But overall a very cool experience !
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything went great!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a unique opportunity to stay in a wine cellar on the oldest continuous residential street in the nation! Did it feel like a wine cellar? Yes, but that made it all the more interesting and cool."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed here during our weekend trip to Philly. It was exactly as described and so, so unique! Definitely would recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a fun little getaway place. The place was very cozy and warm. The bed was very comfortable. I really loved the lighting
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely a cozy little hideaway in Philadelphia!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay right in the heart of Old City. Wicked walkable area, parking was a breeze, and the space is stunning."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This historical lovely rental is in a lovely location, situated on the oldest habitable street in the US. It’s gorgeous, clean, cozy and close to everything Philly has to offer. Patrick was an amazing host and anyone would be lucky to stay in this repurposed wine cellar! Thanks again."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Staying in a historic home is extremely special and should be done as often as possible! Elfreths Alley is a moment glued in time. It is also a lovely and incredibly convenient part of the city - close to anything you may want or need.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A Unique space , that was walkable to everything in a historical location."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I adored this location! it was so warm and cozy
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay! Easy to find and on a very cute street. In a neighborhood with alot of things to do as well. The host was responsive in the chat.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing location in the heart of Old City! The stay in this AirBnB is a treasure itself. We had a rainy afternoon on one of the days of our stay and still felt like we were experiencing colonial Philadelphia while spending some time inside. Great and easy host, great place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stay was great. Interesting, unique place (though not for tall people!) and an incredible location. Great communication. Would stay again"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Terrific location, right by Old City but the block itself is very quiet. Best of both worlds as it were. My girl and I tend toward the goth, so we really dug the cellar-ish vibe of the cellar. Sweet spot, fun atmosphere, if this is your thing."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cool and fun place! Being a shorter person I didn’t mind the tight squeezes. The only downside was the dog from upstairs barking in the morning, since my friend and I wanted to sleep in. Other than that we had a great time and would recommend this place for someone looking for an out of the ordinary space to stay! Location was ideal"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was absolutely beautiful and comforting. I will say the family staying upstairs makes slight noise but not too crazy. The place is old I will say that where it accumulates dust easily so if you have a dust allergy bring your Benadryl. Overall, I enjoyed the stay, host was responsive and attentive to needs."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"loved staying here! description is accurate, definitely a cellar but a really cool way to explore old city"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great time staying in this airbnb. It was very cozy and unique and ideally located. Navigating the historic wine cellar was a bit of an adventure though, lots of low ceilings and tight squeezes, so may not be accessible to everyone."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great locations and being able to say we stayed at Elfreths alley is awesome.
But the family upstairs has small children and at least one dog. There IS noise. You can hear everything, so if you are looking for a peaceful restful stay this may not be the place for you.
Also in pics shows a microwave and there isn’t one. Would have been nice to hear up leftovers etc."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patrick's place was a delight! I came to PA to cheer on family members running in the Philly half-marathon. This was the perfect overnight apartment from which to walk to different places on the race route. Being in this quaint old part of the city was very special. The apartment itself offered a most comfortable bed along with everything needed for a short stay in the city.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We are so glad we stayed at this wonderful gem in old city. If you value getting a taste of history while you are here and you need a place to call home base while exploring all Philly has to offer, this is your place. I never thought I would have an opportunity to actually STAY on Elfreth's Alley, which is the oldest residential street in the country. Patrick was a wonderful and responsive host and checkin was so easy. He set the place up to be ultra cozy (just as cozy as it looks in the pictures!) and really lean into the historical feel. The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze so this might not be the place for you if you can't handle stairs, if you are a larger person, or if you don't like occasionally ducking your head. Personally I really hope to stay here again. Our trip was quick and I really wanted to explore 2nd street more! Also note that the location is very convenient to get to the Market Frankford subway line."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice and cozy place in a beatiful area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Charming space. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patrick’s place was a great for our trip to the Halloween event at the Eastern State Penetentiary. The parking lot he recommended was also very convenient.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Patrick's home was an amazing experience ! It looks just like the photos. It was a really fun experience to stay in such a historical place. The Alley was beautiful and had many tourists strolling along. It was fun to be the one's actually staying there!
One small touch that would have helped us a lot would be a small microwave.
Overall, a really fun unique stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful airbnb! Beautiful area!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Completely unique stay in the heart of old city. How can you say no to sleeping in a wine cellar? Loved it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a truly unique experience! A historical address with modern amenities-the decor is fabulous! The bed is extremely comfy. Centrally located so it was equally easy to walk to the Ben Franklin museum as well as an illumination concert we attended at the Seaport Museum. It has a totally cool vibe and I highly recommend it for a stay out of the ordinary!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at this unique Airbnb. It was exactly as described and very comfortable. We’d definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was awesome! So cool. Stairs are tough for bringing luggage down and there isn’t really a kitchen but it’s very cool!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing host went above and beyond
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect venue for a short 2 nights stay if you want to experience something a little different than your ordinary AirB&B (would not recommend more than 2 nights). We knew what we signed up for so we were not disappointed at all! The area felt safe even during the night. Very convenient location as it is close to major tourist attraction (all walk-able distance, we didn't even take public transpiration at all), also it's convenient as there are cafes (Starbucks for example) and grocery stores nearby. The accommodation itself was unique, we didn't have much issue regarding the noise since that is what we already expected (reading reviews from other travelers). Our only issue was that the place may not be squeaky clean, we bought slippers to wear in house and the bed sheets had stains and hair on them. There was also leftover food in the fridge from previous guests but these are all minor issues. Other than that, we love the place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED our stay here! It was amazing being so close to so many iconic pieces of American history. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, the bed was very comfortable and clean, we felt safe waking around at night - the Old City is very lively and people were kind and friendly. I’d stay here again for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It’s beautiful and in a historic neighborhood but there is an undeniable mold smell and problem. It was all around the window by the head board. The bathroom was so bad my eyes were watering brushing my teeth. I woke up with a cough. It was built in the 1700s but I feel like some more public safety measures could have been taken before opening this up to air B and B.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful space and incredible location. Walking distance to all the historic sites, great restaurants, the waterfront, and more. 12min Uber to the airport. Patrick was super friendly and extremely helpful!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patrick’s place was very unique and in walking distance to all the historical sites. I definitely recommend visiting it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, very interesting place. Really interesting for a couple of nights but I wouldn’t want it for a lengthy stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would highly recommend! Incredible location on Elfreth’s Alley and almost all other Philly attractions in walking distance. Loads of character to the flat and and exactly as described
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patrick’s listing is really what AirBnb is about to me. There are not many places like this and to be able to stay here in such rich history is so cool. The space was very comfortable. If you are a little claustrophobic you might have a hard time where the bed is but we were both fine. Highly recommend Oui Bakery just around the corner.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patrick’s space is so unique yet comfortable and cozy. Very clean. Plenty of restaurants, breakfast spots, and bars within walking distance. We would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patrick’s place was perfect for our little night away. He was also very responsive and helpful anytime i messaged him. The place looked just like the pictures, very cool and different from other airbnbs. Great location, felt very safe, Overall a perfect airbnb experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is cozy and unusual and lovely. Perfect for a one night solo stay, awesome location!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool place, you will know what you're getting into by the description and pictures. Small but very unique and worked well for me as a solo traveler, eating out. Thought it was quite clean for being a cellar."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patrick’s place is a really unique stay right in the heart of Old City! Really cool experience!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in a central location!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a special and cozy place right in the heart of olde city Philadelphia!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than the pictures. A very unique experience yet feels at home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying in this sweet lil wine cellar and would live here if I could. The place was as described, easy to find, near a bunch of stuff and very cozy. Loved how comfy the bed was, the easy to use tv and the bathrobe, I felt very relaxed here at the end of a long day of sightseeing. I also loved the amount of character and detail in the decor. The only downfall was getting woken up by dogs barking, so if you’re a light sleeper like me maybe bring a sound machine. Other than that, I truly enjoyed my stay, thank you Patrick!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place ! looked exactly like the pictures. walking distance to all tourist locations and restaurants. It's definitely recommended.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Living history! This place has it all - location, charm, and a great host :)
Patrick was quickly responsive and gave a great recommendation for parking nearby.
The alley really is a walk back in time!
There are plenty of yummy food and grocery options in walking distance.
Plus, you are in a centuries old wine cellar with a bed, wow!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved staying here! It was a cozy little hidden gem on the coolest street in America. Highly recommend. The place was so clean and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. I hope we get to go back soon!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, cozy spot on a beautiful scenic and historic street. Would recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was everything we wanted it to be. We were excited to stay on Elfriths Alley since we are history nerds! Fit our needs for the short stay, easy to access, near everything and very charming!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for solo trips! a neat experience, but - as you should expect - a tight squeeze. Not uncomfortable though!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I wanted a last-minute place to stay on the way through Philadelphia. We wrote to Patrick on our way to Philadelphia from Atlantic City and he got back to us immediately. Our stay was by far the most memorable and unique experience we could have asked for. The location was private, safe, quiet, and surrounded with cafe's, museums, shopping, and more. Parking was simple for the location, and everything was within walking distance. It felt unreal to be staying right underneath so much history. After a busy weekend, our stay was the perfect relaxing finish to our getaway. I would insist anyone traveling the area looking for a lifetime experience should book a stay. Forever thankful for the perfect 30th birthday evening at Patrick's airbnb. 🖤"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A truly special location on a historically preserved block in Olde City. We loved our experience!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I am conflicted. The cellar was an awesome experience. I am claustrophobic and was really worried about being able to stay. I did fine on that part and even the tiny odd bathroom wasn't a problem. The decor was very cool and I absolutely loved the history there. My only problem was kitchen cleanliness. Yes there is a coffee pot but the lid was left open and dirt fell in from the exposed rafters. It looked like it had been gathering dirt for a long time. Also the wine glasses had so much grime on them nobody would want to use them. Dish soap and a sponge would have helped. In the pictures there is a microwave but I didn't see a microwave so I wasn't even able to heat my water for my instant coffee or cook my breakfast that I brought. Also, you can drive in the alley and unload your stuff before taking your vehicle to a parking garage. Wish I had known that before I got there. I would recommend it, but not if you need coffee or food."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing opportunity to stay on such a historic property! I stayed with my mother and we are sure to have memories that will last us a lifetime! Airbnb is as described on listing, however, as this is an antique cellar there is a strong smell of mildew that was very overwhelming, particularly in the back rooms. It was wonderful waking up under the brick archway in the morning, but bed was old and uncomfortable. Bathroom was hard to access as most of it is taken up by stairs. We ended up leaving after one night for something more comfortable. Happy we tried it out though!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a unique stay! Neighborhood and houses were beautiful and interesting.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a fun experience! I would highly recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Patrick’s place was wonderful. It was the perfect location for our stay in Philly. It was great to be surrounded by so much history and a lot of the sights we’re in walking distance. Would definitely stay with Patrick again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cool spot in Old Town. Perfect place to bring the pups and see a show! Would recommend to friends and stay here in the future!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cool converted wine cellar in a historic neighborhood. Definitely not suitable for anyone with accessibility challenges, but if you don’t mind narrow stairs and a lot of steps between rooms it’s well worth the stay. Patrick is friendly and communicative, and the space itself is a comfortable as it is unique!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was EXACTLY as described. instructions were clear. Ambiance perfect. Cozy place for us. We definitely will recommend it and return for future visits! :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay. Great location and so much to do!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool place! It’s definitely an experience unlike anything I’ve experienced with this app!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A historic July 4th stay. The pitter-patter of canine and little people feet provided a haunting touch. Dinner at Cuba Libre included a banana split with fireworks and breakfast at Cafe Ole was tasty. On checkout we were greeted by a walking tour who asked if the place was haunted. Good location… would return again.🇺🇸😊
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super location, easy to everything in Old City. We were able to comfortably walk to everything. Exactly as it looks online and is described in reviews, so if you’re up for that, recommended."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay at Elfreth’s Alley, very historic and well preserved. Definitely recommend a visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool and historic place to stay! Also very central.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place, quirky and unusual. Sits on a historic street in old town. Perfect for a couple."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a unique cute place! Loved loved loved! Only issue I had was an allergic reaction to what may have been a pet that previously visited there and had to leave earlier than I wanted to. However the best sleep ever down in the wine cellar. Coolest street in Philly!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super unique spot on the cutest street! Loved the space and the neighborhood. Would absolutely stay here again when back in Philly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Patrick went heyond his obligation to refund our payment when we ultimately didn't stay in the studio. He is a SUPER host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can’t stay anywhere better to truly get the Old City vibe!
Never had to call for an Uber-everything g is walkable and the neighborhood is downright historical!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning location. If you stay at the Hilton you’re missing out on a true gem. Watch your head…this house was made for people over two hundred years ago. The AC was on and there was an air dehumidifier running when I got to the suite.
Exactly as described. Super fast communication. Stay here, you’ll be thankful you did.
I do suggest you park at Old Town Pandomonium. It’s $25 for 24 hours and only two blocks away."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was such an amazing location and really cool experience! The wine cellar vibe is like nothing else and it was really fun to be there! The space is very cozy! The location is also great, there are so many restaurants and a great bike path nearby!
Would definitely recommend!!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is tiny! You would want to be under 5’. There was a 4’ hole under the bed! Everything including using the bathroom, was awkward"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Really unique place to stay for sure but not tall people friendly in 6’0” I hit my head twice but for one night to stay in a wine cellar!? Worth it
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I had a fantastic stay in old city!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay and great location!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Fun, quirky spot in the heart of Old City! If you’re tall, you’ll have to do some head ducking, but that’s part of the charm."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very eclectic and quaint
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an unfinished cellar. Damp and smells musty with cobwebs. Saw multiple cave crickets. Bed is difficult to get in/out of due to being in a small nook.
Bathroom is tiny and hard to get into- it’s up steps and you will need to stoop over. Sink and mirror are small. No places to keep toiletries. Low ceilings (I’m 6’ and my partner is 5’5, we both had trouble). Steps leading down to unit are steep.
Anyone with accessibility issues will NOT be able to stay here.
Above is a family with small child(ren) that run around and dogs that bark- that’s what children and dogs do, but not much insulation to cancel noise.
Getting in the unit was easy. Key was in a lockbox on door. TV and Roku. Air conditioner and dehumidifier. Was fun to walk by tourists and blow their minds as you entered a cellar on one of the oldest streets in America. Check out procedure was simple and straightforward. Patrick was responsive when we ran into issues. It is an incredibly unique experience."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pros:
Excellent location; it's a historical place that was cool
Lots to do, and a walkable neighborhood
Just right for perhaps an adult/2 staying for a short visit if you don't mind a dark basement with no light and tight space
Cons:
- Not baby friendly/dog-friendly - tight space to bring a stroller down the stairs into the main door (tight for big suitcases too). Heads up! The step-down directly leads to the main entrance and you can trip if you have heavy luggage. Once you keep a travel crib, the path to anywhere is essentially blocked off (as described, it is a tight space inside as well)
- There are gaps in the flooring by the nightstand where my phone fell and got stuck in the wooden plank (there would have been no way to retrieve it if it fell through the gap)
- Heads up about the low-ceiling transitions! from the living room area that leads up to all other areas (bedroom area/area which has the bathroom)
It was definitely worth the weekend $$$ we paid"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this unique, homey space and the fantastic location on Philadelphia's most historic street in an adorable neighborhood. It was so quiet and peaceful even while being within a few blocks of tons of restaurants, shops, and bars. Patrick reached out the day of our reservation to make sure check in went smoothly and was friendly and responsive throughout."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazing. It's a little small for tall people but I was able to easily get past that since the room was so enjoyable. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in a house on Elfreth's Alley was a delight. The wine cellar was just like the pictures - all exposed brick and arches (my favorite). It was comfortable and cozy, a really fun way to spend a getaway weekend. There's plenty to do in Old City, and it's easy to walk to other sites in the heart of the city (Reading Terminal Market, Independence Hall, Rittenhouse Square, etc.). Highly recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I needed a place to stay for the night in Philly and we could not pass this up. It is great for couples. We loved how close restaurants are and how peaceful it is. Very cozy stay! We will definitely be booking again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was absolutely amazing, thank you so much. I will definitely be going back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,😎
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very unique place to stay in Old City and able to walk to almost everything. Enjoyed the space and history of the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and a unique experience!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a fun, unique experience!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great. It feels a bit surreal in there. Like a little time capsule. Very historic little alley way, very old feeling place. Would recommend for a unique experience."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I wanted to stay somewhere historic and this place definitely checked that box for me! I really enjoyed feeling a part of the history in old Philly.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A very unique stay in a great location. It was a really fun way to spend our Friday night in Philly. The cellar apartment is close to everything you want in old city.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was an absolute awesome experience. Right on Elfreth’s Alley, you definitely feel like you’re taking a step into history. It was only a ten minute walk max to almost all the historical sites in Philadelphia. Our host was incredibly helpful and allowed us to check in early due to our early flight which helped a ton. You wouldn’t expect a wine cellar from the 1700’s to be outfitted with modern tech but it felt like we were in a small studio apartment, complete with Wi-Fi, TV, streaming services and more. Great experience and would definitely recommend to anyone"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool fun area. Nice experience staying in a cellar.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely charming place for 2 to spend a short weekend at!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want to be transported to 1755, Elfreth’s is up your alley. The most charming little nook with historic colonial charm! You gotta treat yourself at least once."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this experience ! It was nothing like anything we’ve experienced before.
Pretty place, very very cozy with dimmable lights ! Come here to relax with your s/o, bring some wine, water and coffee along.
It’s was really relaxing overall !"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, comfy bed, we appreciated the historical significance"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space that has charm and character built in that’s upped by the design of the renovation!
Located on a beautiful, historic street close to other historic landmarks of Old City, this is a once in a lifetime stay as far as American historical value goes.
As was expected, so not a surprise for me but should be noted before booking, it’s a converted wine cellar so shorter people will feel right at home and taller people will need to maneuver more carefully.
Overall, a beautiful, quaint stay in a great spot in the historic area of Philadelphia!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic historical location. It was a small place and there was some noise from the house above but with the age of the building it is somewhat expected. Very low ceilings. Easy to find and to get inside with the hosts prompt responses. Thanks for a wonderful stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing time!! It was so cool to be spending the night in a wine cellar. Very unique and cool. The alley that it’s in is very cute and historic, so you really feel like you’re getting a classic Philly experience. Would highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This host is super responsive and accomodating. I mean what can you possibly say, it's a wine cellar tuned AIRBNB on Elfreth Alley. Obviously if your stars align you should stay at this property at least once in your life. The location is residential but the tourists flock to Elfreth, it was an interesting dynamic. If you're here visit Bookbinders, it was excellent."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend, 10/10! Patrick's place was so unique and charming. It was such a cool experience to be in a wine cellar. My mom and I spent one night and it was perfect. Pictures/description/reviews were accurate. We will for sure be back!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Ideal location for walking to all the main historical attractions and good restaurants in Philly. The description, photos, and reviews are accurate. If you think it would be fun to stay in a very old brick cellar on a small street with lots of history, and most of your activity is going to be outside walking to museums and restaurants, this place is a good choice!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was SUCH a cool spot!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really interesting spot, full of history and character. Great location in the city. The host was friendly and very responsive to communication. Would recommend 100%!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, full of history and a livable glimpse into the past. Everything was as advertised and clean."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A+++
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was so unique and beautiful. My boyfriend and I loved it. The street is absolutely charming and close to everything. We will definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very much recommend Patrick’s place. It was comfortable and clean, and Patrick was responsive and helpful, while still allowing for privacy."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was extremely charming and the location is great! Old City was fantastic and the area is SO walkable and full of history! However (and I know this is an extremely old house with old floors and insulation) the noise from upstairs is intense, with at least two dogs and a baby. The place seems very difficult to get furniture in and out of, but the couch and bed were extremely uncomfortable. Low hanging ceilings were easy enough to navigate and the decorations were absolutely perfect for the space."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying in this unique, historical wine cellar! It’s exactly as pictured and described! It felt private and I slept comfortable!! I expected noise from upstairs per other reviews, but overall it didn’t bother me that much and I was never woken up by it!! I’d absolutely stay again on Elfreths Alley! :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quick trip to Philly and im happy we booked the place last min and get a little discount.
The space is really small but suck a unique experience. Very close to all the bar & restaurant as well"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here is staying in a piece of history. Owner did a great job to fill the space with antique furniture that adds to the unique feeling of staying here. Overall, we’re glad we picked to stay here and would recommend it if you’re up for the adventure. It’s walkable to all the historic sites. The bathroom is small, the bed is just a double, and the ceilings are low so if you are (or are traveling with someone tall/large), this is probably not the place for you. Also, the shower had great water pressure and stayed hot which was awesome but if having a really nice bathroom matters to you, this is a wine cellar and the bathroom is itty bitty."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely unique place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny, but a great unique experience!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really unique property in an incredible part of the city. I am 6'5"" and the ceilings are a little low, but it was way worth the slight inconvenience of having to duck a little bit. I would recommend this place highly, I'm not sure you will find many other places like it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place. Truly a gem, and worth every penny. Very close to cute restraunts and shops"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accurate listing online. Cute place and comfortable.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled to Philly wanting to truly experience Philadelphia and staying on Elfreth’s Alley at Patrick’s brought that to life. This is the place I would recommend to all my friends! The surrounding neighborhood is awesome for walking, shopping, exploring and eating!!! Highly recommend staying at Patrick’s spot!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, lots of places within walking distance."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute place.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I had a great night at this location! The historical alleyway where you are staying is a stunning! I appreciate that Patrick's spot both has the original cellar setup but also included a comfortable TV setup if preferred.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Definitely a cozy and unique space. We loved the chance to stay on Elfreth’s Alley and the fact it was in an old wine cellar made it extra interesting. Great location to walk to restaurants and museums. Patrick was friendly and responsive. We also always appreciate dog friendly Airbnbs since we love to travel with our pup. Highly recommend to other guests!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great space on a historic alley. This is walking distance to many shops and restaurants in the old town. I would recommend it.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and very unique. It might be difficult for someone with allergies with the air quality in the cellar. Other than that we liked the space
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patrick was a great host, communicating promptly and providing a great spot to stay."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great, cool place. love the history related to the studio. highly recommend."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique place to stay, right in the heart of Old City! Checking in and out was a breeze. Loved staying in such a historic space in one of the most historic spots in Philly. Within walking distance of great restaurants and museums."
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cellar apartment for a night or two, however probably not for a longer stay. It is a fairly cramped space, especially the bathroom (which wasn’t the cleanest of spaces) and the noise from the house above (children and dogs) had us wake up early each morning.
If you’re looking for a historic apartment and something a bit different then go for it, it’s fine for one or two nights. If you’re staying a little longer and want more comfort and peace then I’d recommend against it."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a charming and wonderful place! We had a lovely time and everything exceeded our expectations!! We look forward to coming back! Thank you so much.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,ADORABLE stay! So cute and in a great location. Only issues were a faulty toilet and you can hear EVERYTHING from the apartment upstairs which was problematic because I had to wake up at 4 am for the marathon
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect, cozy, warm, lovely!!! Historic little block, prime location in Old City. Highly recommend this beautiful place. It’s a remarkable place to have the opportunity to stay in."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and charming Airbnb. Perfect for our stay with two people. Patrick was very responsive and check in/check out very straightforward.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly quaint location on the historic alley and a cozy stay makes this a good value for staying in the heart of Philly.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in a great location. Very safe and the host was extremely helpful. We would def go back again. Thanks

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for most of the sights to see & walking distance to great bars & restaurants. Parking that was suggested was perfect. Cool experience & true to the listing!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super convenient location central to everything! Patrick was really quick to respond and the air bnb was clean and comfortable and unique as advertised! The parking tip was really helpful too!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Great location.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and close to everything!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Patrick’s place is a gem on a beautiful historic street. We loved being so close to many unique and history filled areas.
Keep in mind that this is an old, historic building and a real cellar! We found it exactly as described and the pictures were accurate as well.
That said, if you are a very large person some of the spaces may be quite tight (especially the bathroom). I am overweight myself and it was fine for me, but be mindful.
Again, the pictures are accurate and totally expected for a historic place such as this! If only these walls could talk! I’d recommend this stay, especially for couples or singles wanting to enjoy the city by foot."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming converted wine cellar in the middle of Old Town.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay is awesome. Highly recommend - even though it's on the pricey end, the location is unbeatable. Definitely scope out parking a bit before you check in because the places around there can be a bit tricky."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome position
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is for the adventuresome! So unique and unusual. Loved the historical vibe!!! Incredible location. Kind hosts.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very neat area.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an amazing spot! Great location in a cute historic alley.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Prime location! Parking garage down the block. Walking distance to so many things. The BnB was super cute just as pictured. Anybody super tall should avoid only because you’ll be hunched over walking through the BnB. 10/10
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique spot, great stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and unique stay in old city! A true gem and close to everything you would want to see!
,,,"I didn’t need to stay, but I lost almost all of my money for the reservation because Rob & Kyle did not communicate back with me , to direct me back to ABNB to cancel my reservation."
,,,Don’t waste your money
,,,"The host took my money knowing the hotel wouldn’t accepting chime cards. Then refused to give me a refund or allow me to change the dates of my stay, so I can get a different bank card to put my security deposit on. I personally think this host is obsessed with money, because they refuse to do the right thing. I got burnt out of $200 and they didn’t even try to give me back at least half of my money due to me not being able to check in."
