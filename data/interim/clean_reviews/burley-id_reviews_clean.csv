We were in town for a family reunion. At one point, my father-in-law who was staying at a local hotel asked me how much I’d paid for the weekend. When I told him, he looked so disappointed and told me that he’d paid more than double at a local hotel for the rest of the family.

He and his family were great people to meet, they recommended plenty of places for my family and I to visit, and their hospitality is unmatched! We stay at his place for a month and it really felt like a second home, everything was new clean and just felt very at home. Don't hesitate to book this place, between the kind hosts, the value, and the views it's a no-brainer! If we are ever back in the Burley area we would definitelybook again!!"

We couldn't have asked for better hosts. They were amazing! The place itself was very clean and had an at home feeling. Personally I loved that there were available cupboards in the kitchen so we had places to put our food other than the counter. They also had everything we needed to cook with utensils, dishes etc. They had a great yard for the kids to play and our kids wanted to play outside constantly and were always welcomed to do so.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"At first we weren't sure if we were in the right place but it's exactly where you think it is at first. It's a cozy little guest house next to the main house and the Host was WONDERFUL. She was very responsive when we were confused at first and was lovely and very welcoming. As you walk in you first notice the homey feeling in the living room and the kitchen, as you go further into the guest house you start to feel like you've got a second home and it was very welcoming considering we arrived late in the night and were tired. We used the shower, the washer/dryer and the tub and everything was cleaner than a hotel. 10/10 would recommend that you stay here."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was charming and such a peaceful setting. Beautiful area. The only downside was that we needed two queens and the pull out on the couch was not really suitable for my son who is 18yo. Maybe for little kids it would be fine but wouldn’t count on that as a bed for an adult.
Great host!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect sanctuary-haven-of-rest for our Denver to Seattle trip with a pet. The food recommendation Chris made was a hit, and they are true super hosts with solid basics and all the right extra touches.
Meeting the animals on the property was so refreshing after all day in the car; the lake, the kittens, the goats and chickens, the hearts-in-a-box-guestbook were all delightful. I have given 5 star ratings before, but this one truly deserves ""exceptional."""

The bed was comfortable. I couldn't get cable that night but they had a nice selection of dvd's.
It got kind of warm so i opened the window and then heard all the trucks from the highway nearby.
The front yard was overgrown and had a couple goats, but they were cool.
The lake was nice, a short walk to get to and had a grassy area with picnic tables.
It was fine for the price and nice to experience the area.
There were some good restaurants a short drive away.
Also follow the hosts directions, maps took me the wrong way."

There are plenty of towels for a group and the master bedroom has an on-suite bathroom too. We found the kitchen had what we needed but might be nice to have a few other items if you were doing extensive cooking. I asked Jared if the place had a griddle for pancakes and it didn’t so he bought one. The yard is very large and fully fenced which we appreciated since we had a toddler and a small dog.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay here!! It is an absolute gem of a home! Every detail is beautiful and adds to the space. I loved the bird light in the bathroom, the ornate mixing spoons for tea and coffee, the plants all around, and the stunning Dutch door!! The outside was beautiful and peaceful. We loved the fire pit with wood provided and spent much of the night out there just hanging out! We got to see people tending to the flower garden next door! Such a treat. The bed was cozy and we loved listening to records before going to sleep. Just perfect!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whitney’s flower pot is such a unique place and I highly recommend checking it out if you’re visiting twin falls, ID. It’s only 45 minutes from the shoshone falls and is in a peaceful location great for a getaway. She also has a flower farm which you can pick your own flowers during the flower season to take a bouquet home which is pretty awesome!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at The Flower Pot house. We were continually delighted to find thematic details inside — art, decorations, and dishware, for example — that made the whole package of staying here unique and memorable. Many people who signed the guest book mentioned it was on their Idaho Bucket List. When we visited local stores, those we were in contact with got big eyes and gave us a sense that we were now accepted and special since we are staying at The Flower Pot. In short, staying here is a special experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Can't say enough about how perfect the Flower Pot was. We really enjoyed our stay and loved the decor inside. It was great to have games to play and the hot tub to soak in.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can not say enough great things about this place! By far the best air bnb I’ve stayed in, definitely an experience stay. The attention to details is spot on, (example they have a big nice fire pit, instead of having to bring your own firewood, they provide it for you, book spray to get you in the mood to read by the bedside, record player with records) things like that made the stay so fun! It was decorated so modern and chic! Loved worth every penny! Will be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could give 6 stars, I would! My teenage daughter and I stayed one night for a getaway from Boise. We hit the National Park Historical Minidoka on the way and the Shoshone Falls going back. We came wilted and left rejuvenated. Everything about our stay at the Flowerpot was memorable. We marveled at the creative design and thoughtful restfulness the atmosphere procured. We highly recommend The Flowerpot to you and hope to return someday!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay! Burley needed a place like this! The vibe was spot on and we loved the hot tub. The shower felt like a massage and the bed was comfy. We loved the record player too.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just a perfect stay.
This place is incredibly gorgeous, unique and quaint. From the moment we arrived we just loved it, beautiful ambiance, tastefully decorated and so so cosy for 2.
Do yourself a favour, if only staying one night don’t go out to a restaurant bring takeout or cook out home. It would be such a waste to go out and miss all this little gem has to offer.
We soaked in the outdoor hot tub, cooked on the 2 burner stove top (which was perfectly adequate) listened to records (yes, there’s a record player) drank wine and played board game’s. We’d definitely recommend this place, and we’d give it 10 stars if we could.
Just Perfect, Perfect, Perfect

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great place to unwind!! We didn't get to use the fire pit, for making s'mores because of the wind and snow!, but we had a great time. Super clean and a fun experience for my husband's 88th Birthday!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at the flower pot. It was such a unique and relaxing experience. The thought that was put into every detail of the house was amazing. And the hot tub was perfect after a day of snowboarding at Pomerelle. Would definitely stay again.

We hope to come back when the flower field is in bloom!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING! I cannot say enough positive things about our stay at the Flowerpot. Everything was perfect, there are so many beautiful and thoughtful details in this space and it was the perfect place to relax and unwind. From enjoying coffee and the views, to hitting the hot tub after a day snowboarding Pomerelle then cuddling up on the couch and playing some card games, you couldn’t ask for more. Loved all the helpful instructions and tried several of the hosts restaurant recommendations and they did not disappoint! Book this Air B&B!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I got to spend the night in a flowerpot… who else can say that?! The airbnb was so wonderful and cozy! Ms. Whitney was a great host.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a unique and quaint place to stay. We stayed during the winter and went up to a small Ski resort about 40 minutes away. The place was quiet and easy to get to. It was surrounded by farmland, and seemed like it would be beautiful during the spring/summer. It’s big enough for 4 people (since there is a futon sofa). If you’re looking for an easy going place to stay, the flower pot is it!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was probably one of my favorite Airbnbs yet. The Flower Pot exceeded ALL of our expectations and was even better in person because of all the cute details and decorations. This was also one of the cleanest Airbnbs we’ve been to and we felt extremely comfortable. Visiting the Flower Pot was a trip I will never forget and might just become one of our yearly traditions🌻
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Flower Pot is such a fun & unique place to stay! Great use of space. Very clean and beautiful little details everywhere you turn. We would love to return sometime and enjoy the outdoor spaces they provide for guests.

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ethan’s place was set up well for our recent family gathering in Burley. Beds & linens were super comfy with plenty of blankets and thick comforters. We noticed extra touches throughout the home, such as extension cords with usb ports, great lighting in all the rooms and a kitchen that was equipped; we were able to cook meals in rather than going out to eat. We played games at the kitchen table and had enough seating in the living room for hanging out together. We loved reading a little about the history of the home. We had one guest that sat down and played the 100 yr old piano; it sounded wonderful!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very accommodating and nice clean place to stay.

Between the main living area and basement family room there was plenty of room for our family to spread out. Ethan was easy to work with- a great communicator and responsive host. The home had all the essentials and updates but with the character of a charming historical home. We loved our stay here and hope to stay again in the future:)."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our family trip to Burley. Very clean and recently remodeled inside. The basement is fully finished and had high end gym equipment, plus a fully stocked kids area with toys, books, etc.
Kitchen was also well stocked with all the basics plus some extras you don’t often see in all Airbnbs.
We were all very pleased with Ethan’s home."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in the area for a short contract job and Alicia's RV/trailer was the perfect spot for my needs. Spotlessly clean and in a very quiet neighbourhood. Very responsive host. Couldn’t ask for more. I've added it to my list of places I would book again in a heartbeat.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So grateful to have found this gem! Our stay was an absolute delight from start to finish. This is in a beautiful quiet country setting with easy access to the main road leading to Burley or Oakley. Despite booking last minute, the host welcomed us with kindness and cleanliness. Her flexibility and accommodation, especially with our little ones in tow and some unexpected challenges with them, made all the difference. Keeping quiet hours seemed impossible with one of our kids crying all night, but Alicia was so understanding and kind.
Experiencing life in a cozy RV was a unique adventure in itself! Our kids loved it! We ended up booking another night. It felt like stepping into a home away from home. From the warm bedding and towels to the well-stocked kitchen that had everything we needed.
It was so wonderful and I would definitely recommend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first stay in an RV. Everything looked immaculate. The only complaint is they didn’t have my bed from home. 😂 But then again no one else does either. I do love my Purple bed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value and perfect for what we needed. Traveling through taking my daughter to college and just needed a place to sleep. it was decently close to the highway and close to food. Nice and clean. I would definitely book here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved how spacious this felt and our kids were beyond excited to stay! The AC worked amazing to keep our family of 6 nice and cool.

We look forward to staying here again the next time we are visiting our friends in Burley!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the most well supplied kitchen we have ever experienced in an AirBnB. The place is well located. We have not stayed in a camper before so had lots of questions about how to do things. They were quick to respond.

Would definitely stay back in this place whenever we drive through and have to stay a night."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia was the perfect host! We loved our two nights in the RV travel trailer! It was quiet, cozy and comfortable!

We will definitely be back and will tell friends and family about it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This RV was so cozy and the perfect amount of space needed for my little family. The bunk beds are amazing for the kids. It was quite and peaceful.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife picked this location many months ago when I decided to compete in the Spudman Triathlon. I'll have to say that our weekend stay was incredibly relaxing. Most of the time when we travel for races we stay at hotels. What a wonderful difference this was. The interior was spotless and roomy. We were located in a area where when we looked out the window we saw beautiful farmland with horses and cows. When we needed to go into town it was only a 5-10 minute drive to there or Snake River. The host was outstanding. Before we left my wife and daughter were gleefully picking a few raspberries from the garden. If you are looking for a peaceful getaway then look no further.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a stopover. Alicia was awesome to work with.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about our stay. so much fun!! The kids had so much fun. I enjoyed the yard. I love sitting out in the sunshine. we were very comfortable in the Trailer. It was in great condition and very well kept. We had everything we needed and we were even offered more pillows or blankets if needed. Thank you so much to our great host's we very much enjoyed our stay it felt warm cozy and very safe. If we go that way again I will be asking to stay in their place. Thank you again!! also they went out of their way to put together the water slide for the kids. They are such a kind family.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Alicia is very kind and responsive. Thanks!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very spacious RV with comforts of home. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the area was peaceful. We will definitely stay again if it is available when we are in the area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a little gem of a place! We have stayed her twice, and it is a perfect basecamp for hanging with friends and family or sightseeing. The kids LOVED the water slide, swings, and trampoline. The bathroom is pretty sizable for a camper, the layout is spacious, and is pretty well stocked (we only used the fridge and didn’t do any food prep). The camper is located just off a quiet country back road, yet close to town. Note: the bunk bed is immediately inside the door to your left. I would recommend the bunks for kids as the mattresses are not very supportive. I slept on the top with the baby and used the extra egg crate mattress topper for added support. All and all, a wonderful and very affordable alternative to staying in a hotel! We will be back!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The RV was cozy and accurately described. Alicia was quick to answer questions. There is a nice 1.8 mile paved trail along the snake that we enjoyed.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alicia's place is a unique camper trailer stay that puts you in a neighborhood feel with a good balance of farm feel just across the street. Mountain sunrise views, a beautiful yard with fruit trees, garden, and games. They're a wonderfully friendly family and very responsive and helpful hosts. I would recommend an easygoing stay here to anyone."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with a very beautiful view of the mountains! Very clean property and RV. Has all the amenities you'll need for a cozy stay!

The host was extremely helpful and even provided us with a bag full of freshly picked produce from her garden! I highly recommend and would stay here again if I were in the area!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is by far one of our best Airbnb’s stay. The RV itself is very comfortable and spacious. The fridge was stocked with water and condiments, and the kitchen includes everything you need to prepare meals and coffee. There were fresh towels in the bathroom and a good size shower as well. There’s a nice BBQ and bench outside, with a lovely stream next to the RV, and cows and horses across the street. Although this is not far off a main road with easy access to everything, the house and RV are on a rural street, such a lovely combination. There are clear instructions for the RV’a shower, fireplace, etc. which was very helpful.
The hosts live in a beautiful area. We LOVED the RV. Very comfortable and had everything we needed. We didn’t have the opportunity to enjoy the yard as we were rushed to get on the road but hope to do so in the future. We will definitely stay again! Thank you for such an enjoyable experience!"

,,,Canceled morning of
,,,Upon arrival we found a dirty shower with hair. Clogged sink. Food remnants in the microwave and sink. Crumbs on the counters. Dirty toilet. Lots of Man hair on the nightstand. Dust on the TV stand. It looks like only the sheets were changed and nothing else was clean and sanitized. Then we had to find a hotel and deal with this issue late at night. Not what we wanted to deal with after a long day of driving.
