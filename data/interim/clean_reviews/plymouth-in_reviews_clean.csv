One caution if you're a light sleeper.... there's a train that comes by the house once a night past midnight...loud and shakes the house a little bit. It didn't bother us during the 4 nights we stayed but it may for others."

If you are in the area for Culver, ND, etc., this is a great and accessible place to stay close to everything you need. Hosts are proactive and exactly accurate with anything they tell you, and make sure you want for nothing when staying in this cozy place. Highly recommended and had a great overall experience from booking to checkout. Many thanks!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy little crash pad close to historic downtown Plymouth
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt very much at home. It is a nice cozy setting. We really just needed a place to sleep because we were busy visiting friends and family during the day. The beds/sofa sleeper were comfortable. There were three tvs so you could watch what you wanted in your designated room. The evenings allowed us to sit on the back porch. We did not need to use the kitchen but we would have been able to prepare a meal in the stocked kitchen if needed. The home is near train tracks which I only heard once during our three nights there. You are only a few minute’s walk from the downtown area where there are restaurants and shops. There are parks a short drive from the house. Angie and Richard were very responsive and gave us easy instructions. I think they live next door but they were respectful of privacy. I would stay with them again. The cost was much less than a hotel and provided much more comfort.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place that we enjoyed for our week in Plymouth, Indiana..."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are extremely kind & attentive. The home is an immaculate, charming cottage in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to restaurants/bars, shopping, & Centennial Park. A perfect place to stay if you're coming for the local blueberry festival!
The bathroom was fully stocked with towels, washcloths, multiple options for body wash, shampoo, & conditioner. Bedrooms are modest with adequate closets. The living room & back patio provide ample & comfortable seating.
The kitchen is quaintly decorated & stocked with a coffee maker (coffee, filters, & liquid creamer provided by hosts), toaster, plates, bowls, cups, mugs, pots/pans for cooking, & silverware. There were no utensils for cooking (whisk, metal spatula, etc) so we did have to improvise.
Note: there is a train track nearby, but it is not busy! However, if someone in your group has sensory issues, it is important to be aware so proactive steps can be taken for your trip."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,More roomy than the pics. Very comfortable and homey.

We will definitely return"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10 out of 10 would recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Nice people.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location of the home is in town however, with the river and small wooded area nearby, it was a calm, peaceful escape. The outside of the house is inviting and the inside is very cozy and incredibly clean. The wood tones on the walls and floors really make it feel like you're staying in a country cabin. The online home manual was a great resource when planning our getaway- we knew what was provided and where everything was located. This rental is a hidden gem and you can't beat the price! 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"While the home is small, it met all the needs of a family of 4 and their guests for a week. The hosts were great at answering questions and solving any problems quickly. Great Wifi available. The basics are plentiful, though kitchen was a little sparse. Temperature in the home was comfy, no neighborhood problems, many unique features that charmed the heart of my young grandson. We appreciated that we did not have to move a lot of decorations that kids could break. Great parks in town as well! Thanks for a good week!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute little house. It has everything you need. We didn’t spend a lot of time there but that was by design, our plans for this trip didn’t include a lot of downtime. The living room couch would be one of the only things to make note of - if you have more than two people, sitting around, relaxing, watching a movie wouldn’t be very comfortable, just not enough seating unless people sit at the wooden dining table chairs. The couch has a bit of a musty/old smell. But since we weren’t planning to hang around the house much, it wasn’t too bad for us.
The house is cute and cozy otherwise. Updated interior, new windows, etc. Very close to downtown.
Angie / Richard were pleasant, helpful and very quick to respond."
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This air bnb is perfect for a overnight stay just passing through. It was exactly what we needed for the price. The only thing that was a bummer was the musty smell and on top of that was all the fragrance with the puff scents plugins. I think most people might not notice it, but those that are sensitive to scents and fragrance this wouldn't be a place for you. If you don't mind it, it a great place to stay if you are passing through.
Thanks again Angie and Richard"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Very clean and easy check in.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie and Richard were great! They were quick to respond and very helpful. They provided everything we needed. We appreciated the lighted driveway and front door to help with nighttime check, etc.
We loved the rustic wood walls. They added so much character to the cottage.
Thanks for the great stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for us. Warm and cozy. Great Wi-Fi and televisions. It fit what we needed very nicely.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a very nice stay. We very much appreciate Angie and Richard being so accommodating and responsive. Their place was spotless but cozy! Definitely recommend. One thing to keep in mind, the temperature is set before you get there - I would suggest discussing your ideal temp with the hosts before arriving."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this stay! Super clean and cozy! It felt like it was a house I had lived in for years! Everything you need was there and it was fresh and clean smelling! Will stay here again, that’s for sure!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little yellow cottage was PERFECT!! So clean & quiet!! Comfortable beds & a fully stocked kitchen (with an air fryer!). Easy check-in & check-out process, close to everything!!
If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay, this is it!
Angie & Richard were very responsive & checked in with me!
So appreciative of their cozy cottage!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thanks Angie and Richard!!!
We just needed a clean, peaceful place for our family of five to get a good night's sleep and your place was absolutely perfect. It was clean, quiet, slept the 5 of us easily and comfortably and the kitchen was equipped enough for us to make a quick breakfast before we had to be out the door to Mass the next morning.
Thanks so much and God bless you both for your hard work!"

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our needs. Only thing I would change is I wished there was an ottoman for the couch. It's not a fancy place, but the price was great and the house was perfect for us! There was no ice, just fyi. Kinda wished there were ice trays. Awesome first aid kit which we ended up needing. We were very thankful for that! We will definitely stay again! The neighborhood is a bit run down, but we had no problems and it's very close to beautiful downtown."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, perfect home and quiet neighborhood."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came just for the weekend and this was a perfect little place for us! In a quiet neighborhood real close to town, so it was nice and easy to go get a quick bite to eat too. Hosts were very friendly and super responsive. We’d stay again for sure."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute and clean! Loved our stay. The only downside was the trains were kind of loud at night and the furnace was loud. It sounded like shoes in a dryer every-time it kicked on :/ but other than it was a great stay!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little two bedroom place ideal for a night sleep while passing through Plymouth! Able to get a good night sleep nice shower and back on the road refreshed!

Would definitely stay again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house from the outside doesn't look like anything to write home about, but once we opened the door and went inside the house was so clean and cheery. It smelled fresh and nice inside and they even put up a few Christmas decorations to feel festive! we were in the area a little before check-in but after checking with Angie and Richard they were happy to let us check in early. for the price we paid for the one night we stayed I would absolutely recommend staying here if you're in the area.
The photos do not show any televisions but they do have 2 very nice ones in the unit. The thermostat is locked up, and it did get chilly but Angie and Richard offered to adjust the temperature for us almost as soon as we checked in to make sure we were comfortable!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy check in and nice house.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My dad and I stayed here for an overnight after a night Notre Dame game. With hotels charging outrageous prices in South Bend on game day this was a great find. This place was on our way back to Cincinnati and was a perfect place for us to lay our heads. My only complaint is the thermostat is locked off so I could not access it, however the host was quick to respond and help adjust the temp to a comfortable setting for us, even at midnight. Overall very happy with our stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,quick weekend stay. Super clean and great little place.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Meets all basic needs. Nice shower.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Angie/Richard's place. It was a quick landing place for a nights rest during our long car ride. We appreciated the easy of finding their cute little home in the middle of a quiet town. Getting into the house was a breeze and everything was as it said on the listing. The biggest point of our stay was in the morning when our car had a flat tire and Richard helped us to get air and avoid a long extension to our road trip. We are so grateful to their above and beyond hospitality. Definitely recommend a stay here with great hosts in a sweet little home.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for the weekend for me and my family! Angie and Richard are great hosts!! Perfect for Notre Dame football games and will be booking again!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in this charming little house. It is clean, neat and is tastefully decorated. It is also outfitted with everything you could need, plus the hosts graciously provide anything extra you think of. The hosts are sweet and eager to help, and are very knowledgable about fun ways to spend your time in the neighborhood. I definitely recommend this listing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place. Deb & Joe couldn't have been nicer, they even had a fishing pole for my husband to borrow ! He caught 9 fish in the afternoon! We had the best relaxing time perfect for us to decompress!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was just what we were looking for! We’ll be back.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for having us stay, Deb and Joe! We loved staying right on the lake. The cottage was so cute and perfect for my field technician and I to stay at while we worked in the area. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"After booking we were told that the Furnace was broken and that there would be an HVAC unit installed the week after our visit. That was a little unfortunate because it was 80 degrees the weekend we stayed, and the listing had mentioned having a window AC unit that was not there. There was a box fan provided that we put in the window, but it was still about 75 degrees and extremely humid inside at night, so that was pretty miserable. Obviously this won’t be an issue for anyone once the HVAC unit is installed, it just would have been nice to know there would be no AC before booking. Additionally, I think “Guest House” would be a more appropriate name for this listing as you are sharing a backyard with the hosts. That wasn’t an issue for us at all, but just think that should be made more clear! I loved that I could bring my pup, and the fenced in yard was great. The lake was beautiful and cottage was very cute!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice host
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very nice lake house and good location. would stay again!

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place had expired food in the kitchen. Lots of it. Cluttered. Dirty loose rugs. The furnace was not secured so the room divider could be moved by a toddler. The lock did not work. There was too much furniture for the space and clutter.
The thermostat did not work, so it had to manually adjusted all through the visit.
The lake was pretty. Safe neighborhood."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was just as described and shown on the pictures. A nice place for a small getaway

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I just want to say as a host Deborah was amazing. She was out of town, and still immediately responded to everything.
There was a cold snap while I was there and I couldn’t get the heat the second night to work and didn’t want to bother her so just left to stay elsewhere. But I did let her know I left.
She was so amazingly apologetic and even refunded my money even though I had told her not to worry about it.
Would definitely stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We spent the night at Deb’s cottage while driving across the US and couldn’t of asked for a more peaceful setting to spend the night. The place was spotless and had an absolutely gorgeous view of the lake. Unfortunately we were way too tired after driving to use the kayaks that were offered but we appreciated the option! We’ll definitely be back again if we find ourselves driving through Indiana.

The setting is a nice quiet country atmosphere. And beautiful surroundings of nothing but woods and nature. Amy was nothing but true professional from the time I arrived to the time I left I even got to meet some of her family who was just as nice as can be. They made me actually feel like family you don't find that very often for sure. When I told people in that town where I was staying all it was was nothing but praise for her and her family. I understand why!!. I'm so happy I chose this place. thank you Amy and to the family thank you and( PS sorry) for the 6:30 a.m. panic alarm on the truck Saturday morning..

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Timothy's house was perfectly suited for my trip's needs! Spacious and really well-priced!
The only thing I'd want to note is that, if you have a sensitive nose, it's possible the well water might cause some frustration. Inevitably it would occasionally smell very faintly of sulfur, but that's just part and parcel of using well water and I don't hold it against the owners."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay with my family while in town for a wedding. Timothy was very pleasant and accommodating. The property around the house provided a distraction for my four kiddos and Timothy offered much needed advice on area towns and what was good to visit.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Air BNB experience as we have always stayed at a hotel which was probably 20 minutes away. We stayed at the same hotel a couple times a year for the last 8 or so years. Our last stay was horrible. Broken outlets, broken shower & rooms were dirty. Their loss is Tim's Country Homes gain. Plus it is closer to our family. When we first pulled in you could feel the calm of his land. I knew if the outside was this inviting the inside had to be just as good if not better. The house was perfect. There was enough room for everyone to have their own space. The kitchen has probably everything you have at home. Even had a “junk drawer” with pens, paper & even a chip clip. There was a paper that explained the house rules & general info. It was easy to read and explained how to use the TV & how they wanted us to leave the house. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked but we will be back. I cannot recommend Tim's house enough."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful home in an even more perfect area. We hope to make another trip to really enjoy the area and this gorgeous home.

We were able to use the garage to park my car in for the night! I really appreciated that! The garage was spacious and had a remote door opener that we used! I feel as if everything we could need was considered! We look forward to booking here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I enjoyed a girls getaway at Tim’s Country Home. The setting was absolutely beautiful , with the pond out front and the surrounding woods.

Very kind, responsive, and proactive. My whole group found the place to be perfect. Super spacious and open. The kitchen had everything we needed to be able to cook.

We had an absolutely great time, enough room for each our own bedroom, and two bathrooms worked great as well. The home was located in an area with lots of things to see and do as well as great places to eat. We also cooked at the home with all the amenities at our fingertips. Private setting was perfect for four friends to hang out and eat drink and be merry, without bothering anyone. The outdoors were beautiful and we even took a walk on the trail through the woods. Waking up in the morning to the horses out the back patio door was a nice way to start the day. We can not say enough about how happy we were with our experience.
We wished this home was closer as we highly recommend it and will definitely go back again when headed that way."

My two boys loved the private pond to fish and my son was holding up his fish trying h to get Timothy’s attention to see, he gave him a great little wave. My children and dad had so many questions when they caught Timothy out attending his horses. We appreciate his hospitality and I even more appreciate him taking his time to answer the kids silly questions. My kids only comment “can we go back to fish for my birthday?!” 10 out of 10 recommend for a quiet family getaway!"

Open floor plan plenty of seating inside and out! Highly recommend
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"We just stayed at Marlena's place this past weekend. It was a nice place to stay, but we thought a little smaller than the photos make it look in the main area. There are a few things you should know if you are choosing this location. First, the beds are very firm (better than broken down and old!), but something to be aware of. Also, we felt the lights were very bright with no option to dim. There are many small appliances and the kitchen is quite well stocked with most anything you would need. The setting is out in the country and very quiet and peaceful. Lots of nice outdoor space! The house is appropriately priced."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is definitely the place you want for a staycation. There is pretty much nothing to do unless you take a boat. Pictures are a bit deceiving. Definitely need to be cleaned outside and dusted. Overall would recommend.

As for her place, spotless, instructions on what we needed to do while there was spot on. Very comfortable to just relax (when we had time). Games, videos were available to use.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, so the detailed review is simply for informational purposes. This house is like a time capsule. I had a grandmother who lived in small-town Indiana in the 70s, and I felt like I was back at her house. It was spotlessly clean. There was a vaguely musty smell in the part of the house you go in and out of, but nowhere else. The bed we slept on was very firm, great for me...but my wife could have used a topper. The living room furniture was ample and comfortable. Still, I would not recommend more than three people. The house is small, and the one bathroom is a definite consideration. The location is rural and peaceful. You're literally surrounded by corn and soybean fields. Plymouth, the nearest town of any size, is 10-15 minutes away. Denise was very helpful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and quiet space in a beautiful country setting. The host is very responsive and accommodating. I would absolutely recommend and will be staying again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Denise went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable during my short stay. She had fresh cookies waiting when I arrived and the home spotless. Extremely comfortable and private accommodations. I’ve actually already booked to be back again this month!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, daughter and I stayed her for two nights to attend my sister-in-laws wedding nearby. The place was peaceful and had everything we needed. The host went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcomed and was very responsive when it came to any updates. She had the basic necessities for us along with some special treats. Such a pleasant surprise experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage in a quitte surroundings with lots of birds singing. The cottage was clean, cozy and had all the neccesary things for a nice comfortabel stay. We loved it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was spotlessly clean. Denise has inquired with us when we will arrive and made us aware of it because of the time zone🙏🏼
Each room is decorated with fine details and is decorated with a lot of love. We travel often, but have never found such a clean place as well as clean cutlery etc.
Unfortunately, we were too short here to enjoy everything.
We would come back any time and highly recommend this place.
Located this is very quiet and yet not far from everything you need.
Thank you very much❤️🫶🏼"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house like of the house on the paris of Laura Ingalls, suepr clean and feel of details and amenities, she even leaves us homemade cookies, water, coffe pods etc
Amazing host so attentive and gentle"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful little spot to spend some time with the family - quiet and peaceful but close to civilization if you want it; the best of both worlds!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECT country setting to get away from the hustle & bustle of city life. Easy to find off of main highways but far enough away to enjoy a country setting. Denise’s attention to detail is recognized from the time you walk through the door until you leave.

She provides all of the amenities you would find while staying with a relative/friend and more.
She communicates in a timely manner to questions.
She also has an entrance door where you don’t have to carry a key.
Excellent value for your dollar."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My son had to take his ACT at nearby Culver Academy and we didn’t want to do the 2 hour drive the morning of the test. The house was charming, spotless clean and peaceful. We live in a big city and my son finds rural areas relaxing so it was a wonderful escape for him to unwind the night before. We had dinner at Swan Lake Resort which was a quick 10 minute drive. I didn’t have experience using the particular air conditioning units but Denise left very clear instructions so I had no problem operating them. Nice soaps in the kitchen and bathroom. Clean towels and cleaning supplies to tidy up. Plenty of extra pillows and blankets. We didn’t need it but a nice stackable washer and dryer tucked in a closet. Lots of interesting reading material around from books to National Geographic magazines my son enjoyed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Denise was extremly prompt on her responses. Place was exceptionally clean and she even left homemade cookies for us on the counter. Great place and great service.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place was very clean (which I appreciate very much). The king size bed was extremely comfortable. Denise has instructions that are very clear and easy to understand. She responded quickly when I had a question. We enjoyed our time in this house. She had cookies waiting for us when we arrived which I thought was a nice touch. This is a comfortable and quiet place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this quiet country house! Slept like a rock both nights I was there. Denise kept in contact the entire time, made sure I wanted for nothing, and keeps a great home close to Culver Academy and Notre Dame. Spent one day at the Mennonite colony northeast of Plymouth, spent the rest of time catching up with dear friends. This is a perfect, and I mean perfect, place to stay if you want a place to quietly relax in the country. Encountered several species of wildlife, got to tour an historic round barn down the road from the house, and most importantly, got a chance to throw off my usual schedule and get some much-needed rest. This is one place I hope to stay at again, and you will too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to call home for a few days while we were in the area for a junior golf tournament.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is cozy and charming. Runs on country roads…and delicious cookies in the kitchen to welcome us. Denise was terrific!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Denise's house is among a large agriculture field, continent to groceries.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful home on the lake! We were in town for Culver Academies Reunion Weekend and this was a perfect location for my husband and I. It was only a 12-min drive. We were on campus during the day, but loved to come back and hang on the deck and relax. So peaceful and quiet! I've already sent this listing to my mom for the next time she visits Culver and plan to stay here again the next time we're up visiting. Perfection!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a gem of a place on Pretty Lake in Plymouth. The house is extremely clean and the style looks like an HGTV home. It is very convenient to Culver Academies and a perfect little retreat. We had a wonderful visit and would love to book this another time when we have more time to sit outside to enjoy the scenery. Thank you for letting us enjoy your lovely home Lindsey!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as advertised. We came in for a Notre Dame football game and found the place to be a great location. The house was perfect for our party and had a beautiful patio and dock area to enjoy before and after the game. The house is well furnished and is updated and modern. It is also right next to a golf course so in addition to lake house activities you can golf. The drive to the game was about 35 minutes so very manageable. Would recommend for a game weekend or just for a weekend getaway for a family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at the rental property. the place was beautiful and so was the scenery. The house was spotless and hall the amenities you could want or need. We appreciated you letting us come stay!!!

everything we needed for an amazing weekend with my family!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage inside is straight out of a magazine, just so many beautiful touches and everything so new! The living space gives plenty of room as well as the patio. I slept on the fold-out couch and found it surprisingly pretty comfortable, and though it's in the living room it had a wall along part of it for some privacy. Being on a lake yet close to town worked out wonderfully for us. We paddled with the kayak and boards there as well as some we brought, like a tube with an anchor to put out in the deeper area for floating/swimming. Wake hours for boats are 1-4 pm so we had to be aware of that and stay by the shore at those times. That was included clearly in the information given for check in, which was very thorough. It was a great stay in beautiful space!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Lindsey, our week was awesome, paddled, kayak, walking around the lake. Your house is a wonderful and peaceful place, we will come back. And also thank you for your kindness 😊."

We were able to grill each night for dinner and eat out on the patio with a fire for s’mores once the sun went down. The Airbnb was clean and had everything we needed for the weekend. The only issue we had was the bees on the patio that we couldn’t seem to escape. We would gladly book again!!"

Every detail has been thought of for you and welcomes you into this space to relax and enjoy your time away.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is a gem. From the moment you enter the paved driveway, you can sense how peaceful and tranquil this property is. Everything outside and inside the home is spectacular. The decor in the inside perfectly matches the home, the attention to detail makes the property feel like your own home, and not a rented location. There is plenty of living areas around the home that you can have space to entertain. The main living room is next to the kitchen and the outdoor patio which is fully enclosed to not allow bugs in. There is a full game room downstairs that has a direct door to the enormous private lake which also had kayaks available for us to use. The grass area was a ton of fun bc of its size; we are huge activity enthusiasts and we played spike ball and frisbee all afternoon with no space issues. There's a grille already connected to a gas tank, so we didn't have to bring our own tank. All in all, the hosts ensured we were taken care of and we can't wait to book again."

This was my first time staying with her and the residence couldn't be any more perfect for my needs. It also has a great location between Plymouth and Culver.

We would love to return if Marshall County cleans up their lakes and adds more boat ramps. People were friendly but the vibe changed once on the water and they realized you weren’t a local. They don’t like to share even though the lakes are a part of their brochure for the county. That’s why it was nice to return to Sue’s where we were always welcome! Her fire pit 🔥was great!!! Does need outdoor furniture~Thx Sue! 😊"

Sue responded to our reservation request immediately and was flexible and understanding. She even let us delay check-out until the tow company delivered our vehicle. When we walked in (bewildered from the happenings of the day), a beautifuland clean space greeted us. Everywhere we turned, there was an ""extra."" Fresh muffins on the counter; actual food (not just condiments) in the fridge and freezer; pantry items (rice, breakfast cereal, snacks); fresh fruit on the table; toothbrushes, toothpastes, and other toiletries. This was probably the most ""stocked"" Airbnb that we've ever stayed in. We would absolutely stay again."
