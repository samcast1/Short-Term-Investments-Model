We're in Oxford every week for Ole Miss games, and Nathan's place stood out for its warmth and convenience.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's Place was the perfect location for our weekend in Oxford attending the LSU-Ole Miss football game. The condo is an easy 30 min. walk to The Grove and a shorter walk to the football/ baseball stadiums. The walk is along sidewalks and beautiful once you enter the campus. 30 minutes was comparable to any of the public parking lots without the hassle of driving. The condo is also an easy 10-15 minute drive to the Square. The apartment is as pictured with a spacious living/dining area. The dining table is set for 4 but easily accommodated 6. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, plates, and glasses. The refrigerator is full sized. We did not cook but used the full sized stove to heat food we brought in. The peninsula provided plenty of space to lay out multiple dishes. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were small but perfectly adequate. Someone was in touch daily to see if we needed anything. It was nice to sit outside on the patio. We would return here."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s in Oxford over the last couple of years and this was the first time I did not choose a unique place like a farm or cottage. A place that is unique. With this being said, it is easier to add special nuances when you only own 1 or 2 Airbnb’s, which is not the case for Nathen. He owns 60+ properties in Oxford and has a management company running them. This is the only way to ensure they are properly taken care of. So although this condo was more generic (for lack of a better word) it was exactly as described in the listing and pictures. It was very clean, super easy to access and in a perfect location, all of which I appreciate. I would definitely recommend this place."

He and his staff are also awesome. Should you have any issues, they are on top of it quick. If you try and book with Nathan and there are no vacancies all I can say is you should've booked earlier. Thanks Nathan and staff for making my stay away from home as close to home like as possible."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is a beautiful condo! We have 2 small girls and the pool had plenty of shallow areas which they could play in without much worry they would be falling into deeper water accidently. The next thing is just personal preference, it had nothing to do with anything wrong or that could have been different: the bed was very different, maybe it's memory foam? But it wasn't comfortable for myself, I'm used to more soft pillow top mattresses, again nothing that was wrong at all, just personal preference. My girls slept like rocks, and my oldest said she liked the bed allot! Everything was exactly as pictured, and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you could need! We did not use the balcony, so I can't speak to that at all. They even had extra shampoo/ lotion that I forgot so I was very thankful! The actual building was a little hard to find, GPS doesn't bring you right there. But we figured it out without having to message for help, again not anything wrong,just sharing experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our little family getaway here! Highly recommend staying. The only two negatives (and I don't want them to detract--more just things to be aware of) are 1) it's not walkable to the downtown area, which people going to Oxford might want and 2) It's on a second floor with a pretty steep staircase, so not super friendly to the less physically active like the very young or very old. Overall, though, condo was super cute and pool was wonderful :)"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great condo with lots of extra touches! Very clean & beautiful decor. Would definitely recommend stay here!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. Nicely decorated, a fantastic tv in the living area for watching Game Day or other games until time to go to the grove. It's directly across from the pool, so this is good if you have kids that like to swim & weather permits. The work out facility is below this condo, so that's convenient for getting in a quick workout before you start your day. This condo is a few miles down & off of Molly Barr Road, so it's not super close to campus, but an easy drive. We had four adults & two kids (ages 10). The space did feel cramped with that many people staying, & a half bath would have been nice due to others occupying showers & getting dressed (for privacy)in the baths attached to the bedrooms. The coffee pot is sleek & pretty, but difficult to work/not user friendly even with the provided instructions. We gave up & bought our morning coffee at various coffee shops nearby. Overall, our stay was great. I would stay here again just with less people."

2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Perfect place for 6 adults however a few items were missing when we arrived. There were only 6 towels and no washcloths. Also, there was no shampoo or conditioner in the bathrooms and the ice machine wasn’t working. Rob did drop off additional towels and washcloths but not until after lunch and I had to buy shampoo and conditioner. He also brought us a bag of ice. Other than those few minor issues, the house was perfect and just as stated in the listing."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rob’s home is beautiful, spacious, quiet and cozy. Separate living areas, beautiful dining table to sit and work or enjoy a nice meal prepared in the chef’s kitchen or take and bake from Chicory a wonderful local grocery store near by.
Comfortable beds, luxurious bedding no microfiber sheets. No toxic chemicals for those sensitive.
The yard is like a park with lots of moss to kick off the shoes and ground.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at my fair share of Airbnbs in Oxford due to work, and I’d say Ali’s is by far the nicest and cleanest. And it smells heavenly.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at the cottage probably 5 times now. The cottage itself is adorable inside and out, and the property is so peaceful. The back porch is a perfect place to watch the sunset. The farm animals and I are friends now. ☺️ It’s a really special place that feels totally isolated - you will want to go back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely spot. About 10-15 minute drive from the heart of Oxford. Felt safe and private too even though it’s on the same property as the host’s home and the farm animals were adorable.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This truly is a wonderful place. The guest house is fairytale charming. The property is serene. The stars are endless. I enjoyed waking up to the roosters crowing!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second visit to the farm, and both times we have enjoyed it immensely. The cottage is just the right size for our family. Rocking on the back porch and watching the animals is so very relaxing, and our kids have a ball with the animals. The square in Oxford is close enough if we want to get out and do something or have a nice meal. Otherwise, just hanging out at the farm is enough. The kids enjoyed collecting eggs and feeding the animals, and Ashley was a kind and friendly host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique and pleasant stay! We seriously enjoyed our two nights at this small farm cottage! The little cottage feels so spacious on the inside; completely unexpected when you look at it from the outside. Everything was clean and well-kept.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The farm is a gem! The wide plank wood floors and the urban farm house aesthetic invite you immediately inside. It’s so cute! She even sets out fresh eggs from her farm on the counter for you. When you wake up in the morning to have coffee on the back deck, you’ll see bunnies, chickens and cats hanging out together on the property. The goats and sheep and pigs are definitely pets. We took a bag of apples and carrots to feed them with the host, Ashley! She is awesome. You might just want to go stay there to meet her and her animals. Those animals adore her. I look forward to coming back again. The home is really well thought out and had so much character. It is close to the Oxford Square. Stay here and love it as much as I did."

We went for a game weekend. It's close enough to the Square to be convenient, yet far enough away to feel some peace after all of the game festivities. The cottage is comfy, super clean, super cute...perfect! I will never forget seeing the bunnies in the yard when we drove in. The instructions were very clear. The location was easy to find. Ashley was super responsive throughout after making the reservation. She had great local recommendations. We really didn't need to ask any questions once we got there because her instructions were so clear. THANK YOU, Ashley and Lucy for a wonderful weekend. I only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I had a great great experience at Ashley's little farm. The cottage is beautiful, although it's nicely decorated it maintains its farm character. Our kids were just happy to run around all day chasing the cats, bunnies, and chicken. They also fed the goats quite some. Downtown Oxford is less than 15 minutes away. The food was pretty good and we found a few fun places around the square.
Ashley was very responsive and easy to work with. We had the chance to meet her at the farm and really enjoyed her presence. She was very welcoming, down to earth, and fun to talk to.
I would definitely recommend to friends and family!"

The yard has several shaded areas with swings. The cottage has well outfitted kitchen if you choose to make meals, but its proximity to Oxford's downtown gives you a great selection of restaurant's (Ajax Diner is a gem). Ashley is very friendly and responsive to requests. This is a truly unique Airbnb location."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great experience staying at The Cottage on Sweet Lucy Farm!
Close enough to Oxford and campus but far enough to enjoy the peaceful country surrounding on an adorable little farm!
Who doesn’t love sitting on the back porch listening to the sounds of roosters in the morning!!
We will be back!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming cottage with everything you need for your stay. Ashley's little farm is beautiful and peaceful not far from the town square in Oxford. The farm animals were a plus as we really enjoyed our welcome greeting from Fig, the friendly goat and fresh farm eggs. Would definitely stay again. Recommend a stay here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cosy and charming cottage, very private and quiet. I can really recommend it!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time to the farm! We love everything about it. We’ll be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"9.9/10 Would recommend. 👍🏼 Wonderful place! Lots of fun goats bunnies, chickens, etc. If the goats are out, consider picking up your young kids cuz they can get a little head-butty, but certainly nothing dangerous.. just light nudges. The farm fresh eggs were DELICIOUS and plentiful. Fireflies lit the air at dusk, and our pup loved running around in the big yard. The kids/twin beds are in a loft above the living area so you have to be quiet if kids are sleeping.. or you can sit on the back porch and enjoy the crickets like we did. The AC works great and is adjustable. There are fun tree swings around, but keep an eye out for the fire-ant hills that come standard in the southern US.
Thanks for a great stay! We’ll be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this gem of an Airbnb. The animals were so sweet and the home was so cozy. We would definitely stay again!

We appreciated having the peaceful, wide open yet cozy space to break up a long road trip. Ashley was very welcoming and kind. Really a perfect place for a family or anyone who loves animals and country spaces."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time at this beautiful space on the farm! Our stay was a very memorable experience that we will cherish for long time. Thank you for helping our family make some fantastic memories together!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ashley place was very relaxing and my kids loved the petting zoo / air bnb situation and I don't think you can find a friendlier host.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing, private little cabin. The farm is an impressive setup with plenty of chickens, goats, and pigs to interact with. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful, relaxing stay on the farm! We loved visiting the animals and picking fresh eggs. Spent most of our time sitting on the back porch just soaking in the peace and quiet and sounds of the farm. Not too far from downtown Oxford when we wanted to venture out, but we always looked forward to coming back to the farm for rest and relaxation. Would definitely recommend if you’re in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ashley’s place was amazing! So charming and cozy. We can’t wait to stay again.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous cabin on a private semi rural spot within easy reach of Oxford which is very nice. Ashley is lovely and helpful. Double bed was very comfy as was the sofa. TV is good, good white goods and there is a kettle for us tea drinkers!
Just felt that there was too much stuff in the place - would be good to find a way for it to be pared back a little. Roosters are pretty noisy. But we’re used to animals so it didn’t affect us at all. Goats are lovely.
All in all a pretty nice place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ashley was so warm, welcoming, and understanding of our last-minute travel situation! Highly recommended to any potential visitors."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Can’t wait to be back
2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ad described ""4 acres of beautiful country side that's free to wander,"" but it was a small sectioned off piece of land in a neighborhood with an electric fence blocking the back area. One morning we woke up to a multitude of cars blocking us in, large groups of people wandering around, & several families walking up/sitting on the porch of our cottage disturbing us/our dogs. Although Ashley did later apologize once we walked out to get eggs, the unexpected visitors were not considerate to us as paying guests & wandered from early in the morning to the afternoon. This was not the quiet/remote getaway we were expecting. We weren't aware a field trip with multiple families would be there at the same time we were paying to be there. Ashley also recommended a friend/neighbor to take pictures of us. Quoted a price for the ""whole lot"" after the sitting fee was paid in cash. When pictures were finally viewable, the price for them was over double the first price given. Take your own pictures."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had the most wonderful time on the farm!Ashley was beyond kind and helpful, and the animals were absolutely delightful. My kids didn’t stop interacting with the animals the entire time we were there. It was so relaxing to just sit in the rocking chairs and take it all in! I am so grateful that we had this downtime together as a family without distractions. Thank you so much for a fantastic couple of days. We can’t wait to visit again!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place is beyond amazing!!!👍👍👍 cottage has all needed items, rustic style decor is 😍 we have stayed with 3.5 years old kid, so he enjoyed animals, especially 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 🐈‍⬛ wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the cottage and explore the area. Hope to be back 🇺🇸 🇱🇹"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don’t have enough good words to say about Ashley’s place. When I say it’s a little slice of Heaven, I mean it with my whole heart. Her communication from the minute of booking was 5 stars! Then when arriving everything was exactly as promised and more! I spent a night here to get away from the city and it filled my soul. Not only was the place magical, Ashley as a host is one of the best. Her heart and little touches are all through out the property. And getting a chance to share her home and animals was a true blessing. Highly Recommend!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super relaxing spot - beautiful space in a rural haven. Ashley was super responsive but gave us our privacy. Fresh eggs were a special touch, for sure!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a spectacular stay at Sweet Lucy Farm! The animals are friendly, adorable, hilarious hosts — the kitty cats and goats immediately welcomed us into to the fam.
The cottage was perfect for me and my 11 year-old kiddo, with room to spare. Everything was as good or better than expected with lots of thoughtful details. Piping hot water in the shower, nice selection of streaming services on the TV (though the critters provided plenty of live entertainment), comfy sheets and linens on the beds, etc.
Pop by Square Books in Oxford for a new book and settle in one of the rocking chairs at the farm — it’s heaven on earth."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for a relaxing weekend! on Sunday we just enjoyed the peaceful serenity of the place and all of the surroundings. We loved seeing and hearing the animals. Oxford is a beautiful city and it's not to far either. Being right outside of town was nice. I hope we have some time in the future to return to the area. Thank you!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal ‼️ Everyone needs to book this cozy cottage & escape to farm life paradise for a few days! The cottage is exquisitely decorated like a place you would see in Southern Living magazine! The farm animals are so precious & loving! Beware, you may want a small farm of your own after staying! So wonderful to relax on the porch rockers or swing on the tree swings or take a country bike ride. Having a relaxing country farm fresh egg breakfast is the BEST! So close to downtown Oxford too! Truly a little slice of heaven! We will be back annually, if not more! Better than a trip to the spa - pure relaxation & awe, pure JOY! Huge thanks to Ashley & Lucy, gracious hosts that created a Disney like farm fairytale experience for us. So grateful for our getaway!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Sweet Lucy Farm!! As soon as we drove up both our faces lit up. Sweet little cottage with the neighboring farm.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING. Everything is a 10 minute drive away --> great restaurants, local grocery, hiking, Faulker's house! Great spot for exploring Oxford but also having peace and quiet. But really the best part is the animals!

There is everything you need to feel at home. We loved, loved, loved the farm animals. There are chickens, goats, pigs, sheep and ducks. There are also a couple of friendly cats, cute bunnies, a host a red cardinals and a few hawks. They soothe the soul. We loved having morning coffee on the porch as we listened to the roosters. We loved watching the sunset and sky and swinging on the swing. Ashley, the owner, is like sunshine! Staying at Sweet Lucy Farm was a wonderful respite for these city folks from New York City. Thank you kindly, Ms Ashley! We appreciate your warm hospitality — your light."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We took our two kids ages 12 & 17 to spend an “unplugged” and simple Christmas from the 23-26th of December at Lucy’s farm. An arctic blast came through and some of the pipes were frozen.. next thing we know Ashley is blocking the heat and setting up a warmer underneath the cottage late at night.. not only was she an incredible host with her communication and dedication but what a hoot.. probably chatted more with her in the Airbnb thread than I did my mom the whole trip 🤣.. my kids and husband loved loved the animals and free range to explore the farm. It was a perfect Christmas experience and so so so glad I (we) met Ashley!!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is adorable and a MUST stay. The joy of the animals and tranquil country vibe of the place is incredible.
We stayed just for one night but wish we could have stayed for a week. Oxford is a beautiful town and this place is really close to it, but honestly just hanging out here petting the animals and sitting on the deck would do me. Absolute heaven.
The place is super well equipped and Ashley is an amazing host. If you are thinking about it - stop thinking and just do it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot close to downtown Oxford. Ashley is a wonderful host, had lots of recommendations, but the stars of the show were the animals.

The Cottage at Sweet Lucy Farm was such a serene and fun getaway for our family. The animals and Ashley have left a mark on our hearts. And just 10 minutes up the road from Ole Miss ❤️💙. We already miss it and can’t wait to come back! The animals definitely feel like pets - they’re so friendly and you have as much access to them as you want, which was so wonderful for the kids. We could go visit with them anytime of day or night. The eggs are so fresh - we picked 20 of them our first day! The cottage is exactly like the pictures - it’s the perfect little cozy spot. Ashley has bikes, chairs and a firepit and grill. We loved making a fire at night. She even provides a noise machine in the bedroom in case the roosters wake you up! We actually loved hearing them in the morning and the sheeps ‘baa’ing’ when we went to bed at night. As a mom, I feel like I hit a home run booking this."

When we first arrived, we heard a hard tapping on the porch glass door. Who was it? The chickens! We loved that! What a great welcome. This city girl loved retrieving fresh eggs from the chicken coop. The cottage is beautifully and tastefully decorated, comfortable and private. The Christmas decorations Ashley put up were also very much appreciated. Sweet Lucy Farm is about a 12 minute drive to Oxford where most restaurants are located. We highly recommend Snackbar and Jinsei. Also our visit to Rowan Oak, Nobel laureate William Faulkner’s home, was special —beautiful and informative. Thank you, Ashley! We hope to see you again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ashley has thought of everything for a lovely, relaxing stay in the country (yet close to town). Her Sweet Lucy Farm is a little slice of Heaven! The stylish, comfortable furnishings, the bucolic setting complete with adorable farm animals, and a fully stocked kitchen will sure to make your getaway all that you’ve ever wanted. Extra touches: a fire pit with surrounding chairs for viewing the stars late at night (you might even hear a Barred Owl hooting in a nearby tree); farm fresh eggs for whipping up breakfast; the softest sheets I’ve ever felt; did I mention that the animals are the cutest? — the baby goats were especially sweet, and it was a perfect morning when I could sit out on the back porch with my coffee, gaze into the back pasture, and watch those little guys (plus the sheep and Kunekune pigs) grazing on hay. Thank you, Ashley!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage at Sweet Lucy Farm was the perfect home away from home! Situated close to Oxford's attractions, it feels like a piece of Heaven.

Ashley gave us easy directions and valuable local intel. Tks Ashley!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Life in the farm, even it only being one night, was fantastic. Our family was returning from a long roadtrip with Sweet Lucy Farm being the last stop before heading home. Our girls loved playing with the animals and spent a large amount of time on the swings. At night we got to see fireflys as we spent some time making S’mores in the fire pit."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cottage was exactly as pictured and very charming. The animals were by far the best part for me and my kids. Even though we were close to the animals you couldn’t hear or smell them in the cottage which was nice. The cottage itself seemed even roomier than the pictures showed and fit our family nicely. Ashley was super responsive and nice.

Goats, pigs, sheep, chickens and fire flies.
My daughter picked eggs for the first time ever, and enjoyed truly fresh eggs ( 5 minutes from picking) for the first time.
And it was my first taste of fresh eggs in decades - a real treat!!
When we left it felt like the farm where I grew up. I can't say exactly why, maybe the feel and scent of the of the air, but it was wonderful.
Highly recommended."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing and a wonderful little get away, I'd recommend it to anyone. We stayed with two little kids and a small dog and it was cute and accommodating. kids really enjoyed seeing the goats and sheep."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A stay at Sweet Lucy Farm is always worth it! My family has stayed there twice now and we plan to stay again. The cottage is super cute, cozy and has everything you need, including fresh eggs! The animals make for a fun experience for kids and adults. You can feed the goats, sheep and pigs or run around with the chickens and roosters. If you're lucky, a chicken may even come to hang out on the back porch with you! Watching the sunset over the pasture is so peaceful and picture perfect. If you're lucky enough to get a midnight rain shower during your stay, you'll get to hear the most relaxing sound... rain on a tin roof, the best soundtrack for a good night's sleep. Watching the cows roam around the pasture while having your morning coffee on the back porch is also a great way to start the day. Ashley is an amazing host and the farm is an amazing place; I highly recommend you check it out if you find yourself in Oxford."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sweet Lucy Farm was an amazing & unique Oxford experience. Our daughter was fascinated with the animals, loved feeding the goats, sheep, and chickens, and playing with their sweet & friendly cats.

Our three year old was in heaven feeding and petting all of the farm animals.

It was just an all around wonderful experience with a very caring mother and daughter running this place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a getaway on a farm, this is definitely the place! The animals (goats, chickens, pigs, cats) will keep you entertained for hours!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had the best time at Sweet Lucy Farm. It was very comfortable with great communication leading up to and during our stay.

It was sad to leave and a pity we could only book for 1 night.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cottage at sweet Lucy farm is a little slice of heaven. Ashley has created such a beautiful place and it shows how much love and care has gone into making this home. It was beautifully decorated and very comfortable for one night for our family of 3.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Waking up and stepping out onto the back porch to baby cows and roosters saying “rise and shine” while the little goats were playing in the grass, it was like a bucolic dream. Freshly brewed coffee in hand, we loved sitting on the porch in the rocking chairs while watching as our son had such a wonderful time playing with the barnyard crew and swinging on the tire swing. We even grabbed a couple of bikes and took a little ride down the country road, stopping to inhale what smelled just like honeysuckle. It felt like we were in a movie. Ashley is an absolutely perfect host, made us feel right at home, and took care of our every need. We will definitely be back!"

PBP is adorable & the location is ideal. The area is quiet and peaceful, and being able to walk to the Square is such a bonus. The unit is well stocked - and well decorated!! We had everything we needed to prepare quick meals. There were plenty of kitchen consumables (paper towels, dishwasher pods, etc) and an abundance of clean towels, bedding & pillows. The art and makes it feel like home. The Oxford & Ole Miss touches are perfect.
Callie’s “rules” are minimal - enjoy the space, be comfortable, set the temp where you like, and don’t worry about a long checkout list. Simply respect & enjoy the space. Staying at PWP felt like staying with a friend."

The location was unbeatable! The condo was just five minutes from the square. There we found fantastic places for dinner, breakfast, great coffee, lunch, shopping and more. And now to the most important part of this review… Callie was AWESOME!! She communicated with us all the time, and made sure we had the best time there.

Callie has her condo set up so comfortably, with everything anyone could need to enjoy a stay, including a well-stocked kitchen and convenience toiletries. Favorite parts were the festive decor, quiet community, coffee bar/bar area and the amazing water pressure. Oh yeah, and the little vornado fan next to the bed in the master…pleasant surprise and a very nice touch from someone who has clearly thought of everything to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. Thank you, Callie!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked this adorable AirBnb for our first weekend getaway with our little one. The pictures are exactly what you get! The apartment feels like a luxury hotel, but home at the same time! It’s obvious how much thought Callie has put into her space from the hospitality to decor! The location is wonderful just being one hill away for the Oxford Square. Callie saw we rented for an infant & messaged me to see what she could do to make the apartment more family friendly for us & future guests. She had bath products, extra wipes & infant utensils waiting for us along with a pack & play for our baby to sleep in! We had a great weekend & can’t wait to rent this space again!"

The condo is located within a 4 minute stroll to the Square (where you have to check out Square Books and Hinton & Hinton and all the dining choices!) and the condo parking was nice bc it was assigned to each unit! The condo itself is beautifully appointed - everything made it feel like home! The bed was like sleeping on clouds and the towels were thick and soft! There are even makeup washcloths to take off makeup if you wear any and a hairdryer (which I forgot to pack so this was great!) The entire place was perfect! As a mom of two kids at Ole Miss and two more coming up soon, I will stay at Powder Blue anytime I can! Thank you for a great Oxford weekend!"

The neighborhood itself was quiet and clean, and gated was a plus. Amy was quick to answer any questions I had, and was overall a very lovely and friendly host!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We were very excited to stay here, but it was a disappointment. We are not the type of guests to constantly reach out and complain so had we done that corrections might have been made to a few of the issues.
Showers were dirty with used bars of soap, the kitchen was not stocked well, no knives. no toaster, no can opener… so plan ahead.
The furnace is very loud. We were there long enough to know we wouldn’t stay again because it was virtually impossible to sleep. The TV in the living room is good. Furniture is comfortable, appliances were good and new, I had to remove the shipping tape in the oven to use it. I did reach out because the fridge wasn’t cooling.
Washer is super loud, heads up don’t start it late at night. I wish I had a better rd use because it’s a nice place but didn’t work well for us and it was lacking basic needs."
