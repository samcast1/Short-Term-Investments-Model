2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, clean, serene. I absolutely loved staying here! I appreciated that Marko checked in with me to make sure I was able to get in ok. It was so peaceful at the house and the lake was a quick walk. My navigation did take me to the wrong drive, but if you follow the very clear instructions they provide (looking for the sign with addresses shown in the first picture) is easy to find."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great

2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,Marko and Tess have a wonderful tiny home! The lake and location is quiet and peaceful. Everything in the tiny home is clean and tidy. My family and I think the place is wonderful. The only two things we had a hard time with was the top windows/outside light and the enormous rain shower. There's no window coverings for the top windows and there is a light that does shine into the tiny home. We slept horribly bc of the light. The rain shower does make it hard to get soap/shampoo rised off.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were not sure about ‚Äútiny‚Äù since we had our pup with us‚Ä¶it was much larger then we anticipated! So charming, we hated to leave. Hoped to stay a week later on our return , sadly it is booked!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Truly a tiny house worth staying in! It‚Äôs located off the side of a lake and has a private fire pit area to use as well. Everything looks just as pictured. Only issue is the hot water didnt always heat in the bathroom, but Tess, the cohost was very responsive in getting someone to come check it out."

Whenever i needed anything i texted and got a response each time! The location was perfect and we felt safe! You are still able to run to the store if needed it‚Äôs not 20-30 mins out just around 8. The place looks even better in person than the photos! so don‚Äôt be scared to book here, we would stay a million times over again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This tiny home was very peaceful. Definitely needed that self care day away.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was pleasant overall, but we encountered a minor issue when taking a shower on the first day. The water turned freezing cold due to the gas running out on the water heater. After the landlord changed, we were able to get the hot water. Additionally, the water pressure was really low, so my gf had to wash her long hair everyday outside before taking a shower.
The house was just as excellent as it appeared in the pictures. Everything was perfect including the location, view, and cleanliness of the house. We loved the place, it created wonderful memories for us."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were looking for a quick getaway for the weekend and this was the perfect place. It was so peaceful and quiet and the farmhouse tiny house was beautiful. We enjoyed sitting by the fire-pit last night and the landscape around us.

I had a wonderful stay and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Tiny! We were in town for a wedding where events were spread between Flowood and Puckett, so this gave us a nice spot in-between all of the activities. I was a little worried to stay in a tiny home when I found out the temperature for most of our stay was going to be in the 20's, but the heater worked well to keep the place nice and warm. Everything was clean and Marko & Tess were super responsive and quick to get back to us with answers to our questions. We really appreciated the flexibility on checkout time while we waited for our late flight out of Jackson. If we're in town again when it's not freezing, we'll definitely look to stay here so we can hang out by the fire pit and explore the lake."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a peaceful and very comfortable stay. The location offers privacy and nice scenery. I would definitely love to stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We immediately noticed how beautiful and safe the entire neighborhood was, which is comforting!
I recommend driving extra slow and paying attention to your surroundings when entering or exiting at night because there are many deer, and they will run in front of the car.
Hosts left the lights to the tiny farmhouse on so we could easily locate it, and the campfire was also already lit for us.
Exterior is extremely beautiful, but the inside is even more stunning!! Looks just like the photos. They left snacks and had the heat on for us. The bed and bedding are extremely comfortable. The lake view is amazing. There is an overhead shower, but it can rotate, and there‚Äôs space to avoid getting your head wet.
Communication from both Marko and Tess were excellent! We will definitely be back!! 3 day 2 night stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely one of the most beautiful air bnbs we have ever stayed at! The location was nice and the house was amazing. Marko was very nice and even lit a fire for us. The house was very cute and perfect for my family. We hope to return in the future and recommend to anyone !!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I am a nurse who was in town for work and I loved the property. It was nice and clean and had beautiful country setting. The owners were very helpful and considerate. I will definitely book again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I were passing through the area, so only needed a place to stay for one night. We were lucky to have found Marko & Tess's Tiny home! Marko was proactive in getting in touch and making sure we could find the place (very helpful, since we got there after dark). He had even left a fire for us in the fire pit! The home was charming and cozy, and had all the amenities we needed. There were thoughtful touches everywhere too. I don't know who designed the house, but I loved the clearstory windows and the amount of daylight. The next time we are looking for a getaway, we would like to return so we can explore the area more."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The epitome of Southern Charm. Home was immaculately cleaned, host was exceptionally personable and most accommodating. While being an older home, the updated renovations and amenities were amazing while not losing their character and charm. There's an enclosed pation in the backyard that makes you just wanna snuggle up with hot chocolate and a blanket. The area was super safe and convenient, literally in the heart of everything. Walking distance from Belhaven College. There is absolutely not one bad nor negative thing I can say about this property. The host Mr. Hilary welcomed us with the most warmest greeting and welcomed.

He had answers about dining, siteseeing and the local Acadian/Cajun community which was an added bonus for my friend was travelling with! The house is exactly as showing and do make time to enjoy the back porch/garden area. Sit still enough and you will see the hummingbirds enjoying the flowers. A true delight!
It is easy to get to from the airport and easy to travel the area. Returning home to the charming and quit neighbourhood each day truly felt like we were coming home. A definitely little treasure I would highly recommend. And do take the time to chat with Hilary if you can, he is the epitome of southern charm and has a treasure trove of information and stories!

The cottage is So nice; it is constructed with so much attention to detail. The cabin just has so many nice features, and is so comfortable. The seating area under the cabin has entertainment and a full sink which is great while cooking on the grill downstairs. Especially at night, it is relaxing to just visit and look out over the pond, or do some fishing. It is not far from downtown Pelahatchie for groceries, etc. We actually plan to book again in the future. Highly recommend the cabin and the hosts!"

Kendra, in anticipation of the heat wave, had set up portable AC's in both upstairs bedrooms, along with a tall oscillating tower fan that helped a lot. But if you are accustomed to sleeping at a low temperature at night, this might not work for you. I would definitely book this home again!! Great host and great home!!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I would give this place 5 stars but it was warm upstairs in the bedrooms. There are two floor units upstairs but they just couldn‚Äôt keep up with the summer heat. Be aware there are foundation issues like doors not closing as they should but nothing that will affect your stay. It is an old house after all. Other than that it was a great stay and would come back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay. The inside of the home looked just like the pictures...beautifully decorated! Very private and peaceful stay. I loved the old charm of the home.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kendra‚Äôs place was adorably decorated and had everything we needed for our one night stay on our way to the beach!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I lived the theme and it smelled great everywhere
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This house in Belhaven was the perfect place to relax at the end of a long workshop. It felt like a New Orleans bungalow- very cozy. Loved the place and the location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, great night, Kendra was very helpful, will return soon."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great safe neighborhood. Loved the house. Would definitely stay again. Easy to find and get into!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was very cute and clean. It was perfect for a night for my partner, his 9 year old son, and I as a stop over on our way to the beach. Would stay here again if I was back in Jackson. The upstairs where the bedrooms and toilet are was considerably warmer than downstairs but other than that everything was perfect!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent Service
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little house was just perfect for our short overnight stay in Jackson. We loved the quiet historic neighborhood it is in with a driveway to pull our car off the street. The owner provides amenity basics and was helpful and flexible from our first interactions. We hope to stay here again as it is a good halfway point between our main residence and family beach house.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and peaceful neighborhood. Kendra was responsive and had helpful tips for the neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kendra was quick to respond when we needed help with something. The place is beautifully decorated.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I owned an AirBnB, I would want it to be like Kendra‚Äôs. Super clean, well decorated and furnished, in a lovely area and close to several restaurants. And for those who care about this, the shower head and water pressure was fabulous."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place in a beautiful and historic neighborhood. Charming old house, with private parking and much space. Would definitely recommend staying there!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my Mother‚Äôs Day weekend at Kendra‚Äôs place, this airbnb just got added to my favorites. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We only rented for an overnight on our journey so did not experience any of the neighboring community. Having a two-bedroom home at about the same cost as a hotel was well worth the price
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was easy to find and close to activities and good restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet and there was a small canal next to the house that I could hear at night, which was great. We stayed at several Airbnbs on our trip in different locations and this one was or favorite. The decor was colorful and cheery, with a lot of personality but it was still comfortable and homey. We loved it. It looks just like the pictures. It was clean, well appointed, and I highly recommend staying here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let‚Äôs start with the Host, she is phenomenal! She‚Äôs very responsive. I do not say that lightly. The home is beautiful. The linens are extremely nice. This was a great stay and I look forward to booking again. Thank you Ms. Kendra!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kendra‚Äôs spot was in a great, safe neighborhood! The decor of the house is perfect and Kendra was so quick to response when a question arose and also quick to offer help if needed!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute neighborhood, caring host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was built in 1868, so the stairs were creaky, and the house has settled. But it is a fun little house with a creek running by. Kendra was super responsive, helpful and accommodating. The key for us is that it's close to Belhaven University, as we were visiting our daughter there. There are alot of cute places to eat, drink and be merry. Kendra has them all listed in her welcome booklet. Overall it was a great stay. I would highly recommend the Jungalow."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is even better in person. Kendra has put so much thought and care into every piece of furniture and decor. The end result is a fun yet calming environment that made our stay very enjoyable! This spot is walking distance from an adorable park and a really nice walking path that goes all the way downtown. Would recommend and stay again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I must say it was by far everything I expected it to be and then some .
This place is my official place to stay whenever I revisit Jackson MS.
The host (Kendra) gave me a true dose of southern hospitality and not only in her home services but also her generosity. Kendra is one of a kind, how I wish more people up north were as kind and respectful as she was with me and my family from the moment we applied for Airbnb until the day of our check out .
Thanks again Kendra and God Bless."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nostalgic!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kendra put a lot of effort into the house. It shows well. It is very charming and right next to a river that is very calming and peaceful.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really enjoyed this place. We didn‚Äôt do much in Jackson and heard later is was a really rough town. We did not have any issues and the house was cute decorated and fully stocked with most things.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kendra's jungle-themed house in quiet Belhaven is a wonderful space! She's an extremely attentive host and even texted me just before I left town to let me know that I had left an object behind, which the cleaning people had put in the mailbox for my easy pickup. The house comes with a nice manual suggesting restaurants and local sites - location is convenient in a safe and quiet neighborhood."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great design choices to spice up your stay in a quiet neighborhood

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute theme. Very comfortable and lots of heaters to keep the old home warm.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing home. Feels fantastic when you walk into a Airbnb where the host clearly takes pride in what they own. We loved it! We recommend and will happily return !
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice & Clean place
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kendra‚Äôs place while in Town for the Dixie Nationals Livestock competition. The neighborhood was quaint, quiet and very peaceful for our stay, the beds were very comfy which is a rarity these days in rentals, the home was extremely clean and comfortable. I would only have 2 suggestions (NOT COMPLAINTS) to make it better and those are to place curtains in the front bedroom as the neighbor‚Äôs flood light shined in the room all night making it bright and possibly putting in a bigger hot water tank as we would have to wait 20-25 min between each 5 minute shower to get warm water and never had true hot water after the first shower had been taken. Kendra was VERY quick to respond and we will be staying in her property again if available on our return visit. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was very much lovely. The ambiance was superb & the host did a wonderful job with check in and communicating.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra‚Äôs place was nothing short of awesome! We will definitely be staying again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was amazing
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the place, a cozy space, super clean and the decor and the theme I loved"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I normally don‚Äôt write reviews. It isn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt enjoy the accommodations of a particular host, it‚Äôs because, like many of you, I‚Äôm lazy.
But Kendra‚Äôs hospitality, accommodations, and resourcefulness warrants such a review.
Suffice it to say, Kendra is beyond outstanding as a host and her property suited my wife and I well.
The Westin Jackson is no matched for what Kendra is doing with her rental properties and the around the clock service she provides.
Would I stay again, certainly."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed one night,An old house with few major renovations. Maintenance definitely has not been maintained and neither has regular cleaning. All bedding was covered in hair. Not the best location for safety. Very good WiFi though.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully decorated, great location."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really enjoyed the stay. Kendra was very accommodating with self check-in. The home was just as advertised and great location close to I-20 and Elvie‚Äôs for breakfast the following morning. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone passing through Jackson.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra‚Äôs place was as advertised and comfortable. My family and I enjoyed the stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, well located."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great property and Kendra is a fantastic host. We had a bit of a heater issue later in the evening but Kendra was very responsive to the point she drove to Wal-Mart, after 10:00 in the evening, and purchased a couple space heaters for us. As we all know, life just happens some times, but it's how you deal with those issues that determines the quality of the person. Kendra is a quality person! We will definitely book with her again. P.S. we loved the location of the house and the historical district. The creaky stairs were awesome!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kendra's place was a great stay while in Jackson! The house looks exactly as pictured, check in was easy, and it's in a perfect location to explore what Jackson has to offer. If you are staying here please take Kendra's reccomendations on restaurants to check out, you won't regret it!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location and great hosts. House was clean and beds were comfortable. The house is older and has a few bumps and bruises (as all old homes do) but the value is great and my group all enjoyed their stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed the stay here! Stairs are creaky, but everything else was awesome. Well equipped home and great for a quick getaway to anywhere in jackson. Easy location to get to. Bedrooms are upstairs and main living downstairs. Decor is very jungle!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kendra was an excellent hostess. She is great at communication with us before we arrived and during our stay if we needed anything. The house was charming as an early 1900's home would be. Good choice for us!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience. Very safe. So cute and well appointed.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I LOVE this house. The owner took well care of it. Very clean and organized. It has everything you need, towels, kitchen utensils, cookware etc. the decoration is amazing ü§© it has a nature theme with all the artificial plants and animal paintings on the walls. We obsoletely enjoyed the house!
And as she mentioned in the description: the stairs are SWEAKY!
The only thing I personally didn‚Äôt like is the see through curtains in the living and dining room. And no curtains at all in the kitchen. It made me little bit scared at night, i felt someone could be watching (it might be just me and it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to most people)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place for us to stay on a stop over to New Orleans. Kendra place was fantastic and suited our needs perfectly.
When we had a need to contact Kendra she replied almost instantly.
Thanks for a great stay. Good luck to you in the future.
Tim."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice older home. It is well decorated, comfortable and clean. It is central to a lot of activities. The only drawback was the streets were in bad shape and there was roadwork."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kendra‚Äôs home was very accommodating. We had the opportunity to meet Kendra and she was professional, warm and caring. We had several great conversations with her. We arrived early and she allowed us to check in. Everything was clean; the bed was very comfortable. The home decor was tasteful and telling. We enjoyed our stay tremendously. If we‚Äôre ever in Jackson, Mississippi again, we‚Äôll definitely book with Kendra. Wonderful experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John‚Äôs Airbnb is truly a gem. It‚Äôs stunning and beautiful, just like the photos. The grounds are also lovely, and I deeply enjoyed listening to all of the insects and frogs at night in the water features. This place in itself is a destination!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing property owned by amazing people. It was the perfect place to relax and recharge. I couldn't have selected a better place to enjoy my weekend. From the moment I went through the gate I felt happy and at peace. John was even gracious enough to let me tour the main property. John thank you so much for your kindness and opening the door to your beautiful house.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best place to stay in Jackson, MS. We come often to visit family, but this time we were so lucky to find this hidden gem to stay for a couple of nights. It is absolutely stunning and we cannot wait to come back. They had everything we would ever need for our two night stay, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The serene views from inside the studio, both during the day and at night, were truly impressive. It was exactly the ending we needed to our week long trip to the south!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mother and I stayed at the Falk House for 2 nights, what a dream! It exceeded our expectations and the pictures did not do it justice. Absolutely gorgeous and peaceful stay. This place is INSPIRING, the layout, furniture and art was meticulously curated and the kitchen and bathroom were stocked with all the essentials and more! I can not recommend this place enough for a special and unique stay in Jackson."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing get-away. Perfect for a couples weekend stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Falk house is an absolutely amazing place to stay! My husband and I spent an anniversary weekend here and had an incredibly magical time. The space is gorgeous, with brilliant architecture and beautiful views outside. John keeps the place looking absolutely immaculate inside and out, and we felt like our every need had been anticipated‚Äîfrom the provided snacks (and amenities like fire logs & a fully equipped bar cart) to the clear instructions for check in, utilities etc‚Äîthe entire experience felt like staying at a five star resort. The space is amazingly private, but John was fully accessible: right next door and very responsive over text. The space itself is an elegant dream of a midcentury modern artist studio, and when you‚Äôre in it you feel transported to a bygone era. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a romantic destination or a place for inspiration to strike, staying at the Falk house is like stepping into a gorgeous painting. You owe it to yourself to stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at the Falk house! It was such a romantic getaway for my husband and I. We loved the glass panels and the mid century modern style. We hope to visit again soon.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The studio is spectacular, and offers a peek inside one of Jackson‚Äôs most storied houses. It was not designed as a residence, so the studio does not offer every convenience, but it is an extraordinary stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first time in Jackson, Missississippi and this is definitely one of the hidden gems of the area. It's really close to a few great spots for brunch, but the aesthetics will take you to a different time - a time of retro art and furniture. There were no issues with the gate, and while it's a glass house, you do feel private since it's tucked far away and there are plenty of trees. The pictures do not do it justice!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"magical space, lucky to stay here and experience it , great friendly host, i hope to be able to stay again in future"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was amazing and the views were beautiful.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place- so unique and wonderful!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Our boys (dogs) loved the outdoor area and constant 360 view of the squirrels. The studio was very peaceful, quiet, and architecturally stunning. Almost every need was considered and accommodated for. The bed was sinfully comfortable. We appreciated every well thought detail. Jackson is not very walkable, so the location is perfect - 10-15 minute drives to everything. We did not get to meet John, but Jake was very welcoming and immediately made us feel right at home. They both checked in with us throughout our stay. Top notch, a must if visiting Jackson."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,John‚Äôs place is so wonderful! It was truly a joy. I loved the setting with the lake view and we loved meeting the owners and hearing the history of this home and guest house! This place gets 5 stars and would definitely come back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We cannot say enough about how outstanding our stay was at the studio in Falk House! Being able to stay in such an amazing piece of modernest architecture felt like a true privilege and we are so grateful to John and Jake for sharing it with us.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved everything! Will definitely be coming back! Beautiful place, loved all of the scenery and the hosts were absolutely amazing!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Studio was just beautiful, and John and Jacob are generous to share their property with travelers. Every detail of the stay was considered, from USB outlets to the towel hanger in the bathroom to a book of short stories in the nightstand. I also felt particularly loved to be gently and curiously greeted by Rusty, their pooch, upon arrival."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was born and raised in Jackson, MS and this is one of the coolest properties I've seen in the area. The architecture and history is fantastic. I love they way they maintained the character and integrity of the design. The hosts went above and beyond with the treats and amenities they left for me (Aveda shower products, snacks, beverages, even eggnog and a Christmas tree for the holidays). The studio is very spacious and clean. I loved waking up to the large windows and being surrounded by trees. The hosts live in the main house, but totally respect the privacy of guests. The area is safe, quiet, gated and convenient. 10/10 would recommend to anyone visiting the Jackson area!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique. Appreciate the view and ambiance.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It's not hard to put in words just how wonderful John's place is. The space feels like a portal to a beautiful bygone era where you can fully relax away from the noise of the modern world. Step inside the mid-century guest house and you will immediately feel the warmth of perfectly curated time capsule while being surrounded by nature. John has put a lot of care into the space and it shows. My husband and I spent the mornings sipping coffee & enjoying jazz while watching our two Brussels griffons take in all the beautiful views. They were both also warmly welcomed by John with food bowls that we forgot to pack!
John has wonderful dining recommendations in Jackson -Brent‚Äôs Drugs, Walker‚Äôs Drive In, Pulito, and Elvies. Hidden gems of Jackson are The End of All Music Vinyl and Lemuria Books. Spending the evenings in the guesthouse watching the sunset with a book next to the fireplace was truly the peak of what it means to relax and reset. We can‚Äôt wait to return someday very soon."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A real treat to stay in such a stunning piece of art. John was an excellent host and thought of everything!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I will definitely return to this gorgeous mid century modern air bnb! I felt safe, secure, and it was exactly as described. I spent over a week working remotely from this property and let me say, it is special and calming!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visiting Jackson (and the state, for that matter) for the first time, we had no clue what to expect. And then John and Jake went about setting a bar that will be difficult for anyone to surpass. Their property is exquisite. The setting and vibe is so peaceful. We could not have asked for more in our studio accommodations; walking through the door felt like stepping into an embrace. Soft music and lighting, great amenities, cool mid-century modern style, gorgeous view of the surroundings. Awesome! John and Jake were most generous with their time and hospitality - great recommendations for dining and exploring in Jackson and beyond. In years of Airbnb experience, by far the most gracious hosts we‚Äôve encountered. If you ever find yourself in Jackson, make sure you find yourself here! We‚Äôre already looking for reasons to visit again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing stay and hosts!! They went above and beyond to make sure we (and our dog) felt welcome and taken care of! Peaceful home and surroundings. We sat out on the water and enjoyed the calm and quiet environment. Perfect choice to spend a few days after our wedding!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful with the tall glass windows and open studio concept. Think Frank Lloyd Wright details. We really enjoyed staying at The Falk House and loved the privacy and serene surrounding neighborhood. John was exceptionally responsive and helpful. Highly recommend this place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place and will definitely book again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is absolutely GORGEOUS and I constantly found myself in awe of the architecture, furniture, and decor throughout the guest house as well as the exterior of main house. If you are an appreciator of Mid Century Modern architecture and design, this is an absolute MUST stay. I must have had 10+ friends inquire ""where are you?!"" based on my of Insta posts!
We were a short drive away from Fondren neighborhood/ business district in Jackson, MS and there were more great restaurants than we could visit in our long weekend stay, and we are already considering a second trip.
Even more amazing was the fact that the hosts were pet friendly and we were able to bring our small dog along with us. She absolutely LOVED walking throughout the guest house peaking out every window she could, keeping her eyes on squirrels, etc.
Hosts were very responsive via text message and eager to offer up dining and other recommendations. Already thinking of making a return visit to the Falk House!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stellar experience all around. The Falk House is just as advertised, and John was extraordinarily responsive. I would 100% return, and I would recommend Falk House‚Äîwithout hesitation‚Äîto family and close friends looking for lodging in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at the Falk Studio is a MUST when traveling to or through Jackson, MS! Beautiful home- inside + out. Safe + peaceful. Unique + memorable for sure. From our 12 year old daughter ""We stepped out side every night to hear the night time animals- frogs, owls, + jar birds perform an opera."" We stayed for 6 nights for my daughter to attend Ballet Magnificat. We are incredibly grateful to the hosts for opening up their heart + home to us."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely wonderful hidden gem! Peaceful, safe and quiet, yet 5 mins away from everything I needed. John was amazing and super fast with correspondence and anything I needed. So happy to have found the perfect place to get away and work for a few days with the most serene backdrop! I have already passed along the link to so many people and will definitely book again soon in the near future!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and unique place! We will remember our stay there with gratitude.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John‚Äôs place is one of the most stunning stays I‚Äôve had while traveling. The guest house is located behind the main house with a huge lawn and views of the pond. The property is very private and serene and the studio is simply stunning. Cannot recommend this place or John any higher. He was friendly, helpful, and communicative for all our needs."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a terrific stay at John's place. A truly special house and property. This was a work trip for me and the place was set up perfectly to get some great quiet work done. Great neighborhood and location. Everything could not be better.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is what an airbnb experience should be. Unique quarters, super hospitable owner and attention to detail. If you like architecture at all you won‚Äôt want to miss this Talliesen West evoked structure. Outside it‚Äôs a bit On Walden Pond with a fire pit option. This was my first visit to Jackson and I found people very friendly & a calm over all pace of life. The studio is pristinely clean. We lucked out on the weather - leaves are still multi colored and the air cool. I hope John lets us come back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Falk House is the perfect stay for a solo traveling woman. I felt safe and at ease on the property. Especially with John and Jake nearby. This is the best getaway for both nature and mid century modern architecture lovers who‚Äôd prefer relaxation and privacy without feeling too secluded from others. Will definitely be visiting again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the most amazing cottage we could ever imagine. An original 50‚Äôs mid century modern house in the most serene beautiful setting. John was very helpful and gracious. If you love architecture don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to stay in this cottage.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property! Just what the doctor ordered! John was an exceptional host! Studio was meticulous; private, spacious & very comfortable. Location couldn‚Äôt have been better. Loved everything about our stay. Beautiful details throughout. We appreciate the opportunity to have stayed there. Mike & Joy"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful stay!! Can‚Äôt wait to hopefully return again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and serene in every way. You won‚Äôt believe that you are in Jackson, MS! John and Jake were wonderful hosts who have taken great care to honor and restore this beautiful home."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved it! Very aesthetically pleasing!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing unique place to stay.
We had the most tranquil few days, I can not speak highly enough of the host John. The communication was fantastic, but never felt intrusive.
The house was ready when we arrived with everything we needed, including the fire pit which was set and ready to light.
This was our first ever Airbnb and it has set the bar extremely high."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to stay in Jackson!! My fianc√© and I stayed here for a few days to explore Jackson ahead of a weekend in New Orleans. The space was immaculately clean and so nicely decorated. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!! Thoughtful personal touches as well. We were able to work from John‚Äôs home with great Wifi and plenty of work spaces. John and Jake are delightful hosts and went out of their way to help us (even drove us to pick up our rental car!). I cannot recommend this stay enough!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is incredible. It‚Äôs a hidden gem in the middle of Jackson. John has thought of everything. Every detail was covered. It was having my own little private retreat. Already planning another staycation in this beautiful home. Definitely a respite for anyone‚Äôs soul.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic spot. It‚Äôs exactly what you hope it will be.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A fantastic experience for fans of mid-century modern architecture and design. Don't be shy about the lack of window coverings as the property is surrounded by a waterway and trees and it would be very difficult for anyone in one of the neighboring properties in the distance or from the street to actually see inside the house at night. The owners do provide one electric lantern but bringing headlamps or flashlights would be very useful as the property is very dark at night. And don't be scared of all the strange sound at night outside. It's just the frogs.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Falk House is an absolute dream of architectural design, natural beauty, quiet privacy and luxurious comfort. John has clearly put his heart and soul into preserving this stunning house, furnishing it with art, books and gorgeous furniture. We were welcomed with a lovely bottle of wine, snacks, mixers and a fridge filled with drinks --- and organic cotton sleep masks! The firepit was prepared with firewood, ready for a romantic evening by the tree shaded lake. It was a short drive to Lemuria Bookstore, Broad Street Bakery & Cafe and the cool Fondren district. We truly savored our time in this gorgeous glass house and hope to return for a week long stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in the listing is accurate. The place is stunning, but what the description and pictures don't do justice to is the feeling you get from staying at the Falk House. The design and architecture is so perfectly harmonious that it creates a very centering and calming feeling. Never slept better. Would recommend 10/10."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a dream; especially for mid century fans! The design of the home is incredible and all of the thoughtful touches John adds makes you feel like you‚Äôre at a retreat spa. The bed is very comfy and everything you could need for a short stay has been thought of. I feel so lucky we were able to come and enjoy this space. I wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely stunning visit and and home!! I hope to return again soon to this beautiful place. The hosts were wonderful and very attentive, and have thought through just about every detail to make the stay comfortable."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This past weekend my husband and I dropped our daughter off to visit her Aunt, and we took a weekend trip to‚Ä¶.Jackson, Mississippi.
Now, on the surface one might say ‚ÄúJackson? Mississippi?!?‚Äù But we wanted a place in quick driving distance that had a mid century place to stay, and we landed on this charming Airbnb. It is a historic house and you can stay in the art studio that is separate from the main house.
It. Was. Beautiful. And amazing. And inspiring. And all the words that strike the note in your heart when you desperately need that moment of peace.
The hosts (John and Jacob) are wonderful as well. So, thank you to our hosts. And, if you get a chance to go stay in the art studio at the historic Falk House, I highly recommend it.
Also, Jackson was such a fun surprise. Artsy! And excellent food!) We will be going back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Falk House
In a word, Perfection! While looking for a quick getaway, my husband and I happened upon the Falk House. It was everything and more! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by this space. The guesthouse is stunningly beautiful and makes for the perfect work environment, as well as place to simply relax. The studio is very clean and beautifully decorated! We also enjoyed sitting on the patio by the small lake and watching the wildlife, such as the resident alligator. My husband even got to do a little fishing as well. We also loved the privacy the Falk House provides while also being convenient to some great restaurants the area has to offer. 10/10 would highly recommend! Our only regret is that we didn‚Äôt stay longer! Thanks John and Jake for sharing your hidden oasis. We‚Äôll be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing space. Hosts are so thoughtful and kind. Loved watching the rain fall through the windows. Really special space. Highly recommend!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful space!! Highly recommend. Gorgeous decor, super comfortable bed, good location. Very peaceful."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful estate. Friendly and welcoming hosts. This is definitely a great getaway. Highly recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is amazing. It‚Äôs perfect for a quiet retreat. I didn‚Äôt want to go do anything because I was so relaxed and the setting is so serene! John was very communicative and accommodating, even when I was a day late due to a flight cancellation. Also, if you‚Äôre into mid-century modern design, you will be amazed at the care and thoughtfulness of every detail. I hope to come back and enjoy gem in Jackson again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give 10 stars, but 5 is the max. I can‚Äôt say one negative thing about a place so perfect, and I couldn‚Äôt have had a better visit. Our hosts were fabulous, helpful and very communicative., and last but not least very thoughtful we even got eye covers, snacks and drinks! The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in as well, which is very important. The fireplace was so cozy and created a perfect space to read my book. I may have cried tears of joy upon arrival because this place is my dream, and there‚Äôs no doubt we will be back for another visit! If you love mid century you will be in for a treat. The location is also very central to everything we wanted to visit!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing property with an amazing host. Staying there was truly a dream. We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to thank the owners of this beautiful mid-century modern (MCM) house for sharing it with folks like us who normally only get to see such a place in magazines. What a treat! As soon as we got in the door with our suitcases, I put some 1950s and early 1960s music (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Henry Mancini) on the Bluetooth speaker. It was cool enough when we visited in early May to open the doors during the day and be entirely comfortable. So relaxing! The single caveat I will mention‚Äînot a complaint, just a heads-up‚Äîis that MCM design sometimes prioritizes style and statement over comfort. This ""form above function"" thinking shows up at the Falk House only in the bathroom, which has real eye appeal with its hard textures and triangular sink but will come as something of a surprise to travelers accustomed to the brightly lighted, spacious facilities of, say, a Hampton Inn. Also, there are a few concrete steps to get to the bathroom, so I would not recommend this as a stay for someone in need of a walker or cane to get around. Other than that, you should book this wonderful house and see what the future looked like in the late 1950s!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great space warm, inviting and great design. The hosts are wonderful in very way. Don‚Äôt pass this place up"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a large, comfortable, open space situated in a lovely park like setting. It is located in a lovely area of Jackson with easy access to restaurants and shopping etc."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic hosts with top notch communication. The Falk House is an incredibly impressive piece of architecture and the whole property is gorgeous. It‚Äôs the extra touches that made me feel right at home ‚Äî coffee maker, light snacks, smart TV, flat and sparkling water, bathroom essentials, etc. Will be recommending The Falk House to anyone I know visiting Jackson."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely retreat takes one back to a slower pace and time. Great for bird watcher‚Äôs, nature lovers, artists and architectural fans."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You want a beautiful place to let your hair down and enjoy the scenery? This is the place to go! The house is so beautiful. The host was so great and made sure to be available if I needed anything. The patio going out to the lake was so nice. I‚Äôll be visiting again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beyond cool! John's property is in a beautiful woods setting in the middle of Jackson. You feel secluded but a short drive to the best there is in Jackson. In addition, the Art Studio was immaculately clean and super comfortable from the bed to the linens and also includes a great setting and view of a lake to unwind. In addition to the physical comforts the property has a beautiful architecture design and is well appointed with beautiful art and furnishings to create a great experience for your senses. A truly unique experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Such a hidden gem! Jake and John were awesome! Great hospitality and plenty of privacy! So much attention to detail! One of the best weekends away we‚Äôve ever had! Would highly recommend to all my friends and family! You won‚Äôt regret it!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute jewel of a Mid-Century Modern art studio set in a peaceful waterside landscape. This glass cube sports attention to detail in architecture and furnishings. It may be part of a historic residence but it's also super clean with modern comforts (restful bed, fluffy towels, micro-kitchen, solar pathlights). The hosts are extremely thoughtful and responsive. They are dedicated homeowners and it was a privilege to stay in their splendid guest house. A truly rare opportunity."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a once in a lifetime kind of stay that I‚Äôd comfortably list as a must-see for anyone in the state. If it were just for the house that would be enough, but John and Jake elevated the experience to feeling borderline serendipitous. Their attentive thoughtfulness coupled and respect for privacy made this the perfect stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start?
The second you turn into the gate you realize that your about to experience a once in a lifetime, jaw dropping moment.
The place is absolutely gorgeous. The property is well maintained down to every last detail. We were greeted by Jacob first and he was the most welcoming and kind co-host we have ever mer. He told us some history about the house and made sure we knew to call if we needed anything at all.
A few hours later we met John, he was so friendly & knowledgeable about the history of this one of a kind dream house. His attention to detail is impecable.
We walked into our guest house and we were in awe at the beauty, every inch of it!! Truly a glass house.
They had it stocked with great snacks & drinks to our surprise.
We decided to walk around to explore a bit only to find the beautiful lake, tall trees & a family of ducks passing by.
They had the Fire pit already set up for us with 4 very comfortable chairs to just sit and enjoy water by the water or just listen to the sound of nature. The birds were chirping away.
It was relaxing & you have privacy.
We went to Chard for dinner which was great. Amazing steaks. Saturday we spent the day exploring town & went to the 65,000 SF flea mart. We had a great time. Honestly we could of never left the guest house and been perfectly content!
It is that special of a place.
I would highly recommend this listing for anyone going within 20-30 minutes of the house. It‚Äôs worth the drive to stay here no matter what you going to Mississippi for.
No words can describe the impression John & Jake leave on you. They are what southern hospitality is all about. You feel like you‚Äôve known them forever instantly. So helpful with anything at all. Yet they give you all the privacy you want.
Great people. Period!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! If you like art, nature, architecture, peace, or relaxation - this is your spot! We had a great stay at The Falk House. It‚Äôs so beautiful and peaceful in the studio. John and Jake are lovely hosts, providing a beautiful experience right in the middle of Jackson! Stay here if you are thinking about it‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I first walked in, I had tears in my eyes. Every time friends and family members travel to the US for the first time, we visit the Glass House of Philip Johnson. I now understand what this is all about. Thank you John for sharing this masterpiece."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a wonderful, peaceful place to stay. John is an excellent host and went out of his way to make sure we had a safe place to stay had we experienced severe weather as was predicted. The views are beautiful and the bed extremely comfortable. If you are considering staying here and have the chance TAKE IT!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Listen..! Everything was awesome..! The place is very nice, I was accommodated with everything I needed and more..! John was the perfect host and checked on me daily....not only is this place a gem, John is a gem as well..! I'll get this place every time I visit Jackson if it's available..!!! This place get 5 stars and John does also for being a great host..! I highly recommend this place..!!!üòÄüëçüèæüëåüèæ"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is an extraordinarily beautiful and well cared for place. Thoughtfully curated and hosted
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb was the best! If you‚Äôre an art lover or MCM fan, you‚Äôll love the thoughtful architecture and impeccable decor. John communicated in a timely and efficient manner, and he left snacks, coffee and minis for us (which we 10000% took advantage of!!). We enjoyed waking up with the natural sunlight each morning and plan on staying again next time."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This immaculately designed studio is a superb place to stay for a relaxing and fun getaway!
The hosts made it simple to enter the studio upon arrival and were so kind to check in daily making sure we had all we needed.
If you love mid century modern design, you are in for a real treat. The grounds are gorgeous and the interior is so very cool!
The outdoor fire pit was such a nice surprise and the indoor fireplace was a one of my favorite spots to sit with one of the many great books available.
The bar was set up with snacks and drinks and was just so nice to have as we arrived in the evening wanting a cocktail to celebrate the start to our mini vacation.
This Airbnb really was such a delight! Living in Jackson, we never knew this gem existed. We encourage locals to check it out for a great staycation!
We look forward to staying here again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin! This is by far the most beautiful Airbnb's I have stayed at. The moment you drive in, you are surrounded by the big beautiful trees , with the creek right outside your door. The wall to wall windows inside make you feel like your outside. The cozy sitting area with the fireplace. The most comfy bed I think I've ever slept in and all the personal touches from the coffee, drinks, to the snacks provided. Oh and did I mention the shower! Dreamy!
Meeting and speaking to John was the highlight. He is the most gracious host! If you need to escape the city and need a relaxing place to retreat, look no further! Thank you so very much John! I will without a doubt be back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The artist studio at the Falk House is an amazing place. If you‚Äôre a fan of Mies Van Der Rohe - Frank Lloyd Wright you will love W.W.Easley‚Äôs timeless modernist creation. We felt like we were sleeping in a very special place. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was great. John was so generous with his time and showed us the property. This studio is best for couples. It‚Äôs spectacular ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Faulk House is absolutely a must see!
We are so thankful to John for sharing his home!
The Art Studio is a space that demands your complete attention from the time you enter the room until you (force yourself) to leave it! Within moments of opening the door you will instantly feel yourself unwind into the space as you settle in for a night or two‚Ä¶or more!!
You will also enjoy sitting out by a cozy fire with a view of the lake or simply admiring every detail of the design and decor inside the studio.
From the perfectly shaped ice for a glass of bourbon to the invigorating rosemary mint shampoo‚Ä¶John thought of everything!
Thank you John for being a spectacular host! Meeting you was by far the best part of our stay ü§ó!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying in the artists suite was an incredibly unique experience that I will never forget. John was the perfect host and was happy to give restaurant recommendations and ideas on what to see and do in Jackson. Do not miss your chance to stay in this meticulously kept piece of history.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"26 years as a builder and this property I am in awe of. John was on the spot with coms and very handy on checking in on us. There was no tv and I did not know that when I reserved. My wife and I spent two days with no tv and we found ourselves enjoying every minute of it. We only left to go to store. We will not hesitate to stay again and we have already told 30 couples about our stay. If you want to step back to a time when couples entertained themselves in the evenings with no boob tube, this is a must!!! BRAVO, JOHN!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful place to stay! Close to many good restaurants and bars. My wife and I had a blast getting away from the house for a bit. If you aren‚Äôt out having fun, you‚Äôre enjoying the view the house has to offer (If you like a forest scene). The architecture is amazing, and relaxing, if art is something you enjoy definitely think about staying here. The hosts are more then accommodating and warm. Definitely worth the price and drive!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This art studio is a perfect getaway for couples. The property is beautiful and even prompted me to look it up online it is so unique! The owner John could not be more accommodating. The friendly pup Rusty was a nice little visitor and made me miss our dogs a little less! We had to evacuate from New Orleans because of üåÄIda. The atmosphere of this beautiful property is just what we needed after riding out the storm. Thank you John for being amazing! We look forward to the next time we get to come soak up the energy of this amazing house. The peacefulness and serene atmosphere is an energy I have rarely experienced. Please if you‚Äôre in Jackson, book this amazing property! You won‚Äôt regret it. Oh and the COUCH is soooooo comfortable I wanted to take it home!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"STOP SCROLLING and book this now!! I do not have enough good things to say about John and the studio! Let me give it a try though. The studio is magnificent, the floor to ceiling windows give you so much freedom and openness but at the same time the property is set up that it feels as private as a room without a single window. The decor is tasteful and fits the house so perfectly, if you need any inspiration for any project you will find it in no time just sitting in one of the many chairs of the studio.
Let me tell you though, the real gem of this property is John. He is the kindest most servant hearted man I have ever met. Airbnb hosts always say let me know if you need anything but John means it. Never has someone gone out of their way so much to make a stay more memorable than this man.
Have I convinced you yet? I have nothing to gain here. This is just a once in a lifetime Airbnb."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Work of art home, pleasure staying there, waking up in light and nature, as well as being so close to the city. Thanks again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a host, Jennifer was outstanding in terms of responsiveness, kindness, and just plain being helpful. I felt welcomed immediately. Jennifer and Oliver's home is beautiful, and had everything we needed to relax and spend time with family. Their home is close to everything that mattered to us, was very comfortable and peaceful, and is definitely a place we'd stay over and over again. It isn't often that I feel I received value for every dollar I spent. These folks nailed it in their attentiveness, attention to detail, great attitudes, and great communication. We'll be back. We loved it."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful residence. Full of fine things suitable for master chefs, bibliophiles, and weekend (or armchair) athletes. And that stunning bathroom! The hosts recommended activities & restaurants that almost kept us from the many in-house treats. The townhouse is expansive yet cozy, super-clean, with private courtyards shielded from sun and wind. The hosts are extremely thoughtful and responsive. A topnotch stay in the Jackson Fondren area."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best! This was an amazing place, southern hospitality at its finest! It had everything we needed and we really had no need to leave the house. The hosts were awesome so welcoming and very helpful."

No details were missed by Jennifer & Oliver! I have traveled the world as a guest and hosted thousands as an Airbnb host myself. If you are considering Jackson‚Ä¶ Book THIS place!! Top Tier Accommodations!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phem‚Äôs place was private and clean. Close to the highway and close to our desired destinations within the city. The magnolia trees were fabulous and the lights along the walkway made getting into his place comfortable and easy to navigate. The digital entry was easy peasy. No keys to keep track of or lock yourself out. Plenty of towels were provided and everything smelled clean and fresh.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place in a peaceful neighborhood. Great place for a quick visit to see family.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it, I‚Äôm going back"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable space!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phem‚Äôs place was incredibly clean and organized. The air con also worked excellent (I like to sleep in ice cold conditions). Phem also proactively messaged me in regards to check in and encouraged me to reach out with any questions. Excellent host.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay. Phem was always communicative and friendly. The place looked just like the pictures and I was extremely comfortable. I recommend having something for soiled towels or laundry if you‚Äôre staying for an extended period of time. Also, the lights went out for about 2 days due to there being a storm , but Phem offered me to stay at another one of his properties with no hesitation. Overall I loved it and can‚Äôt wait to book again !!! üòÄ"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent host, willing to go above and beyond for the guests. Thank you."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Phems place is just as described. He was very accommodating to allow us to stay for our preferred days at such short notice. There is a separate living room, bedroom and bathroom provided in the suite. You can sometimes hear the laundry room at times, but it wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. Check-in instructions were very clear and helpful. Overall, I would visit again."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quaint unit perfect for sleeping. The photos were taken during a different season of the year and optimal for advertising. The outside was not horrible, but not similar to the pictures. I almost passed it.
instructions were provided for everything!
Very nice neighbors. Very walkable neighborhood."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, attractive and charming rental. The entry at night was lovely, through the magnolia trees with twinkle lights. Comfortable bedding. I would not hesitate to book again on future travels between my home and Dallas."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place to stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed at Phem‚Äôs multiple times now. Perfect spot.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a quick stay form my boyfriend and I on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Every thing was clean and super cute. We enjoyed our stay . Would definitely stay again !!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Magnolia Suite was just like the photos, was quaint, very comfortable & quiet. The amenities list a private backyard, but I was not provided information on how to access it. I did not inquire as I walked my dog before I arrived & there is a school just 1/2 block away that was well lit at night. The neighborhood made me feel safe & neighbors were friendly. The host is pet friendly, but does charge a pet fee that was not mentioned in the listing. I recommended this information be provided in the listing. I was in Jackson to show at a dog show so being pet friendly is very important.
It is unfortunate that I could not determine how to run the lovely fan in the bedroom with the lights off as the wall switch appeared to run both the fan & the separate ceiling lights. It was not important for my stay as the air conditioning & heat were superb.
I would definitely stay again if I come back to Jackson. It is a lovely suite and worth the price."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"No problems at all, comfy place in nice neighborhood"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved It!! I will point out, that if you are planning more than 2 people coming, Don't. It's designed for 2 or less. In my case, it was just me.
Located in a nice neighborhood and very easy to find. Looks exactly as it is represented in the ad.
Owner communicated great!!
As with any review, people want to know the main issue: Would you stay there again??
HECK YES! I Will Be a Returning Tenant."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Needed a place just for the night. Phem's place was clean and felt safe. Will stay again when traveling.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a quick one night stay as we were traveling through Jackson on our way to Atlanta. This was the perfect spot. Easy access. Parked on the street 20 feet from the door. Quiet and safe and a block away from a school. Beautiful tree lined streets. Phem is quick to answer any questions you might have. I definitely would stay here again. Much easier than staying at a hotel.

There‚Äôs a fridge and a microwave in the living room and basic kitchen utensils in a cabinet.
Wonderful to be able to self regulate the air conditioning (and turn it off).
Private entrance. Parking in front of the studio. Quiet residential area.
Phem lives in the house next door. He‚Äôs very friendly and quickly responds to any questions or requests."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a perfect place to stay for a short work trip! Beautiful scenery, decor, and a welcoming host. Highly recommend!!!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My overall stay was very good at Phem's place. You can't beat the price that was paid for three nights anywhere, so this was perfect for me. The only thing I would say is that some blinds or a black out curtain could've been over the bathroom window to cover it a little more. Also, there was a plug-in and a scented decor inside the bathroom that was a little too strong for me.
I have asthma, so this just may have been too strong for me, but not for anyone else that doesn't deal with sinus or allergy issues. My husband didn't have an issue with it all. It wasn't a big deal for the price that we paid though. I just relocated the plug-in and the scented decor to the living room area while I slept in the bedroom, which worked out well for me.
The bathroom is located off the bedroom.
Overall, I would recommend the place to stay. You can't beat the price for a three night stay and get a place like this anywhere. I would stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"overall nice place , with a great host. I dont have any complaints about my stay."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The outdoor area was not maintained and usable as it looks in the photos. However the inside was clean and. Couch was uncomfortable and wifi was spotty for some of my devices. Neighbors were roudy late at night making it harder to sleep. Overall neighborhood location is private and seems safe. Host was communicative and place served it's purpose for a 1 night stay while I was traveling in the road
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed with Phem at this location twice now and it is great! Phem communicates well and is so friendly and very responsive. The apartment is very comfortable and clean. I will book again when staying in Jackson.

thanks phem"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Very quiet. Older neighborhood in Jackson. Traveled with small elderly dog who enjoyed sitting under the magnolia trees with me. Host was vert accomodating for my short notice stay. Would stay again.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean and comfortable, quiet neighborhood and private. TV connection in bedroom was lost and host was quick to respond and resolve. Shared with host benefits of adding air purification machine. Brought my portable which helped with allergies. (Contact me if interested.) Would definitely recommend for a place to stay in Jackson."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, easy in and out. Comfortable bed and a quiet neighborhood. Netflix and other entertainment options were available."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like other reviewers have said, you can hear the host family through the closed and locked door in the living room. It sounds like the main house laundry area is on the other side. Their pet bird can be heard in the unit. And there were some sounds of family life early in the morning. But, I agree with other reviewers that they appear conscious of their guests and of minimizing noise.
The kitchenette of a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker all worked well.
The living room, bedroom, and bathroom we're comfortably spacious for two people, thoughtfully decorated, and clean.
Host was quickly responsive to questions & sent the check-in information right on time.
(If this helps others: We stayed on a 1st of the month. The county emergency sirens test on the 1st. ""Sirens are tested at noon on the first day of each month for one (1) minute for each signal. If they should sound at any other time, or if they continue for longer than 1 minute, a possible emergency exists..."")"

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here on way to New Orleans for a night. The place was easy to access, felt private, and was in a quite neighborhood. Only downside was that the bed was extremely firm and there were hairs on the bath towels. Overall, it was a nice place to stay for a night for the price."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely stay! Unit was perfect for me and the pups as a pass thru on my way back home. Neighborhood is quiet and perfect for walking the dogs. The light features and fountain outside the unit were a delight! There was a bit of noise you could hear in the main house but you could tell they were trying very hard to be respectful and quiet.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,exactly as pictured and described.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My pups and I stayed only one night but we thoroughly enjoyed Phem‚Äôs place. It was exactly as described. So exquisitely decorated! Would definitely stay there again if/when in the Jackson, MS area!"

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Phem's place was what we needed. There were a few things that could have made it better - more lamps, trash cans and exact designated mini kitchen area. We would return to stay knowing what we should bring ourselves and parking curbside."

Would definitely like to stay here when we have more time.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was actually very nice, absolutely no complaints. I see that the refund policy says no refunds but host was very unaccommodating on the fact that Jackson was, at the time, under a boil water advisory and the mayor was recommending evacuation of the city. The area had no problems, as the host said, but host would absolutely not budge on the refund, despite a request because of special circumstances. I would absolutely stay at this place again but not with this host."

Mentions these things to Phem and he said he works your cere of it. He thought the smell may be a pkaa az by by the front door. Who knows???"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Phem‚Äôs house is clean, cute, easy to find and in a nice neighborhood. Everything was easy (from reservation to check-in/check-out) and a Phem was welcoming and helpful.

The only thing that I could think of being improved is to spring for a slightly better coffee. Would love to stay with Phem again!"

Everything was exactly as described in the listing & the check-in/check-out process was smooth & simple; the only downside was that there was a very strong old, wet scent throughout the entire suite & there were molded coffee grounds left in the coffee maker."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication from the start, check in was a breeze. I used the room for a show I came to town to see. Checked in about 5pm, room was clean and ready for me. Went to the show got back after midnight, all was quite and had no issue getting a good night's sleep. Would use again if I'm ever back in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was safe, and quiet during the daytime for us night shift workers. The blackout curtains were definitely a plus. The unit was very clean, AC unit was ice cold in the 100 degree temperatures, and also very quiet. I would definitely book again"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, nicely decorated, quiet neighborhood, beautiful magnolias, exactly what we needed for our 11-day stay. Looking forward to our next visit."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect resting place for our road trip. Easy access, close to restaurants and clean."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a lovely suite in a very beautiful established neighborhood. We stayed 2 nights to break up a trip from Texas to Alabama to adopt a rescue Pomeranian. This fit the bill perfectly. We were able to sit and drink a glass of wine outside under the magnolia trees and relax and watch a movie as well. the A/C works wonderfully so we were very comfortable. Our hosts provided everything that we needed to make our stay pleasant all they way down to the wine glasses. Would recommend this spot to anyone traveling through Jackson.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The location was perfect for a place to have a quiet break from traveling thru Jackson. Very clean with thoughtful furnishings, space and coffee. Better than most!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,this host is awesome coming from LA kinda like home. everything is nice in the private room!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure! Highly recommend if you are in the Jackson area!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Phem was so nice throughout my whole stay! I highly recommend booking a stay here.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very spacious place. Only has. A couple of coffee cups so bring any kitchen stuff you might need. Bed is very comfortable and there is a nice amount of closet and bathroom storage space
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful experience. Could not have asked for a better host, or more pleasant experience. Will return."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Quiet and private, excellent location for my needs! I‚Äôll stay here again. Thanks!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot but this is in North Jackson, not in Bellhaven as listed in the ad."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for the price! Also provided with basic necessities like toothpaste, shampoo and condition, and bar soap."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was nice and clean I would stay again
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,üëçüèΩ
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great spot, very nice neighborhood, everything just as described if not better. I will look this place up again the next time I‚Äôm in Jackson."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very charming neighborhood and rental. We stopped here on a cross country road trip and really enjoy Phem's Airbnb to rest and recuperate. We went on a nice run around the neighborhood which was quaint and welcoming. We then relaxed on the couch with nearby Whole Foods hot bar and settled into a Netflix movie. The rental had everything we needed with a microwave and coffee in the morning. We'll definitely stay here again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very quiet, clean, and peaceful. Definitely appreciate the private entrance!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, clean , and comfortable stay."
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice space for a getaway. There was an issue with not receiving our access code the day of, but Phem resolved it after a delay in checking in. The water gets hot quickly, so you don't have to wait. The closet is roomy with plenty of hangers. The bedroom was nice and dark for sleeping. Expect some noise from the main house as well as from outside (the windows let more noise through than expected). We would like to have given 3.5 stars, but only whole stars are available."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I definitely enjoyed my stay at Phem‚Äôs. I‚Äôm grateful that I was able to host my friends in the lounge which was quite spacious and cozy. The decor and wall art gives the place a relaxing ambience. And I love the forestry of the neighborhood.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, comfortable furniture. Safe neighborhood , was a lovely area to walk with my dog.
Thank you Phem for the recommendation on where to eat as well! Would definitely stay again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities needed for a couple of days in Jackson. Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and level of comfort. I traveled and booked this stay for a business trip and I was more than happy with everything. Its peaceful, comfortable and very close to everything."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husb, me, and our senior chihuahua were completely comfortable staying here. The decor has a minimalist aesthetic and I found it restful. Parking is no problem, we were able to park right in front every time, the self check-in was super easy. On walking in, there were no smells of disinfectant or room freshener, no smells of former visitors or food-- I'm really sensitive to such things and it was a great first impression. The place is spotless. The central heat and air is instantly responsive. The bed was very comfortable, we both slept great. It turned out I had to finish a work project the afternoon we were there, and I was able to get set up and work on my computer for several hours no problem. The one thing I would advise is if you plan to use Netflix or other streaming programs, try it out right away so that if you have a problem you can ask Phem for help (both hosts were kind and welcoming). We're not very tech savvy and wound up feeling like it was too late to ask. One thing some other reviews have mentioned is the sound of children-- Yes, the cottage shares a partial wall with their living space. We heard a very few muffled family sounds around dinner time, and that was it-- it was not at all a problem for us. I would so much rather give my money to folks like this family for lodging, and when I had my Superhost airbnb cottage it was a real boon for us. The place is about 2 miles off of I-55 and is located in an area where a 10 minute drive yields tons of excellent restaurant options-- try the Cultivation Food Hall for variety and excellence-- we were blown away, and the takeout packaging was perfect. I recommend staying here."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, great host!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice and cozy, super dark, we slept like rocks. Very basic and comfy, also very clean and easy access."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very great place and clean. Nice and helpful would definitely stay again
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Watch your step!!! There is about a four inch drop from the front door into the living area, I almost fell on my face! The light switch is in the middle of the wall over the couch, I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find it.
There is also a very tall step up into the bathroom, which is clean but had no hand towel, no bath mat and the curtain rod towel bar was falling out of the wall. There were 2 bath towels in the cabinet and a couple of wash cloths, though if you have delicate or sensitive skin, I do not recommend using them, they were like washing your face with 80 grit sandpaper!
The bed is horribly uncomfortable and there were no extra blankets, I doubled up the comforter because I was cold.
They did provide a coffee pot and coffee, but it was a big container of Folgers which who knows how many people stuck their hands in prior to my arrival. Thanks, but no thanks! If there was ever a time and place for a K-cup, this is it.
The host was very quick to respond to any questions I had prior to my arrival. All in all, I was there less than 12 hours, the place was clean and quiet, but I wouldn‚Äôt go back, there are plenty of other places to choose from."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Never disappointed in my stay with Phem and Pam! Always happy to stay in such a home away from home environment!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Suite was very spacious and clean. Convenient location to restaurants. We enjoyed dinner at the Pig and Pint. Good communication with host and easy check in.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay if you are in the Jackson area. One of my favourites! Highly recommend!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will not be disappointed very responsive and host was nice and inviting as well! Easy direction to suite and very clean! I will definitely be staying with them soon! Hard to get in because this host is one of the best if not the best!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay with great hospitable hosts! Highly recommend.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my time in the magnolia suite! I will return in the future! I can‚Äôt wait until the Magnolias come into season so I can sit on the patio and enjoy the fragrance! Phem is an excellent and very responsive host! I look forward to staying again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at this cute little guest house!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cozy nook was PERFECT!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quaint place, sizeable for one to two occupants.
Location is only a few minutes from the city of Jackson and Ridgeland, and Madison and Flowood are just a few more minutes out than those.
This suite allowed me to take a very relaxing and productive three-day stay in the Jackson area."
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Basic stay for someone passing through. I‚Äôve stayed at 6 bnb‚Äôs this past week and this one left something to be desired. There was no water, sugar, or anything over a Folgers can for the coffee pot. There was no shampoo, conditioner or body wash in the shower. The ceiling fan cannot stay on without the lights being on. The bed was not very comfortable. I woke up very sore and it smelled kinda funny all around. Maybe new construction? Wet walls? Overall I‚Äôd say it wasn‚Äôt my favorite and there was nothing special about it. Oh yeah and I also heard the kid crying like a few other reviewers have pointed out."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and cozy. Everything was spotless and well set up with clear directions!
The neighborhood is very quiet, the walkway actually extends to the curb which makes the entrance a breeze to find.
When you walk in, you‚Äôre in a living room with a little couch and a TV with streaming options already set up which is so helpful. The bedroom is a completely separate room and then the bathroom is attached.
The hosts are very organized and communicative. I felt safe the entire time and would recommend this stay to anyone!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy spot that has everything you need!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to return.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The home owner does have kids, and they where a little loud. The bed was not the best in the world, but we have slept in a lot worse. If they do change out the bed, a king size would be nice. Could not get anything on the TV, not hooked up to cable or firestick. The bath room is nice. Very clean, and if you are dead tired, it will work for you for at least a one nighter. I gave them a four star with room for improvements. 1. BED. 2. TV needs work, 3. Try to keep the kids quite. 4. work on the appartment should be done on days not rented, 5. Parties should be held when the guest are not there. To be fair about this, we came in on 2pm Saturday afternoon, went right to sleep....awoke to some loud music four hours later, so we decieded since there was a lot of stuff going on, to continue our journery since we have rested."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for my quick stay. Would stay here again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, great communication!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Would stay again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a nice place to stay overnight on our way across country.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This guest house is more incredible than the listing shows. Once you walk in you see this spacious living area and then greeted with a beautifully decorated separate bedroom and bathroom. This airbnb is also close to a lot of shops and restaurants including a Whole Foods. I truly enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend to others if in the Jackson area!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very simple airbnb, we came for a wedding in Flora, MS and it was a good place to sleep but with little to no amenities provided, it wasn‚Äôt very convenient or comfortable. Hot water shuts off at night I‚Äôm assuming, so I had to take a cold shower one night, and another time the hot water ran out so it turned from hot to cold very quickly. Come prepared with your own water, shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, body wash, blow dryer, and even coffee, although a coffee pot is provided. I stayed in the room for most of the day one day and could hear a child crying/screaming through the thin walls and parents yelling as well, for almost the entire day, not so peaceful. The bedroom fan does not work unless the light next to it is also on, so you can‚Äôt sleep with the fan on. The best part of our trip was the sweet neighborhood golden retriever that greeted us outside for our last few days. Also, we learned that Jackson was NOT the safest place to stay, there is basically nothing to do in the area, and there are very limited healthy food options, so we won‚Äôt be returning."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect for our overnight stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These hosts are extremely nice! Communication is excellent and the suite was very clean. If I come back to Jackson, I will definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a cozy and convenient place for anyone visiting Jackson. Conveniently located near restaurants and attractions.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were wonderful. The host was very responsive & apologetic in attempting to address the issue of not having hot water. I sincerely believe that this issue was unexpected. And because I know that these kinds of problems cannot always be anticipated, I still give the host, the property & the overall stay & experience the highest possible ratings. I would definitely return."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room, private entry, clean and spacious ."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was simple and extremely clean. The quiet neighborhood is exactly what we had hoped for. Access is easy and convenient. Close to many restaurants and local attractions. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place and in walking distance of a great sushi spot and ramen spot.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay with Rachel. She‚Äôs terrific and always quick to answer any questions. Property had everything I needed to have a comfortable, trouble free visit. No reservations about positive recommendation"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute and easy to walk around foundren!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A very cozy little bungalow! We were here for a wedding and were able to walk to the ceremony and the reception hall. Rachel was accommodating with our dog. Very satisfied.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I loved the place and Rachel is a wonderful host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place was a real GEM! I loved everything about it. Very peaceful, easy to find, had everything I needed and it was spotless. I've stayed at many Airbnbs with cheap towels, cheap pots & pans and no extra toilet paper. This place had nice plush towels, free Netflix included, washing machine & dryer and was even stocked with coffee. I'd stay here every single time I'm visiting Fondren for work. Walking distance to lots of nice restaurants, and entertainment. I'm actually headed to go book this place again for May. Thank you soo much Rachel, for making this a great experience!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Comfy accommodations near good restaurants. Used as housing for work trip. Good fit for single occupants.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's house was one of the best located places we've ever stayed in our years of enjoying Airbnb! We could walk to fantastic restaurants - the best right across the street - a local market, wine shop, restored movie theater, bowling alley, tiki bar, coffee shop, thrift shop, bakery. It was the best neighborhood! And the house has such cool decor and features like the exposed wood walls in the bedroom and the cute screened porch in front. Rachel also shared excellent recommendations and was super responsive. We'll definitely stay here again if we come back to Jackson!!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was very clean and had everything a person might need. Walking distance to a grocery store so it was very convenient. A very comfortable place to stay. The only issue I had, which has nothing to do with Rachel, was the water pressure to the place was not very good. There were days when I did not have access to hot water or a shower. This is a problem with the city of Jackson. Since my time here was in the middle of winter, I probably would have stayed on the outskirts of Jackson had I known beforehand."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, clean place, friendly host. Definitely a good stay for 1-2 people."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle is an amazing host. She was responsive and super friendly. The place was extremely clean, had everything I needed, and was in a great location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's was absolutely amazing staying there! Perfect little home for solo or a partner
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very clean and well kept. I like that we were within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants. The host was also very kind and responsive. I will say that the hot water lasts maybe 20-30 minutes, so if you have more than one person and want to shower back to back before an event, just be aware of that. Overall, the place was very well stocked and taken care of and well worth the money!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel is a great host. You can‚Äôt go wrong with booking with her. Her place is clean & comfortable. Thanks!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed in the home for two weeks, had a wonderful time exploring the Fondren area. Many shops, restaurants and activities just steps from the property. We greatly enjoyed the park just two blocks down the residential street, we walked that park every day. Our only issue was the internet, we work full time while traveling the US one airbnb at a time but the internet was clocking at less than 1 mbps and made doing our jobs extremely difficult. Verizon service was awful, so our backup internet didn't help. If you're not there to work, then it's a wonderful home and location!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Always wonderful when I stay at one of Rachel‚Äôs listings! Nice clean and everything I needed for my stay. I enjoy the Fondren area with close restaurants and bars. She‚Äôs very responsive, polite and if you ever have a problem she‚Äôs quick to get it handled! 100% recommend. Will be back."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I found a place close to plenty of things to do and restaurants that place was very clean. It was just the right size for a guest for the two weeks I was there. Rachel was helpful and nice. I enjoyed working with her. I will notify her again when I need to come to Jackson because she is my jam now.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay

Top of Fondren is definitely worth the money to stay!!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, check in was incredibly easy and host was very responsive.
The only downside is the home is in a heavily trafficked spot and you can hear everything."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved our week stay! Rachel was very responsive and gave clear instructions with everything. She made it very stress-free and accommodating. Everything was clean and cozy and we would definitely book with her again if we are in this area in the future! Don‚Äôt miss out on the BBQ spot directly across the street!

Thank you Rachel!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our go-to place in Fondren! It is EXTREMELY accessible to all of the cool stuff in the area. We walked to the grocery store, to restaurants, and even to the newly renovated movie theater! There is a FULL size washer and dryer, and the kitchen is sufficient for preparing meals.
One of our favorite things to do was to sit in the chairs in the screened-in porch, drink our morning coffee, and watch the world go by."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb is super cute and in possibly the most convenient place possible. You can wake up in the morning, grab some petit fours or cookies from campbell's down the street, and then cross the street for some of the best coffee in jackson at the bean.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice little place. It is a bit loud because it is near a busy street and restaurant. The noise calmed down around 10pm. It is in a great location to the university hospital for anyone looking for a long term place to stay for rotations or work.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great 6-night stay here and look forward to returning! House was charming, clean, and very close (easy walking distance) to Woodland Hills/Fondren shopping area and restaurants. Well-supplied kitchenette and small touches; room doors and layout made flow and space easy for 1-2 people. Nice little screened-in porch with fan, too. I like an urban feel on the edge of residential and this spot nailed it; homey while feeling safe with quick and easy access to shops and food (grocery and restaurants)."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel was great ! If I were to need anything her communication was great !

2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was very fast to reply to messages. The location of this place is excellent. Easy walking distance to downtown Fondren and directly across from Pig and Pint.
We chose this place because we weren‚Äôt looking for luxury, we wanted an easy location and this offers just that.
It‚Äôs a good size for two people, the couch does offer a second bed but the bathroom is small... again, good for a safe place to stay and easy access to great restaurants.
We were disappointed that the guitar that is offered to be used was missing two strings :/"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near restaurants and close to downtown! House is just like posted. We hope to return.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always perfect and exceptionally clean.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The property was actually closer to my desired location than expected. It had been a long time since I visited that area, and I was pleased to find quite a few things within walking distance. I had to reach out to Rachel once, and she responded immediately. Also, I was arriving late and leaving early but found the check-in/check-out process seamless despite the time. My children and I really liked our stay here. It was the perfect size for the three of us."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome stay at Rachel‚Äôs place. It had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm from Jackson but now live in South Carolina. I've never stayed in an Airbnb in my hometown before, but Top of Fondren was ideal for me. If you're not familiar with the area, Fondren has so many good options for restaurants, coffee spots, etc., and this spot puts you within walking distance.
Everything was just as described, and the house was wonderfully clean. Having a nice-sized bedroom, a kitchen, and even the ability to wash clothes while there, made me feel like I was ""beating the system."" I kept finding new thoughtful touches each day I was there.
Rachel was A+ throughout the process, from responding to my initial reservation to the day of checkout.
Definitely recommended."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great location!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this house. Perfect amount of space for us and our little pup. Comfy bed made for a good night‚Äôs rest as well. Even though it was New Years weekend, it was never too loud for us and was also very safe. Highly recommend this to anyone who needs a place to stay. We will definitely keep her properties in mind when we return to Jackson."
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a good location and decently prized place but not ideal for more than 2 adults.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superb location! Clean, comfortable and stylish. Excellent communication from Rachel. Highly recommend for a stay in Jackson!"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place..would definitely recommend booking this place!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Rachel's house is lovely, with a full-size fridge, nice bed, couch and TV with netflix available. The location is also awesome, within walking distance to all of Fondren and literally right across the street from a great BBQ restaurant. Highly recommended!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, stylish, and convenient! Have coffee on the porch, watch Netflix on the very comfy couch, or walk to the shops. The shower is glorious, and the in-unit laundry and kitchen are very convenient. Dog-friendly, too. We had a lovely time."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful house and location! Everything is comfortable and lovely.
We so enjoyed sitting on the screen porch, sipping drinks, playing cards, our pups contentedly at our feet.
A fantastic spot for pet guests, but also for guests who are allergic or not pet people because the house is spotless and the surfaces and design are all pet resistant - you would never know by look or feel there that pets are allowed. Stay with confidence.
The neighborhood is a delight. Do not miss Walker‚Äôs drive-in, just a block away - it‚Äôs a gourmet restaurant with a whimsical name. The State Park is a mile or so away - a beautiful place to walk, hike, spend the day.
Rachel was a great host. We hope she will welcome us back"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Walking distance to so many good places to eat!
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice host. Cute place. Could use a thorough cleaning.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel is amazing!! She is so communicative and accommodating. I had to re-schedule my reservation a few times due to work conflict and weather conflict but she was super patient and understanding. Highly recommend!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stopped for the night but will definitely be back to visit and enjoy more time here. The house was everything we needed and had tons of charm.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved it!!!! She had everything that you would need plus more. 5 stars. I will be back.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is great. Area is great. You will love it, all the amenities you will not find at a hotel"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space for a layover on a long drive or trip for a couple with a child or friend. Pet friendly scores high with me, so this place rocks for that alone ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying at Rachel's place! Her place was EXTREMELY clean and the location was amazing. I loved that the home was very close to numerous restaurants and coffee shops. She was very communicative and I would recommend staying at her home.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived in Jackson in the early afternoon and Rachel graciously coordinated with the house cleaner to allow us access an hour early. This is a mid-century one bedroom ranch that has had some updates. There is parking in front of the home. It is across the street from the Yana Club, a nice facility to support recovering alcoholics. Their parking lot is adjacent to the bedroom side of the home and there was a fair amount of traffic during meeting times but everyone was respectful. We especially appreciated having the stackable washer/dryer to refresh our clothes on a long road trip. We did have a problem when the toilet flush mechanism broke but Rachel dispatched someone to fix it within an hour of our call. The bedroom and bathroom doors would not stay closed, so an adjustment to keep them from popping open would be welcomed. The house is walkable to restaurants and shops in the Fondren district of Jackson. This is a reasonably priced alternative to a hotel room with more options for spreading out and a kitchen for preparing meals. While in Jackson, we recommend a visit to the Mississippi Civil Rights Center and the Mississippi Museum of Art."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice little place to stay. It's super clean, super cute, and has quick access to all kinds of fantastic food places. Owner is prompt and courteous. Our stay here was all around great!"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs a perfect place to stop while traveling. Restaurants and shops are nearby so you can walk. It is near a corner so there is a lot of traffic and it‚Äôs not quiet.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for us as we needed a quite night in on our way to Atlanta. Clean, organized and tidy. No complains."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Expect for the home to be clean and Rachel to be quick with the response.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our runaway getaway from Hurricane Sally. The neighborhood is full of good food and a corner market is in easy walking distance. Coffee lovers, The Bean Coffee shop is a must during your stay!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place modern, clean, everything you need from a home away from home. Thanks Rachael I will be booking again in the near future."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,For those of you who are looking for a great location near the local restaurants this is the place to stay. It‚Äôs literally walking distance from numerous local food diners. For those of you who are foodies this is non chain options with a variety of choices. The one drawback with the location is that it can get noisy at times in the early evening (8-10pm) and that can be challenging for those of you who bring small children. Outside of that this is a great place to stay if you are headed to Jackson or passing through. The owner is very helpful and very responsive. Would stay again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute place in a great area
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Darling house, super clean and perfect for two! Located in a fun location within walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants and groceries. Rachel is quick to respond and check in and check out is a breeze. The bedding and towels are nice too!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean home in convenient location. Nice touches to mak stay comfortable. As a music lover, the guitar was a definite plus."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little house in a great location. Near the main streets and restaurants. Great size for 2 people, check in was easy, and communication was great with Rachel. Only negative was the amount of street lights coming into the bedroom made it a little hard to sleep. Would stay in again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at your cute cottage! Very stylish and homey with everything we needed provided. The screen porch is great as we enjoyed the breeze from the tropical weather...The neighborhood is really cute and great place to walk my dog! Perfect location for restaurants as there is one right across the street that looked quite good but unfortunately we missed the cut off point for ordering. We also felt really safe and I overall very charmingüòÉRachel is a great host and was very accomodating to my animals. I would highly recommend if your passing thru or visiting Jackson. Thank you Rachel
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel's place was fantastic. Clean and right in a great part of town. Will definitely be back again here when I'm in town.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little blue house with the screen in porch was exactly what we were looking for during our stay in Jackson!
Pros:
1.) It is very clean with an amenities in every nook and cranny of this small updated home; bath soap, laundry soap ... snack bars, coffee pods. This home is set up to make your stay relaxing.

3.) The small yard is well maintained and the curb appeal makes it feel homey.
4.) The main bedroom was comfortable! We were thrilled the bed wasn't awful like a hotels. The minisplit in the room kept it a perfect temperature and the decor was relaxing.
5.) The kitchen has cookware, dishware, Keriug ... everything you need to stay in.
6.) They allow pets for a small fee! Pick up after your furrbaby and you're good to go!
7.) The washer and dryer were perfect! I got to do laundry before we checked out!!
8.) Rachel left menus for surrounding restaurants, a total time saver!
9.) Rachel was responsive honest and great to work with! and
10.) Theres a park a few blocks away we walked to everyday ... when we say this place is perfect ... we mean it!
Not Pros:
1.) The doors do not stay closed and randomly open ... don't watch a scary movie!! üòÇüòÇ No really, this place had ZERO cons ..."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rachel‚Äôs home was perfect! We stayed at Rachel‚Äôs on our cross country move from Tucson back to Atlanta. The home was so cozy and clean we wanted to stay longer than just one night. We even sat out on the front porch and enjoyed a storm that came through! After three days of driving it was the perfect place for us and our dogs to recharge before making the final drive into Georgia. Can‚Äôt thank Rachel enough for letting us stay in her adorable home!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The ‚ÄúTop of Fondren‚Äù property is nestled on a quit street in Jackson not to far off the interstate and Maps lead us right to the door. This is a clean property and has nice amenities. Rachel is a great host and we would highly recommend her property. My wife and I will stay there again when passing through Jackson.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed for the night as a stopping point for our roadtrip. The place was easily accessible from the highway. Very close walking distance to restaurants/coffee shops. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Overall, Rachel went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Right in the heart of the Fondren neighborhood- easy distance to pretty much everything in Jackson. Rachel was really quick and helpful in communicating about the details.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Everything was exactly as stated and Rachel did a phenomenal job making our stay as cozy as possible. Will definitely be returning.

A+ will definitely stay again when we make our way back to Jackson. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachel is an amazing host and her place is equally as amazing. Clean, quiet, and charming. We will definitely be back."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachel‚Äôs place is a great stay for the price. It is an older home that has some cute updates and a screened in patio. The Pig and Pint BBQ restaurant is right across the street and is amazing. Even the kids enjoyed it. Rachel had some nice extras for us - coffee pods, granola bars, extra soap, shampoo, etc. The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable, but I do want to note that the fold out couch was very uncomfortable for an adult. I think if you put the kids on the foldout and the adults in the other room, you‚Äôd be ok. Also, not all of the doors shut or stay closed if you‚Äôre concerned about privacy. Otherwise, the price was good and Rachel was quick to respond!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Our family of four fit well. Great location for our one night stop over. No complaints. Kept us comfortable and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again. Was actually bigger than I thought it would be.

The only fault, if there was any fault, is the fact that the kitchen is very, very small. However, the make up of the remainder of the house make up for that. One of the members of our party, a 14 year old girl, was deathly afraid of cats, and the resident cat was persistent in trying to make friends. It should be noted that there is a friendly cat on premises in case there is anyone with cat allergies. In general, the house was immaculate and clearly worth the price.

The space is very clean, there are many options on the tv for winding down at night, and many coffee selections for the Keurig in the morning. Master bathroom has a very comfortable mattress and the bathroom is stocked with items in case you forgot something at home. The kicker for me is sweet Sassy Pants, their outside kitty.
