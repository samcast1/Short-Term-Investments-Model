The house is decorated beautifully and stocked with everything we could possibly need. The coziness and comfort, exceptional!
The beautiful sunrise and sunset made our stay perfect!!
I want to give a bad review to keep others from booking Anna’s house so it will be available to me anytime I want it. But I just can’t do that.
10 out of 10, perfect score!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Anna's lake house was beautiful. The area was peaceful and just stepping out the back door there are a variety of activity options. The lighting was lovely with views of both the sunrise and the sunset, a nice variety of birds to watch, and a nice open grassy area. We didn't have a chance to try out the boats, but if we'd had more time we would have loved to do that as well.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a wonderful stay! The home is so pleasant and inviting. The property is relatively private along the peaceful lakefront area.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely spot with an even better view! Updated and clean.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The lake house was amazing. It was perfect for a selfcare getaway for my bestfriends and I in celebration of my 35th birthday. The kitchen had everything necessary for the private chef to prepare our brunch. The host was very pleasant and responsive. She provided the check-in instructions long before arrival which made getting settled even easier. I can’t wait until summer so that I can experience the lake house during the warmer season.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful location for a writer’s retreat. My guests and I enjoyed our weekend at Anna’s home. As a host, Anna was proactive with communication and extremely hospitable. She checked in on us as we commuted to the location during a snowstorm. Also, she followed up with us as the weather temperature dropped to make sure we were comfortable. The serene location and home environment were conducive for us to finish our project and spend quality time with each other. I highly recommend this gem in Indiana for anyone who needs a break from city life. Thanks, Anna!"

The kitchen is well-equipped, and there's a Keurig and a great variety of coffee flavors provided. The neighbors were kind and helpful.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the space, very clean and kitchen was stocked with mugs, a Keurig, cookware, etc. It was a great birding spot; even just sitting in the dining room or prepping dinner we were graced by swans and grebes. A couple bald eagles even flew by each morning! Bathrooms had plush towels and temperature precise controls in the shower. Low ceilings in some rooms downstairs but most of us were under 6’ so no problems for us. Took the kayak and paddle boat out and was a lovely time all around. A much appreciated relaxing weekend!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Anna's place was fantastic! It was even better than the photos! Her house was warm and welcoming, spotless and decorated so well. Anna was kind and responsive to our every need. We appreciate her flexibility when we requested an extra night stay at the beginning of the trip. We all slept great in the comfortable beds and the peaceful setting was something I could get used to. I also need to add that the showers were fantastic.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Lake House was simply perfect! This home feels like ""home"". The lake is so very peaceful and the inside of the home is beautiful. The tranquil vibe is evident in this property. The check-in and check-out was so simple and easy to follow. The home was extremely clean and well stocked with needed items. One person in our party of 4 booked the Lake House for she and her husband in May for their anniversary because she loved it so much. It's a place that you'd just want to keep coming back to for a peaceful break. Not far away are different restaurants and quaint shopping as well. Anna, the host, is kind, helpful and very quick to respond to messages. Thank you for creating a place that provides a calm in a busy world."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thankful for Anna! We got there on Tuesday and check in was easy, and the house was adorable and clean! It’s been completely redone and it shows.
Unfortunately we woke up at 5am on Wednesday to no water, we didn’t let her know until around 9, and she replied almost instantly. She had the neighbor (handy man) over right away and he started to find out what needed to be done. Unfortunately we decided to head home due to us only being there for a day anyway, but she texted us when it was back on and said we could head back, but we were already home. She then let us know that we could come back any weekend for free. How AMAZING is that? We will definitely be booking again in the future. She was very sweet, and easy to communicate with.
Something to note that this is a lake that’s more for kayaking or boating, not really swimming. But we saw so much wildlife while we were there and the view is completely worth it.
Thank you Anna! Really!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Anna's and they were spectacular. The cottage is exactly like the photos, which are stunning. You have Lakeviews out every window.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Walking into the place, WOW! Was our response. Very Very nice place! It was such a beautiful decorated home!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Anna's place was lovely and quiet. Very pet friendly, with multiple dog beds. My kids loved the beds and couch. The shower is amazing and relaxing. It would be nice if there were some games for families to do. I know it's not listed as kid friendly, but it might be a nice addition."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just simply out of this world place, any house lucky to have placed the way Anna's lake house was built regard to the Lake, the way windows are to the Lake, and even house design to the Lake. Whole place was for anybody who are to get away from World. Bathrooms are simply 5 star (or 7 star) luxury hotel bathroom, one had shower, the other had very nice deep bathtub, one of my nephew was not letting go that tub. All kitchen appliances' were new all new, amenities were enough for any group of people.
Thank you, Anna, for such a beautiful house, we will be happy to come back again"

Bathroom space was a little small for a big guy but the shower and bath made up for that.
House is located in a neighborhood with children. Could hear them in the evening but not an issue and was quiet at night.
Overall a great stay and experience, much better than hotels I've stayed at. Will certainly be looking up Ashlee & Jon next time I return to New Castle."

We were able to find spare items in the closets, a handy checkout list posted on the fridge, and a few cold beverages in the fridge as a welcome extra, too. My husband really appreciated the nicely stocked coffee bar:) I certainly appreciated him being able to get his coffee fix before venturing out!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was coming back into New Castle to visit my family and found this listing and thought it looked super cute. I am SO glad we ended up booking through Jon. The house was on a quiet street and was close to my parent's house and Road 3 (where a lot of restaurants are). The house matched the pictures on the listing. It was cute, comfy and was the perfect size! There was a huge backyard with a seating area, a workout room, a coffee area and dining room.
Jon was so great. He explained all the house rules, was SO responsive to my emails and just made me feel welcome and important. We've already talked about booking here again when we go back into town. The only ""complaint"" I had, which wasn't a big deal was the lights outside the front door were so bright that they attracted what seemed like all the bugs in the neighborhood. So I was constantly trying to rush in without letting anything in. But I did appreciate all that light when we first showed up after it was dark."

We were visiting for Ball State graduation weekend- great place and value to stay for family/friends visiting BSU (about 25 min drive to BSU from this house). Highly recommend if you are in the area, way nicer and value to have the comfort of a home vs a hotel room! Thank you Jon!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly won't be able to say enough great things about the host and house! Jon responded right away with questions I had. He was so very helpful and kind. My daughter (22 years old) came with us on a quick trip from Maryland to Indiania to visit my mom. This was her first time ever staying at an Airbnb property. She asked me on the way why I don't like to stay in hotels. Well, the minute she walked in the door she realized why we don't. The property was so clean. As we walked around the house, we loved all the small things that were added to make you feel right at home. The decor was so beautiful, and the bed was amazing. So much I sent Jon a message asking him for the brand since I am in the market for a new bed myself. The small touch of having water bottles left on the table by the bed was such as sweet gesture. We are very happy that we decided to stay at this property for sure. Thanks again for everything!"

Debbie had coffee and left us a plate of banana bread, and a bowl of fresh fruit - totally unexpected and very much appreciated!
When we returned from dinner on Friday evening there was a note and small space heater for the upstairs bedroom since the temperature was to drop during the night and the heater upstairs wasn’t working properly. She apologized for the inconvenience, but since all four of us suffer from hot flashes it wasn’t a problem for us. We look forward to returning next year!"

2020-01-01,4.0,Group trip,We found the place very affordable and comfortable. It's essentially half of a split level house locked off as a private space for guests. Coffee bar and snacks were a nice touch in the upstairs bedroom.

Great place to stay!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Debbie's place was just wonderful! It feels like you're in the middle of nowhere but you're only minutes away from the town (24-hour Walmart, Walgreens, McDonald's, etc)! Debbie is super nice and extremely accommodating; she provided delicious breakfasts for us in the mornings. The house was perfect and the sunset on the lake was beautiful! Definitely recommend!"

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These people couldn't be any nicer! We were in Rochester for the weekend and were pleased to find this place where we could spread out a little and avoid the local hotels. We pulled out their card table and had a late night family game of cards along with the microwave popcorn they left us (sorry about what got on the floor!). Debbie left plenty of coffee, water, a nice fruit assortment, and fresh banana nut bread. That was a great bonus!
We had busy days booked so were unable to take the option to enjoy the lake or their local restaurant recommendation but we really appreciated that they offered. I also appreciated the small things like a place to plug in your phone at the nightstand and a flashlight on each side of the upstairs bed. Great value for 3 bedrooms and a sitting area."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Outstanding hospitality.

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie was a great hostess and very thoughtful. Kept in touch with us to make sure we were good and didn’t need anything.
The home is nice and cozy, lots of nice touches like extra outlets and notes of where things are. We enjoyed the snacks and coffee table.
Before staying with Debbie, our only choice was an ok hotel with lots of noise and doors slamming and we enjoyed this much more. Plenty of space to spread out and we slept great, quiet and comfy beds."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debbie was a great host! There were 3 of us staying, so it was great that we each had our own room."

2018-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house. There was 6 of us that wanted to stay. There was plenty of room. Plenty of freshly cleaned towels. Thought we were 7 people and she had an air mattress ready for us. It was awesome. Close to where we needed to go. Offered local restaraunt suggestions.

2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debbie and her husband Gary are some of the nicest people you will EVER meet. We used their home just as a place to sleep while attending an event nearby. Everything is clean and beds were comfortable. Bed upstairs was SUPER comfortable. I didn't get to interact with Debbie as much as we arrived late and she had to work the next day early and leave out of town, but I literally feel lucky to have met Gary. These are the kind of people that restore your faith in humanity. Space was as described, and I would stay again. This is not a 5 star resort if that is what you are looking for, but it is clean, comfortable and they go out of their way to create specialness like having fresh flowers and banana bread."
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Debbie and Gary are very kind and friendly. We often have dinner and watch Movies together. This is a very nice and unforgettable trip. Thank you my friends!
2017-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and thoughtful people. I hope to stay with them again.
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved the peace and tranquility of this place. It is not fancy and it lacks a kitchen, but the host makes up for the lack of those things with her generocity and responsiveness! Would absolutely recommend for anyone looking to stay in Rochester or on Lake Manitou. The Nature Preserve is just down the road and the Elks Lodge is within walking distance. Perfect walking environment and beautiful lake!"
2016-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gary and his families are really really great !!they do their best to help us,we spend a very awesome time there,we talked a lot of things about the differences between US and China,they have a great patience to explain to us!Thank you very much,we will miss all you guys.Next time when we back there,we will come to your home again^_^"
2016-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. There was amazing baked good waiting for me too! Thank you!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Debbie was great and accommodated for our super late arrival. She left snacks and water and had coffee there for the morning.
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive, welcoming and caring. The house was comfortable and set in a beautiful area. Provided snacks, water and amazing banana bread! Great space we didn't even know about the upstairs area. We will definitely stay with them again!"
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the first time I used AIRBNB and I was so happy with my stay that I'm sure to use it again. As I was in the area for business, I didn't use the space as much as I would have if I brought my family. The upstairs bed was extremely comfortable. The Keurig and snacks were a very nice touch. The WiFi was fast enough that I could stream videos.
My hosts were much nicer than I expected. I didn't ask for a lot because the accommodations were great, but I believe they would have given whatever I needed. The breakfast in the morning was amazing! I was glad to sit at their table and talk with them. I enjoyed their company and wished I would have talked with them the night before to get to know them better.
The only thing I would recommend is more security on the doors. I would have liked a keypad or key to my area, and a bolted lock on both sides of the door between their living area and the rented area. There was a lock, but I'd like to see a dead bolt, one for each side to prevent unwanted intrusion from either party. However, I would have to add that the house was probably the safest in the neighborhood because a police officer lives across the street.
Overall, well done and I hope to stay at your place again Debbie!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debbie was great. The place is very nice and is exactly as described. It's their children's quarters, they have decided to share it with the travelers. We had a nice time. I wish we could spend more time here. Debbie's husband is also a nice guy to talk to. One thing to note for sure is that, this place doesn't have a kitchen attached, though Debbie allows you to use her."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Accommodations. The host were absolutely Awesome in every way. Even went out of their way to call a neighbor for a cork screw.
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, simple accommodations that worked perfectly for our family group. The bedrooms were each great. One bathroom to share and it sufficed! There's no kitchen without passing onto the hosts' home, which was generously offered, but we did not. The Kurig, fruit and snacks, and above all the kindness and consideration that we received were great blessings.
Highly recommended as simple but excellent-value accommodations! A trip out on the boat was in the works but our group chose to hit the road. But Debbie's kindness and helpfulness were simply exceptional. Thank you again!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful space, and quite comfortable. The hosts were very friendly, and very communicative. We will very likely be back!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Oh gosh! this stay exceeded my expectations. I was there to drop my daughter off to her college. Came away feeling like I had a vacation with family. Comfy home off the lake. ample room for me and my family. Debbie and Gary were more than gracious. They became quick friends and family. I am not sure that I have adequate words to describe the hospitality that we received on this stay. loved the location off of the lake, the boating that Gary so graciously offered my family, the warmth and southern hospitality feeling we received. The beds were incredibly comfortable. I know we will come back again. It's not fancy, but if you want a comfy stay with the feel of a loving home with great hosts, this is the place for you!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it was extremely clean. The communication was great
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I grew up here so it was great to have a home to stay at instead of having to stay at a hotel in greenfield. Walked around the neighborhood with my three little granddaughters and enjoyed my time wish I would have snagged it sooner so I could have gotten it the whole weekend since I was in town for graduation. Very nice and clean place. Loved it, would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Second time using their properties. Good stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was just like the photos. Made me feel like I was at home, and not at a hotel. . Very comfortable furniture. A great deal of attention went into the decor. Also a very peaceful neighborhood. I plan to stay here again when traveling. I highly recommend this place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give them 10 stars! we went to see the eclipse and it was the perfect spot, even though they didn't control the weather we're still giving them credit. They're everything you want from a host friendly, responsive, and generous. We forgot our coats and they're willing to ship them back to us! we couldn't be happier with our choice."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really convenient and peaceful location. The house was very clean and organized.I really enjoyed my stay and will book again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were traveling with our baby for a wedding and needed somewhere close to the venue with home amenities. Jon and Ashlee’s place was perfect! We were on the go a lot and needed somewhere comfy to come back to with the added bonus of restaurants being close by so we could order delivery. The apartment is comfy, cozy, and so cute!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We visited New Castle to meet our new grand baby. Jon & Ashlee’s place is cozy, clean, comfortable and perfect for the two of us. We arrived on a late flight but the porch light and inside lights were on to safely greet us. If the weather had been a bit warmer it would have been an easy walk to Pizza King, Jacks Donuts, and Dairy King. Anderson Casino was also a quick 30 minute drive. The provided washer and dryer were super convenient and allowed us to travel with only carry on luggage. As avid coffee lovers the large drip coffee pot and Nespresso machine were also an added bonus! The king size bed was also very comfortable for both of us (hard to find in an AirBNB)! We will be visiting New Castle quite often so Jon & Ashlee’s place will always be our first pick for accommodations!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay. Host was responsive and accommodating in every way. Clean, quiet, and exceeded my expectations. I will stay again when I return to town. Thanks again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts and the property looked just like the pictures. Jon & Ashlee were very responsive. The place was neat, clean and comfortable. They had beverages in the refrigerator and next to our bedside. They had a coffee maker and a Keurig machine, with multiple coffee options, as well as tea options. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to town."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay and relax. Very quaint and cozy. Comfortable bed and pillows. Thank you Jon and Ashlee, will definitely stay again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed by myself at Jon & Ashlee's for the Muncie 70.3. It was perfect for me with everything I needed, clean and nicely decorated.
I parked in the street which was close to the front door. With all my triathlon stuff, it was convenient and easy to go back and forth getting ready for the event.
The about 25 minute drive North to the transition was peaceful with almost no traffic. (Unlike the traffic coming from Muncie)
It was great! Happy I stayed there!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the first Airbnb that I have stayed in, but I was really impressed. I always stay at a hotel, but for about the same price, I was able to stay at a place that was more like home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed at one of Jon and Ashlee‘s places. We’ve not been disappointed either time. Very nice accommodations. Also, easy to find, nice amenities, and very responsive to our messages. Looking forward to staying here again in the future. It’s nice not to have to lodge in a motel. Thank you, Jon and Ashlee!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place! Great location, quiet, super cute and a perfect option for when extended family comes home to visit. Loved it so much that my husband and I are renting another Airbnb option from Jon & Ashlee when we come home for Thanksgiving."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay here was extremely nice! Anything we needed for our stay was provided. Jon and Ashlee were incredibly responsive and gave us all the instructions we needed for check in and check out. The apartment was so clean and the neighborhood was very quiet and calm.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved everything about our stay, cute- little cozy home- decorated super cute of course women notice every detail to decor. Very clean and I like that the checkout instructions were on the refrigerator. Also good call on putting an additional window unit in the bedroom to assure it was extra cool as some people like the noise or like it colder then others. Thank you!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay. The home was very clean and easy to access. If I’m in the area again I would gladly stay again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jon & Ashlee’s place is great! It’s very restfully decorated and simply & beautifully done. The bed is extremely comfortable, the coffee delicious and Jon’s response time each time I had a question was the best I’ve had in any of the airb&b’s I’ve ever stayed in :-) Definitely recommend Jon & Ashlee’s place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we both enjoyed it!!! the only bad thing was the ants coming in the house by the kitchen window so behide the sink. everything else was great but the bathroom mirror was small. other then that everything was great!! OOOO i forgot add a tv in the bed room!!! the den was fine but me and her wanted to watch some tv in the bedroom!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is clean and pretty. The recent updates make it fresh and contemporary. The hosts have gone above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome by supplying many extra amenities and thoughtful touches. We had a concern, and they quickly remedied it with more than we expected."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great! We live in the area but had people in town at the family home so us kids (27) crashed here for the night! Fantastic option for the area since the hotels aren't the besttt :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This ""tiny house"" surpassed our expectations. It became comfortably ours during our 5 day stay. The bed was so great we are buying a similar one! They have gone top of the line in all appliances, bedding, amenities, even supplies in the closet! Jon and Ashlee responded immediately to our needs. Checking in during daylight is always preferable - we arrived in the dark and while the porch light was on, the address numbers are dark and on the opposite side of the light and the door, so was difficult to see, but that's a 'one off' situation! We will come back here again and again, as I have family in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hotel choices in this area are not comparable to this residence. The quaint, cozy feel of this home was such a great choice. And in addition to that it is close to the Famous Jack’s Donuts."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! Super easy to find. Very clean. Great water pressure in the shower. Nice touches in the kitchen and throughout the house. All our needs were met with comfort and ease. They even put water bottles by the bed : )
Great communication as well. Always responded within 5 minutes."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jon and Ashlee provided a cute and comfortable place to visit. I really appreciated that they provided a variety of beverages and the kitchen was well stocked with cooking necessities.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, lovely property with beautiful animals!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect country home
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Timothy's house was perfectly suited for my trip's needs! Spacious and really well-priced!
The only thing I'd want to note is that, if you have a sensitive nose, it's possible the well water might cause some frustration. Inevitably it would occasionally smell very faintly of sulfur, but that's just part and parcel of using well water and I don't hold it against the owners."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay with my family while in town for a wedding. Timothy was very pleasant and accommodating. The property around the house provided a distraction for my four kiddos and Timothy offered much needed advice on area towns and what was good to visit.
Highly recommend if you plan to visit the Rochester area!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome! Timothy was a great host and very responsive. We enjoyed our time and would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay will stay again if in the area
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Air BNB experience as we have always stayed at a hotel which was probably 20 minutes away. We stayed at the same hotel a couple times a year for the last 8 or so years. Our last stay was horrible. Broken outlets, broken shower & rooms were dirty. Their loss is Tim's Country Homes gain. Plus it is closer to our family. When we first pulled in you could feel the calm of his land. I knew if the outside was this inviting the inside had to be just as good if not better. The house was perfect. There was enough room for everyone to have their own space. The kitchen has probably everything you have at home. Even had a “junk drawer” with pens, paper & even a chip clip. There was a paper that explained the house rules & general info. It was easy to read and explained how to use the TV & how they wanted us to leave the house. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked but we will be back. I cannot recommend Tim's house enough."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Timothy is great to work with! Such a beautiful setting!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arrival, Timothy was there to greet us! I have a full time psychiatric ￼service dog, he was accepting of her. The house was spacious and comfortable! The area was beautiful and private! The home was clean and prepared for us! The welcome paper on the counter was helpful for information about the house! We were able to use the garage to park my car in for the night! I really appreciated that! The garage was spacious and had a remote door opener that we used! I feel as if everything we could need was considered! We look forward to booking here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I enjoyed a girls getaway at Tim’s Country Home. The setting was absolutely beautiful , with the pond out front and the surrounding woods. We loved hiking the trails through the woods and wished we had brought our cross country skis due to an unexpected snow! Timothy responded quickly to our messages and was super helpful. The house was well stocked with kitchen supplies, towels, bed linens, etc. The Roku TV gave us lots of watching options and the beds were very comfortable. We can’t wait to come back!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Timothy was a very kind and accommodating host. My family was looking for a place to come together to prepare a Thanksgiving meal and Timothy's home allowed us to do just that. The space was cozy. we especially enjoyed the wood burning stove and the outdoor walking trails.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Timothy’s place was perfect for our short stay with friends! We enjoyed the spacious house. It’s in a great setting with pond in front and woods around. It couldn’t be more peaceful.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have stayed at quite a few Airbnbs over the years, and this was easily a standout. The place was nicer than the photos, the location was peaceful and beautiful, and the puppy was the sweetest!! I wish I could've stayed so much longer. Tim was an amazing host. Very kind, responsive, and proactive. My whole group found the place to be perfect. Super spacious and open. The kitchen had everything we needed to be able to cook. The little pond was so pretty against all the fall colors. If I ever make it back to Indiana, I know where I will be staying!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two gals from WI, met two friends from MI at Timothy's home. We had an absolutely great time, enough room for each our own bedroom, and two bathrooms worked great as well. The home was located in an area with lots of things to see and do as well as great places to eat. We also cooked at the home with all the amenities at our fingertips. Private setting was perfect for four friends to hang out and eat drink and be merry, without bothering anyone. The outdoors were beautiful and we even took a walk on the trail through the woods. Waking up in the morning to the horses out the back patio door was a nice way to start the day. We can not say enough about how happy we were with our experience.
We wished this home was closer as we highly recommend it and will definitely go back again when headed that way."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home in a quiet, peaceful area. Everyone was very friendly. Home was very nice and roomy. Would definitely stay there again."

Tim makes you feel welcome and lives right next door so communication is great. However; unless you reach out to him you would never know they are there. The residence is large with plenty of room and amenities."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My children, parents and I really enjoyed our stay. My two boys loved the private pond to fish and my son was holding up his fish trying h to get Timothy’s attention to see, he gave him a great little wave. My children and dad had so many questions when they caught Timothy out attending his horses. We appreciate his hospitality and I even more appreciate him taking his time to answer the kids silly questions. My kids only comment “can we go back to fish for my birthday?!” 10 out of 10 recommend for a quiet family getaway!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tim did a great job hosting us. I'd gladly recommend staying here again. he even helped us air our flat tire on the way out.
10/10 definitely recommend"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing little “retreat” in a beautiful and charming location, all within the city limits of a small river town.
Kurt and Heidi are absolutely wonderful hosts.
I will certainly be back to The Shed Resort again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little cottage type airbnb! The chickens do greet you every time you come and go! So cute! The host was so nice too and had a nice chat with her and she showed us the kitchen area in the garage. Such an adorable little place. Very clean, and smelled wonderful inside as well!!! And I love the little book where guests can write about their trip and stay while they stayed here, such a cute idea!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. There was meticulous care to provide a very clean environment and they even left a couple of cupcakes with a small hand written note, which was very appreciated. Due to an unfortunate incident on our end, we were only able to stay a couple of hours and didn't get to complete our stay as planned, but in the short time we were there, we really enjoyed this little goat shed turned mini home. Listening to the creek babble while sitting outside was our favorite part. There was also a very friendly cat who did his part to make us feel right at home and the chickens out front were a nice touch too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only needed one night but had a great sleep. Very relaxing setting, Kurt and Heidi have an awesome piece of land and they provide everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Highly recommend if in the area, a very peaceful place."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt & Heidi were amazing hosts! The Shed Retreat was truly a retreat….peaceful, beautiful, restful. We were greeted by their two lovely outdoor cats who became fast friends of ours. We sat around the bonfire practically all day, with the cozy outdoor lights on. We cooked over the bonfire, read, did puzzles, all while listening to the chickens in their coop. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a peaceful place to unplug!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we were so happy to find a small retreat to stay at, Kurt & Heidi are great people. Their kitty cats are adorable, it was warm and cozy and soft and easy. just like indiana, nature, and god should be. 💕🙏"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The shed and its surrounding area looked beautiful with the different colored leaves that had come with the fall weather. The place was warm and relaxing and the area is quiet and peaceful. I appreciated the hosts always going the extra mile and making sure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. The shed really was a truly unique experience that I’d love to have again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE, completely enjoyable AirB&B experience less than two hours from home, in my own home state!
I didn’t have much time to read about this one ahead of time, but I booked it because I read “shed.” I’ve overnighted in just about every situation, but never a shed.
What I had for just one night was a very cozy, peaceful, and extremely enjoyable escape.
Thank you, Kurt & Heidi, for taking care of every detail and providing a haste-free experience in a lovely setting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this beautiful, little place! They allowed early check-in and since no one had booked the place after me, allowed me to stay later as well."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking peaceful surroundings in a rustic setting, you will love the Shed retreat. We learned some interesting things about foot pump faucets and camp toilets while enjoying the lovely antique furnishings, suoer comfortable mattress and fleece bathrobes. Kurt and Hiedi, your prayers for us were answered."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were very hospitable, going ""above and beyond,"" providing cupcakes as a welcome gift. They described their place accurately - including the story of the space, the neighboring chicken coop, and the camp toilet and outdoor shower (and instructions to use the community aquatic center as another option for showering). It's a lovely, peaceful, place for those who enjoy being close to nature :)"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the Mexican restaurant down the road, very quaint and quiet, great price for a great place. LOVED THE CATS"

Kurt and heidi, are very nice and very responsive to our requests ... really a location as we love them.... and thank you for the tasty muffins when we arrive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,just the place I needed for my getaway weekend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute shed with a welcoming relaxing atmosphere
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A genuinely special experience
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet. It matched the description and the trail down to the river was a nice bonus. Kurt and Heidi have restored this shed to something very enjoyable and needed for people wanting a retreat from the busyness of life.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay very much
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. Although close to the house, it felt like a completely private little oasis. We spent a lot of time sitting outside, and it was very peaceful and relaxing. All the nice added touches were much appreciated. The bed was incredibly comfortable as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The shed is a great getaway from city life!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Though we live in the country surrounded by trees with a creek running through it, the Shed Retreat, though similar to our usual surroundings similar, was much more! If you want a peaceful, cozy spot to tuck away from the buzz of everyday life, you can't go wrong with Kurt and Heidi's place. It's close to town amenities yet located in country surroundings within a quiet neighborhood we felt safe in. We weren't sure what the compost toilet experience would be like, but it was super user-friendly, no pun intended, and only added to the experience. It's clear Kurt and Heidi put thoughtful effort into making their place and our stay special. Everything was as advertised and then some."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Shed Retreat is a great little space! Exactly as described and hosts go the extra mile to welcome guests and extend hospitality.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The shed is cute and cozy. would happily stay again
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay here and commuted to Fort Wayne during the day for a conference. It was cozy, relaxing, and pleasant and Kurt and Heidi were able to supply us with a few things we had forgotten to bring. We especially loved the fresh eggs and the fire pit!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat was clean, adorable and so cozy for our Anniversary celebration getaway. Just what we were looking for. Kurt & Heidi were very accommodating & helped us with a last minute reservation."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a great location and such a cozy place. Perfect for a girls weekend. Every detail was so thoughtful and made us feel so loved. Will definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat is a perfect and cozy retreat to get away from the business of the world and just rest and humble yourself in nature. The cats are super friendly and greeted me each morning which was very sweet. Unfortunately, my stay called for wet and cold weather but I think the fireplace and the extended grounds close to the creek would've been a great place to enjoy the surroundings and reflect on life. I really enjoyed the photo book detailing how the shed came to be, as well as perusing the several games and books inside the cabinet. This would be a great getaway for couples as there were several books/games available to re-get to know each other and share with each other. I would definitely recommend this location for couples. It's also close to Warsaw which has a cute lake and stores to explore."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying in this oasis and I can’t wait to plan my next time. My favorite retreat!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cute place to stay, alot to do and enjoy on the property. Kurt is a super host, very informative and willing to go out of his way to help you out."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed was wonderful :) The cats were so sweet and followed us around everywhere we went. The outdoor shower was an adventure at first glance but it was easy to setup and was one of the most refreshing showers I’ve had. The sounds of nature mixed with the natural light is its own sensation.
Thank you Kurt and Heidi for having us!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Wonderful little place to rejuvenate.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my revisit to this place. Even the second time, I felt this place was unique and pleasant calm stay in the woods. Especially walking down into the creek and spending time around with forest environment was amazing. Always liked welcome muffins by Kurt and Heidi and also good time with the kitten around. Also attended a music concert at downtown which was a very easy drive and a fun place to hang around. Definitely recommended place for anyone's stay"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean place
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very cute and cozy place to stay
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location was ideal and the amenities and communication were above and beyond. I highly recommend and definitely know we will be back :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The glowing reviews are absolutely justified. As hosts, as a location, the amenities, the comfortable and cosy touches… this is an incredible place to stay. I would highly recommend the Shed Retreat to anyone thinking about staying there."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is by far one of the best airbnbs that we have ever stayed at (we are counting our stays here by the handfuls at this point!). A simple getaway, thoughtful hosts, a unique setting, and absolutely adorable accommodations. This visit called for poor weather, so Kurt and Heidi set up the garage with some indoor games for the kids and I to play so we wouldn’t be bored—I call that definitely going above and beyond. It was well appreciated and they truly are the sweetest hosts. 100% would recommend. Also to note is the adorable downtown area, library with community garden, several Little Free Libraries in the area, and a bomb thrift shop that my daughter and I discovered. ♥️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat is a very unique, clean, and comfortable stay! The homemade muffins were delicious and the bed is super comfortable. It's the perfect little place for a weekend adventure to North Manchester and neighboring towns. We found antiques and oddities, a covered bridge, a waterfall, ice cream, and a great bar for hamburgers and rings! Plus, it has been decades since I won a game of Battleship! Truly enjoyed our stay and the story/pictures of how this place came to be. Thank you, Kurt and Heidi!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. It was evident that a lot of care and thought has gone into making this little space as comfortable and welcoming as possible. For us, this stay checked all of our boxes, particularly being simple and affordable. The bathroom situation (toilet and shower outdoors) was no problem for us, and even added to the fun of our stay. I found myself especially appreciative of the house robes and shoes provided for our use - they made walking to the bathroom or using the shower a lot cleaner and easier than it could have been. Although we didn't meet Kurt and Heidi face to face during our stay, they were always quick to respond to questions, and available to help. I could certainly see us staying at the Shed Retreat again in the future. As parents it was the perfect little space to get away and reconnect for a couple days, without breaking the budget. We really appreciate what Kurt and Heidi have done with the space, and love that they've made it available."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was wonderful staying at the Shed Retreat! I literally made my annual retreat there (8 days) and found the setting and solitude perfect for letting my heart open up to the Lord's gracious love. Thanks to Heidi and Kurt for being such lovely hosts and providing the space (both physical and existential) I needed to discover how very loved I am by God.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Shed was just as described and it was a wonderful relaxing time for my husband and I to just get away and unplug for a few days! The location was great we did some hiking and there was even a little festival in town on Friday night that we happened upon. The bed was comfy and the cupcakes were a wonderful treat!! Thank you so much Kurt and Heidi for making such a peaceful getaway!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi have such a beautiful place and I highly recommend going there for some well deserved relax time. They were such thoughtful hosts with all the signage around, and creating a space that feels so homey. The cupcakes and robes were definite bonuses :-). My heart and soul needed this place when I stayed and I am so thankful I was able to reconnect with what matters most there. Thank y'all. <3"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely WONDERFUL place to stay! So calming and peaceful to hear nature and the town is quaint and well kept too! I was worried about the shower and toilet but both were not bad! Shower was warm and relaxing to hear the trees and birds around you. Hosts were friendly and so were all the animals! Would definitely recommend!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here! It’s such a cozy and relaxing getaway.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet, comfortable!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean, quiet! Good value, good hosts!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely place is amazing and perfectly great. One can completely feel about privacy and have a great relaxing time here. With a lot of trees around with a nice trail and fireplace, this place makes you feel like somewhere in deep woods.
A very calm and friendly kitten around makes a greater feeling and morning wake-up call from roosters. The place is cozy and perfectly cleaned by Kurt & Heidi. With provided few kitchens and game accessories it will be great fun.
As the trail leads into a nice creek in the backyard, it will be a great time to spend around in the entire day time in the woods. Definitely love to visit this place again. Bottom line, if you are a true lover of nature then this is the PERFECT PLACE for your pleasant stay....!!!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 3rd visit and its wonderful every time! We love the peaceful space Kurt and Heidi have made for their guests and we look forward to the little treats left for us. We cant wait for our next visit!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place to get away I wish we were able to stay a little longer but visiting family we didn’t get too definitely worth the stay! Will definitely be coming back.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a nice stay. Enjoy sitting by the fire and enjoying the nature.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed. Such an amazing space
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Liked it so much, I stayed a second time! Hosts were friendly and the space was perfect, just like the first time I stayed. Unfortunately, I just had time to catch some sleep before hitting the road early the next day. Would have liked to stay a few days to unwind! Maybe next time."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay with Kurt and Heidi. They have done an amazing job on with the creation of The Shed Retreat. Everything about our stay was perfect to the twinkle lights at night to the chickens and kitties outside. You won’t regret staying here in the cutest of towns. My husband and I will be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place to spend some time.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great spot! The “shed” was way more than I was asking for. Comfortable and restful spot (I think I might have slept better than at home). Friendly and helpful hosts made sure that I had everything I needed. They even had cupcakes waiting when I got there! Wonderful people and great value!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed here a handful of times and will continue to do so. Great hospitality, clean, unique, and a great little downtown area to check out with super friendly locals. A+"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! so quiet, clean and beautiful!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect weekend getaway! This place is so cozy with communicative and respectful hosts. I especially loved hanging out with the two cats and spending a sunny afternoon by the creek!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it’s a nice cozy place if you’re looking for a stay and i would highly suggest it, well worth it"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfectly peaceful place!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute and cozy little apartment in a peaceful setting, complete with a couple of really friendly cats and lovely chickens! The shed itself was warm, inviting and smelled wonderful inside. The hosts leave you to your own devices and honor privacy, while still responding quickly to communication through the Airbnb app. The toilet arrangement (a camp toilet outside and one you can take inside) most certainly isn’t for everyone. It was a little hard to handle at times, but certainly didn’t take away from my total experience. Also, because of the time of year, the outdoor shower on premises was not available (there are showers available at a local rec facility for a modest fee). If you can put up with these minor points, I would enthusiastically recommend this location to anyone visiting this area!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed is a perfect getaway spot. If you are looking to relax, this is the place! Cozy and Comfy!!
Perfect place to read a book, listen to music or take in the beautiful creation around you."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and quiet place! The Shed Retreat is a gem, and I hope to visit again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for a little get away. A quaint goat barn turned into an escape I’ll never forget. I felt tranquility and peacefulness listening to the creek babble as I took in the vibrant Fall colors. The crunch of the leaves a few steps down a cute wooded path made me reminisce my childhood growing up in Michigan. At night, the fire pit area was illuminated and beautified by adorning lights- like fireflies of summers past. The kittens sat in my lap purring me awake the next morning while enjoying coffee out front on the deck. Kurt and Heidi hit the nail on the head with the details of my new escape. They pray for those who find their way to the Shed. And pray for you while you’re here. And my soul could feel their healing words. Thank you so much for sharing this sacred space."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here. the atmosphere was cozy & peaceful. I felt very welcomed and the animals were such a great surprise. My son misses it already!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway location! My husband and I did a little ""retreat"" here for a weekend to shut our phones off and be in nature! Perfect location for that purpose. We enjoying spending an afternoon swimming at the fitness center up the road and eating Mexican at El Mezquite. The hosts do an excellent job at making the smaller space feel ""homey."" You get your own section by their house that feels like your own retreat center for your time there. Enjoy!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is ""luxury camping"" at it's finest. The rustic serenity cannot be adequately described with words, but must be experienced. The site is peaceful, the chickens are friendly (Fresh eggs for breakfast!) , and the cats are full of love. There is peace to be had here..."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The restroom situation is odd at first. But there is something soothing about taking a shower outdoors. It is private and tidy. More of a campers paradise than a hotel. While the two cats are quite friendly and affectionate. I would keep them away if you try to cook. The little doesn't have a lot of manners. All in all a great place for the price.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cutest property with the sweetest owners! We loved sitting by the fire pit with the cats. We will definitely be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The name says it all! If you are looking to feel far away from it all and experience the country and pampered camping this is it, the atmosphere was completely relaxing and laid back we will be returning!!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely place with beautiful trees and green grass near a creek. Ideal for young people. We are in our late 70’s and missed the creature comforts of indoor plumbing. However the weather was warm and outside showers were adequate and exhilarating. It made us feel young and adventurous. Kurt and Heidi were gracious hosts.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Very relaxing. Ingenious outdoor shower.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were terrific hosts. While some parts of the space were a shared, I still had all the privacy I wanted. I was greeted with muffins on the bed and a few beers in the fridge. I would definitely stay there again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed in a lot of tiny homes or glamping type of experiences and this was probably one of our favorites. The tiny house was tucked away and felt pretty private. The outdoor space with string lights was perfect for a campfire. There were so many things to do that were perfect for a relaxing getaway. There was also a very friendly kitten when we stayed so that was a plus. We enjoyed our time here and I’m sure we will be back.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cozy little retreat. It’s a great “glamping” spot. The outdoor shower and bathroom were very clean and great for being outdoors. We had fun playing games from the cupboard. Also, the setting was lovely!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Shed Retreat is a little room in a beautifully peaceful setting out in the country. It's kind of a cross between a guest cottage and camping. The Shed itself is relatively close to Kurt & Heidi's house, yet is situated so it's surprisingly secluded and private, so it really IS perfect for a retreat.
Personally, my favorite part about my 2-night stay was probably just sitting inside, reading, writing, and coloring, with the windows open to let in the cool, fresh air. I also enjoyed an evening campfire (ate too many s'mores), walking down to the creek and the green grassy area (early a.m. squats & lunges), gathering fresh eggs, and practicing some ""kitten yoga"" (didn't know that was a thing, but the little grey guy thought I should try it).
The outside restroom is relatively convenient, clean, and comfortable. I feel that guests should be aware in advance that they are asked to do some of their own ""maintenance"" of the camp toilet, and that was not at all a problem for me.
Heidi and Kurt went out of their way to help me with a problem that came up (which was not related to their property), and I'm so appreciative of their assistance.
I didn't experience much in the town of North Manchester, but I did visit the History Museum, which was interesting and informative, and the Main View restaurant where I had a delicious lunch.
I hope I get an opportunity to stay at The Shed sometime in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So cute and cozy! Super clean and neat inside and out. Kurt and Heidi were so hospitable and over all just super lovely people. Would 100% stay again and recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing space to relax, unwind, and clear your mind. The cats made the experience more special! The space itself was clean and cozy. Perfect for couples or as a solo trip. So much love was put into The Shed Retreat and it shows. Thank you so much, Kurt and Heidi! (The apple muffins that were waiting for us when we arrived were such a sweet touch and delicious!)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend this place for a pleasant stay. Do use the fire place at the barn as well as at the creek.
We had a great time hanging around late nights, playing and some refreshing time."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a terrific experience at the Shed. Went looking for a weekend away to enjoy the pleasures of camping but also have a bed and room at night. My kind of glamping! Kurt and Heidi were so thoughtful - welcome cupcakes and a note on the bed when I arrived. The room was comfortable and adequate. Firewood ready for a campfire. Instructions and anything I needed to know was communicated well. They were sweet to say hello and visit but also considerate to give me space. Lots of options for simple fun. I checked out the fitness center one day. Walked downtown North Manchester for ice cream another day. And enjoyed reading and several cups of coffee by the fire. The chickens, fresh eggs and adorable kitties just added to the charm of the experience. Price was right and well worth it! Thanks Kurt and Heidi!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything about The Shed is awesome. Comfortable and cute inside and out. This was our third visit and we will be back again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cozy and homey! It was the perfect retreat for our anniversary. There was even a bottle of sparkling apple cider and amazing cupcakes to help us celebrate. They have everything here that you need to make your stay enjoyable. We are planning our next trip in the fall some time. We’d love to come back and enjoy this place longer and get to interact with the owners more. The cats, as everybody mentions, were just an added bonus!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of my favorite places I have stayed. It was so cute and had so many nice additions. Honestly it was so amazing that I got to love on kittens at night and in the morning. That was my favorite addition. It was also nice to have some devotion books because my husband and I got to do it before we went to bed. Also, the cupcakes were awesome!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The shed is super cute and quaint! We came to stay for just one evening for a wedding nearby. Kurt was so helpful and kind. Loved waking up to the sounds of a nature and enjoying some coffee on the shed porch.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very charming and comfy. Great for a couple of nights.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just, wow! It is clear how much thought and love has gone into this little retreat. It was absolutely beautiful and had everything you could have needed and more! Kurt and Heidi have a beautiful property and yes, there were kitties! The kitties were such an added blessing and so adorable. The shed was stunning, as was the yard and little creek in the back! We have never been camping before and this little glamping getaway was a perfect introduction, featuring an outdoor toilet and shower. The toilet was easy to use and very clean, as was the shower. This was everything we were looking for and we cant wait to be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! Kitten snuggles, fish nibbling your toes in the stream, beautiful surroundings, peace and quiet. We absolutely loved our stay, and the cupcakes ,with the sparkling juice, waiting for us was a great touch. So much love and care in this little space, and a wonderful place to celebrate our anniversary."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice accomadations, beautiful setting. The kayak trip was very nice. Great value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space. Relaxing and rejuvenating. Heidi and Kurt have put their hearts into it to make it cute, comfortable and a spot carved out for your soul and heart to rest. My husband gave me this trip as a beautiful Mother’s Day present. I went kayaking, played with the kittens, napped in the hammock, had coffee under the trees, listened to the silence and the sound of the River and rode a bike into town for dinner. It was a gift and a blessing in many ways. I highly recommend the space and the hosts."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely loving. If you like camping you'll enjoy the scenery. If you're looking to experience something different and unique this is something for you.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat was beautiful, clean and so restful. I plan to return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome space with cute kitties
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you like ""glamping"" this place is for you! It was an oasis of serenity and beauty, nestled in a sweet garden of hostas and shady trees. The chickens are near the parking and their sweet soft noises greeted us as we entered the very short path to the beautiful converted goat shed. If those goats could see this place now, they'd be in awe of it! The decor inside is darling and it had everything you needed, including A/C, electricity, a nice comfy chair, coffee table and love seat sitting area. The large bed was extremely comfy and the pillows were perfect. Rubber slippers, towels and bathrobes were provided near the back door for use in the very private outside shower. There is a camp toilet which along with the foot pump sink is part of the ""glamping"" experience that made this a fun adventure. From the cupcakes that greeted us to the fresh eggs we cooked in the barn for breakfast, we couldn't have asked for more! Oh! We also were over the moon visiting with the sweetest momma cat and her five adorable kittens!!! If we could have adopted any, we would have begged for at least two. It will be one of the best places you can find to stay in Indiana and I guarantee you won't want to leave!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a true gem. Even just a night left me refreshed and with a bit more peace. Everything is as described, and Kurt and Heidi were extremely thoughtful and kind in their design and communication."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay…three bookings in the same week (unplanned!) should say something about how awesome this location is!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying at the Shed retreat was relaxing! If you need a getaway and a place to refresh this is a great spot! Sitting out and watching the chickens and the kittens made for a lovely evening. We wish our stay could have been longer but we only were there for one night. We hope to go back maybe for a weekend sometime!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great hosts with a clean and serene space. I stayed with three of my kids one night and knew I wanted to bring my younger two and the host was able to immediately accommodate that without a problem. I HIGHLY recommend this location and it’s definitely a new regular for us. ♥️🐓🥚🙌🏼💕
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely LOVE this location. The hosts are beyond friendly, the cats (and now kittens as well!!!) are just adorable and so playful, and the setting is peaceful and just enough off of the beaten path to feel sort of camp-y in a very glamp-y way. My 15 year old daughter didn’t want to come previously because of the outdoor restroom (🙄😐). She, for some reason, chose to come this time and now said she will come every chance she gets. If this place can win over the pickiest teenager in the world, I’d say it’s whatever level comes after “winner”! 😋😉💕"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! This place is super cozy and beautifully designed. Don't be fooled by the little door; it's actually very spacious inside (and I'm 6'4"")! We were even greeted with some amazing and unexpected cupcakes upon our arrival, which hit the spot after a long drive. The setting is absolutely beautiful; we fell in love with the kitties and the hens. And there is a great woods that leads to a river out back. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our visit to North Manchester. Kurt was easy to get a hold of and super helpful when we had questions. Thanks so much!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful magical place! Friendly hosts, comfortable setup, and kittens. What’s not to love?"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are here to shed your worries away, spending more time with peace and quietness that nature has to offer, then you are at the right place. Will come back again for cute kittens 😁"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This retreat is even better than the photos show! Super cozy, cool on hot days, warmer on chilly mornings. Camping toilet is just fine as is the outdoor shower. Loved ever second of my stay and the kittens roaming around with their mama are just an added bonus!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"clean place. kind, courteous, and helpful hosts"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best rooms I’ve ever stayed in. The hosts are clear, clean, and friendly. If you want a rustic retreat that still feels like home, look no further!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kurt and Heidi were wonderful hosts. The space was clean and comfortable, and there were several amenities to enjoy. We got to play with their cats outside and feed the chickens. It was something much different than we were used to and it was a nice couple getaway for us. We will definitely be back in the future and we couldn’t recommend it more!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cute and clean!!! Perfect getaway
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kurt and Heidi were great hosts! They were great and answering our questions and offering suggestions for activities to enjoy throughout our stay. It was so peaceful and we will definitely stay again next time we are in Indiana!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot! Quaint and cozy. The scenery is unlike any other I have experienced as far as air bnb is concerned. I highly recommend this amazing spot!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’ve got an inkling this place is for you — IT IS! Man, what a rejuvenating experience even just for 1 night away. The grounds were more gorgeous and the space even better than I could ever expect. SO homey and very close to all you need (not far at all from the downtown area of N Manchester). Can’t wait to return!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was excellent from playing on the trails and exploring the water to the sweetheart cats loving on us to gathering our own eggs for breakfast to the cute little fire pit and homemade collie (yum!). We will definitely be back—my new favorite AirBNB! ❤️🙌🏼
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little cabin getaway! Truly puts the “glam” in glamping
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing peaceful place if you're looking for some quiet time. love the cats:)
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Shed is very peaceful. It is perfect for a personal or a couples retreat.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute space.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun stay - Kurt and Heidi have put great thought and work into making their place so relaxing. Communication was quick and great through the process. Plenty of small touches at the property. We did not take advantage of all of the amenities but it was nice to have so many different activities offered. Great value for a relaxing weekend trip. Look forward to putting together a return visit.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi’s place is so unique and was such a treat to stay in! The quaint, farmhouse styled shed was so cozy. We love the roaming cats and kittens! Highly recommend this spot 💜"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The shed is a great getaway! Close to a little creek, quaint, cozy, and quiet. It was the perfect thing I needed to get a little time for myself. There were plenty of blankets to get cozy, all the amenities were provided, and I found the outdoor bathroom a fun little adventure. If you’re not a fan of cats, though, this may not be the spot for you. There are a ton of friendly cats (and kittens) that accompanied me throughout my time outside. I found them endearing, but someone afraid (or allergic) to cats may find that less than relaxing. Definitely would recommend this spot!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the woodsy location of The Shack Retreat. It was cozy and decorated beautifully. Even though close to the main home, it was still very private. We were able to go for a walk and enjoy the kittens playing outside. There are many restaurants and stores within a few minutes' drive. We will definitely recommend to our local friends for a day away!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I never knew I could love Indiana before coming here. Everything LOOKS as pictured, but the FEEL is way better than any words can describe. I'm definitely bringing my daughter next time I come back. Most amazing solo Airbnb experience ever. 💜"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place. Exactly as described. Lots of chickens and cats. Everything was well done and easy. Thank you!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The love and effort Kurt and Heidi put into this experience shows the moment you arrive. I could write about so many things but I’ll keep it simple. All around it is a great place to get away and connect with your partner and forget about daily life for a moment. Loved every second of it!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You need to go here. Best air bnb I’ve been to in a long time!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem here in the middle of a peaceful atmosphere! We loved it!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second trip to the Shed and it was just as awesome as our first time. We love the relaxing space and cozy fire. We did a kayak trip again and enjoyed every minute of it. The thoughtful touches Kurt and Heidi have done just make this one of our favorite spots!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at The Shed Retreat! We were in town for a wedding and only 15 minutes away from the venue. Such a great little spot with amazing decorations & privacy! Coming from country living myself, I loved walking past the chickens & having kitty friends that love back scratches! We actually really enjoyed the outdoor shower and bathroom area. It will kind of catch you off guard at first, but it had a way of taking you into an even more rustic retreat. I will recommend this place whenever asked."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. I have been there about 4 times. The energy is very positive and healing. It is indeed a nice retreat. It is kind of like glamping. There are many cats and chickens. You can ride bikes or go kayaking. North Manchester is a very pleasing rural community. Very amenable to a romantic getaway, you can get really close to your partner here."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi were wonderful hosts! We loved relaxing in the hammocks, spending time by the campfire, and getting fresh eggs from the coop! There were so many small touches that made the trip extra special too--like a welcome note with homemade cookies and a note on a book of questions inviting us to get to know each other better. My wife fell in love with Nala, one of their kittens, who was a great hammock snuggle buddy! Kurt was especially attentive and communicative--transporting our farmer's market goods (There is a wonderful farmer's market in town on Saturday mornings!) for us when he noticed that we had bought a little too much to carry back with us to the shed with the bikes that he lent us. We also really enjoyed, and recommend, the kayaking trip! (This would be at a small extra cost and includes kayaks, paddles, life jackets and drop off / pick up.) It was all just what we needed to get away from everyday life!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! My husband and I took a long weekend here and have already started telling our friends about the The Shed Retreat. Our only fear is that it will already be booked when we want to come back!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There just arent enough words to describe how wonderful of an experience we had! Kurt and Heidi are amazing hosts and created a peaceful space for their visitors! We plan on going back again soon since we just loved our time spent there.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This ranks among one of our favorite Airbnb's we have stayed in! For a quick two-day anniversary trip to Winona Lake, Kurt and Heidi's place was exactly what we hoped for. Now that we know about this amazing place, we hope to be back in the future for a longer visit."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent place to stay! Cute, clean, and lots of fun."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Think ""Glamping"" only better. Kurt and Heidi's Shed retreat was just what my husband and I needed for a few days to rest and refresh. We enjoyed the fire pit, the kittens, and the secluded space ""away from it all."" Kurt was very accommodating when we Kayaked, and they were fantastic at communicating. The little touches of care in the shed were perfect! The unique art work, the extra throw blankets and robes, the coffee and sugar, and the cookies and note - this stay exceeded our expectations! We would love to return!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, relaxing place to escape to!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! The shed retreat was awesome! The hosts are quick to respond, the space is comfortable and stylish! We loved sitting by the fire pit , loved the kittens and chickens, and all of the personal touches! We were able to go kayaking (last minute) and thoroughly enjoyed it! Showering under the stars was fantastic! And the welcome cookies were very much appreciated!
We have stayed at many Air bnbs and this is one of our favorites!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful time during my mom-cation getaway for the night. It was much needed and everything I was looking for. The indoor and outdoor settings made for a peaceful stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my 3rd time staying at the Shed Retreat. It is a very homey and uplifting experience- I love it here.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an amazing retreat into nature and simple living. If you need to clear your mind, get in touch with yourself, focus on art or meditation; this is the place for you. The hosts were so kind and the amenities were unbelievable for the price and quality of the place. I recommend bringing your own grill and food to cook on site. There is a great farmers market in the town on Saturday morning, but otherwise healthy convenient food choices are slim. The camping toilet is really the only rustic part of the amenities so you should be prepared to take care of your own waste. There are some beautiful state parks in the area you can drive to for hiking trails and nature time. The best part by far was meeting the hosts and going on the kayak adventure; they provided the kayak and the drop-off/pick-up. The river was beautiful with a good mix of challenging and relaxing sections which made for a perfect true adventure. Thank you so much Heidi and Kurt for the love and kindness you put into this retreat."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place with lots of love and hospitality shown! We would stay there again if we are in the area
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at the Shed, I love this place!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kurt and Heidi are great hosts and the shed was perfect with so many personal touches. We loved all the helpful notes and signs. The country setting was so nice and peaceful and we thoroughly enjoyed the cats. The bed was super comfy. Highly recommended!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in a search for a small little retreat this is the perfect place! We didn’t do the extra activities such as using the bikes, outdoor games, kayaking or the fire pit. Which tells you that this place is Loaded with options! But we will sure return to do so! Location is great, very quite and peaceful. The Shed Retreat was very clean and the instructions at location were very easy to read and follow. Kurt and Heidi definitely thought of all the little details which makes this place even more special. Can’t forget that there were extra companions, the kittens on the property made it feel more like home. The outdoor shower and bathroom are very easy to use, it is truly an experience. My husband and I can’t thank Kurt and Heidi enough for their hospitality. If you decide to give this place a chance, you will not regret it!! Go for it and give it a try! Have fun!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kurt and Heidi went above and beyond for us. We came for our first anniversary and spent our time feeling so welcome and surrounded by kitties, nature, and chickens. It’s like staying in a luxurious little hobbit hole. They let us rent their own kayaks to go kayaking and dropped us off and picked us up for a great price. We got fresh, warm eggs from the chicken coop for breakfast and had a great fire surrounded by fairy lights. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to spend our anniversary :)"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi was a great host! The check in was very easy. The place was very clean. We loved how quiet and relaxing the property was. The location offers a nice trail in the back that leads to a great spot to start a fire. Both her and her husband took care of all of our needs and are very grateful. Great place to spend time with the Lord! Everything was well maintained and kept. Would recommend to any couple who wants to get away or even an individual or family looking for a cool spot to relax. Thank you Heidi and Kurt
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful, private retreat in the country❤️ The shed was like a little cabin in the woods. Everything was clean and the host were very welcoming. You can sit out around the fire in the evening with the kittens. We loved our stay there!
Randy and Ben"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint little place. Hosts offer a lot of extras. Peaceful.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has special loving energy and all you need for a relaxing and peaceful retreat in the country.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great spot for what I needed! Kurt and Heidi went above and beyond with their hospitality.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique, quaint, quiet place!! We really enjoyed our time there!! It was very cozy with most of what my fiancé and I needed for a quiet love bird weekend together! It did get a bit chilly at night but that made for closer cuddling! We didn't use the cold outdoor shower, to cold, but did go to the rec center which was quite enjoyable with the pool and hot tub!! The fire pit was great with all the wood you need and the kittens were just an added plus to the experience! We did have a great stay! Super clean and cozy!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Shed Retreat was such a cute, cozy little space. The backyard area was so charming and would be a great place to relax around the fire, it was raining when I went. The bed and furniture were so comfy and there were plenty of throw blankets to snuggle up with and relax. We were greeted by kittens when we arrived and every time we went outside. It was overall such a peaceful, private, and relaxing place to stay. I would love to go back on a nicer weekend so I could get outdoors there. Such a nice place for some R&R."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an incredible experience. We are AirBnB host and vacate our home every weekend. Kurt and Heidi’s place offered everything our family needed. We were able to set up a tent right outside the shed, which gave us a little more space to play with. Our two year old twins had a sandbox and swing set to keep them busy. We enjoyed a fire and tenting as if we were camping, yet with the comfort of a stylish and comfortable place to sleep. The shed was separated from the main house by a garage, which had a refrigerator for us to keep milk cold. There was running water and electricity. Also within a mile of a cute little small town and yummy Mexican!"

We were warmly welcomed with hellos and blueberry muffins!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic week! Kurt and Heidi (and their family) are so kind and considerate. Although we were on their property, we could not see any of their activity most of the time. They immediately responded to any questions we had and were very helpful about area information. We definitely plan to go back! We hope to make it a traditional trip."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was truly wonderful staying overnight at the Shed Retreat. It was evident how much intention, purposeful, and prayerful planning went into creating every aspect of this cozy space. I was truly able to spend some beautiful uninterrupted time with God. I especially loved borrowing a bike to grab dinner in town!! This place is like it’s own little peaceful sanctuary!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My oh my. Rod's place is not only a beautifuly reconditioned Industrial space, but an Art gallery as well. Read his BIO and it explains what I mean.
Entry is easy, lock box and complete instructions. Rod, even sent pictures to help guide us from the street. The stairwell to the 2cd floor is very wide and easy to navigate.
Once inside you have 12' ceilings (at least) and the revamped industrial vibe without being sterile and too modern. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. The bathrooms, the floors, everything.
A family of could easily stay her, the kitchen is lovely and well equipped. Even has a dishwasher.
If you are in New Castle, you will miss out if you do not stay with Rod. He himself seems like a charming man and I hope we meet at some point."

He was 100% pro-active in communicating, checking in with us during our stay, and responding promptly if we had a question...what more could one ask of a host. The unit itself nicely was very clean and furnished with comfortable furniture and beds; the kitchen had everything necessary to prepare snacks or meals. Coffee shops were very close by, but plenty of coffee and tea choices in the cupboards made staying in our go-to for morning beverages. Definitely will be our home away from home when we're back in New Castle."

Wayne) Indiana to user-friendly Indy...from artsy Bloomington to some time spent in nearby Hagerstown and Richmond...
I knew New Castle before....but had no idea it could look (and feel!) like this! The Loft is beautiful and welcoming. The porch, the fresh air, and the hummingbirds, alone, are worth it.

From waking up early and seeing the deer come out of the surrounding woods to feed on the corn that they provide, to the beautiful sunrises and the cardinals and blue jays that continue to swoop in for the left over corn, it is evident that Gods peace, beauty and creation is surrounding you.
The Loft is Cozy, comfortable, relaxing, and so peaceful. It is just a short drive into town for dinner or shopping.
The owners are more than helpful with anything you need! It is evident how much they care not only about their beautiful place & property, but also about their visitors comfort & needs! I am definitely looking forward to returning!"

We typically stay in Indy and go back and forth, this was so much better. We stay at air bnbs at least once a month. This has been the homiest. So clean and everything I wanted or needed was there. Communication couldn’t have been better. Their property was extravagant, and the views. Actually wish it had been August to see the fields. I’ve lived in the south a long time, but staying here was every good memory I have growing up. The smell of fresh cut grass, the sound of the birds, and the views of country.

I am in town for work, short term, and had been paying roughly 1500 to stay. Christmas roles around, and they charged me an additional 1000 without any notification. Went back and forth with AirBNB to no avail. Hannah and Scott were also dumbfounded as to why I was charged so much. Will not be using AirBNB for future stays, whether for work or pleasure."

We loved every minute of it, looking forward to go back. Thank you to the Wallace family for their kindness and hospitality."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay here for the solar eclipse. It's a large property in beautiful Amish farm country. Very quiet and peaceful. I could hear the faint clop-clop of horse drawn buggies on distant roads, and the railroad couple miles away. Far enough from big cities that you can see many stars.
Apartment is very nice and cozy size for 1 or 2 (400 sq ft). Furnishings comfortable. Kitchen well equipped -- full size fridge / freezer, microwave, toaster oven, K-cup. No stove but didn't miss it. Kitchen well stocked w essentials and snacks. Everything clean. Dish TV and WiFi worked well. You can park right at the door & only 2 steps up into the space. The rest of the building is a large workshop -- all very quiet.
Hosts live in the main house and are very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach. Home-cooked meals and pies were delicious and unexpected. I felt very welcome. Hosts appear new to AirBnB but I can't think of anything to improve. Hope to return someday. Highly recommended!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful quiet spot! The hosts met me upon arrival, gave me TV and heating instructions. The place was clean and we'll stocked.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I was able to give this location MORE than 5 stars. The house was IMPECCABLE, beautifully decorated, completely comfortable, exactly what I needed! Being in town for a horse show, it was the perfect distance to the show grounds and after being on our feet all day, it was the perfect relaxation zone to come home, kick off my boots, and sit on the back deck with a glass of wine. I cannot say anything negative about this house or the owners as it was the best rental I've stayed at in a long time with the best owners. It's exactly where I want to be next time I'm traveling to New Castle, unless the owners add properties to their portfolio, and if they do.. I'd be happy to stay there as well! Thank you again Jon and Ashlee on making my first time to New Castle a great experience."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts of this location reaaly put a lot of effort in making your stay as pleasant as possible. They think of every detail and you can tell they are not scrimping on any amenities that might make your stay as enjoyable as it could be. They are listed as a ""Super Host"" which is very apt."

The kitchen was fantastic, they have literally everything you need to cook. Very cozy living room, really nice beds. The last thing I have to mention was the coffee machine. I’m also a big fan of Nespresso vertuo, if you know the price of the capsules you will know it is very generous of them to offer you all those collections. We definitely had a wonderful fall break there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jon and Ashlee’s place was beautiful! Plenty of room and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with anything you may need.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 6 has done a lot of traveling and air BnB stays in the last 3 years. This place was perfect for our family and the little extra touches were noticeable and made the experience really great. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a water bottle placed on every night stand to quench our thirst in the middle of the night. What a great added value! Very comfortable beds and a great night sleep. Would recommend this place for sure 👍
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed a single night on our way driving through from the east coast to Kansas, but we really enjoyed Jon & Ashlee's place. Everything was really well designed and well decorated, and we enjoyed flipping through the cool coffee table books all around the place. The town isn't right on I-70, but it was a surprisingly easy and quick to get to and from the highway from the Airbnb. I'm not sure exactly what the town has in it, but if you find yourself in town or passing through near by, we'd definitely recommend this Airbnb.
Also, I stupidly left something in the Airbnb and they were kind enough to promptly look for and ship me the item."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a gem tucked in a cute residential neighborhood! We were traveling cross country and needed a place with multiple bedrooms to accommodate our group for an overnight stop. We found this listing and were drawn to the photos and listing. What a joy it was to see the place matched everything described!
This sweet bungalow is on a quiet residential street near the cute downtown.
Off-street parking and super easy entry and we were inside this impeccably decorated home. The hosts have amazing design taste- clutter free but with cute touches that create a cozy space. They thought of everything- comfortable bedding, nice towels, phone chargers and extension cords, cozy lighting, water on nightstands, coffee station and extra drinks in fridge, throw blankets on the couch and a great TV setup. Be sure to spend time on the back deck- at night to enjoy the lighting and in the morning like I did with my cup and coffee and book. Stay here! You’ll love it"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"On a weekly basis, I stay at an Airbnb for my work. That host has raised the bar on my expectations, hence the reason I stay there every week. With that said, this location meets and surpasses the standard I am accustomed to. The hosts are amazing with communication. The house is spotless. There is not a detail missed. The kitchen is beyond well-stocked. We were able to cook meals and could have baked a cake if needed!
We will be back.
If you are in the New Castle area, book it unless I'm trying to get a reservation!
Thank you for a great place to stay!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jon and Ashlee were very responsive and friendly, accommodating us when our flight got canceled and the trip was bumped a day.

We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it."

I highly recommend this space!"

Jon was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts provided Hoosier hospitality really “above and beyond” expectations. Kitchen waiting for home cook. Three bedrooms set to comfort travelers. Hosts you’d enjoy sharing a toast or dinner.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our favorite airbnb to date! So many thoughtful touches and amenities to make us feel at home. Only 30 minutes from Ball State University so a great choice for our daughter's graduation. Highly recommend, would give more than 5 stars if I could! Great hospitality!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is even more beautiful than the pictures. You walk in and instantly feel at home. It is so serene and spacious! I cannot recommend this house enough. I travel a lot, and this is one of my favorite places I have stayed!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Jon’s place was perfect for our month long stay in New Castle while we waited on our new home to be available.

The house is beautifully decorated and the kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. The location was perfect for us as well. It was easy to get anywhere we needed to go while staying here. I would 100% recommend this place for anyone staying in New Castle.

The listing had a fresh, modern look and feel with a focus on design that we enjoyed - it was so homey, comfortable and attractive. Jon was flexible and responsive when our plans changed and communicated well throughout our stay. The cleaning fees were modest which is one of the things we look for when we travel on AirBnB. We were visiting family and it truly was the perfect home away from home during our time in New Castle. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay. The house was very welcoming and warm; down to the details. You can tell that Jon put a lot of thought into making this place homie.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bestie and I wanted a lake house weekend gateway to chat, read, and catch up on baking shows. Katie’s place was THE PERFECT spot. It’s right on the water which was beautiful. It was bright and airy and beautifully decorated. A few minute drive to local restaurants (we liked The Dam Landing and Rochester Bagel & Coffee). We have been talking about making this our new lake house getaway spot!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was absolutely beautiful. Katie was an amazing host and was extremely responsive.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie was a fantastic host and the property is more beautiful than the pictures listed. Everything was clean and organized.

The host are amazing with communication, helpful in so many ways and friendly beyond standards.
Before we even left we wanted to book for our plans this summer together.
So we will be back in the future.
Rochester is growing with a new amazing theater and tons of local shops that are quite a delight.
Thanks again for making our stay amazing."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our two families enjoyed this house with beautiful view.
I like living room with high ceiling.
Also there are lots of toys for kids. Our children enjoyed playing with Lego!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean cabin in a good location. Close to town but still feel like you’re on vacation at the lake. The view out to the lake is gorgeous
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A cute home right on the lake with a wonderful view. Communication with the owner was always fast. Restaurant right on the water was so fun.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing visit! They are such friendly and responsive hosts. The house is clean, homey and unique. We cannot wait to go back sometime!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, peaceful setting on beautiful Lake Manitou. Comfortable beds and the view was stunning! Kristen communicated with clear instructions and prompt with answering any questions. Will definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kristin's place was very well kept and convenient. Check in and check out was smooth and easy to follow. The views out of the window were incredibly lovely! My dog enjoyed his time in the fenced yard as well - he was super happy!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great stay at Kristin’s cabin when in town for a friend’s wedding! Kristin was an extremely responsive host and even went above and beyond and helped us locate a ride to the airport when our transportation fell through. It was too cold outside for us to be able to enjoy the lake fully but it was so picturesque!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cozy place was perfect as we were in town for a friends wedding. Beautiful to wake up with the views of the lake.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Jeff and Kristin's place on the lake. The beds were comfortable, the lake was beautiful, and we appreciated the fenced in back yard for our furry friends. Would definitively stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Lake Manitou! The house was cozy and had plenty of space. We used the lily pad in the lake, which was awesome! Sitting on the deck every morning with coffee and a book was so peaceful. The house is also close to everything in Rochester. We would definitely come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute home! Great spot! Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location and clean home. Nothing fancy but perfect for our wedding party.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great lake place, exactly as pictured/described. Enjoyed the paddle board, youth kayaks, and lilly pad that were available for our use. House was clean and comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kristen communicated with all my questions before and during our stay quickly. We rented a boat nearby at Lilly Pad's Boutique and Kristen let us use their float pad that was in the garage. We had three dogs with us so the fenced in yard was awesome.
My husband and I have three grown children who also have significant others. We had plenty of room for all seven adults. Since there are three floors, we felt we had privacy from each other as well.
The water is shallow by the pier, so getting our kayaks in and out was easy. We noticed the rocks are sharp so bring water shoes if you plan to swim by the pier.
Overall, this is a great family vacation spot!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This lakeside home is in a beautiful setting with lovely views of the waterfront. We watched wildlife and played in and out of the water. The house itself is cozy and has everything you need for a lake vacation. Enjoy!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This lake house was awesome and exactly as described. We enjoyed our stay and kayaking right off the dock in the back yard. It is peaceful and in a great location. We would book it again!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed spending the weekend at the lake house! The location is perfect. The cottage has everything needed for a weekend. We enjoyed the water equipment as well! Great place for a gateaway from the city!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house and location! The deck and dock were awesome for sitting outside and there was lots of bird activity to watch from the nearby island (osprey, herons, etc). The water toys were a great perk: we used the paddleboard and Lilypad every day. Definitely recommend this rental!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,I had an amazing time.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location - loved the water front property & the access to yard game and water toys
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great views of the lake whether sitting inside or hanging out of the large deck, which was a wonderful place to relax. Loved having the dogs with us, the fenced yard was big plus. If you wish to have some swim time with your dogs, be aware that having a sea wall means there is no beach for them to easily get out of the lake - so you're only option is to lift them out and, due to the height of the pier, there is at least 3 feet between the pier and the surface of the water - that's a long way to lift a 40 lb dog. The lake bottom is not sand, so your feet sink and you have no leverage to lift from underneath. Other than that challenge, we had a wonderful time at the lakehouse. It's a beautiful property. Convenient access to restaurants and grocery - we especially loved Rochester Bagels & Harvest Moon. Communication and response from the hosts was great."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An awesome place to relax and enjoy the view!! A perfect getaway!! Neighbors extremely nice, too!!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our needs while visiting relatives in Rochester. Right on the lake and even though it was cold, the sliding doors made the view enjoyable. Lots of nice little extras included.
Very easy to communicate with and no issues during our stay!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is great for a weekend get-a-way. Beautiful waterfront property with great views.
The pet friendly accommodations are great. Fully fenced in yard for safe romping."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The owners have created a space that is right on the water and is perfect for a weekend away with friends or even a small family. The house is so cute (just as described), is cozy (offering multiple rooms and accommodations for both children and adults) and is so serene (sitting on the water with minimal noise around). The location is perfect for hearing the sound of water, nature and passing boats. There are also a few classic games in the closet for entertainment if you are taking a step away from technology (though a tv is provided in the basement). The owners have also provided a few recommendations regarding local excursions and food that are spot on. No regrets regarding this reservation and would book it a gain in the future. Grateful to the owners for creating a space for guests to enjoy nature and a quaint community."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice home! Plenty of sleeping room for large groups. Access to paddle boards and kayaks were a great benefit. Dog friendly with a fenced in yard made it ideal for our family!

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Site is exactly as shown. Very clean. Right on the water. It was very relaxing laying on the big blue float mat that was available for use. Neighbors were friendly with a wave and general quick small talk, but did not hover. Feels very secluded but just a few minutes from stores etc. My family thought it was perfect for a water front get away. |f you have issues with steps, the spiral staircase in the house is a little challenging, but if you don't need tv you can manage everything on the main floor."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great communication, just as described, would highly recommend"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,A great weekend get away! We went as a group of 6 with two dogs and we all absolutely loved it! It’s a great space with plenty of outdoor space right next to the lake! Will definitely stay again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place. Easy communication and quick answers to any questions that we had. It was very clean and great for a couple to a small family. We were able to bring our dog and he loved it as well. We will definitely return, with our kids, in the future."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The picture perfect view was worth the price. We loved the spacious deck and spent majority of our time outside. This house is perfect for dogs and young children due to the fenced yard. Our host full-filled every one of our requests. We will definitely be staying here again.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"New deck, nice outdoor space and access to the lake. Owners were accessible and check in/out was easy."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is very clean. The large deck and fenced yard was great for enjoying the early spring weather. I would love to visit again and take advantage of the beautiful lake in the summer.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the lake with a lovely view - we had a great trip with our 3 doggies. We wish we had more time to get away, but enjoyed our long weekend!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely stay with a beautiful lake view, even in the winter it’s something to experience.
Unfortunately for anyone from the city or who is a POC I wouldn’t recommend purely for the neighbors who made my group feel rather uncomfortable. Additionally, the kitchen was a bit smaller than we expected so if you intend on cooking expect a tight squeeze."
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommend staying here! A-frame is set up great, was super clean and is on the lake! Golf, food and bars all within 3 minutes. Cant wait to stay again!!!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We had an awesome weekend getaway at the cabin!
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was basically clean when we arrived. However, it was not a comfortable space. The two dining chairs were bar height and have no back. The two chairs in the “living room” are uncomfortable. So there was no place to relax. Neither tv worked - not sure if it was batteries for the remotes or another issue. We did not pursue it because neither was located such that it would be easy to relax and watch tv. Half of the windows lacked screens. We needed to open the windows to air the space out because the air chemical smell was overwhelming when we walked in. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone with respiratory issues, limited mobility (because of the stairs), or a family because of lack of seating or spaces for children or even two couples. This was disappointing. On the plus side it is right downtown."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property had numerous maintenance and cleanliness issues, inside and out. This morning (12/28/23), I picked up multiple pieces of trash strewn around the property. The trash cans had tipped over (overflowing) on Christmas Day and trash was everywhere. I messaged the host last Saturday about 10 issues (and there were more) and they responded that they’d look into a compensation offer for our dissatisfaction. Still waiting…"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Perfect location right outside of Indianapolis! Highly Recommended.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little 2 bedroom and 1 bath upstairs apt style house. Close to the downtown but also close to the main hiway with several eating and shopping locations. If I need to stay in New Castle, In again I would certainly rebook here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was here for work. The location and place worked great for me. It was clean and cozy. It was as pictured.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All we needed. My friend and I were born and raised in New Castle. I dold my family home in May. So, for first time we had no place to stay. So we tried the 215 place. It was all we needed while visiting old friends and catching up ourselves. We've been friends 65+ yesrs.
New Castle is looking better. We were pleased. Felt weird to be ""home"" and not AT my house, but tgat wasn't you fault."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute two bedroom apartment in downtown New Castle. More comfortable and nicer than any hotel in town.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was very clean, close to the downtown area. Roku tv was nice. Beds were comfortable. Keypad made it easy to check in and not worry about a key"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice place to stay for two weeks of out of state work. Only downside I would say is it’s fairly close to fire department/EMS building but I didn’t mind too much. Great to talk with on the few minor inconveniences always responded within 15-30 minutes!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my stay at your property. You could hear the trains coming threw but it wasn’t a problem. You have to drive about 30 minutes to get to restaurants and shops. Both bedrooms are really spacious. They are a few weird things. One in the bathroom whatever they were doing yo the wall below the towel rack. They is also a space I guess for a washer and dryer hook up that’s open. Overall I loved the decor, the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with appliances and items for cooking."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. In coming to New Castle in the past it’s been difficult to find a nice place to stay. We will most definitely be booking with five star properties in the future when we come back! There are many small attention to details, like extra soap in the bathroom, spices to cook with, hangers in the closet, a drying mat for dishes and ice cube trays filled up ready to use. The beds were super comfortable and clean. Lots of extra pillows and blankets in the closets
Overall we loved our stay, the location is perfect and so close to a lot of places. Walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, the art park and local library. We Will be booking this place again next year when visiting our family."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place perfect for the occasion we rented it for. Very responsive. Great service.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nothing to mention it was a good stay
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,nice place I didn't realize it was 2nd floor no big deal tho easy access. modern chairs are not really comfortable for relaxing and watching tv but no room for a couch I guess.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in downtown New Castle. Very close to courthouse
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Good spot to stay. Peaceful and quiet location.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pleasant, clean, convenient, comfortable accommodations! My family was in town to celebrate my son’s marriage and it was the perfect location and size for 4 of us to stay. Will definitely return when visiting my son and new daughter-in-law!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, 2nd floor. Clean and comfortable."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place good location
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything. Very nice and clean.
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place right where we needed to be. Close to the square in New Castle. This unit has stairs for access once you get in the door. Communication was GREAT! If you are stopping ahead of time for groceries know that the coffee machine takes K cups. The mattress I slept on (one of the twins) was not the best. My brother slept in the queen and said it was fine. I saw that heat was struck through as an amenity but please know that in addition to central heat there are several space heaters in the unit.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was a great find for the location and price! Everything was modern and clean upon arrival. The fireplace and smart thermostat kept everything at a comfortable temperature during our chilly visit.
We had a few minor complaints such as lack of curtains in the bedrooms to prevent the bright lights from Main Street stream into the rooms at night and there not being enough wash cloths for the length of our stay. Besides those few minor items, we would stay here again based on location alone.
My suggestion is to bring a sleep mask and some coffee to brew in the keurig!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just what I expected, very new and clean. Would definitely stay again. Unit3 has a flight of stairs so may need to bring baby gate if traveling with young children or choose one of the downstairs units."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean and friendly. I only wish there was a television in the bedroom with the queen bed. Also, I am old, so the steps leading up to the apartment was complicated for me. The apartment was lovely, though."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, clean and close to downtown. I would recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean and newly renovated. Decently close to food and drinks within walking distance, and even more with a short drive away. It is on the second floor though so if you can't climb stairs that could be an issue. I would definitely recommend this place to stay and they were very quick with their responses."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice accommodations for our lodging while in town racing at Newcastle Motorsports Park!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you need to stay near New Castle, this is the place to go. Very clean and modern, felt very at home there. I was the first person who booked so there were a few small things I let them know about so it's hopefully perfect for your visit."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay that is super close to the heart of town! Worked perfectly for why we needed it and will stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our families third visit to Oak Grove. It is such a wonderful place to stay. The house is huge and spacious and clean. We've had many meals and good conversation around that dining room table. The kitchen is amazing - so many little extra's in the cupboards - just in case I had forgotten a something. My family loves sitting on the huge porch every morning and evening. Such a lovely home - thank you for sharing it with us. We love it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place if you're looking for a peaceful country setting. This is our second time renting this house while visiting family and friends in the area.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with our friends and two toddlers. DeAnn even had two pack and play's ready for us so we didn't need to pack that in the car, which was incredibly helpful (we were trying to fit four adults and two toddlers in the same minivan). DeAnn's home had everything we needed for our families saving alot of time and space in the vehicle!
Thank you so much!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our stay! Such beautiful scenery surrounding the house! We were in town for a work trip. After some very long days it was great to come back to place that felt like home!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at this house for a week with my family and we really enjoyed our stay here!! It is very well-equipped with all you need from kitchen utensils to bed linens towels, blankets etc. It is also very spacious in terms of dining room, living room, and kitchen which makes it flexible in case you happen to come with a larger family. All bathrooms including laundry are all very well equipped with toilet paper, towels, and a few hygienic products. Every room has a TV which makes it entertaining for family time and for the little ones. Lastly, the house has more than enough space on the backyard which would be very nice to use during the summer time.
Overall, this house is very comfortable and offers all you need for either shorter and longer stays! I would highly recommend it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. We felt very much at home. Very well stocked and plenty of room.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Well I have never left a review for any airbnb that I have stayed at but this house was set up perfectly. The house has everything you need with everything labeled so that you can find everything easily. When we looked at the picture on airbnb we thought it was an old farm house that we would have to make do but it wasn't like that, this house had everything we wanted and much more. Everyone in my group was very pleased with everything this house had to offer."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent place to stay for a large family or group. Good hosts
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the 3rd year we have rented this beautiful farm house for a girls craft weekend! We LOVE this house and all that it has to offer! And DeAnn is always very welcoming to us coming early and leaving later :-)
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a great day! Beautiful porch!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,I was so impressed with the remodeling that has taken place. Very beautiful. My Great Grandfather built the home. My Grandparents lived there for over 50 years. I spent countless hours at the home throughout my childhood. Many great memories during our stay. Very nice to meet Dan and DeAnn. They were very gracious hosts!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband & I took our 4 kids (ages 2-10yrs) for a 5 night stay at Oak Grove. This home & hosts were incredible! The kitchen was fully stocked with condiments, coffee, bottled water & more - everything was labeled for easy finding, too. The beds were comfortable, the bedding & linens were nice & clean - plenty of pillows, blankets & towels. The kids loved the gaming area downstairs & the outdoor activities. This house is fully equipped for families with a baby, as they provide a basket of toys, books, baby gate for the stairs, playpens, a highchair & even baby silverware! If you're looking for a peaceful country home that feels home from home, don't hesitate to book your stay here! We will absolutely stay here again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect place for several family members to gather as we attended our Family Reunion at nearby Germany Bridge Park (which is beautiful by the way)! Ample room for everyone, very comfortable, great parking! My daughter was even able to charge her new Tesla at the home with the new 30amp they just installed at the house! So great❤️. After our reunion we had plenty of room to make a great meal as a family & play games! The fun game room in the basement is so awesome- such a bonus❤️ My favorite was the wrap around porch & drinking my coffee - so peaceful & a great way to start the day!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable, spacious, and quiet farmhouse. It’s spotlessly clean throughout. The kitchen is stocked with everything you might need, and all of the drawers and cupboards are conveniently labeled. We went for the bike trails, and this house is a 5-minute drive to Rochester (Nickel Plate Trail) and a 20-minute drive to Winamac (Panhandle Trail). We had a really nice dinner at Lucrezia’s Italian restaurant in Culver, which was also just a 20-minute drive from the house. Would highly recommend this house."

The house was sparkling clean. Each room was decorated in farmhouse style, with well made and comfy furnishings. We cooked all of our meals in the kitchen and there was never a tool we could not find! We also enjoyed the large fireplace in the living room every night!
Outdoors, our grandson enjoyed running outside and fell in love with the swing!
This was a perfect place for our family to slow down, reconnect, and beat the winter blahs."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cessna House is the perfect getaway if you're looking for an easily accessible country setting in North Central Indiana.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"DeAnn thinks of everything you might possibly need or want during your stay. Hands down the best equipped kitchen we have ever seen in an Airbnb. The popcorn was a delicious touch.
Her communication is responsive and super friendly. My grandkids enjoyed the jet tub and meeting the chickens (and meeting DeAnn's dad, too!). The Wi games were also big hits. Plenty of comfy beds, super clean house, and loads of space. Imagine how much more we would have enjoyed the deck and grill if the weather hadn't been so bitterly cold 🥶❄️🥶❄️. But the big, remodeled farm house was cozy and welcoming. Thanks, DeAnn!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I was very impressed with how well stocked the kitchen was. They even provided fresh eggs from their chickens. The home is decorated beautifully and very clean. I highly recommend this Airbnb and would definitely stay here again in the future.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My hubs was traveling for business, we install custom timber frame structures all over the nation and we stay at all sorts of places. He absolutely loved his stay here, said the only place that came close was our AirBNB in Malibu, CA. He loved it so much he took me on a Facetime tour to show me all the amazing amenities, and raved about the fresh eggs the hosts offered for breakfast one morning. In short, the best Midwestern AirBNB ever!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful weekend we had at this beautiful home!!! So spacious clean, and all the amenities were amazing!!!!

2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic place to stay! Unbelievable how property is furnished.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd time staying here to visit family and friends. We had a wonderful visit and the house is so cozy, comfortable, and accommodating. The fresh eggs from the chickens are wonderful. Thank you again for a great stay!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a cousins get together (half live in Chicago and other half in Cincinnati- a perfect halfway!) this was a perfect house for all of us and our kids! The kids had fun running around outside, playing on the swings watching the chickens, and with games in the basement. The adults loved having a drink on the covered porch and by the fire pit at night (oh and playing WII -oh goodness that was more fun than anticipated!!) We’ll definitely be back, kitchen had everything we needed for a taco dinner for all of us Saturday. Highly recommend this home!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed . Just wanted to relax , cook and explore plethora of things this farm home had to offer like bon fire , bbq , barn, lots of indoor and board games, lovely kitchen with so many supplies.
The house offers the best of everything. It’s a home away from home with so much of space for kids to play around. Everything was so aptly marked for the guests which was quite impressive. The pictures of the home don’t do justice.
What to say about their wonderful hospitality. The host was super responsive and addressed our concerns. We enjoyed the sweet corn ( right from their farm ) offered to us by Daniel. Daniel was super nice and told us about the interesting history of the house. Also helped us fix the wifi issue we experienced.
I would definitely recommend this to our friends. It was not just stay , it was an experience!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the best organized and thought-out Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Labeling everything in the kitchen made our cooking process and clean-up incredibly easy. I had my bachelor planned a float trip through riverside rentals. This house was perfect for a group looking to enjoy day drinking and yard games. Our stay exceeded everyone's expectations.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Will not disappoint if your stay is long or just a short one. Hosts are very friendly. House is very clean with anything and everything you need. Labels on all the cabinets made things so much easier for getting around the kitchen. The grandkids loved the chickens and the swing set in the backyard. Plenty of room for everyone. Must see house in person to appreciate the beauty of it. Very nicely remodeled and so relaxing to sit on the wrap around porch. We are already talking about planning another trip back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"AMAZING!! Pristine CLEAN!! This awesome farmhouse is so perfect & peaceful--just what this group of 10 ladies needed for our Weekend Getaway. Plenty of comfortable sleeping spaces for all of us. The woodwork throughout the house is beautifully done and the hosts have thought of EVERYTHING--if we forgot it, they had us covered. The whole house is labelled so you are not searching cabinets and drawers to find stuff. The location is perfect--secluded, but activities, shops, winery, walmart, and groceries are a short drive. The U-Pick flowers was wonderful!! I just can't say enough about our weekend and the comfort, cleanliness, communication, and friendliness that was shown by DeAnn and her family!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the Cessna house for a long weekend as part of a larger family reunion. This house was perfect for our multi-generational family, from 2 to 72! Comfortable beds, quiet places to escape and plenty of room to spread out. Games in the basement kept our 5 year old entertained AWAY from the TV! Lots of space outside to run around, feed the chickens or roast marshmallows for s’mores. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, peaceful place to enjoy the country."

Our kids are so happy, my husband is in love and wants to buy the property.... This property has completely inspired us. We feel like we finally found the perfect place to stay after coming down to Culver/Rochester over the last 4+ years."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our group had a great time at the Cessna house! Plenty of room for everyone, and stocked with everything you could need - from games to kitchen items. Kids loved the huge yard and the swings, and seeing the chickens roam around. We took canoes and kayaks down the Tippecanoe River one day, which we would recommend! Hosts were super helpful and responsive - thanks again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,No suggestions.Everything was amazing.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not do this place justice. It’s much bigger in person and so nice and open but still hidden. Hope to go back with a bigger group.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful. Big nice yard and the chickens come for a visit. Everything in the house is labeled to help out. Very clean. Would definitely rent this place again
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Amazing property. Hosts were perfect.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just finished staying here for the second time: and we'll probably come back again one day, because we can rely on the Cessna House at Oak Grove Place to be everything an Airbnb should be. The house is spotlessly clean, the hosts are extremely responsive (they live right next door), and there are a lot of nice extras like the farm-fresh eggs they provide when you check-in and the chickens that wander the property. Check-in is a breeze, they just send you the code and you type it on the keypad.
It's not the most exciting part of Indiana, but we were able to do an aggressive tourist schedule that involved visiting the nearby cities of Wabash (site of a 1826 treaty between the US govt and Indians and the first city with electric lighting), Marion (hometown of Garfield creator Jim Davis), Peru (home to a US Air Force museum with Cold War bombers), Kokomo (where the first car in America was built), Logansport (nice hiking trails along the river), Warsaw (a beautiful city between two lakes), and a few others, all of which were within a 45 minute or so drive. We even took a day trip to Indianapolis, though that was a 2 hour drive one way.
Of course if you just wanted to relax inside your entire stay, the house is great for that too. There are a million DVDs and the internet connection is good."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is spacious, family friendly, has every extra touch you can think of, and the owners have thought of everything to make it a relaxing stay."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have become regular guests of the Cessna House. Daniel, Donna & DeAnn are wonderful hosts & have thought of literally everything! This house is beautiful, big and very warm & homey.
They have thought of everything, all we need is right there! The grandkids absolutely love the lower lever game room,board games, along with the outdoor area, complete with tether ball, swing set, fire pit, deck and bbq grill."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the house it was amazing and very cozy! Would definitely recommend such a wonderful home!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home away from home was the perfect place to gather to welcome the newest addition to our family. It was the first 4 generation union and a perfect place to relax, feel at home, celebrate, and spend quality time. The hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating and the home was so comfortable and clean and had everything we could possibly need. We had great communication and accommodations while still having privacy. This home has so much charm and character and is rich in history. It was fun to read about this preserved and beautifully restored home. I plan to visit family and friends often and hope to stay here again. Thank you for providing a high quality home away from home in Rochester."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and couldn’t have asked for nicer people! They were so accommodating and helpful! The house was absolutely amazing and the game room downstairs was a blast! We will definitely be going back.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautifully restored home, with so many immenities offered along with a very clean and cozy environment. As soon as you walk in you feel right at home. The hosts are very accomidating, friendly and available. The kitchen is meticulously labeled so you can find everything and the cupboards are full of extras. We love the downstairs game room with pool table, fooseball & shuffle board along with chess/checkers & many board games. It offers a fireplace along with cut wood for the winter days and fire pit, swing set & tether ball for warmer weather enjoyment. My family loves the Cessna House. We have our 3rd stay scheduled for spring break."
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This charming home was one of the best places we've stayed at. It is beautifully redone and had plenty of room for everyone in our 7 person group.
The master suite was absolutely amazing! Not only huge, but it had a private bathroom with a deep jacuzzi tub that melted all my stress away. The beds was comfortable.
Our family had a blast playing the Wii, watching movies from the very large selection. The table in the dining room was perfect for family dinners and board games. We also spent a lot of time having friendly competitions of pool, foosball, checkers & shuffle board.
All the thoughtful things the host did just put it over the top- from farm fresh eggs in the fridge to the beautiful Christmas decorations & tree to the firewood ready and waiting for the beautiful fireplace.
Daniel was sweet man who made sure everything was right for us. We were all enchanted with our stay and are planning on returning!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Daniel’s place was perfect! The home is so clean and decorated so well! Everything we could possibly need or want they have. The beds are comfortable with cozy blankets. There is plenty of space. There are games, books, a game room, and we loved having a wii tournament.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The organization in this house is unmatched. Everything is labeled (cabinets, drawers etc.) The way the house is et up with supplies everything is right where you expect and so easy to find. They have eggs from their chickens in the fridge, coffee, little cereals and tons of other stuff at your disposal. They have a grill and everything needed for any sort of cooking. Although we didn’t use any there are two fully stocked fire wood piles for the indoor fireplace and the outdoor fire pit. The games available at the house is such a great touch. So many game boards, Nintendo Wii, shuffle board, pool, foosball, washers etc. 4 bedrooms with all nice size beds and 3 showers is another great feature of this place. No one is on top of each other at all. Big finding room table and endless places to sit whether you’re indoor or outdoor you pretty much can always be comfortable. My friends and I will definitely be using this place again! My favorite place that I have ever stayed at using Air Bnb"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, thanks for having us"

Beautifully remodeled & a recreational room with pool table, shuffleboard and fooseball. The kids had a great time. Big yard and also a fire pit. We have adopted this as our new home away from home."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Being city-dwellers who needed a break for some fresh air and wide open spaces, this property was just what the doctor ordered and exceeded our expectations.
The huge backyard gave plenty of space for our three young children to run around chasing chickens and burning energy on a swingset, tetherball, woods to explore and (add-on) bounce house. The fire pit was excellent and i spent hours every night watching the sun set and playing old honkytonk tunes on the acoustic.
The house was great, warm, well-stocked and comfortable. Can't wait to come back next year.
Thanks Daniel and DeAnn."

A sad time for sure but having this place to gather and celebrate Dad’s life was perfect. The place is always impeccably clean, they have everything you might need including both a gas and charcoal grill, which we took advantage of this week. The team is very quick to respond to any questions. We also love the fresh eggs and enjoyed the fresh picked sweet corn dropped off by Daniel. Thank you all so very much."

On top of the fantastic accommodations, they also had drawers in the kitchen clearly labeled and a whole packet for visitors to review should they want to know more about the area."
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Best Airbnb I've ever stayed in! The pictures dont do it justice. It was an amazing home and the scenery surrounding the home was very beautiful! Communication with the hosts was great they responded quickly and efficiently to every question i had. The place was so clean and we loved the thoughtful touches throughout. This home really exceeded our expectations and was perfect for our group.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Very spacious house in a quiet country setting with nice amenities. Host was very responsive. Would definitely recommend to book this place.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was one of the best airbnb's I have stayed at, the property was amazing! Everything was clean and felt very at home. Wish my stay was a little longer!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this massive house at the last minute, and we're glad we did. Despite being enormous, it was immaculately clean. Despite being an old, historic house, all of the appliances, bathrooms, and fixtures were brand new and up to date. The fridge was stocked with basic food (including farm fresh eggs from the chickens that roam the property) and the kitchen was stocked with all the cooking utensils and tools you can think of. There were also a lot of thoughtful touches like games, books, and toys. The backyard is huge and contained, among other things, swings and a tether ball. This house could easily and comfortably fit a large party, and having it all to ourselves made me and my wife feel like the king and queen of Indiana. Overall, this is one of the most remarkable properties we have ever stayed at, anywhere in the world."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice large house with a lot of thoughtful touches
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great country setting with all of the amenities! Three great porches for morning coffee or cooking hamburgers outside. The house is close to Walmart, Kroger, and downtown!
The Superhost responds quickly to questions.
Always a 5 star when we stay here...."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Staying at the Cessna House was a very relaxing getaway. Being surrounded by fields of corn and soybean was a refreshing switch up from the droning mundane routine of the city. Daniel was also a very helpful host, he checked up to make sure we were doing alright and also left a list of local restaurants. Overall a great stay and I would highly recommend to people looking for a peaceful getaway."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family this was our second stay here and we will be back!
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Best experience from an Airbnb ever. Everything you could possibly need.
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed for a work trip with multiple crews. Daniel's place was amazing all around. We even had a guys truck break down and they even lended a hand and offered their supplies and time to get him back on the road for work. We could never appreciate them more than any place we have stayed for work trips in Indiana! We stay for a week at a time each week. Beautiful historical home in a country setting to relax after a long day of work. By far the best yet!! All around!!! We will be back any chance we get as long as they have us!!
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"First ever airbnb and it was great, felt like home,host was great. definitely recommend it and will definitely be back to this place soon!!"

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Cessna House is top notch in every way! The location is in a quiet, rural area. Great for a peaceful vacation, but only five minutes away access any supplies you may need. The house itself is an historic older home that has been completely renovated with modern amenities without losing its charm. We had five adults and five children ranging ages 16 to 7. We were very comfortable and the pool table, foozball table, and shuffleboard game are a definite plus!
I give this destination my highest recommendation!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is amazing! Wonderful and beautiful space; impeccably clean; So much room and amenities to offer guests. The house was easy to get to and was exactly as it was described. Our only regret is we wished we’d had more time at the house to enjoy all it had to offer.
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at The Cessna House for Thanksgiving. There was plenty of room for all of us. The kitchen worked great for fixing Thanksgiving and it was nice to have the extra sink in the laundry room to help with dishes. It was good for Dad as well. He managed the three steps like a champ and having a bathroom on the first floor helped a lot.
We hope to schedule a long weekend in the spring so we can take advantage of the fire pit!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house. Great location will stay again.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great! Beautiful scenery, clean, great amenities. The host was wonderful and very responsive. Will definitely book again if we plan to come back to the area! Thank you!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Large, beautifully restored farmhouse on expansive acreage. The house is immaculate, with nice little touches like farm fresh eggs in the fridge. The hosts are nearby and very quick to respond with any question. Whether you have a large or small group, Oak Grove provides a welcome respite from the city."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"THIS. WAS. AMAZING!
Daniel and his family are the most amazing and hospitable people we've met in a long time.
The peace that their listing brought us was tremendous, and we honestly didnt want to leave! 5 stars is honestly not enough to rate them!
We ate awesome eggs, enjoyed campfires, and sleep in wonderful rooms! There's nothing like it!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful home. It was such a great homey experience staying st Cessna House. Everything was so clean and new, especially the bathrooms. We really appreciated the snacks and breakfast items that were left for us to share. It was the perfect spot to stop on our way from Evansville to Notre Dame to see a game. Everything was as advertised. The restaurants, that were suggested by Daniel, were awesome. We ate st the Evergreen and Mikey’s. We will definitely be back!
Thanks
Linda"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was wonderul! Exceeded our expectations! Will definitely stay again the next time we are in Rochester!
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautifully renovated farmhouse. Our group loved being able to relax in the country. Our host stocked the fridge with milk, OJ, farm fresh eggs, water, and there was cereal and coffee available. This was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated! There was a huge table to play games and a big tv with a large selection of movies. Three full bathrooms was a luxury and one even included a spa tub. The kitchen was well equipped and I loved how everything was labeled. It was well stocked with utensils, pans and dinnerware. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!! Far exceeded our expectations!!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Oak Grove Place (Cessna House). The house was spotlessly clean and organized. We had plenty of food stocked in the refrigerator (which was really wonderful, Thank you !)
We really enjoyed the house and surroundings. We would highly recommend this house to others.
Thank you again for giving us a wonderful place to relax and make memories."
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Daniel is an excellent host and his home is amazing! Everything we needed was provided and the fresh eggs and snacks were a nice touch. The place was very clean and very comfortable!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place !
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our very big family stayed here for a Culver Academy graduation. The reviews are true! This place is beyond exceptional. Check-in was a breeze and Daniel was very quick with his responses. The descriptions of the property was also very accurate and the location was also very nice. The entire house and property was very clean, the house smelled very clean and welcoming. All of the beds were comfortable and all the linen was very clean and smelled great. There was not one fault with the cleanliness of this place. There were so many amenities provided that we didn’t want for anything for our comfort at all, they thought of everything. We would recommend this place 200 times over and we plan on staying there again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is absolutely fantastic and could not have asked for better hosts. Our family plans to go back next year and hopefully many more to come! We give this one 10 stars!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great family friendly home! The place was spotless with everything and more we needed. The bounce house option was an added bonus for our family. Book now you will not be disappointed!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is wonderful! It was so clean and inviting. A piece of Indiana-Americana history! There were all kinds of games and activities for us and our grandkids who were traveling with us. They had food in the fridge, coffee choices and fresh fruit. Very comfortable and homey. I wish we had planned to stay there longer. We would definitely come back if returning to this area."
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you want somewhere with lots of room for a large group this is definitely the home to rent! It has been so beautifully restored and updated that it has an elegant but very welcoming and homey feel to it. It's close to many small towns in the area, yet out in the rural peaceful countryside. The hosts are thoughtful, friendly, and helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed. This has been our best Airbnb stay yet!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and spacious home. Very accommodating and fully stocked. Easy access from the main highway, quiet and with a great yard and views. Daniel was great and a very friendly host."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oak Grove Place is a lovely country get-away. It is large and spacious both inside and out. It was very neat and clean, and had all sorts of special amenities, like farm fresh eggs in the fridge, plush rocking patio chairs on the front porch, and beautiful views across the fields. My wife and I grew up in a rural setting. And Oak Grove Place was a wonderful return to all those feelings and memories. The owner was very kind, friendly, and helpful when we needed him. Check in was super easy. And we had all the privacy we were looking for in a country setting. Our stay was just the sort of quiet and restfulness we were looking for. We were able to find classic town diners and burger joints in downtown Rochester in the evenings -and ice cream shops too! Will definitely return in the future. A perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay. The house was immaculate when we arrived. Check-in was easy and communication with DeAnn and Daniel was very easy as they were very prompt with their replies. The house had such a wonderfully relaxing, cozy and peaceful atmosphere to it. Everything was labeled clearly with great directions and we found everything we needed when cooking meals in the fully stocked kitchen. The beds were really comfortable. Overall, a fantastic place to stay and we are already planning on coming back again."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to get away
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful! It’s the perfect place to get away from city life! The deck is wonderful and it overlooks a big green beautiful backyard with big fields behind it. The house itself clean and welcoming... and gorgeous! So historic and lovely! Loved the farm fresh eggs and breakfast options! We had a blast playing shuffleboard and pool downstairs during the rain, and soaked up the sun and privacy outside when the weather was nice. There’s a fire pit, with everything you need to get it going so bring stuff for s’mores! Great for a big family or a couple just looking for some peace and quiet. We had a wonderful stay and hope to return again in the fall!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far our best house rental experience. The house felt very cozy, not like a rental property. Everything was very clean, it was very spacious and worked out perfectly for our trip. Thank you for a great stay!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing Place to stay. 5 stars all around
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is am amazing place. It was so clean and had absolutely everything we needed. We were truly pleasantly surprised at the home. The pictures on line do not do it justice. Just beautiful. The beds were comfortable, it was quiet and we just totally felt at home there. Our family came in from Florida, Missouri and Wisconsin to celebrate our mothers 90th birthday and our parents 70th wedding anniversary. It was a great place to hang out and have very special family times together as our parents house is too small to accommodate such gatherings. Thank you Daniel!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house. Well stocked. Great place to stay.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a great place. Modern, spacious, and very comfortable."
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The ""Cessna House"" is a wonderfully remodeled historic farmhome in a beautiful quiet setting. We loved everything about it - it was perfect for our 'wedding party' family members to all stay together. Even had time to enjoy some rousing games of pool and shuffleboard downstairs. Comfortable, quiet sleeping, great amenities and kitchen supplies - everything just went smooth as silk. We would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking for an AirBnB in the Rochester area."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To say that we enjoyed our stay here would be an understatement. This house is amazing and the owners have so many little things that make it even better. Everything is labeled in the kitchen, the master bedroom had 2 pack and plays set out after telling them that we were staying with our 1 year old twin girls. There is a firepit and grill in the back yard. The house is amazing, we had our local family over for dinner and they loved the house too. Please, please, please keep this house on the market so we can keep staying here on our yearly trips back home."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"An absolutely stunning place. Fire pit out back for sitting around and relaxing or roasting marshmallows. BBQ outside with choice of gas or charcoal. Pool table with shuffle board, an array of board games, dvds to watch. Two fireplaces, kitchen with plenty of items to cook with, fresh eggs from their chickens, other items such as coffee, sugar and creamer, juices etc. nice big dining room table, home with character. Beautiful wrap around porch. Absolutely stunning and relaxing. Highly recommend."

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I had a wonderful experience at Oak Grove Place! Since our dad moved into an assisted living facility in Rochester, we’ve had to stay in hotels. This is a way better option for us. Four sisters, four bedrooms, three full bathrooms...perfect! We didn’t cook anything but the kitchen was nice and big. Extra clean house, awesome. We can’t wait to come back when it’s warm out and take advantage of the porches, deck, and fire pit. Thanks to Daniel for everything, especially for plowing the driveway!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loads of kitchen supplies, good movie variety, good wifi, super clean, and quiet location."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had such a nice stay at Oak Grove Place. The updates to the old farmhouse make you feel right at home. The pool table in the basement kept the kids busy and the fireplace made the living room cozy.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful peaceful country setting, great hosts, exceptionally clean!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel's family was a pleasure to interact with and made sure everything went perfectly. The house is just far enough outside of town to be a quiet getaway, but close enough for easy access to stores and restaurants.
The kitchen, bathrooms, and living spaces have all been nicely renovated and updated. Some of the original farmhouse features have also been preserved, such as the pocket doors to the front seating area and much of the woodwork around the house. There is a roomy deck and backyard with a grill and fire pit which would be enjoyable in the warmer weather. With the amount of space in and outside of the house, Daniel's place is a great option for families. Daniel's family also left some delicious farm fresh eggs from their chickens.
Highly recommended and in my opinion a much better value and experience than staying in a motel in town. I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in the Rochester area."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a solid Airbnb! True hospitality that was appreciated. Lots of nice little touches made us feel right at home for our short stay.
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our paintball team decided to stay here instead of a hotel this year for a local scenario event. I was very skeptical of an Airbnb because we’ve never stayed in one. From the moment we walked in, all doubt was erased. It was beautiful, clean, and felt very welcoming. Everything we needed was there. We were able to come back after a long day of playing and cookout. Having a washer and dryer was another awesome touch. We will definitely be back!"

The hosts are very welcoming, helpful and responsive. This was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting family in the area."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a three day weekend with a couple of friends. Dan and his team were extremely quick and easy to communicate with and were flexible on specific requests. The property is huge, beautiful, and clean inside and out. A lot of porch space for hanging out outside as well as a large lot with a fire pit in the back which we used all three nights. Wi-Fi worked well. Overall it's a great property with great hosts."
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was absolutely amazing the pictures do not do it justice, it’s huge! The front and back patios were an awesome place to hang out, and the house had a bunch of extras. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area, and it’s very close to the river. The owner was very nice and accommodating."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully renovated house with so much character! The house was very clean, and everything is labelled so it is easy to find what you need.

Not only was the house great, but they also went above and beyond providing home grown corn from their family's field and fresh eggs. We will definitely be back!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The home is awesome. Really a homey and quiet setting and relaxing in the country if that’s what your looking for. The house has been updated inside and looks and feels comfortable to stay there. Our family enjoyed our stay at the Oak Grove Place this 4th of July weekend. Owners very nice and communicated with us. I would recommend staying there.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I cannot speak more favorably about Stephanie‘s cabin and her hospitality.
I loved the cabin and I love the fact that I had access to an onsite garage, especially as it was bitter cold.
The place was clean and buttoned up. It was very comfortable and seemed like all guest needs had been planned for.
Stephanie and I have some mutual local friends. They all spoke so highly of her that I felt like I had known her all my life.
I have a high school reunion coming up next fall and I will guarantee you I will be staying right here at Stephanie‘s cabin.
Any guest that is looking for a comfortable quiet Airbnb anywhere in the area should check this place out. Pretty special."

Within walking distance to Willie and Red's and Abbotts. Loved it and will happily stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I were traveling and while eating dinner we decided to look for a place to stop for the night. I found Michelle's place and sent her a request. It was the first time I ever requested a stay for the same night and Michelle responded almost immediately. We were only about an hour and a half away and she had it ready for us along with clear and easy instructions. We had a long day on the road and felt right at home as soon as we walked in the door! She had everything we could have needed and the house was very clean and cozy. 5 star stay for sure and I definitely recommend to anyone

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to settle down for the week while working in the area. It’s always nice to break up the hotel stays during the week. The home was great. The style mimics my house so it was perfect. The king bed was surprisingly comfortable. I stay in hotels every week so a comfortable bed is very important and rarely found.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay in Hagerstown at one of her locations, I love it. Anytime that I’m visiting that area for work.
