2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. This may not mean much to anyone else, but one thing I really appreciated was the blankets. They had so many plush blankets in the linen closet, folded neatly, and they were freshly washed. My kids didn'tbring their blankets and that made our stay so much more comfortable. You could tell the quilts on the beds had been washed, too. That is a big deal to me. Everything was labeled and organized. Like other reviews stated, we had a plate of fresh cookies when we arrived. That was a very nice touch. The only thing is, I didn't realize this was basically a guest house. it is on the property, at the end of the driveway of a larger house. We still had privacy and enjoyedour stay, but It made it a little confusing to find in the dark."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were up there to pre-fish for a tournament and wanted to stay on the lake,but it was overpriced/booked. Found this place and thought it might be too far from the lake, but it is an easy 12 min drive to Lincoln Landing. The house has a carport that will fit 2 boats with power poles under it which was nice since it was raining while we were there. When we entered the house the host had left us some homemade chocolate chip cookies, which were delicious. We left for dinner and when we returned the power was out, but the host left us a battery powered lantern and a note saying Alabama power will have it back on by 9. The place is clean and great, The host is great, we will definitely be back next time we are up here fishing."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This could not have been a better stay. Victoria and Tom are fabulous, attentive hosts. Their home is much larger than the photos show, and much more beautiful than the photos show. Their sunflower theme is charming. Perfect kitchen to cook. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood with families. Safe and secure. Short distance between the parking and the entry door, so luggage and my ‚Äútraveling library for work‚Äù were easy to manage. They are smart to provide a local channel in addition to streaming services, as a traveler needs to know the status of local weather, at times. They provided games, cards, books, welcome snacks, coffee, tea, and more. I highly recommend! Thanks, Tom and Victoria! Our staff will be back to work hard and rest well again. You‚Äôre fabulous hosts!"

The next day Jackie & John showed up delivered one of her homemade pound cakes and mowed the lawn. The home is decorated beautifully, the accommodations and d√©cor helped us to relax. The home is stocked with amenities which added to our comfort. The children enjoyed playing in the huge backyard. There's plenty of room for everyone to sit on the front and back porch while taking in the view of the well-manicured lawn.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fantastic! My new bride and I came straight here after leaving our wedding, wanting a place to slow down and unwind for a bit before getting back into the swing of things. And that's exactly what we found. The house is an older home, but completely updated on the inside, with classy furnishings and a cozy environment. The kitchen was well stocked with the utensils you'd need to cook pretty much anything, and there are even some ingredients already available, including snacks to tide you over until the food is done, haha. The stay was lovely, and the small personal touches, from the flower petals on the floor to the chocolates on the bed, were beyond what we expected. We cannot recommend Miss Jackie and Natalie's Place more."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jackie is an excellent host. Communication was great. She provided us with a list of sights to see and things to do. Her home is beautifully decorated and has all the amenities. We highly recommend staying at Jackie‚Äôs home if you are in the area. We will stay again when in the area.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jackie‚Äôs Place was everything we could‚Äôve asked for. Beautiful home with everything that we needed. She even left some snacks that were very much appreciated. The entire house was very clean. Not too far from a Piggly Wiggly where we were able to pick up some groceries. She was excellent with communication and readily available if we needed her. Loved our stay here and would encourage others to stay at Jackie‚Äôs if you‚Äôre in town.

Our first experience with airb&b did not disappoint! This place was amazing in every way!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The only thing I hated about this reservation was having to leave. This home was everything described. Very clean. Very quaint. Very private. Very beautiful. It was a surprise birthday getaway for my husband who is an avid fisherman. He received an unexpected birthday greeting that put a huge smile on his face and having access to the water, he was in pure heaven (as was I). This is definitely our new home away from and staycation being that we are not far from home, but felt so far away. Can't wait for our next visit. Perfect place! Perfect hosts!! üëåüèæ"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying solo was a wonderful ""retreat"" at Jennifer's place. She had the kayak ready for me, and it was easy to get it in the water from the ramp. When I arrived on Friday there was a muffin and a selection of delicious tea, and I snuggled up in a cozy blanket to watch the sunset on the dock. Can't say enough about my stay, it's clear how much she does to make it a serene and beautiful experience. And, when you check out, the only thing you have to do is your dishes! This stay was my best Mother's Day gift yet."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent Airbnb! I highly recommend it. It was clean, neat, and well organized; it had perfect lake-front views, lots of activities to choose from, but it was also very restful with wonderful peace and quiet."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay was great! Jennifer was extremely responsive, and was willing to help with anything we needed during our stay. Definitely worth every penny."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came for the Talladega race. Jennifer was absolutely amazing and the place was so peaceful, beautiful and perfect. The beautiful view of the lake sitting on the sofa looking out the window was breathtaking. We even got to see an Eagle flying which reminds us of God's strength and protection. Isaiah 40:31"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay and as amazing as our first stay was, this one exceeded any expectations we had. Jennifer and Terry have thought of every need you could have. The peace their home emits is actually culpable. Pulling up in their driveway feels like coming home. They work hard for their 5 start rating, and it is very well earned."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with a beautiful view!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a peaceful lil place. Really enjoyed the views and the calmness. Instructions were clear and accessible. No complaints at all!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful ‚Ä¶..
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time at Jennifers place. This is such a relaxing place. It was cold and windy while we were there but I was just fine looking out at the beauty of the water and relaxing on the couch watching movies and escaping life a few days. This place is well accommodated and very affordable for people on a budget like me. This maybe out getaway spot for sure. Jennifer and Terry are super nice host.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ç

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a little weekend getaway with my fianc√© and this place did NOT disappoint. It was very clean, peaceful, and the perfect mini vacation. The hosts also left blueberry muffins that were delicious and we very much appreciated it. We had so much fun and the place is incredibly cozy. We are already talking about our next stay here! Definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was so private and peaceful. Although it was attached to their main living quarters, you had no idea they were even home! The kitchen was fully stocked. I chose this location for my boyfriend's birthday getaway and we walked into the kitchen, she had left a bottle of wine and a cake with a ""Happy Birthday"" tag. I thought it was an incredibly sweet gesture!! The instructions were very clear and precise about location, how to check in, and how to operate certain things within the home. It also needs to be noted the amount of time, energy, and the gathering of information it took to make the very impressive book she made with all the local favorites. And the bed....soooo comfy! The view from our bedroom was absolutely beautiful üòç It was veryyyy cold outside during our stay, so we weren't able to use the outside amenities, but we definitely plan on coming back during the warmer months. Thanks again to Jennifer and her husband for such a beautiful, clean, and peaceful place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, cozy place to get away from the chaos of everyday life. Beautiful view of the water. We hope to go back when it is a little warmer so that we can enjoy the water more. We enjoyed our time there!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing but great things to say about this place. Beautiful views of the lake. It was cold so we did enjoy the fire pit each night. Next time I definitely want to try some lake activities. The place was as described and very clean. The owners stay out of the way, but were very responsive with a couple of requests I had. I highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A pit stop with a BEAUTIFUL view!!!! We were on our way to the blue ridge mountains in GA and this place was the perfect stop along the way! It was an anniversary trip and there was champagne waiting for us in the fridge - so thoughtful! The place truly has EVERYTHING we needed and a beautiful lake view. We slept great and felt it was very clean. Thank you for such a quick and easy stay.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this at the very last minute and Jennifer was so awesome and accommodating! The apartment is lovely and in a beautiful location that is so peaceful and quiet which was exactly what I needed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find, driving up to Siestas and Sunsets, we could not believe what a fantastic location we had found. The whole experience that Jennifer has created with the amenities and decor together with thoughtfull touches make this a lovely place to be. Jennifer is a very responsive host and the check in was easy, once settled in we looked through a very useful information folder with lots of recommendations for activities and places to eat. Our only regret is due to our schedule we could only stay for two nights, i would have enjoyed taking one of the kayaks out or even going for a swim. Thank you Jennifer and it was a pleasure chatting with you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If there‚Äôs only two of you this is a real gem: well appointed apartment overlooking Logan Martin Lake with amazing sunsets. The hosts made us feel right at home - responsive when needed but respecting privacy. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a place in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was by far one of our favorite places we‚Äôve stayed! Our hosts were super accommodating and the place was absolutely amazing! You can‚Äôt beat the location and the view! Definitely recommend!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice place to relax!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terry and Jennifer's place was quite the find on the lake. We were looking for something for a fishing tournament that we were in and found this lovely space to stay, accommodated with so many amenities to make us feel right at home.
They thought of everything, from yoga mats to outdoor fireplaces, hair dryers, iron, and everything you could need in the kitchen. The place is so cozy and well decorated. And the views are impeccable.
They were very responsive to our questions answering immediately when needed. We hope to come back again ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a small oasis away from the busy day to day! The views of the water are breathtaking, and you can see it while laying in bed. One of our favorite spots was the porch swing on the pier. We‚Äôve never been anywhere so clean and felt so warm and cozy as soon as we stepped inside. Jennifer and Terry were great hosts that were available anytime we needed them. They also thought of everything you could need to have in the space, including cookware, dishes and beach towels. We were also very impressed that they had kayaks we could use on the lake, which was such an added bonus to enjoy. It was hands down my favorite thing to do and wished we would have gone kayaking each day of our stay. They have a gem of a place and we hope to be back again. We can‚Äôt thank them enough for a truly unforgettable experience to enjoy the beauty of Alabama!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect! We have stayed at many AirBnb places and have appreciated the uniqueness of each. But this, this is a spot like heaven on earth. We sat Friday afternoon on the dock until the sun set and then enjoyed morning coffee on the lakeside patio. Watching the birds fly and the fish jump was so relaxing. If we hadn't had planned things to do in the area, our weekend would've been complete hanging outside there. The apartment was lovely with amazing views of that lake. Slept comfortably, the shower was exquisite, and our sweet hosts even provided coffee and muffins. While we didn't get to kayak as planned (we had a packed schedule), Jennifer had everything ready. All in all, wonderful hosts and so grateful they share their home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Sunsets and Siestas! It was beautiful! The view was so peaceful, the apartment spotless and well decorated. Jennifer left us two delicious looking muffins and had an assortment of teas to choose from. Terry and Jennifer were quick to respond to our texts and very accommodating! We loved exploring the lake in their kayaks, and enjoying the view from the porch! I would definitely stay again and recommend this lovely spot to others!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Such a hidden gem. If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful, quiet getaway in the most gorgeous location then look no further.
We were intrigued when booking because of the amazing reviews as well as the phenomenal photos. It was even better than we expected! So clean, pristine even. Jennifer is so accommodating and even left out fresh muffins for a warm welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen (pots and pans, utensils, etc.) so that we could enjoy our own cooking. The sunsets are unbelievable and we couldn‚Äôt wait to wake up and drink coffee on the porch every morning.
We genuinely hope to be in the area and to stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My boyfriend and I were so grateful to vacation in such a beautiful setting! It was absolutely lovely being on the river. We were very comfortable in this Airbnb, and the unique floor and tasteful furniture and decor made it feel welcoming right away. Having the grill was a great addition to the more limited (but still serviceable) kitchen. The outdoor furniture, kayaks, and fire pit definitely expand your options here. Jennifer and Terry communicated very promptly and were easy to talk to. We would gladly stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was absolutely amazing for what I was looking for. Relaxing and beautiful sunrise and sunsets.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I came for a girls getaway weekend and wanted to be lizards in the sun, and found Sunsets and Siestas.
Jennifer and Terry were absolutely amazing hosts. The space was beautiful - so clean and with a breathtaking view of the lake.
The bed was incredibly comfortable, soft blankets in the living room and bedroom, and the waterfall shower was the best shower I‚Äôve had in a LONG time. There were plenty of dishes, which I always find a plus in Airbnbs.
They had a binder with local recommendations, so we didn‚Äôt have to think too hard about where to have dinner!
We texted asking about kayaking and they got PFDs and paddles ready for us quickly! Finally, Terry came and helped up build a perfect fire. It was a great way to end our little getaway weekend.
I can‚Äôt wait to come back for a weekend with my boyfriend!
Thank you to Jennifer and Terry for such a great space."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second visit to Siestas and Sunsets in 2023. Another wonderful experience. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute slice of heaven! Property is so beautiful and peaceful. Their home was beautifully decorated and clean!!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! The apartment was spotless clean & beautifully decorated. Jennifer & Terry have everything you need for a wonderful time! We took the kayaks out and had an absolute blast. Terry helped us make a fire one night & it was so relaxing to sit by the fire & make s‚Äômores. I also recommend packing a book to read on the covered dock. It‚Äôs obvious how intentional they are about giving guests privacy, but they were also very responsive. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again to unwind!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ralph‚Äôs place
From the moment we drove up, we knew this place was special.
There were Wrens bouncing in the trees & Red Headed Woodpeckers eating. Whether lingering on the porch, sitting in the den or lounging in the bed the view of the lake is spectacular. The apartment is clean, bright and very nicely decorated. Jennifer & Terry invited us into Sunsets & Siestas with many personal touches that made it feel just like home. My husband & I wanted somewhere to rest & that is what we‚Äôve done all while watching & listening to the birds & sounds of lake life. The hosts were a delight to meet. We look forward to returning! - The Harveys"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don‚Äôt think we can put into words how perfect this place is. A little spot of heaven alongside the water. Such amazing and helpful hosts!
We made a last minute swap in our plans and changed to come here. Best decision ever, everything from the lovely muffins awaiting us on arrival, being able to Kayak and relax next to the fire pit.
We hope to return on our next trip back to the states! Thank you so much again"

Everything was so well thought out and creatively beautiful, simple but just right. The sunset was truly amazing, and the siestas wonderful, the bed was extremely comfortable. Jennifer was gracious, kind and thoughtful, and we felt so welcomed with the special touches. It was a great spot to get away for our wedding anniversary. My husband and I both loved it and also really enjoyed kayaking in the afternoon (somehow Jennifer also managed to order up some fantastic weather for us, even in February!) It was close enough we also enjoyed the views and hiking at Mt Cheaha, so we managed to enjoy both mountain and lake for our weekend away. I can see why Jennifer is rated as a Super Host, she really is! We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would enjoy returning someday."

The quarters were closed off from the main house so it was completely private. The hosts were friendly and their dog Elvis often greeted us in the driveway.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have so many compliments for my hosts Jennifer and Terry! First, they managed to give me the privacy and quiet that I needed along with responding quickly if I found the need to reach out to them‚Ä¶ quite a balancing act! They are each beyond extraordinary in their hospitality!
The home is lovely, clean and well equipped with amenities. The first morning that I woke up at Siestas and Sunsets, I heard a few snow geese flying over the lake, while the water gently lapped the shore and dock‚Ä¶ I thought I was waking up in heaven‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏èü¶¢ü¶¢ü¶¢üõ∂‚ò∫Ô∏è
Beautiful place, very relaxing. Do yourself a favor a visit with them!"

The basement area is so well done, comfy bed & they've thought of everything you could need for your stay. As a previous host, I'm always looking for ideas for future homes & they thought about just about everything. This place is legit the dream!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular view, great get away spot all the amenities you could ever want or need with out the headache of trying to think of what to bring.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Picture Perfect!
The sunsets alone are worth the visit, but when you tie in the perfectly put together apartment it truly makes this a gem of a stay.
The apartment has everything you will need and more! They didn't miss one detail when creating this space and it feels very private along with a perfect lake view from every window.
The check in was simple and Jennifer was amazing with communication and accommodation of our stay. Even left us a beautiful card and bottle of wine for us to enjoy on our first family vacation with our newborn.
Fire pit was stocked with wood and only needed a match to start, charcoal grill ready to be lit, and kayak ready to ride along with all vests and oars ready at hand. They even had a yoga mat available for those tranquil morning sunrise stretches that you only see in the movies.
Truly a gem of a stay and we will most certainly be back to enjoy again!!!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay with Getaway! Hosts were extremely helpful and responsive. Nice walking trails. Private and secluded cabins on the property. Everything you would need for indoor outdoor camping was available. Nice pup treats as well! We would stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful find. My husband and I enjoyed staying at this location and will definitely book again when we are in Alabama. The host gave clear instructions and we had no need to reach out while we were there, which we appreciated. Thank you to The Getaway for a beautiful cabin that fit all our needs for the 5 days we were there."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone was respectable. Very clean. The streets were very rocky and narrow which was the ONLY negative thing I have to say. Overall, it was great! Will definitely go again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a well needed get away. I‚Äôve have so many people ask for the booking info since I posted about my experience, I can‚Äôt wait to book again ü•∞."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin in the woods was an excellent getaway. The large window faced a lovely wooded area and was quite private. However, you are not strictly alone in the woods at this location. There are in fact approximately 30-40 seperate cabins that are seperated by (in our case) only about 150 feet. While the windows were mostly not facing the other cabins, the feeling of the location was more of a nice and secluded homey trailer park, rather than a by-yourself-in-the-woods getaway.
We especially enjoyed the vibey radio/bluetooth speaker and used it extensively.
The kitchen was a bit lacking. No toaster, oven, or freezer, which was a bit unfortunate as it was difficult to cook much.
There is Wifi, which worked wonderfully. And there was also a small book of 150 card games with detailed rulesets! We especially enjoyed playing cards (which were included)
This was not made very clear, but the food items on the bar and the fire supplies are not complimentary, and you will be charged extra."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Will definitely be back! Such a beautiful place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Enjoyed every moment of it. The name speaks for itself it is a great getaway.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, beautiful stay! What a lovely little space, truly chic for such a small space - perfect for an intimate couple or for a pair of best friends. My travel companion and I stayed two nights, made a fire, cooked a meal, and dedicated time to a healing journey on our road trip retreat through the States. This space served us in all the ways we needed and we loved the little touches that helped us feel at home; like the tea, smores bag, and just how intentionally everything was set up. Highly recommended!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay this year. Our cabin was different from the last time so we only had the one bed. Again I wasn't disappointed, waking up and raising the blind to the huge window was amazing! We actually had deer one morning to watch, incredible! The cost to stay at the cabin is awesome and yes you do get more than what you pay for."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most relaxing and peaceful stay in our own slice of luxury heaven! The photos certainly do not do the cabin justice! In person, they are bigger, cleaner, more luxurious and so much more comfortable than we could have imagined. We went on walks every day on the beautiful property and even managed to run when we felt like it, as the roads and pathways are in pristine condition. There are local recommendations, extra items to enhance your stay (from insect repellant to smores kits) and the cabins are kitted out to meet any and all needs! We 100% recommend this stay to everyone!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The only thing missing is the banjo music! lol! This place is great for unplugging and getting away from the world. Just the basics and nothing more. Loved it and will definitely be staying here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet and peaceful night stay with our pup- which was exactlywhat we were looking forüòä. The personal touches and gifts they supplied were perfect.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway for couples. Super cute cabins (great touches like s'mores kit, firewood, coffee, and tea.) Relaxing and peaceful. Favorite food places: Lickin' Good Donuts, Giovanni's (Pizza), and Tokyo Sushi and Hibachi. Drove an hour to Cheaha State Park (Definitely worth it!) Absolutely beautiful! Majestic Caverns is a very short drive as well. Will visit again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying at Getaway. It was extremely private and peaceful.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend to recharge on my own. I ran and walked the nearby trails and enjoyed the fire pit in the evenings.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I have stayed at epic airbnbs all over the globe and this one is definitely up there on the list. It took me by complete surprise as it is in the middle of nowhere Alabama. They have everything you could ever need in this cute little tiny home - even things you didn‚Äôt think you needed or wanted! There is no mirror over the sink or on the wall so if that is something you need, make sure to bring one with. This seemed to be an intentional part of the design and experience which I quickly came to love. I appreciated the thoughtfulness surrounding rest and time in nature so much! My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt stay longer."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful serene little Getaway!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay for the night, I wish I could have stayed longer! Super peaceful, clean, and private + felt protected with the other cabins in the community being there. Definitely will stay here again if I‚Äôm passing through the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and quiet. Amazing place to decompress & unplug. I really enjoyed my 2 night stay but I wish I stayed longer. I will say that once you turn into the campsite, the gps will make it seem like you are lost but all you have to do is follow the signs in the road and you will eventually run into your cabin. I Highly recommend this stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely recommended, in the middle of the forest. With fireplace, very relaxing!"

Waking up next to that big window every morning in the middle of the wilderness, was something I could do everyday. Heather at this Outpost was in constant contact with us and making sure our stay was going well! The AC was out, and they went out and got a state of the Art cooling fan to accommodate us the same day before we arrived! Definitely a big shout out to Heather, a great employee!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would 10/10 recommend this place! Can‚Äôt wait to plan our next trip back.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely worth every penny spent! So relaxing and quiet. Beautiful views out of the windows! Great communication from host and very clear instructions. Would 100% recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing getaway! My Fiance and I will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently stayed at this lovely small cabin and had an absolutely wonderful experience. The host was incredibly prepared and had the kitchen fully stocked with everything I could possibly need, including individual oil packets for cooking. The cabin itself was breathtaking, with a giant window next to the bed that provided an amazing view of the sunrise and stars at night. We were nestled on an overlook and saw multiple deer during our stay, which was a great bonus. The location was quiet and secluded, yet still close enough to stores for a small grocery run. I was particularly impressed with the included amenities like wood, firestarter, and a smore kit, which made the trip feel extra special. The cleanliness and attention to detail were exceptional, with everything individually packaged. Overall, I had an amazing experience and would highly recommend this cabin to anyone looking for a peaceful and memorable getaway. We will be back for sure!!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay. I Will definitely be staying again. Kitchen has everything you need for your getaway. The night view......omg. and one of those nights the moon was right outside our window. The only issue was the shower head :( it was hard to shower because the shower head is 8 ft high and it was not adjustable. So to my girls that don't want their hair to get wet. Bring a shower cap. So i literally had to shower with the door open to keep my hair from getting wet. Other than that everything else was perfect. I just know next time bring sneakers and shower cap.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had I known how much I was going to love this cabin by the river, I would have booked at least two nights instead of just one. What a gem this cabin campground is! It was a travelers oasis for us this time but we will need to make it our destination when we come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our window faced the river, so we were very lucky. We particularly enjoyed the design of the window in our cozy little cabin. The shower was only five minutes long, so it was a good challenge for us. (Although i really think It would be better to show it in the introduction of the amenities.)
Despite some confusion and concerns, we still had a great time during our stay. We loved looking out of the window and enjoying the peaceful view of the riverside.
We are excited to try out other tiny cabin from getaway‚Äôs in different states during our next trip."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay!! Will definitely be back again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place too unplug, unwind, and rest when traveling. Clean and comfortable for 2."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was so much more than we expected! Quiet and peaceful weekend. They thought of tons of small little details. The bed was comfy, the directions were clear on how to get there, plenty of firewood. The whole weekend we kept saying we couldn‚Äôt wait to come back. 10/10!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was a great get away from the hustle and bustle!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"a very beautiful spot out in the woods, very limited service so if you are not looking to disconnect i don‚Äôt suggest this particular area. Overall the location was beautiful they had a hiking trail for the quests that was just beautiful if you wanted to just stay at the cabin for the day. I was thrilled with the stay it was so beautiful and i highly recommended this spot for anyone who just wants to be out in nature and disconnect especially for the price. They have made such a beautiful spot and i can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place was great and everything we could've hoped for
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a great stay! Easy to find, great location, very quiet and relaxing. Check in was easy and when I had a question, they responded quickly. The cabin had everything we needed. I would highly recommend staying here."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great spot that was exactly as described.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was probably our favourite Airbnb, it was so peaceful, the hosts are super communicative, and the signage around the property is clear and easy to follow.
The cabin was clean inside and out (no weird smell that people keep mentioning), not close to other cabins, and was equipped with everything (except microwave). We were beyond happy with our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I decided to do a weekend getaway together. The place was quite and intimate and allowed us to disconnect with the stress of everyday life. If you‚Äôre looking for a weekend getaway I highly suggest it. Just pack your own food to cook all weekend so you don‚Äôt have to leave. They also have a campfire and provide a considerable amount of firewood complimentary
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. Beautiful, secluded location."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very quiet and peaceful. loved the big windows and outside fire pit.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my cabin, it was perfect!! The lot was beautiful and secluded!! The cabin was clean, bed and pillows were so comfy. It had everything I wanted and more. My favorite feature was the big window, I did not want to leave!!! Definitely will be back!!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would recommend! What a great experience! Wonderful for reconnecting with eachother or just with yourself.
We loved our stay at our cozy and cleverly designed cabin! Well equipped yet super minimalistic. Everything you need within arms reach. All without skimping on comfort.
Everything else is thought off too - fire pit, smores, hot chocolate, deck of cards - the Getaway experience lets you focus on you and your company and the trees around. Suggested activities and games are great for those restless among us! üòâ
The kitchen, though tiny, works great. Bathroom is super clean and great shower head.
The area is pretty - perfect for a long walk or some playtime. You won‚Äôt even have to leave the park. Some cool local stores (a great fabric store!), great nature and the pretty river all provide plenty for a small getaway.
Neighboring cabins seem close but you hardly see any through the trees and you won‚Äôt hear anything but the trees and the wind. You feel safe yet secluded."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a quiet stay and peaceful. The room smelled funny but you get use to it. I wish I was told I wasn‚Äôt getting a lake front cabin like the photos show or I would have rented a different location but enjoyed my stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 recommend. SUPER nice, love the simplicity of the designs, very intentional with using the space wisely. Love the personal features, kids activity & crayons, s‚Äômores kits, fire supplies, stainless counter & drying rack shelves, etc. LOVE the bed window feature, pull-down shades, and quality bed, etc. Exceeded our expectations. Modern, comfortable, functional, & aesthetically pleasing."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a nice getaway. It's perfect for couples who want to take a break and get away from it all. I will be returning. Everything was as pictured and described.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a great place to getaway and relax! They thought of everything! The cabin was extremely clean and neat. It was the little touches that made a big impact! There were books, cards, and even an activity sheet, that made the transition into being off grid really easy. There were supplies to build a fire and even optional s‚Äômore kits available. It was quiet and felt safe."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Highly recommend staying here.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was my second time staying and they even accommodated a Friend staying in a cabin close to us. Since I was working in the area it was great. Love the fire wood was supplied because we cooked on fire pit for dinner.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible experience. Blown away by the quality of the cabin. The cleanliness and amenities were awesome. Really impressed by the kitchen too. A lot more room in the cabin than you would expect, but we spent most our time outside by the picnic table and around the campfire."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Much better than a hotel, served its purpose as a place to rest after long days at a medical course."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a lovely stay. The space is small, but perfect for a couple's getaway. The firepit was particularly nice."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome experience! We absolutely loved our stay, we'll definitely be back again soon. Much needed rest and relaxation. Very peaceful, tranquil setting, we loved the attention to the little details and the use of space and simplicity of it all. Definitely worth every penny.."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The folks at Getaway communicated with us very well about any questions we had before and during the trip.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was exactly what I expected. A clean, quiet, and comfortable getaway from reality. A great place to unplug and unwind away from the hustle and bustle. The nature trail was a great addition to the camp ground feel of this place and the views were great too. I will definitely be coming back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best weekend getaway with Getaway Cabins. It was so relaxing and peaceful. We woke up and saw deer every morning right out of our window! The walking paths were enjoyable as well. It was a beautiful location. The hosts did not bug us once, but were available at any moment we needed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to another stay in the future"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at the getaway! It was a little crammed for 2 people and 2 large dogs. Perfectly matches the description. I asked for more firewood, and they brought it to our site while we were out hiking. Nice & peaceful"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved it here. It was beautiful and a wonderful place to spend our first anniversary together! I didn‚Äôt see the menu for the charge of items in the cabin until after we used some coffee and tea bags. The menu was hidden above the fridge. Just make sure you know it‚Äôs not free. We added like $40 to our tab due to not knowing, the logs said it was included in our stay but charged $8. Oh well, no biggie. Just be aware! Overall we LOVED OUR STAY. We are coming back very soon. So cozy and unbelievably clean."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice concept. Somehow I did not know this was a group of 26 units until I arrived on the property. Perhaps it was something I overlooked. Regardless, they were spaced a nice distance from each other, with plenty of distance to feel private and uncramped. Several of the units over look the River. I‚Äôm not sure there is an option for specifically choosing one of those. Would be nice if there is."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Getaway was relaxing and peaceful. The perfect place for a quick weekend getaway!

Spot: Beautiful and serene, with some great trails.
Service: Hand-written note when you walk in the door with smore's ingredients."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here on the first two nights of our honeymoon. We chose the Getaway because we wanted a quiet, private spot where we could spend time together without a lot of distractions. We can‚Äôt say thank you enough for the beautiful, peaceful and relaxing stay. The cabin on wheels was very clean, minimalistic, and inviting. Our hosts provided everything we needed. It was private and quiet the whole time we were there. The views out the wall-size window above the bed were amazing and we didn‚Äôt complain about not having cell service or WiFi because we were able to focus on spending more time together. It‚Äôs an oasis just 20 mins from townü•∞"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time at a Getaway outpost and it was amazing! It was beautiful and peaceful and exactly what I needed. Fair warning, they‚Äôre not kidding when they say that service is spotty. I have Verizon and had 1 bar 99% of the time. So if you need music or videos etc. for your time, make sure you pre download it prior to your trip. All that being said, I had everything I needed in my little space and quickly fell into my own rhythm while there. I was there alone the entire time and felt completely safe. 100% would recommend!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The only bad thing about where we stayed was our driveway. It was very narrow than the others and pit holes by ours. But other than that it was an overall perfect experience! My husband and I have already started at looking at these for our next place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and relaxing. A perfect spot to stay overnight as we continued the rest of our trip the next morning. Every detail was thought through and the coffee was delicious!!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful experience! So peaceful, and beautiful! We loved the location."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect getaway for my husband and me! Their attention to detail was impressive as we had everything we could need. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We found this place last minute. We were worried they wouldn't have any availability as it was Halloween after all. They were quick to reply and give directions. We'll likely book again as it was better than the photos.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for our 1 year anniversary. It was very quiet, very clean, great stay"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was so beautiful here that I wish I was able to stay more than one night!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I loved the cabin! The bed was very spacious and comfy. The big window view was great. Only thing is we were really looking forward to making a fire, cooking dinner over the fire, and making smores. Unfortunately we could not because there was a fire ban."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed two nights in cabin Tola. We were very pleased with everything. The cabin was spotless. I'm very picky when it comes to cleanliness, and I was very satisfied with the entire setup inside and outside. I was also very impressed that our host kept in contact with me from the beginning of our booking until after we had already checked out. I highly recommend Getaway Talladega Valley located in Childersburg, Alabama!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Everything was great. Will most definitely recommend and most definitely will be coming back and I can‚Äôt wait.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was lovely, the rooms are nice and cozy with a nice, large bed. The water pressures was great in the shower and I love that they provided firewood for you to buy without any hassle. They also provide amazing, high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The nature trail was also extremely nice and I would definitely recommend this place as well as return again in the future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at our Getaway! Loved the accommodations and the set-up!
We look forward to visiting the other locations in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my best friend took this trip as 2 new moms who just needed a break to breathe. It was so cute and cozy. The provided firewood and fire starter was great! We LOVED our stay and are already planning to make it a yearly thing. The service is very spotty, with verizon I had a handful of places that could send and receive messages so it didn‚Äôt bother me. The drive to get to a walmart or good restaurants was at least 30 minutes but that also didn‚Äôt bother me. Last the sink water got very hot but the shower did not. But overall 10/10 I will recommend this place to anybody!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great spot. I had to be in Sylacauga for a few days and this was the perfect place to stay. The bed was comfy and the big glass window had a beautiful nature view which was very peaceful. I also walked down the road to the nature trail to hang out by the river for a bit. It‚Äôs probably about a 10 minute drive to town which was convenient. My favorite part was that all of the firewood and starters were included so I could have a fire every night. I‚Äôd definitely come back to stay here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it. Like camping but with a comfortable bed and electricity. It had everything we needed. Would stay again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed at getaway to celebrate our anniversary and had the best time. It was so nice to unplug and reconnect in nature.

I would highly recommend getaway for your next stay as we definitely plan to come back soon!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Extraordinary place to stay where you can just reset and relax in the nature. Getaway makes it possible! The window view is so amazing and the fire place very special. We had a perfect stay and would love to book again.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was amazing. Easy check-in, beautiful scenery, and the complimentary firewood and s‚Äômores was great! I have no complaints! It was exactly what my husband and I needed. No service and to be out in nature. The huge window looking out into the trees was nice to go to bed and wake up too. The place was very clean and new. The bed was super comfy and they gave us everything we needed. We definitely plan on visiting again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could rate higher than 4 stars because the Getaway cabins really exceeded my expectations. I loved how peaceful the surrounds were and how the layout of the cabin was. I visited the cabins with my boyfriend, so we had both of our bags/luggage, and we were able to store everything without feeling cluttered. The fridge kept our food at a nice temperature. The cabins come equipped with A LOT of amenities, literally everything you could need, the only thing that was missing was a grill brush, but there was aluminum foil under the sink so we were still able to use the grill. The hosts are super responsive, we called ti get instructions to our specific cabin and they answer the first time and helped direct us even though we were sent a map. I 10/10 recommend esp if you are thinking about coming with your significant other. I can‚Äôt wait until we come back! Thank you Getaway for such a great experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little get away
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was there alone with my dog ( by design) , Gypsy loves being in the woods and so she gives her 5 star approve l‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Getaway was a great mini vacation for my best friend and I. The drive was easy and finding the location was easy as well. We did arrive an hour early and the Getaway was able to accommodate us and let us into a cabin which was awesome. The cabin is very tiny but very clean. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was nice and hot. They provided us with free firewater and fire starters (we did not end up using) but it was a nice touch. I did email the staff to ask for two more towels and they were very responsive and accommodated our request quickly. Overall this is a great place for a weekend getaway where you want to disconnect and spend some quality time with friends or family. Oh! We were able find breakfast foods, grocery store, Walmart, and a local tattoo shop (Lola Rose) for some spontaneous best friend tattoos. :) Everything was very close and convenient. I will definitely be back again but next time when it‚Äôs cooler so I can enjoy a nice campfire. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing. Easy check-in, beautiful scenery, and the complimentary firewood and s‚Äômores was great! I have no complaints!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little cabin! My husband and I visited on our way to Taladega speedway as part of our mini moon and this cabin was the perfect quiet night away. Peaceful, safe, and so quaint. We arrived just after dark so didn‚Äôt make use of the free firewood or s‚Äômores, but they were such a sweet homely touch. The bed was super comfy, air con and heat was easy to use as it was a little chilly on arrival. We had a little bit of phone signal, but were excited to listen to the local radio and play card games all night. The view of the forest from the huge window was beautiful to wake up to. The only thing I would say is the angle of the shower head wasn‚Äôt great, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and the water was just hitting me straight in the face haha! Best air bnb we have ever stayed in, every last detail was had been carefully thought out, down to tampons in the bathroom and citronella scented body wash to keep the bugs away! 10/10!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place was everything I needed it to be and more for a fun getaway for my husband and I! Perfect for couples that want to reconnect or solo if you want a reset. It is very clean and new and has thus far been maintained really well. I cooked two meals inside. They supplied the things that they said they would as far as kitchen items. I brought my own of everything (just in case), but they had quality pans and knives. The on-site nature walk was fun and easy, definitely not a strenuous hike, but nice and relaxing. The built in radio inside was a nice touch. Shower is tight and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, but very clean so not a problem. It was too hot for us to want to make a fire, but the instructions say not to gather wood for fire. They provide wood in a bin next to the fire pit, but it also says it‚Äôs for purchase but doesn‚Äôt say how much it is or how you are charged for it. I wish that was more clear, I would‚Äôve messaged if we wanted to actually make a fire. 10/10!! Will definitely be back!:)"

We couldn't have gotten closer to what my Marines, and I wanted to do. Absolutely no complaints, and I would gladly use this rental again. We had a blast, thank you again, Michael."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin in the beautiful woods! We loved sitting on the porch and enjoying our coffee , listening to the rain on the metal roof.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful handcrafted cabin (we stayed in #4) on the Pinhoti trail overlooking gorgeous hills. It‚Äôs a 30 minute drive from Cheaha mountain and 5 minutes from a gas station. There is a train that whistles but it only added to the charm for us. Dee Dee was very responsive, and they also offer firewood for sale at an affordable price. A little slice of heaven!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay & plan to return. It's practically new, spotless, nice linens, furniture, & cozy. Cabins are situated such that you have nice privacy & the road/parking areas are clearly marked/easy access. There are places w/in the retreat to walk & explore. Also, a portion of Pinhoti Trail is w/in walking distance for a more challenging/longer hike (check AllTrails app). We loved the picture wall that showed/explained where much of the wood to build the cabins came from! We stayed during the winter, so w/ all the fallen leaves, we enjoyed the many ridge-line views. Nice sunrises on front porch & sunsets on back porch w/ plenty of seating options. We had 2 minor hick-ups, however the hosts were super friendly & promptly available to assist us. Seeing the numerous trains pass through during the days was quite interesting, but they can be loud during the nights if you are a light sleeper. Earplugs are in the nightstand drawers. Cell service can be spotty depending on your provider."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location of the cabin was very relaxing and loved how close it was to the Pinhoti trail.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved it! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay. Very very clean. Beautiful cabin. Bring hiking shoes for the trails. Some of them are difficult. The train does come by at night, but it didn't bother us. Great place to enjoy relaxing and family time. They have really put a lot of time and effort into making it a beautiful place."

The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice as it was beautiful! My only complaint would be the train that comes through every couple of hours. Luckily it only woke up our kids once so overall, not a problem!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful cabin in the woods close enough to the creek to hear it from the balcony. Very soothing and restorative. The sound of occasional trains going by were a nice touch, too! They were close enough to hear but not so close as to be a nuisance. Will definitely be back!!"

Dee Dee I‚Äôd AWESOME!!!! Definitely be back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful cabin, would stay again!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"The cabin and surroundings were beautiful. It was clean and inviting. Only downsides were the roads, lighting, and trains. The roads are gravel and steep. Not ideal for luxury cars. Perfect for trucks. SUVs or jeeps. The lighting in the parking area could have been better, really dark at night. Maybe, could use some motion lights in the parking area. There are motion lights on the cabin but the lighting does not reach the parking area. The train situation is what it is but there were trains moving all night. The cabin had the perfect decor for the surroundings and the showers are large. The beds were comfortable. The host was quick in responding to questions. I would return in the future and I would recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a nature scene."

so nice. The surroundings were beautiful. We had such a great time we have already booked the cabin (#2) for the fall.
It rained most of the time we were there but it didn‚Äôt matter,we made the most of it and had a grand time!
Dee Dee was a perfect host and worked with us so we could check in before the storms came in.
Thank you for that!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place this is!! The cabin was lovely and clean and Dee Dee was so responsive and helpful. There are so many beautiful hikes in this area and watching the sunset from the deck was one of our favorite things. We had lots of small kids in our group, and the kids enjoyed running in the yard and throwing pine cones in the creek. Dee Dee also had some fun games and books that the littles enjoyed. We had a delightful time staying here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay. The cabin was amazing in an amazing spot. It was so great to be able to jump right in the Pinhoti Trail and get some Hiking in. Sunrise point that is on the property is a straight up hike but it is well worth the challenge to see the view. We will definitely try and come back to these cabins for a stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful cabin in a lovely area of Alabama. We did some of the suggested hikes to waterfalls.
Only downside was the train whistle during the night, but was fine with earplugs."

The kitchen had everything and the beds were so comfy. Everything was clean and we felt right at home. We will be back for sure and want to bring friends with us since it's a beautiful retreat. Dee Dee was great and friendly. Can't say enough about how great the cabin and our experience was!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We recently stayed at this Peaceful Cabin Retreat, and it was the perfect getaway for Thanksgiving. The cabin is secluded tranquility, and it‚Äôs rustic but not roughing it. The view from the spacious wrap around porch is breathtaking. The cabin is well-maintained and clean, and the host was very accommodating and responsive to our needs. The cabin is equipped with all the necessary amenities, including a fully functional kitchen, comfortable beds, and a cozy fireplace.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! We had an incredible stay at Dee Dee‚Äôs place and will for sure be back. Adorable cabin with plenty of space and gorgeous views.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anything that we needed they were right there. Did everything that we asked them too. We needed some tables and her husband went to the church to get us more. We put the trash out front and he came and got it. We had a campfire down by the lake that was so nice and the kids even got in the creek. We really enjoyed ourselves.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem!! Very beautiful and quiet!! Trails around the property are great hiking and walking!!

We loved it here and hope to come back some time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny cabin was great! It was very clean, quiet, and peaceful. We especially enjoyed the Green Egg, the clean and cozy cabin, and the peace and quiet out there.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cody's place was great! Every detail was thought of and provided for, including some nice extras. There was a cool, rainfall shower head feature that was a nice touch. A big one for me is a comfortable bed and the one I slept in was. He also didn't require a ton of extra clean up as we left, as some hosts do. Plenty of space to turn a boat around if you're in town to fish."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place to stay. Cody communicated very well. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the shower, it‚Äôs the type that is a rainfall shower or whatever but the little directional pointers shot water everywhere and weren‚Äôt aimed in the same direction. The first night my wife and I didn‚Äôt get good sleep due to some kind of rodent in between the walls scratching around. It was private and we enjoyed seeing the farms close by."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cody was extremely responsive when I asked questions regarding the tiny home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It‚Äôs far enough away from the city but not too far away from stores and activities. I would definitely recommend this cabin to a friend.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The cabin is beautiful and so are the surroundings. We sat outside and just listened to the birds singing around us. It was so peaceful. We ate at The Back Porch and enjoyed our meal. We toured the Grist Mill and Covered Bridge, The Cheaha Mountains, DeSoto Caverns and the Blue Bell Creamery. We had a wonderful time. Cody is a great host and always answered any of our questions in a timely manner. Thank you for helping us to have a great 4th anniversary!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a baseball tournament. Super cute and cozy. Quiet and secluded off in the woods. Had a great experience.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the tranquility of this place. We came in after midnight from GA. We thought this was absolutely wY out there in the country when we woke up I went to the Gas Station and dollar store 5 minutes away.
Long and short this was a wonerful duccluded cabin with all the Luxury you could imagine. WiFi; Bluetooth; complete Kitchen with coffee. Everything was Perfect. The cabin specifically mad our trip special."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Often I travel for business and I like to stay in a place that is away from the event venue so I can recharge. Cody‚Äôs place is a nice little cabin about 13 miles from the Talladega CMP Park and SuperSpeedway property which was perfect. It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful.
We arrived well after dark about 10PM and the cabin is off the Main Street. To get to it you have to drive down a small road that makes you think you‚Äôre driving onto someone‚Äôs property. That‚Äôs OK because Cody responded immediately to our text when we asked about it.
Would I recommend it? Absolutely! My only hesitation is that if I do it might not be available the next time go back.

The water in the lake was down (rented in March) so it was difficult to get the kayaks in and out of the water but the host, Roxanne was very responsive and said that yes, she and her husband are thinking of building a ramp with a pulley for the months that the water is low.

It's a short drive to reach stores, but far enough away from everything to feel like a retreat. I was staying there alone but felt safe and secure in the area. The house is beautiful and exactly as pictured with all the amenities. From the first night, It felt more like home than just an empty house. I kept accidentally referring to the place as ""home"" while I was staying there! The owners communicated with me to offer support and were very responsive to my messages. I highly recommend and would definitely stay there again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay October 20-22, 2023:
I rented this lake house for my wife's birthday weekend. One of the best vacation rentals we've had the pleasure of staying! Roxanne was an excellent host. The house was very clean, no weird odors, etc., the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed and more! There were plenty of snacks, a full assortment of condiments and spices, cooking utensils and even cupcakes that we really appreciated!
The location is very rural in a slough on the lake; however, it was extremely quiet for us and we did not see another person other than some fishermen in their boats in front of our pier in the early morning. We really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and viewing the beautiful nature. The fish were jumping in the early morning and early evening, geese were flying in out of the cove, squirrels in the trees, and their was a large blue heron that we watched in the morning from the deck. Overall this was an excellent experience for us. We will be back!"

When I say spotless, it was immaculate. Lots of extras to make sure you‚Äôre extra comfy. I was pleasantly surprised at how many goodies were left. Fresh fruit, delicious muffins, and lots of drinks. Felt very private and convenient for my pups. Dog bed, treats, bowls included. I‚Äôll be going back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great escape. The location on the water allows for easy access to the main channel, yet is tucked away on a quiet slew. The space is open and the bedrooms nice sized. The beds were extremely comfortable. The property looked as the pictures described. The host put a lot of thought and effort into making sure creature comforts like toiletry samples and other thoughtful items were provided. I even had a birthday surprise as the host knew I was coming to celebrate my birthday. The hosts took time to put together a handy information packet and the sunsets on the deck are some of the most beautiful lake sunsets I‚Äôve seen. This place truly is a treasure. It felt like we were staying with family. (The kind we like üòÅ) We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better experience. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John is a total Rock Star! My boyfriend and I made a last-minute booking at his place. The price was surprisingly reasonable considering what he was offering. John accepted our reservation almost immediately and offered local recommendations for food and entertainment. We arrived late and were delighted at the location, design, amenities & comfort of the unit. I met John the next morning while fetching something from our truck. He offered us sausage, bacon & Irish coffee (to go with the fresh eggs he had left for us) - which he then prepared for us and delivered to our front porch. The 3 of us then spent the next few hours chatting, eating, and laughing. He showed us his home, his property and entertained us with stories from his own crazy, interesting life. We left that day with plans to reconnect again & look forward to seeing him in the future. I recommend his Airbnb without hesitation - he is simply killing the game!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at this Airbnb. We were in the state for firefighter training at the track so we mostly needed a place to sleep and shower. This place gave us so much more. The property was beautiful and so peaceful. We were able to enjoy the hot tub and we had access to the pool, grill, smoker, and the entire back yard. Everything was clean and really amazing. This place works for both long and short term stays but definitely do yourself a favor and stay here long enough to really relax and enjoy it all. It was so nice we really wish we had more time there. John is super friendly and helpful as well. We really look forward to staying here again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was exactly what we needed! It was secluded, quiet, and relaxing. We didn‚Äôt enjoy the grounds as much as we‚Äôd originally planned, but that was because we stayed snuggled up and caught up on some much needed rest!
John was a wonderful host!! He had good suggestions for food, entertainment, etc. We did eat those loaded bbq fries!!
Everything was perfect! We plan to visit again this summer when it‚Äôs warmer and we can enjoy being in the pool or head over to the lake!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Hunters. We did have to work remotely during our stay and appreciated the one work place. Would have been helpful to have another table but we made it work. Beds and linens were comfortable and was refreshing to have towels that weren't thin and worn out from previous guests. Check the kitchenware, several plates, glasses and silverware not cleaned well. That, of course, is not reflective of Hunter but more so the previous guests. Should the cleaning people have to spot check that? I don't know."

2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beautiful location on the lake which was nice. The pool was nice to have as well. I would certainly rent again if available but only on a non-holiday weekend next time due to the higher rate. Very peaceful and the host, Margaret and her husband, were very responsive. The water heater went out on us during the stay but they had it replaced same day (very appreciative of them doing that for us!). The only downside was that the upstairs area/bedrooms were a bit warm and the thermostat was set such that we could not lower it to cool things down. All-in-all, great place to rent especially with the beautiful view."

There is only access through one door at the back of the house, which was slightly annoying but I'm sure there was a reason for this previously. Overall we had a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely stunning property with a very kind and responsive and amazing host!!! Thank you Margaret! See you next time!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed everything about this location.

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host, responsive, polite, and timely!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location and the house was beautiful, so pleasant and secluded. We had 9 adults and 2 kids and everyone slept perfect! My only thing was the amenities that need to be added, the period of stay trash bags are needed more than just the two that was left, more pots and pans are needed to be added especially if have you families who are spending majority of their time at the house! We will be visiting again in the summer so that we can have access to the pool! I will recommend this house to any one who is looking for a spacious and peaceful house

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for a weekend at the CMP marksmanship park and this house fit our needs perfectly. The house was clean, had plenty of beds, a grill, and outdoor seating."
2022-12-01,3.0,Group trip,My only complaint is it was 11-15 degrees the night we stayed. The host had the temperature set at 63. They sat out space heaters and blankets for us to use but they were no help in a house that size. The host wouldn‚Äôt respond when asked if the heat could be turned up.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect weekend for 2 families at a fishing tournament. We had plenty of room and the house was convenient to the boat launch. Having 2 ovens

We will be back this summer to try the pool."

2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Enjoyed our quick weekend trip. Worked out well for our family of 8 that needed a place to stay for a wedding nearby at Mallard Oaks Farm.
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was not clean. We couldn‚Äôt use the pool because of the leaves and debris in it.
We did enjoy the view. The master bedroom bed was comfortable."
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,It was a nice home but could have been cleaner and the stairs and deck were a safety hazard.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All I can say this was a STAYCATION AT IT‚ÄôS BEST! Thank you Lara and Andy!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a wonderful stay, the view is amazing. the owners of this property are very friendly and quick to reply. it felt very comfortable relaxing and playing pool. we do suggest to be very mindful of the driveway when entering and parking, the view from your car is something my to take in."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent house on the river with lots of fun things to do. It‚Äôs in a nice and quiet neighborhood with great views. Kitchen is well equipped. Hosts were very responsive and helpful and didn‚Äôt ask we do a burdensome number of things for checkout.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I loved this property. highly recommend especially if you love nature. Very private and very spacious. neighbors are so friendly. Felt right at home. The view was BEAUTIFUL!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,So beautiful! I highly recommend if you want a quiet get-away with tons of things to do.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Lara‚Äôs lake house is beautiful, clean, and made us feel right at home. The house was decorated beautifully, offered great ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù such as a pool table, ping pong, and a beautiful view with plenty of seating options.
The only discrepancies that keep it from being a 5/5 stars are the driveway grade and the lack of photos and description of the stairs and driveway prior to booking. The driveway is very steep and almost non accessible if you don‚Äôt have a 4wd truck (thankfully we drove our dually), there are a few flights of stairs to go down and up to get to and from the front door. We don‚Äôt require any handicap accessibility, but I am recovering from two pelvis fractures, so it would have been nice to see the stairs in the photos and read that in the description prior to booking. Other than that the property was amazing, clean, beautiful, and Andy and Lara were fantastic hosts. We will definitely book with them again if we‚Äôre ever back in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely house on the river. We had everything we needed for our trip---the kitchen is well stocked and the rooms are comfortable. Communication from Andy and Lara was timely and thorough. The main attraction is definitely the view---just beautiful!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hello, we are a family of 5 from Florida. We did a road trip from Miami to Alabama, and decided to stay in this cabin. The location is great! Not too far from Birmingham and you can travel to Cheah state park in the area.
The view from the cabin is amazing, and the cabin itself is specious and has everything you need.
Compare to other Airbnb that I visited it truly has everything! Towels, shampoo, conditioner ( full size), equipped kitchen with the basics: olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and some other items. There is a pool table and plenty of board games. Fire pit outside and a grill.
Our kids are 12,10,5 and they loved the cabin.
Parking wasn‚Äôt bad at all as other reviews described. I just think that it‚Äôs better to arrive at daylight ( it‚Äôs getting dark at 5 PM).
Host was very friendly and checked from time to time if everything is good.
Highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,I had a such wonderful time at Andy and Lara‚Äôs place. Everything was perfect. The view was amazing. Andy and Lara were very helpful. I will definitely visit again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy and Lara‚Äôs property made for the perfect weekend getaway for me and my two teenaged children. As an architect, I loved the design, materials, furnishings, and decorations. It is a warm and welcoming home. The pool table, dart board, and table tennis top on the lower level were a highlight of the trip. The house is equipped with all the amenities you could need. On discovering that the grill was out of gas just hours before dinner, Andy and Lara had a new tank sent over! The home is super comfy and well laid out, with different areas on each level to hang out. We ate in the dining room one night, had breakfast on the upper porch one morning, and ate a few meals right at the kitchen island on bar stools. My daughter loves to fish and was able to catch a few little brim from the dock. The home itself is a destination, without the need for outside activities, although, we did go for a hike in the Talladega National Forest about an hour away. It was a perfect bonding weekend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Andy and Lara‚Äôs place was great. They are super great host, checking periodically. The beds slept great, everything was clean, and Lara makes sure to provide things you may forget. The view is stunning, sunsets are indescribable. The game room downstairs had our boys entertained all evening. If we are ever back in this area, we will be back. The location is perfect to the city life if you need or want to go eat, shopping, etc. Thank you guys for opening your home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a view. We had a great time.
We spent 3 days exploring Talladega national forest in our jeep and it was amazing.
Highly recommend"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at lake houses on Weis Lake, Lake Harding, Smith Lake, and Logam Martin Lake. This place was a cut above the rest. This was not just another lake house. This was a Lake Home! Had a Great time!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was unique as far as the architectural design. Beautiful waterfront view. A lots of stairs from driveway to house not conducive for one with bad knees. Stairs to home need wood replaced due to weathering. The setting of home in remote dark road could use more landscape lights alone staircase. The strategic design of driveway can cause car to get stuck depending on type. Must instruct rentals to place the car in 1st gear to get up the hill! Overall, a lovely vacation home. Kudos to the lay out.üëå"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience, great stay , great hosts."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. The home is very comfortable and the view is stunning.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Andy and Lara were very attentive and friendly and take care of all our needs!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was spacious and beautiful, tucked away in the side of a hill overlooking the beautiful lake. The sunset was incredible every evening. Check in was simple. Andy and Lara were great hosts and very responsive! We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay on the lake was spectacular! The kids were wore out from swimming & climbing the stairs to & from the dock (good way to get them sleepy!). Kitchen was stocked & bathrooms spotless. Plenty of linens, pillows and great views! The front door sticks really hard, so you‚Äôll need some force. All in all, it was great"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were blown away by this place. The house was lovely, spacious, and had plenty for us to do. We took two teens and one preteen and they had a blast playing pool and darts and swimming in the lake. I highly recommend this for a family vacation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at the lake. We all agreed we'd never stayed somewhere with such a beautiful view. we had 4 adults and 4 kids of all ages and we all had a phenomenal time. From family dinners in the open concept kitchen/ living/ dining space, to playing pool and ping pong, to swimming and sitting by the lake, this home had so many fun things for us to do. We had our privacy but our hosts always responded very quickly and were so helpful.
One word of advice, if you come with kids, establish a rule that they DO NOT touch the alarm system. One of our kids saw the alarm system and thought it was a tv or iPad and tried to play with it and ended up triggering a panic alarm and calling the police. Our hosts were understanding but please avoid our mistake! üòÇ"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing 4 nights stay for my husbands 40th birthday! The house is spacious, with great communal areas to spend family time together. We enjoyed the use of the pool table and darts board. The outdoor area is fantastic with incredible views of the lake and we loved spending time by the water and having bbq's in the evening. We also hired a boat for the day from Poor House Branch Marina which was a good way to see more of the area.
The place is well equipped for everything you might need and Andy and Lara had thought about everything to make our stay so enjoyable. They were great hosts-  responsive and helpful leading up to our stay and during the time we were there.
The area itself is quiet and peaceful. If you did want to venture out then Pell City is a few minutes drive away and we enjoyed a meal at Docks Bar & Grill and also at Shack BBQ (very close to the property).
We cannot recommend staying here enough!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family meets up every year for Fathers Day weekend. We always try to stay on the water somewhere. Once we check in we don‚Äôt like to leave the property until checkout. This was by far the best location yet. Andy and Laura were very easy to reach and perfect Hosts!
The two levels of porches and balconies were amazing. Although we always take our own, the house was fully stocked with anything you could ever need even down to shampoo and body wash. I have never seen a place with so many personal touches everywhere. We cooked every meal there and everything was at our fingertips. The game room was a huge plus for us at night and during rainy periods.
I cannot say enough about the views. Having morning coffee while looking over the Coosa River with my Grandbabies by my side was amazing.
My favorite thing about the weekend was that the TVs were NEVER turned on. There‚Äôs too much fun to be had here. Relaxation and family time at its best!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My family stayed for just over a week and really enjoyed our stay. Loved the lake and the house was very comfortable with everything you would need. Andy and Laura are quick to reply to any questions. Docks in Pell City became a favorite place to eat, as did The Shack which is just down the road. The house is close to enough to Birmingham and Talledega National Forest, under an hour drive, that there are lots of areas to explore. Locals are very welcoming. Just a note- the driveway is quite steep."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love, love, love this lakehouse!! There are really not enough words to express how perfect this place is. Perfectly decorated with gorgeous views from every room. Amazing outdoor spots with lots of seating- porch, deck, and dock. My family also enjoyed the basement with pool table/ping pong and darts. Great kitchen and comfy beds. We will absolutely stay here again next time we visit Logan Martin!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We picked this place because it seemed comfortable and unique. It was both of those. The first floor is 3 bed 2 bath, plus a large open kitchen which is open to the living room w/ TV. The first half day it rained. The kitchen and the living room open up onto a covered porch with 2 big sliding glass doors. So you could be in the house and it was almost like being outside. Very nice. The porch is also furnished and we ate a couple of meals out there.
The adult kids played downstairs. Pool, ping pong, darts and watched some movies. This room is also open to a deck and a swing.
From there you take the stairs to the lake, where floaties, a swing and the lake await you. Of course there was a lot of swimming involved.
The house is nicely appointed. Live plants, comfortable furniture, nice layout.
I cooked five full meals for 8 people. The kitchen had every thing I needed to cook with including a grill. Wonderful place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andy was proactive communicating, giving very instructions information and responsive. The was unique and clean. The pool table/ping pong was a hit everyone. The dock area was a lovely spot to hang out. We would highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Andy and Lara for your hospitality. Great communication and quick responses. Everything was clean and beds extremely comfortable. Loved the layout of the house. A whole game room with pool table and ping-pong table downstairs. House was right on the lake and had stellar views! We would definitely stay here again :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was great! Andy and Lara were very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Hands down the best Airbnb we‚Äôve stayed in! We loved everything about our stay and just wish it would‚Äôve been warmer outside so we could enjoy the water! If you are looking for a beautiful vacation home look no further. The house is very spacious and you don‚Äôt feel crammed even with 8. Andy is extremely responsive and a great host.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful and well maintained. We have three kids and they loved climbing up and down the hill and drinking hot chocolate by the fire pit at night. The pool table, ping pong and swing were also a big hit. My husband and I really enjoyed the view. Lara & Andy thought of everything we might need and communicated to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a great experience and long weekend away for us."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a lovely January weekend here taking in the lake views.
The house was super comfortable, and had all the amenities needed to cook and relax. The outdoor screened porch and decks were amazing. Lots of stairs down to the house and to the water, but both were worth it for the experience.
The internet streamed very fast, and there was plenty of space to spread out and work.
Would love to return on a summer day."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sooo nice, relaxing...just what we were looking for first week of retirement."

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We came down for the weekend for a race at Talledega and enjoyed our time very well! We enjoyed the surroundings and will be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Was looking for a nice relaxing get away before the hecticness of the new year kicks in, and that‚Äôs exactly what we got. Beautiful view and loved having our own dock to fish off of, even took the kayak out for a spin. House was decorated beautifully and loved how big the master bedroom was. We got to enjoy coffee in the porch swing in the mornings and ended the day having a beer and shooting some pool. My only complaint is the driveway was nerve wracking, but only because we‚Äôre not used to driving on that steep an incline. Nice quiet location with everything you could need! We‚Äôll definitely be coming to stay again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and relaxing place to stay!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay - we had 5 women and 5 dogs, so we definitely pushed the limits of the space, but we made it work. The house is adorable, cozy and comfortable. It has a great front porch and backyard. The dogs were able to run around, and the front porch was a safe in-between place for coming and going.
Kinley was super responsive to all my questions and made the stay easy and comfortable. She set up an air mattress for us since we had more people than beds."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect setup for me - I was out before sunrise and back after sunset and Kinley‚Äôs home was perfect for my needs. Inexpensive, safe, secure and quiet. She was an amazing host - always available, friendly, responsive and helpful."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little spot, the host was fantastic and very helpful, and it was pretty close to the Talladega speed way.
only concern was that my buddy is pretty sure he heard a drive by a few blocks away, I can't really confirm if that's what it was, but it was loud nevertheless.
overall had a great stay and would definitely stay here again next time."
,,,I had 4 kid's which were all under 12 & 2 were 7 month old twins. So it's a $25 fee for extra guest including kid's which I didn't mind paying. I just called to get an understanding & wanted to know if I was paying for infants also. Well we never made it that far because she was instantly rude when I called. I guess she assumed that I called because I didn't want to pay but that was not the case. She did apologize after I let her know I'm not being rude so why are you. But I canceled my reservation to stay because if your rude to me as the customer for no reason I definitely don't want to spend my money with you. Overall house was nice & clean but customer service was horrible.
,,,"Every room had a window until running (unlike photos). The patio is totally different from the listing. The pool has no handrail at the shallow end and no ladder in the deep end (unlike photos). Both were gone, w/ the metal left uncovered and jagged in the ground. In the pool on our 1st full day our 7 y/o started saying his hand felt ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and he wasn‚Äôt able to grip. We found there was a low-grade electrical current coming from the edge of the pool. An adult tested the area and felt intense tingling in his hand & the hairs on the back of his arm & neck stood up. The host said they could not address until after checkout. We asked for a 1-night refund of $395 (total was $1,700) to cover a boat rental for the day that we didn‚Äôt have a pool. The host sent $100. She says there was nothing wrong with the pool. We have no reason to lie about this. This host is not going to provide you with an accurate listing, so I will. I have plenty of photos. Don‚Äôt risk it, book with a Superhost instead"
