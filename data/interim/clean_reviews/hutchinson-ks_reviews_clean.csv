2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to find and access to the house was super easy. Very basic furnishings but had everything you might need. I have a sensitive nose, so there was an unpleasant odor throughout the house, more so in the front room and utility/2nd bedroom. They had a dehumidifier in the utility/2nd bedroom. Once it shut off, it began to smell more. The house was not perfectly spotless but was very close to it. Everything worked as it should and no complaints with A/C. The main bedroom was super cute and comfortable and the mattress wasn't bad. If there had been extra people I would not have wanted to be the one to sleep in the single bed in the utility room. The bathroom had all necessities. Toilet was super close to the sink vanity, and the lack of light in the shower was disappointing, but it was PRETTY CLEAN. The floors in the house were uneven and there were step ups and downs in the kitchen and bathroom. Since this place was clean, I would say it was a win in my book."

The living room has two of the most comfortablecouches we had ever sat on. There is a TV and internet, I would recommend bringing a Firestick as there is no cable or satellite. You really don't need a TV while staying here, there is plenty to do, from playing one of the board games to enjoying a nice walk, or exploring some of the museums nearby.

The location is perfect for Main Street shopping and central to Hutch's other local attractions.

We looked at several Airbnb's in Hutch and this is by far the best for location, accommodation and value. You will not be disappointed with this hidden treasure."

We planned to have a very intimate gathering and the hosts were great about communicating their boundaries and helping us to understand how we could go about our weekend. At the last minute we had sickness preventing some of what we intended to do, and they were so understanding about us tailoring our weekend a bit more to what we needed. The house was so warm and inviting, not to mention spacious. It was fantastic for having large family meals together, sitting out back watching the kids play, and staying off of electronics to enjoy one another's company! We appreciated all of the thought that went into the amenities around the barn, and have already booked another stay. The town of Yoder was incredibly friendly as well, and I can't wait to explore a bit more when we return!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Harley‚Äôs place. We were a little nervous about the location as we would be traveling back and forth between the house and the state fairgrounds. However, there were two easy routes from Hutchinson and neither took long at all! It‚Äôs a beautiful location, in the country but still close to town. The house had everything we needed. We loved being able to park our car in the garage and having a washer and dryer to use! We didn‚Äôt cook but there seemed to be all the amenities needed if you did. The beds were comfy and the entire house was cozy and well decorated. My only complaint is that I wish we would‚Äôve had more time to enjoy the big deck and outdoor area. Great place!"

2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better first time experience these guys! All around 10 out of 10! I generally spend 7 to 9 months on the road at any given time frame. Moving from job site to job site and being able to come back to a place that feels more like home and not just another hotel room is worth its weight in gold. The peace and quiet this place has to offer is superb in comparison to the contrary! No awkward elevator rides or sketchy activities going on in the parking lot. Like I said, worth it‚Äôs weight in gold lol! Harley and Becca have been extremely accommodating throughout my stay here. Doesn‚Äôt get much better than this folks!"

The kitchen was fully stocked with anything you would need to make a meal or snack while you are there and the coffee station was perfect for my morning wake-up. The living room was so comfy and inviting, with plenty of space to spread out and enjoy a good book or watch a movie with the family. The beds were so very comfy and warm and the bedrooms were very inviting. The bathroom was laid out perfectly and had a double sink which made getting ready in the morning a breeze, everyone could fit around it if needed. We loved the towels, they were so soft. If you are looking for that home away from home for your next vacation then you have found your place here at the Roundtop Rendevous."

They went above and beyond just to make our stay more comfortable, we had a heating problem and it was fixed the same day, they respond very quickly and address your need that is highly appreciated. It matches the photos and description and is close to a lot of restaurants, as well to Hutchinson Regional Medical Center where we had our training. We loved staying at this AirBnb, will HIGHLY recommend it for anyone coming to Hutchinson and if we are back there, wouldn‚Äôt live in any other place.

He has everything we needed to cook some sides for Thanksgiving. Love that places like Starbucks are within walking distance.

He is very easy to get in touch with but there was no need during our stay because everything was perfect. The house was wonderful! They thought of everything and nothing was overlooked. From the cleanliness and style, to the abundant linens and stocked kitchen - it truly felt as comfortable as home. The attention to detail was evident; comfortable beds, soft linens, plush towels, and the home smelled so good!! We loved our stay so much. It made all the running around that visiting family entails so much better to know we had a great place to return to to relax. We will absolutely be back again.

Curt‚Äôs place worked perfectly for allowing me to work remotely using the kitchen table, cooking during the week and cooking for Thanksgiving. Had a lot more cooking supplies then I‚Äôve ever experienced at an Airbnb. The place was very clean and smelled great every time you walked in.

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older home that has recently been renovated and updated. All the spaces were very nice and the home was clean, comfortable and cozy. It was just a short walk to the Cosmosphere and a longer but doable walk to the main drag. The only negatives were some of the updates were not completed...there weren't too many three prong outlets (laptop friendly), the windows and screens were pretty hard to operate and there aren't any outdoor spaces on the property. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would book again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! I'm originally from Hutch, but my family didn't have a place for us to stay for the Holidays, so we decided to go the Air BNB route instead and this place suited us perfectly! It's small, but perfect for our family. It was very clean and very welcoming, and they even had a few Christmas decorations! The beds were comfy with lots of pillows and a plush comforter. Check in was easy, and we didn't ever need anything so we didn't ever communicate with Briana. The kitchen was completely stocked with all the essentials you might need, including condiments and different things in the fridge. Overall, we would definitely stay here again if needed and would highly recommend it to anyone if you are needing a nice, quiet place to stay while in the area! We've stayed at a few places, but this one is by far the best!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I'll be back for sure! Spacious, great use of space. I brought a white noise machine that I always travel with. I didn't even need the earplugs for the train.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was only one night, but it was comfortable. The bed had a memory foam type which helped with comfort. The bathroom was very clean and the room was clean. Linens smelled laundry fresh but not over-powering.
The listing mentioned the train track, which was fine since it was a vacation-type stay. So that was expected.
Pleasant stay. Thank you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris‚Äôs place is a really great spot to stay at. I really do appreciate the peacefulness and the convenience of the house for what it provides.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean place at a very good price‚Ä¶but the trains do come through in close proximity in the wee hours of the am. Overall not a real big deal unless you‚Äôre a light sleeper.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beware the train. Thankfully I had earplugs, but if I hadn't, the host provided plenty! Very spacious and inviting"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was leery about the train that was mentioned. I brought my own earplugs cause I have special ear plugs. Didn't need them until 2:15 put them in and did not hear the train again until, I think 3:45.
The place was spotless. I was a bit confused with the key pad because I had to press it first to light up.
The tv was easy to understand
We have stayed in a lot of BNB's and a lot of motels. This shower is one of the top showers that I have EVER showered in. 67 years of showering and other than being a bit small this one was great. Wonderful water pressure and great hot water - didn't want to get out of the shower.
I will be back and bring my wife next time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little house. Fit our needs for the weekend. Easy to get to. plan to try to stay again next time we are in Hutchinson.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little spot! Very nice home. It had everything you would need for a stay. Everything was sparkling clean and very well taken care of. I had a small problem entering the home ( I think the heat just messed with the lock) and Chris had me on the phone within 2 minutes of the text I sent. Will definitely book again!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Chris has a very affordable place to stay and it was very clean. However, I‚Äôm a light sleeper and there is a train located very close to the house that woke me up hourly. The hosts provided ear plugs for us that we could have used, which I really appreciated. I didn‚Äôt use the ear plugs, but I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve helped with noise. My husband was able to sleep thought the night pretty well! Overall, please with how clean and fairly priced this stay was."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I had a very short stop here whilst traveling across the US.
Upon entering the place there was a really weird smell, which went away after a while/running the air.
It was very hot inside for quite a while.
The water pressure was GREAT though, the shower was definitely my favorite part.
We didn‚Äôt use any of the kitchen/etc as we were only there for a few hours. Checkout was easy but needed a bit of clarification.
Overall the place was pretty much what we expected with a few minor inconveniences. The trains weren‚Äôt an issue for us, only passed once or twice and didn‚Äôt wake us.
The town is very Kansas-Vibe, which we appreciated as people from another state. It was a great deal for the price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Not my 1st stay. Very comfortable and safe. And affordable! Ty!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was perfect as we were passing through Hutchinson. Close to the tracks, but my partner and I live by some tracks back at home anyway, so it didn‚Äôt bother us. Super clean and comfortable little home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"To be honest, I just needed a place to sleep for the night as we were visiting the college and the price was right. When we got there I was super happy to see how well kept the property was. We were sent the information to get inside prior to our arrival. When we went in and walked around I was very excited to see that this little place FAR EXCEEDED our expectation. Did you forget something? That‚Äôs totally fine because they have everything you might need and I felt much more comfortable there than I ever have in a hotel with whatever is in my suitcase. Quaint little home away from home. Very clean. I will definitely be staying there again. Thank you so much for making our trip down there a comfortable one."

Clean, nice size, and great for us. We are train people so that didn't bother us at all I slept through them easily because of that and hubby is a train fanatic so we enjoyed the walking trail right by the house that allowed us to walk a ways near the tracks as well!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris' place was perfect. I enjoyed a short weekend there for some training and it fit my needs and then some. It's the last house on the road which made it feel private. It was a quiet area and i never felt unsafe. The railroad is next to the house but I didn't find it too loud and was never woke up during the night from one. I actually enjoyed them going by during the evening. The house was very pleasant and had every amenity you could think of. I never cooked there but it had everything you would need to cook a home cooked meal. Shower had good water pressure. A/C worked great. There is a trail at the end of the street that will take you to a creek, nice little 2 mile walk or jog. Overall I was extremely satisfied with this place and would definitely recommend!"

Very comfortable home for my short stay I would gladly stay again if in area
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think this place will be a regular visit !!
It‚Äôs has the feeling of being away from everything ,while in reality,everything is right down the street . There are sidewalks for walks or runs into the city or down a bike trail .Great internet and internet TVs, perfect for mom or baby. Easter was great here !! Although a studio type room setting. It feels bigger and cozy. Great shower and oven for pizza. What more can be said ? Excellent deal for the price and you couldn‚Äôt have a better host. Thanks Chris and Darla !!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay. The place was clean and tidy, the house rules were clear and well communicated. The neighborhood is very quiet, and although there is a nearby train, i never heard it. There were earplugs provided just in case. Highly recommend!"

Clean. Comfortable. Affordable.
The noise from the train was minimal.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cute small house for yourself or a couple, very private and matched the description perfectly."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was super clean and cozy! We will stay again if ever in the area!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The cute little studio was perfect for my husband and I. It‚Äôs close to downtown and to Hutch CC. Something to be aware of if you‚Äôre a light sleeper is the train tracks are very close. The provided earplugs worked like a charm though, and we would stay here again! It was also SPOTLESS and we felt right at home."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Very clean.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The trains are very close, but the host provides earplugs. I sleep heavily and still should have used those. Even with that though, the place was clean, spacious and absolutley worth the price. The host is proactive and friendly as well."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another excellent stay at this cozy house. Chris and Darla are very responsive. The house has everything I need and so affordable. Definitely my first choice when visiting family in Hutch!!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, happy I could have this place to rest and reset after a busy weekend at the Cosmosphere. Would definitely stay again. Bed was pretty comfy, I slept like a baby!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to stay
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is nicely updated and very clean! The pictures on the listing don't do it justice. The neighborhood is quiet and you are at the end of a block so you have adequate privacy. Check in and check out process was very simple. Everything we needed for our short stay was available. The shower is really nice with a dual shower head and very good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The stand up closet that separates the ""bedroom"" from the ""living room"" is really nice too. The price per night is a great deal for what you are getting. Couldn't be happier! Definitely recommend this bnb if you are looking to stay in Hutchinson."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was clean and exactly as described. Beautiful room and it was well furnished. We really enjoyed our stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little house is everything advertised and nicer! It has everything you could need for a short or long stay.
Chris and Darla make check in effortless and they are friendly and available, though there was nothing I needed to ask them for.
It's a great value, discounted I guess (as stated) due to a couple of overnight trains which are brief and no big deal. I would stay again for sure."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great little studio house!! I had a wonderful stay. Very clean with so many amenities and nice touches. The hosts were very good at communicating. Great value and would definitely stay here again!!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Host
Good place to stay"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The location is a bit sketchy, but not really much you can do about it. I did feel safe enough and the amenities were excellent. They even provided ear plugs for the trains, which weren‚Äôt too bad! The interior is lovely and they thought of all the things a guest may need. Only suggestion would be a water filter on the tap, water bottles in the fridge, or a brita filter. I personally don‚Äôt trust the metallic flavor of the water, like well water. Otherwise a fantastic stay!! Thank You!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a cute and comfortable little house! The location was good and easy to find. The bed was comfortable and the shower is NICE! We would definitely stay again!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great little house! We were a little concerned about the neighborhood when we arrived, but we had no problems. Our only real complaint was the bed. It was pretty uncomfortable for 2 people,but would probably be fine for one person. Definitely worth the money."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, quiet area. Really unique Airbnb!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Spend two weeks at the Hutchinson Fire Academy. This place was great! It was a 10 minute drive to the Academy and maybe 8 minutes to the main campus. The neighbors were friendly. It was a nice quiet place to study and lay my head. This place had many amenities, everything I needed and more. The hosts were very kind and curtious. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying at this place. Extremely simple to book, check-in, and check-out of and was perfect for a one-night stay. The only concern one might have would be the train noises, but they were not an issue in the slightest."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to lay our head for a quick family trip. Property is really close to train tracks. Overall it was a great deal! We hope to book it again for future trips to Hutchinson.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is so cute and very clean! The bed was very comfortable. The host was quick to reply to my questions and requests. We will stay again when we are in town.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything was great at the house! Even with the train tracks close by it wasn't that hard to fall asleep. The bed was comfortable and everything worked great! Even though I just stayed for one night it was still a wonderful stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! Everything was clean and functional, the space was very cozy, and the amenities were thoughtful (ear plugs, toiletries, hair dryer, etc). No complaints!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little one all needed
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage. Very roomy inside. Comfortable and well located. I recommend the place . I made sure everything was nice and clean before I left. Including dishes , floor, bathroom etc. the hosts did not ask me to do this, just the dishes of course because it is common sense.
I also put the used towels to wash In The wash machine to help with the cleaning for the next guests. I tried to help the best I could. I was there for studying so I had no much time to enjoy the place since I was all day in college for my Clinicals/orientation.
It was snowing in Hutchinson. It was lovely!
I was there to study for a week and it was a quiet place near everything you need in town. The hosts are amazing and there for you if you need them.
Cute little town. I highly recommend.
Good luck!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as advertised, the bnb offers everything you need while traveling and more. Clean, comfortable and very safe place."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although we were only there to sleep (about 8 hrs), the added amenities provided did not go unnoticed! Love that it‚Äôs on the end of the street. Be prepared for the train, but the ear plugs provided were great!! Honestly one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve stayed at for the cost."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! My boyfriend and I were attending a wedding in town and this place was perfect for us! It is clean, very well kept and adorable. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Train is noisy but the location is worth it. They provide ear buds to block noise. Clean and quaint. Would stay again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved staying in this house! It is so cute and perfect for just me! The house was very clean and I loved how open and spacious it was! The cost just can‚Äôt be beat but it is located next to the train tracks. This is made very clear in the description and the other reviews so it wasn‚Äôt a surprise. I‚Äôve lived next to tracks before so I wasn‚Äôt really bothered by the trains but they do provide ear plugs, which is very thoughtful! It was very much worth the cheap price and I would absolutely stay there again! The neighborhood was actually very quite besides the trains and it‚Äôs at the end of a dead end street so you don‚Äôt have to deal with through traffic."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a great price! Very clean and comfortable, would definitely stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chris & Darla‚Äôs place is a great value! It‚Äôs very affordable and at the same time very clean and comfortable. It‚Äôs in a very quiet, safe neighborhood and just off a nice walking/biking trail. They communicated very well and accommodated my special requests due to special circumstances. This has become my favorite ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù and I look forward to many return visits in the future!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will totally dig this cottage. It's spotlessly clean and located on a quiet street. We felt safe and secure staying here and were impressed with the lay out and comfortable bed! We recommend it!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean! Older neighborhood but quaint little house and quiet- trains come through but we didn‚Äôt notice after first night- host provided ear plugs but we didn‚Äôt use them. Large bathroom and everything provided just as advertised - would definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for my trip to Hutch! Easy, quiet location right next to the creek path for an afternoon run. The house is the perfect size for 1 or 2 people and had everything I needed. Would definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little place for the value, and perfect for an over night or weekend stay. We were in Kansas for work so we stayed a week. That‚Äôs a little long as this place doesn‚Äôt have cable or a dishwasher. It does have smart TVs so apps are great without cable. Lots of space to put your clothes away while staying. Hosts are quick to reply."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place
Great value
Good and comfy set up"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean small house at the end of the court with only street parking. Many trains blow horn and some are on your track behind the trees. May need to use available ear plugs. Still a great value with full kitchen. Internet TV in front room and bedroom area. Stack wash/dry in large bathroom.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute little home. Perfect for the one night me and my boyfriend stayed. The only complaint is the smell upon entering is extremely musty. We turned the air down and the extra fan on and it went away fairly quickly. Extremely easy checkin and bed was comfy!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! We really loved everything about it, especially the 'extra' touches like the nightlights, coffee, a usb outlet in convenient charging location. Chris was helpful and quick to respond when we accidentally locked ourselves out. I liked that it was a short drive to Main St (downtown), the Stratica, and the Cosmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was just as advertised. Cute comfy and clean. Bed was really comfortable. We would stay again. Price was great too.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Chris's place. The train tracks are very close (as stated in the listing) but they provide earplugs if needed. We did end up needing them as a train went through at 4:15am and 4:20am but obviously Chris can't control the train schedule. We would stay here again for sure.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"FABULOUS PLACE!!! as good as a fancy vrbo. spotless, very big with many many thoughtful touches. crazy good value!!! john and kimsan"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and cozy! Would stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Central location and quiet neighborhood. Near train tracks but not bothersome. House was cute and just the right size for us as a couple. It was very clean and everything was tidy.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was a great value for the one night I stayed here on my way to Denver! There's a bit of a moldy smell to the place -- but I got used to it and it was fine? The place was spacious and comfortable.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this house! It was perfect while we were in town for a wedding weekend. We did have one minor hiccup during check-in, but Chris got in touch with us right away and we were all set! Comfortable, clean, and the perfect size for 2 people. Great amenities as well."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice quiet area. Nice walking trail nearby and close to railroad. I grew up close to one so the sound did not bother me, and the trees muffle the sound. House is small and cute and perfect for one or two people. Very clean."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so wonderful! The owners are warm, friendly, and go out of there way to ensure your stay is most comfortable.

We look forward to staying at this property again - thank you so much, Chris and Darla, for the amazing hospitality!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always outstanding!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was delighted by this comfortable accommodation. In addition to being squeaky clean, the house is chockfull of every amenity and many thoughtful additions. I enjoyed the clever breakup and design of space. The sound from the RR was negligible as the back facing the tracks is windowless. Heck! Even earplugs are supplied, which I found unnecessary. Quiet. Peaceful. Restful."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying here the owners are very nice answer my questions right away and the house was very clean
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris‚Äôs place was amazing. 10/10 stars all around. It was above and beyond our needs for a weekend stay, as well as communication with the hosts was perfect. We enjoyed it so much that we are hoping to book again next time we are in town!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chris's place was so cute and cozy. Check in was a breeze with a code, the house was VERY clean and had every single thing you could need. The best part was the comfortable mattress and nice, hot shower. The trains were loud, but Chris left earplugs for guests to use and they didn't bother me once I feel asleep. I would stay there again! Thank you!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect little house for 2. Just like a big hotel room with an open floor plan, kitchen, separate bathroom, and washer/dryer. Not too far from the fairgrounds either, which was a huge plus."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a home away from home - it has everything you would need.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean. Enjoyed my stay very much! Will be back in May. Very quiet! I did hear the train a few times but it was no bother. Bed and recliner was very comfortable. Loved having Netflix. Would very much recommend this place!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can't even find words to describe this farm house. It's beautiful and charming with the way it preserves history AND includes modern farm house renovations. Our family of three were elated to be snowed in, in such an adorable/cozy farm house. The house was very clean and had so many special decorative touches that make you feel right at home. Sabrina was very responsive when messaging with her and was very accommodating with letting us in when we arrived 30 minutes earlier than planned. After an 8+ inch snow, not only was the drive way plowed, but a path was shoveled from the porch to both sides of our truck! They definitely went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We rented this Airbnb to host our family Thanksgiving dinner, and it worked out perfectly. The place was very clean. The location and surroundings were so peaceful and quiet."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If HGTV was to do a show ""This Old Farmhouse"" about the renovation of a quintessential Kansas property, this would easily fit the bill. Idyllic setting, reasonably close to every amenity but with total privacy. Everything is brand new and done to perfection. Top quality appliances, HVAC, high end shower and all the thoughtful touches only someone with meticulous attention to detail who cares about the guest experience would provide. We have stayed at a lot of high end properties all over the World and were in Kansas for the first time to visit family; our standards are high and this place met them. No question it is the best accommodation of any kind in Hutchison you cannot go wrong booking. Look forward to returning."

Yoder is just a couple miles away with a few stores and eateries. Great weekend getaway!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the cottage! It was very clean and a very comfortable home away from home. We enjoyed watching Lloyd and his family on their dairy farm.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a cozy, cabin feel home away from home, book your stay here! The details are intentional, making it feel peaceful and earthy. I enjoyed my morning coffee as the cattle made their way by the front door. We purchased fresh eggs, milk, cheese, butter, bacon, and breads from their homegrown/made store that is located on-site. The family is welcoming and quick to respond to their guests‚Äô needs. I cannot wait to return!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! The home was beautifully designed and cozy. They had the fireplace and candles going when we arrived and a handwritten note. They even had a treat in the fridge for us! We felt very welcome.

It also had so many amenities that were very helpful for our big day, like a steamer and a big bathroom for us to get ready in. We also brought our 3 kiddos with us, all 4 year old and younger. They LOVED it. They want to go back to the farm now and keep asking when we‚Äôll be back. They loved the bunk beds and the basket of toys that were in the spare room. We also would go outside/ look out the door to watch the cows come and go. They had a blast. Also, the eggs and milk were so good. This bnb was so homey, clean, and just very much enjoyed. Make sure to read their little guest book! Lots of experiences and peoples stories in there."

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this enchanting little farmhouse."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a peaceful place stay. it was really cute to be awakened in the morning by the mooing of cows!
The store on property even delivered.
Great stay and experience!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Red Barn Cottage was the perfect oasis for my family! We were in town to visit my family and we could not have asked for a better place to stay. The red barn was comfortable very beautifully decorated, and the amenities included everything that we needed. The red barn has recently been made over from an existing horse barn, and it is very modern yet cozy. In addition to the place being beautiful, there was a farm store within several hundred feet of the barn including ice cream, cheese, meats, yogurt, raw milk, and even sourdough breads and cinnamon rolls. The location is absolutely beautiful. You are right in the middle of Yoder farm country. You can see the cows being milked every day in the barns. You can also see guinea hens walking around the property grazing on the pasture, as well as rabbits to the left of the barn. Outside was a nice sitting area with a basketball hoop and tons of activities, like cornhole and jump ropes and basketballs and footballs. Absolutely perfect!"

We originally planned to stay in Wichita so we could spend a day exploring and make use of our Sunflower Summer passes as a family. However, once I saw this place I just couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity to stay here!
During our stay we were able to make our favorite meals (breakfast and brenner) + fresh whipped cream! Our girls enjoyed the coloring books and our one year old son and my husband had a great time playing outside. We also drank too much chocolate milk, enjoyed the sunset, and slept comfortably- what more could anyone ask for?! Oh yeah bath towels were high quality too! This is a wonderful place to stay and we‚Äôd gladly stay here again; our kiddos have already been asking when we‚Äôre going back! Hopefully soon!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Red Barn Cottage. It was beautiful and extremely clean. Loyd has made the cottage so inviting and comfortable and has provided wonderful amenities. My younger kids enjoyed the toys and outdoor space to play, and my older children enjoyed the card games and peaceful atmosphere of the cottage. We ordered items from the farm store and had them delivered to the cottage. This was such a wonderful option. Everything we ordered was amazing and delicious. We highly recommend this stay and hope we can make it back again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for letting us be in this beautiful place! Simply beautiful!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little barn cottage is amazing. So well thought out. It is beautiful inside and out. I wish we could have made it to the store. This was a definite favorite on this trip! I would happily stay again and highly recommend!!!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice place close to the things we wanted to see and was a really peaceful place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Red Barn Cottage was a peaceful and cozy place for our family. I had planned several outings during the day but looked forward to coming back to a beautiful space. It was clean, well-appointed, and the hosts included lots of little extras like games, toiletries, kitchen supplies, etc. to make things easier for travelers....all the comforts of home and more. Loved the fireplace and master bedroom the most."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is such a gem! Perfectly decorated with a cozy feel, incredibly clean, and the surrounding farm is so charming. The beds were comfortable and the next morning we were so impressed to see some of their raw milk and farm fresh eggs in the fridge for our enjoyment. There are games and books for kids in the bunk room. It‚Äôs such a great place we will definitely return to when we‚Äôre in the area and would highly recommend to anyone."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a great stop in Kansas, consider Loyds Red Barn! Everything was brand new and well put together. Peaceful stop right on their dairy farm. The kids loved the private play area. We all enjoyed relaxing in the living room and playing games. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Thanks for hosting us!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly Anne was very responsive and worked with me on a last minute booking/check in. The apartment was in a great area, with a splashpad and park across the street, and lots of good restaurants close by to eat at, or order in. The space was as described and clean. The only reason I gave 4 stars was due to comfort level. If half stars were an AirB&B thing, I would give 4.5. The bed wasn't great, and neither were the couches. That's totally a personal preference, and someone else may love them. Another item of note was the thickness/sound proofing of the walls (which Kelly Anne has no control over, but just to give other renters a heads up). You could clearly hear conversations in the apartment that shares a wall with the bedroom, which means they could hear whatever is said or done in the bedroom ;>) Having said that, we would stay there again."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice clean apartment in center of town. Parking was a challenge at times as there were no parking spaces available at the complex. I did have an issue with not knowing how to use the door lock. Kelly Anne was responsive but instructions at the house would have been nice.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Very clean and had all the amenities needed for a long stay. Kelly Anne was easy to communicate with.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was great, super easy check-in, very clean, great communication . Couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything else."

Kelly Anne is a great host.
Pros:
Location is good, a park across the street and very little traffic noise.
Well equipped kitchen, great appliances.
Adequately furnished.
Convenient parking.
Cons:
Noise from upstairs neighbors. Not terrible, but very noticeable at times.
Smart TV, so Netflix, Prime, Hulu and other streaming services available, but no local channels/networks.
Small toilet and very cheap toilet paper.

Shower curtain liner needs to be changed."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little apartment was exactly as listed. We only stayed a couple of nights but would definitely return if we ever find ourselves in Hutchinson again.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly Anne‚Äôs place is nicely located close to everything in Hutchinson. My wife and I were visiting for our granddaughter‚Äôs graduation. We were centrally located for the activities. The apartment has a coded entry so check in is a no contact experience.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly's place was beautiful and clean. The only issue (which is no fault of Kelly) was that the walls in the apartment building are paper thin so you hear EVERYTHING from the neighbors surrounding your apartment. Ear plugs were a simple and quick fix for me and blocked out the snoring neighbor :)

The location is fabulous, just minutes from the state fair venue and close to many restaurants. Kelly Anne was so quick to respond to any questions I had and was always very nice and professional with me. I had a great stay and recommend anyone stay with her, you won't be disappointed!"

,,,"There was not a single clean towel available when I arrived. They were wadded up in a muddy mess in the bathtub. The bedsheets had not been washed. Old food was sitting out on the counter and in the sink. Overall the entire place was unclean and disgusting. The walls are paper thin, you can hear the neighbors talking and snoring. I will not be back and to not recommend this to anyone. Terrible quality and service."
