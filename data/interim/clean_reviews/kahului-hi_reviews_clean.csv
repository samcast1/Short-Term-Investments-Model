2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All good.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good straightforward no frills stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Very close to Paia. Easy to find. Clear instructions. Flexible check out time. Bed was comfortable. Clean. Beautiful floors and decorations. Updated. Only concern was sound: Air conditioner loud and outside /highway sounds. Thanks so much! Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place ... easy walk to Mamas fish house
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near Paia. Loved it!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt very comfortable and would come back again. The location is great. Check-in and check-out was easy. The apartment has everything you need to have a great vacationüòä
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was exactly as described! Very cozy and cute with the wooden accents throughout. Booking was especially easy!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! So close to our friends in Haiku. We got a reservation at Mama's Fish House and we were able to walk there which was nice. Paolo was also very quick to respond and help us when we locked ourselves out of the house by accident lol. We love Maui and will definitely look to this place for future trips.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Paula and Paulo are very pleasant and responsive to our request. This was a convenient location for our visit with family in Maui. Beach path close by with large sea turtles sunning on the beach. Mammas fish house next door is a must try!!! Reservations needed but we were able to get in without reservations.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"place was clean, great location and Paolo was quick to respond to any questions."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Paolo's place. The location was driveable to the heart of Paia, which we loved exploring. The beach near the town was beautiful and we were even able to spot a couple of sea turtles. The onsite laundry is very affordable but plan to bring your own pod/detergent, as neither are provided. Paolo was responsive and flexible."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paolo‚Äôs place was as advertised and was comfortable for one person in the bedroom and the other on the pull out couch. It felt pretty expensive but the market has been very expensive lately so I don‚Äôt think it was unreasonable compared to other options.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location on north Maui to get a head start on the road to Hana. Place was rather sparse and not conducive to lounging around to relax or for cooking a nice meal. Kitchen is not well stocked. There was just the one old sofa in the living room with an old TV on the floor that was difficult to decipher operation. The patio furniture was also unusable but we did use the complimentary beach chairs for nearby Ho'okipa Beach Park. The bedroom mattress was comfortable and the bedroom AC worked well. If you just need a place to sleep on a comfortable bed in an air conditioned bedroom while on north Maui without any other lodging needs, this place works."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this place, very well appointed with wood art. We actually wanted to stay another night but it was booked. Very comfortable bed and pillow options.
This is right at the top of the Road to Hana. We would stay here again is it is in our travel plans."
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was okay for a one night stay. Location is good. Right by mama‚Äôs fish house and close to Paia downtown area. However the price was not worth the stay. Over $400 dollars for one night. Cockroaches in the condo. Geckos in the condo. So many tasks asked of us before check out. I paid a cleaning fee, I expect that should cover the trash disposal of one bag of trash from my one night stay. The place was ‚Äúclean‚Äù but a little musty. Overall, did not think the space was worth what we paid."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot - walking distance to Mama's Fish House and a small beach with Turtle's hanging out. Comfortable bed and very effective bedroom AC.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only spent a short time in this place but it was all we needed: comfortable bed, fridge, parking spot, and located near Paia."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and friendly host! Great place in a great location close to beaches and shops.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean and big space, easy parking."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location!
Super-convenient to be at the beginning of the Road To Hana as well as only a couple of minutes drive to the center of Paia town.
Ground-floor made access extremely easy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was as just what we needed for our three day visit to Maui. We needed a convenient location to spend most of our time at the national park. This apartment was conveniently located. Very clean apartment. Liked that the designated parking space was in front of the door. The decor was very creative and artistic. Bed was comfortable. Some of the previous reviews noted that the complex was run-down and older. While it may be a bit older- I felt the upkeep was nice and it had a boutique motel vibe. Would definitely stay again if we ever visited Maui in the future.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant stay, near Paia and some great beaches. Close to the road however, so could be a little noisy at night if you are a light sleeper."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Professionally managed, very clean, with all the amenities you need. I stayed in many airbnbs in Maui, and this is so far the best one!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! I loved all the custom wood work throughout. Beautiful and clean.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was perfect for me. Key fob was a little difficult to operate at first, but Paolo‚Äôs wife was able to walk me through it over the phone. Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great central location to beach and downtown area. Beautiful wood work throughout condo.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the comfortable stay. The wood accents and bathroom work is very nice!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place close to the Paia restaurants and shops. Air cooler in the bedroom to help cool it off. Updated kitchen and bathrooms. Would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent location and good price
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location to start the road to Hana, beach at walking distance. The really close to everthing restuarants, stores and lots of things to see."
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It was a good place to stay and was clean. The shower ceiling had mold on it but I'm sure he will get it fixed. other than that it was a good place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a beautiful space and super clean. The road noise wasn‚Äôt a problem at all. Really convenient location that felt very safe!! Loved it
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, super friendly owner. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is perfect
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodation exactly as described (from equipment, noise, bugs, atmosphere). We can recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you Paolo, you were understanding despite my booking date error. Looking forward to it. I recommend the Condo, even more beautiful than in the photos!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paolo was very responsive and helpful. The place was clean and comfortable. Mama‚Äôs fish house was fantastic and we loved the small grocery with prepared food and coffee a block away. Short walk to the beach in front of Mama‚Äôs. Other beaches were a close drive. Lots of turtles in the area. We would stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paolo was very informative about the place and kept constant communication before and throughout the stay. Would definitely give this place 4.5/5
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great spot for those exploring Paia and the North side of Maui. The bed was super comfortable and great air conditioning in the bedroom which is a major plus!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing stay at her place, she was very friendly and the place was a perfect escape for us while exploring Paia!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for adventures. There's a beautiful small beach in walking distance and the famous and incredible Mama's Fish House restaurant is right there, also. Road to Hana starts here and Hookipa Beach is also nearby."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place exactly as described and shown in photos! would absolutely book again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paolo‚Äôs place is super clean, great location in Paia where there is a lot of nice places to go shopping and restaurants, walk distance to the beach and close to the surf, it was perfect for us and our 2 kids!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay. Paolo's place is a great spot for both traveling to hiking in Haleakala National Park or enjoying the beaches along Kihei or west Maui. Also, having a full kitchen was more useful than we even anticipated!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious appartment. Unfortunately, TV did not work. For the price, we think coffee and some detergent for the laundry could be provided"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the stay. It was as advertised. Only issue was we couldn‚Äôt get the TV to work & one morning we had some noisy neighbors who were speaking very loudly before 6 AM that waked us but we got up to a beautiful morning. So no worries for the earlier then expected wake up call.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to all areas. The host is flexible and fast to respond.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was comfy, the kitchen well equipped with the basics, the couch was comfy, and the walk to Mama‚Äôs was like a minute or two at the most (as a single I walked in twice and was immediately seated at the bar ~ they say it‚Äôs that place that‚Äôs so hard to get into), the Kuau Store up the hill has the best coffee, pineapple upside down cake pastry for breakfast (you absolutely must, get it!) and premade p&j sandwiches~ the Paia Fish Market is a must go! (eat late and miss the lines ~ get the Cajan Snapper and the Shrimp Quesada!) If you don‚Äôt mind a bit of wind, go to Baldwin Beach, and don‚Äôt miss Makawao! Paulo was an extremely gracious and responsive host! I was very happy there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is awesome if you love Maui‚Äôs north shore -Paia and Hookipa. Walk to Mama‚Äôs fish house and tide pools. Don‚Äôt forget to stop at Kuau Mart with their great selection of espressos and plate lunch! The interior is all custom and makes you feel like you found a special place‚Ä¶and you did!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is in a great location, and is a 2 min walk to Mama‚Äôs Fish House. All the finishings in the apartment are updated and it has everything you need. The living room area is not the most private at night due to it being on the first floor and the curtains not closing all the way. Other than that it is a great find and would definitely stay there again if we ever come back to Paia!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Maui. Close proximity to downtown Paia.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Beautify beach accesses right down the way. Had everything we needed. Paolo was a pleasure to work with and worked with us at every turn. I would love to go back.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit is very cute with lots of wood accents. There is only an AC unit in the bedroom, so the rest of the condo can get pretty warm. Nice patio with open space in the back.
The unit is located on a busy road with no sidewalks, which didn't feel safe to walk along. There is a beach nearby with public access, otherwise this location isn't very walkable. Short drive to downtown Paia, which was really nice.
Paolo was a somewhat responsive host. We needed a pack and play, which was supposed to be provided in the unit, but was missing when we checked in and he brought one over a couple of hours later. We asked for an early check in, but didnt receive a response. The gate code provided was incorrect or outdated because it didn't work.
Overall, it was an okay stay, but I probabaly wouldn't stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was easy to check-in and book. Unfortunately we had an issue with our rooms and then it was resolved but the cancelation policy stated no refunds. That was my biggest problem. Otherwise the place is clean and well decorated
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We spent a night here after flying in that afternoon and before doing the Road to Hana the next day and the location was absolutely perfect for that! The space was very clean. The AC unit in the bedroom was a bit noisy, but it did keep the bedroom a comfortable temperature.
ACTIVITIES: Paia and the nearby beaches are much easier to access with a car - it's difficult to walk (especially at night) given the lack of sidewalks. The nearby Ho'okipa Beach (~5min drive) was amazing - we watched surfers and got to see SO MANY turtles up on the beach around sunset time.
DINING: We loved the Flatbread Company for an affordable dinner option. The condo is also just a few minute walk to Mama's Fish House if you want a fancier dining experience. Paia Coffee Bar was great for grabbing coffee/breakfast before starting our long drive the next day."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great stay at Paolo‚Äôs!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our weekend stay here, mostly for the proximity to a great beach spot with lots of sea turtles. The condo was nice, beds comfortable and was just what we expected from the description and photos. I would stay here again and recommend to others that want to explore the North Shore and Upcountry while in Maui."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,enjoyed the nearby beach and coffee shop/market! also great to be able to reserve it for just a night while we toured the island
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic location, extremely peaceful and a walk to several beaches. Would absolutely reserve on my next visit. Thank you Paolo."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Paolo & Paola were very accommodating during our stay. The only thing I did not appreciate was the loud traffic, I am personally more of a zen lover."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed here for the night and had a great experience. Check in and check out instructions were clear and easy. In walking distance to the beach behind Mama's fish house which barely anyone was at. Saw lots of turtles there! The town area of Paia was close with lots of shopping and places to eat.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was exactly what we‚Äôd hoped for in Maui! A close walkable beach was wonderful to have, and Paia was the type of town we‚Äôd hoped to stay in! Definitely great for people who want to get away from touristy in Maui and enjoy a small town feel away from the big resorts"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a treat. It was amazing and so beautiful and convenient. Thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice place with everything we needed!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and love Paia which is 4min away with the car. The laundry room next to the building is very clean. Thank you! :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a good spot for everything we wanted to do in the first half of our vacation. Right on the Hana Hwy, so was really convenient to get to the hikes and waterfalls. Restaurants 5 min drive down the road."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location, it is well positioned for the Road to Hana and Haleakala National Park. We also loved walking to Mama's Fish House beach and seeing the turtles in the morning.
The condo was clean and was accurately described. The wood detailing is unique and there was plenty of space for us. We did have some trouble sleeping, as the air conditioner was loud when it kicked on and off, I'm not sure what the solution for that is, if you don't mind sleeping with just a fan it wouldn't be a problem."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Paolo for the stay! Appreciate your precise instructions and follow up. We enjoyed our short stay in Paia. If you need a place to stay and don‚Äôt need much, Paolo‚Äôs place is perfect. Location is literally a short walk from Mama‚Äôs Fish House, which was the reason for our stay in Paia. Mahalo for the hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Proximity to so many great things on the north shore and upcountry. Would love to come back. Easy instructions and great communication. Thanks again!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our 3 night stay. We echo precious reviews: it‚Äôs a little dark inside and there could be a few more kitchen utensils. There were some tiny little ants but we put everything in the fridge and had no trouble. But those are picky things. We had a wonderful drink and dessert at Mama‚Äôs Fish House and we cooked a great swordfish dinner in one night. The beach in front of mama‚Äôs is amazing and we spent 2 afternoons swimming and gawking at the 8 sea turtles basking in the reef. Overall a comfortable place to stay near Paia. Paolo was responsive when contacted regarding checkin. Easy to locate and plenty of parking. Close to the little Kuau market. We felt very safe.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is small but cozy, decor is beautiful. Mama‚Äôs fish house is in walking distance, right by the beach. We will definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location for what we wanted. While we had a car, I think it would be walkable to the Hana/Baldwin intersection. The woodwork in the apartment is very lovely and the space was clean. The AC unit was a little loud (I'm used to white noise though!), but it blocked out noise from the main road.
We had no issues. It was super easy to get in and travel to/from. Great place to stay if you're doing the road to Hana and want to be close to restaurants in downtown Paia/Baldwin Beach.
The only ""thing"" I would comment on/suggest looking into is the shower. The handle is exceptionally tight (I thought i was going to break it!) to move in order to turn on. Secondly, when we showered, the water pressure was pretty poor, but there was a button that made the pressure perfect. The only thing was that you had to hold the button while you showered to maintain the pressure! It wasn't a big deal though, especially for a short visit!
Thanks, Paolo!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice island vibe!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simple, artful, relaxing apartment. Convenient to Paia business district as well as roads to Haleakala and Hana. Be sure to see the turtles at nearby cove behind Mama‚Äôs fish house."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and as described. Perfect for road to Hana
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a good place for a couple. Place was clean, host was very responsive. Only comment i have is kitchen was not much stocked like the other Vacation rentals I have used. Nice to have some coffee powder for the first mornings coffee."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We walked to Mama‚Äôs fish house for our anniversary dinner.
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Description was accurate and photos accurately captured the space. We arrived late at night and left early the next morning, so we weren‚Äôt able to see the surroundings. Not much light at night. The inside was clean for the most part and the appliances were new. We did notice a critter in the shower when we arrived, but as to be expected in a tropical destination. Host provided waters in the fridge upon arrival, which was a nice touch. We only stayed one night as we were only in Maui to catch a flight the next morning."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice place for the money. Maui is so expensive, it's grea to find a nice spot to call home for a while that doesn't break the bank. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Convenient location close to the airport and on the way to Hana.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the aesthetics of this place. It was immediately comfortable and the decor was pleasing. We weren‚Äôt there long enough to do any cooking and we didn‚Äôt use the AC. The shower hardware was difficult to use. Close to activities, including turtle watching, and having a car helped. We wished we could have stayed longer."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Back door was only a screen. It was locked but still didn‚Äôt feel all that safe.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for road to Hana
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Beautiful wood furniture throughout. AC was very comfortable in the bedrooms. Easy to find. Just a few minutes walk from Mama's Fish House. Enjoyed the patio. I would recommend a car if you plan on going to town, though you could walk to a wonderful little store/deli/smoothie/coffee place in just a few minutes. We used Lyft which was easy to get into Paia for restaurants. Host was responsive and instructions were clear. I'd recommend this place as a great option for close to Mama's Fish House, Paia, and the Road to Hana."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easily accessible and very clean. It‚Äôs a few miles from the closest restaurants so you will need to either Uber or rent a car. Not a bad price for the location .
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place near Paia. Simple and a block from the beach.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you fir the stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your gonna go to Mamas fish house , then this a great place to stay. Just a short 1 min walk to restaurant. Very artsy and modern , my girlfriend really liked the monkey pod tables. The shower looks super cool but it only got warm, not as hot as I would like. But everything else was great. Easy parking , easy check in. We enjoyed our stay , mahalo !"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location if you are planning to do the Road to Hana. Check-in was super easy.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Paolos! The apartment was clean and quiet. The Monkeypod detailing was very pretty!
I saw a couple other reviewers complain about bugs ‚Äî this is a tropical island. If you take your shoes off, put your food away & wipe down sinks, etc. there was absolutely no problem with it for me.
Host was quick to respond when I needed something mid-trip and had it fixed within 15 minutes.
Only thing I would change if possible would be a little extra lighting (bottom floor unit).
Mahalo nui loa!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Overall a great stay! The condo was clean and easy to access and the location was perfect!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Paolos place. Good located. Easy to get around from there. Was only a 15min drive to twin falls. We definitely would stay there again. Mahalo for everything.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had everything we needed. Good directions, easy check in and easily reachable host/s. Quiet area, walking distance to Mama‚Äôs Fish House and its beach. The space itself was roomy, well stocked and well decorated with good quality furniture. The shower knob could use some lubrication. The AC in the bedroom was adequate for our 1-night stay; we didn‚Äôt spend the day lounging in the living room so it worked for us. The bed and linen were quite comfortable and felt wonderful after a long day of traveling. We would come back to this space should we feel the need for a short stay in Paia again. Thank you, Paolo!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time staying at Paolo‚Äôs condo. The decor is super cool and artistic, and the location is excellent.
If strong wifi or having a smart tv are important to you, the condo is not set up for that at this time. The wifi does not reach into the bedroom, either, and it made it a bit tricky for my wife, who needed to work."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paolo‚Äôs place was just what we were looking for: right on the Hana highway (with parking space right in front of the unit) so easy to get on the road in the early morning, very close to town and a short walk from a small market shop with great food and sunscreen, and right by a turtle beach in front of Mama‚Äôs fish house. Saw tons of turtles! AC in the bedroom kept it cool for sleeping. Overall clean place with the exception of some ants in the bathroom, but hosts were super responsive and got us some spray. Had a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, stay and value! Will definitely book again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time in Paia! What a cute town with fabulous restaurants and not as touristy as Lahaina. This property is clean and conveniently located. Reviews are correct in that there is a lot of traffic noise. However, we ran the air conditioner in the bedroom and did not bother us. We spent some time on Ho'okipa beach one afternoon and saw 13 sea turtles on the beach as well as an endangered sea lion. There is a lot to do in this area.
The pictures are very accurate. There is a lot of driftwood accents, which adds to the charm of this property. However, do note the television sits on the floor, there are not end tables or coffee tables for drinks, books, etc and the couch is well loved. The bed was comfortable with a good choice of pillows and bedding"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little apartment in a large apartment building right on main road and 2-block walk to lovely little beach.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I normally don't air grievances, but this airbnb has a no refunds policy, which means if any of the following are a dealbreaker for you, don't book:
Bugs, or dead bugs. - At the bottom of the listing, there is mention of the possibility of cockroaches due to the climate and geound floor nature of the airbnb. I found several dead bugs in the counter or amongst the dishes. I felt like I had to scrub the dishes before and after using them.
Heat. - there is no central air in this building and the windows did not adequately cool throughout the day. There's a small air conditioner which can only cool the bedroom area with the door closed, but even then I woke up sweating during the night.
Privacy/noise. - this condo has thin walls and is located in the middle of a bend in a busy road, meaning I could hear cars going by at all hours, day or night. I could also distinctly hear the noises from the neighbors, or of people walking around outside. There are also wild chickens who begin crowing at roughly 4 am.
All in all, the stay itself wasnt horrible, but I did not feel that it was worthy of the listed price (Not to mention the $100 cleaning fee for an unclean place where you have to haul away your own garbage/recycling). I stayed in Hawai'i for two weeks and this was my most expensive and least satisfactory stay."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location! The unit was clean and the kitchen was fully stocked. The only down side was there wasn‚Äôt an air conditioner in the living room!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious and conveniently located to easily access Maui's north shore beaches and the charming town of Paia."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really cool spot, well decorated, host was communicative and quick! We felt it was pretty warm in September without an AC in the main sitting area- only real drawback. Thanks Paolo!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location right by Paia and the start of the Road to Hana. Everything was as listed and Paolo was a great host.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Excellent location. Cool and creative decor. Responsive host!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend Paolo‚Äôs place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was good. The location is right next to Mama Fish house and a few minutes in the central Paia. Abt 15 min and you in the airport. Only the master bed has a/c but it was cold. Quiet complex.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and spacious unit. Convenient location and close to some amazing eateries and shops. Extremely happy with my stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great and exactly as advertised! Very clean (and I'm picky) AC doesn't work super well so if that is something you absolutely need, then only expect to use at night. Fans worked great for us. Unit didn't get too hot in August. A little farther from the restaurants so you have to drive or Uber but it was only a short ride. Very good deal for the area. We might be back in the future :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication and easy check-in. Very clean and cute decor. The location was perfect. We had a short walk to Kuau Cove. We got to see turtles and a beautiful sunset. It's right off Hana Highway, but this worked great for us as it was the perfect starting point for our Road to Hana outing. We'd definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paolo's place was a perfect location to all the quirkiness we were after in Paia. The nearby beach was also a dream. Highly recommend this very affordable paradise.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, great hosts, right next to Mamas fish house which is a must indulge! Near a bunch of other great food locations too!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent place to stay. Paolo responds super quick and seems very helpful. Condominium is near the beach area and next to Mamas Fishhouse. Will definitely book again when we return to Maui. Thank you!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is as listed. The location is super convenient and right next to mamas fish house restaurant- even if you don‚Äôt go there the beach is awesome- we saw turtles! The kitchen has everything you need and check in smooth. Would definitely stay here again when we visit Paia!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and cute place! Great location too. We needed a place to stay that was close to airport since flight was late at night. We loved being able to walk to kuau store for their fantastic poke and pastries! Host was very prompt and nice
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very sweet, responds fast! And the place is amazing, it‚Äôs so nice, I couldn‚Äôt believe the price I got for it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Paola. Short distance to Paia-nice little town. We were mostly driving in and out everyday but coming to the condo was nice and cozy. I recommend it to any one. By the way, it is right next to Mama‚Äôs Fish House-great food and drinks."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful stay. Earthiness, intentionality, sleekness and dreaminess of driftwood features really added a lovely rustic layer to our more rural Paia experience before spending time in more modernized Lahaina.
Not centrally cooled- we stayed mid-July and with the only 1 freestanding AC unit located in the bedroom, open window ventilation and ceiling fan in living room, were comfortable with the temp. Lovely shade and breezes in this unit even at hottest of summertime.
Great location, safe, PRISTINELY clean. If you need a blow drier bring one, but had everything else we needed (kitchen basics, iron, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc.)
Communication and hospitality from correspondent was top notch."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay in Paia! It was hot without a/c in the whole condo but was able to still sleep good with the room a/c. Overall, good value and would stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Clean, easy, safe. Great coffee within walking distance. Good communication. Zero issues."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and a great stay.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, communication great. Minimal furniture all other amenities were good. Paia is a very cute little town conveniently located for adventures to Hana Highway and Lahaina."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paolo‚Äôs place was great. Perfect for 2 People. Close to the beach behind Mama‚Äôs Fish House ( Food is pricey and delicious,but need reservations in advance) The place is close to Paia and Haiku. Recommend Colleen‚Äôs at the Cannery in Haiku for dining out. Very casual, but great food. I would definitely come back here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot and quick/easy communication when booking and arriving.
Would happily stay again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Is a beautiful condo great value
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paolo's place was the perfect stay for us. We did Road to Hana during day and made it back to his place which was the perfect place to rest after such an adventurous day. Very close to Paia for dinner, music and drinks. Very close to airport for quick and easy departure. Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Great hosts; flexible, responsive, and super awesome if you get a chance to run into in person. Sea turtle sanctuary beach is the first beach you get to, so beautiful, right next door to Mama's Fish House. Amazing views. The apartment is beautifully decorated & designed & super easy to use and nice to be in. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Just perfect for our layover before the road to Hana, and easy walk to dinner at Mama‚Äôs. The highway noise was no problem at all, and the Ku‚Äôau Store is fantastic! Nice touches throughout his place, very comfortable bed, nice kitchen and bathroom."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,We needed a place near the airport to pick up friends arriving the day after us and this location worked out.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great stay at Paolo's condo. A few people wrote about the vicinity of the busy road and noise. It did not bother us at all! The a/c unit in the bedroom works fine, but we only used it first night. The rest of the stay the fans were perfectly enough for a good night sleep.
The mattress and the pillows were perfect for us ( nice and firm ).
The kitchen had all the tools we needed for cooking. Special thanks to the host for having a blender! We enjoyed fresh smoothies every morning!
I would like to highlight the local store that is only a few minutes away walking. Ku'au store it is called. FANTASTIC lattes, amazing tuna poke made fresh daily and all the little things you made need to buy. The store associates are SUPER friendly and helpful.
Overall, the condo is in a great location close to everything!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and stylish apartment with a big kitchen!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, on a great location to kickstart out road to Hana trip from a fresh day. The apartment was very clean and it is really well HI-themed modern decoration. Really cool touches with the wood work!"
2022-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,If you don‚Äôt mind getting bug bites in your sleep or cockroaches under your toilet then this place is fine. If those are problems then for you then I would t recommend. We couldn‚Äôt leave food anywhere without bugs crawling all over them within minutes. It was a nice place without the bug infestation.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay. Very clean.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paolo‚Äôs space was clean and inviting! Wonderful location with the cute town of Paia just a short drive down the road! We enjoyed short drives and walks to beautiful beaches!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location minutes from Paia and a solid grocery with prepared and ready to eat options. The unit was spacious, updated, and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Definitely a great value and jumping off point for taking the road to Hana."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great little spot right next to Mamas fish house at the beginning of road to Hana. If you can‚Äôt get a reservation at Mamas, walk in, they will try their best to seat you. Nice country store around the corner and secluded beaches if you know where to look. Nice touch with the boogey board, chairs and towels. Make sure to put your food in the fridge and check out a great breakfast spot called Baked on Maui!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paolo's place was just as advertised and a perfect place to crash after a big day of hiking, diving, or beaching. Looking forward to returning!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, and nice little apartment for 1-2 people. Mahalo!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Only stayed one night at Paulo's place but wish we had booked it longer. Really nicely remodeled unit close to Paia and the road to Hana.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time in Paia! This well-designed apartment was a great home base for us. We loved being within walking distance of Mama‚Äôs Fish House Beach and the Ku‚Äôau Store.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was good.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"OMGosh! This place is great! Being on the first floor was awesome with kids because the grass lanai straight out was amazing and breezy. There‚Äôs a little grocery a block away with a coffee shop inside- great for basic stuff and a big grocery about a mile down the road if there‚Äôs more elaborate meals you‚Äôre looking for.
Very easy access and loved how the condo was situated from activities."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place! 100% nicer in person than in pictures! Very near Mama‚Äôs Fish House, but get reservations early on! Also close to the beach. Already on the road to Hana. Just all-around great!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just what we were looking for!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very good place in an excellent location with beach access via a short walk. Good communication from friendly owners.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was as advertised. It was nice to have towels provided. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little Condo on the 1st floor in Paia is central location to downtown Paia, beaches, Mama Fish House. You can't get a better location than this! Parking spot right outside. Love the wooden interior throughout the condo and the beach items (boogie board, beach chairs, towels, etc).
I did not enjoy the flat pillows. Please change up the pillows! Even with AC the bedroom was still kind of hot which makes it hard to sleep.
Also this location has a huge ANT problem. Ants all over the walls, kitchen counters, etc. Beware of your foods."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in a great location. Beautiful woodwork inside! We were very comfortable and happy. If you download the app for the laundry you get your first load free!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to Road to Hana and right next to Mamas Fish house (we highly recommend and its reservation based). The apt is right next to a street so it can be a bit noisy so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful use of wood in this place! Paolo had the hide a bed already set up for my son, which was totally unexpected and appreciated. Laundry facilities were great. Make sure you bring quarters.
Mama‚Äôs Fish House is right next door but you need to make reservations months in advance. Pa√≠a has lots of good restaurants and fun shops downtown.
The bed is comfy and the shower is great. The handle on the shower is unusually tight but I love unusual non-slip surface of the shower floor. Very cool!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Good location to explore Paia, the roads to Hana and other areas. Quick walk to Mama‚Äôs fish house Drawbacks are the noisy road, lack of pool, no bbq and coin laundry. The air con in the bedroom helped drown out the easily morning traffic noise that starts at 6 am. The kids found it a bit hot in the main room and had to leave the screen open of this ground floor unit even with the fan. A bit concerning since the front parking area by the highway isn‚Äôt fully gated. Sofa bed was more comfortable than Hyatt or other hotel so big bonus. Nicely decorated. Decent value for money for our 5 night stay with teenagersand nice laidback place overall during Covid as a place to sleep."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Place offers basic necessities and is great for a simple stop/stay when visiting Paia. Having a parking spot at the front door was amazingly convenient. This was my last day on the island and loading all our bags was super easy as we headed off to the airport. No oven but the stove top sufficed. Laundry room is coin operated so we skipped to wash back home.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great unit in a great location. It is on the ground floor which makes getting in and out a lot easier. The unit is very clean with nice furnishings. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. We needed assistance from the host once and he was at the unit within 20 minutes.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in the apartment was as-advertised. Clean, organized, comfortable. And the location is great for exploring Maui."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unassuming from the outside, the unit is fresh and nicely set up with a tropical organic vibe. we could have used a few more pillows, but providing beach towels was a nice touch. Would recommend ear plugs for those who are sensitive to noise, as the walls are rather thin, and the location borders a busy road."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time here and it never disappoints. Perfect location, quiet, safe and close proximity to adventurous outings! This couple is great with communicating and always pleasant! 5 stars!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So close to the beach and had everything we needed! Loved it!
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Great location, very clean, easy check-in, good place to stay if you will be out adventuring during the day.
Cons: Issue with the shower so we only had lukewarm water (we noticed someone else said this in a recent review), and the lighting throughout the condo is super dim. Not great for doing much of anything once the sun goes down."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a good location for the start of Hana highway. There is a small public beach within walking distance but it is in front of a fancy restaurant. We had a slight problem with the shower but it was fixed the next day. We enjoyed our stay.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to the beach, further out from everything else. Loved the interior design. Easy to check in. Don‚Äôt forget to send a picture with your car information when you arrive so you can park in front."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as advertised! Like any apartment building, you can hear neighbors and a bit of road noise but nothing that earplugs wouldn‚Äôt solve. We LOVED the K≈´ ªau Store just a few minutes away on foot. Had everything from delicious coffee and pastries to poke and sandwiches for lunch. Not to mention other essentials if you wanted to cook."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location near Paia town and Mama‚Äôs Fish House. We stayed one night in preparation for Haleakala sunrise and enjoyed the place.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location on the Hana highway. We stayed a week and found it to be comfortable and accessible to great beach walking distance and town of Pa‚Äôia which has ‚Äúlow‚Äù tourist factor. Highly recommend.

Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was perfect for our last night of our honeymoon. Also, the perfect location for doing the Road To Hana. The place was spotless and had lots of unique wood features which made it unique. Bed was very comfy and sheets were super soft. On top of that, we walked right over to Mama‚Äôs Fish House for dinner. Perfect!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was well maintained and had everything we needed. We loved the location, super close to the beach and the town of Paia was so cute and lowkey."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, just a quick drive to downtown Paia and a short walk to the mamas fish house beach. You don‚Äôt even need to pay $60 per plate to use the beach which was nice. We stayed here to get a head start on the road to Hana and it‚Äôs an excellent spot for that."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay next to an amazing beach, and at the start of the road to Hana. Loved it!"

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good location to start drive to Hana.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great cute spot with an ideal
Location for us. We wanted something affordable in the area near a beach and this is near Kuau cove, by one of the greatest little beaches in Maui.
This is a first floor apartment, but we actually enjoyed being able to walk into the courtyard.
Although off the Hana highway, it‚Äôs pretty quiet.
Wish the pull out couch was most comfortable to sleep on, but the bedroom was great. So if it‚Äôs just 2, this place is perfect."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy and flexible on the checkin, lovely little condo exactly as advertised. Amazing location just steps away from Mama's fish house which has a gorgeous little beach. If you go early in the morning, you might see some sea turtles sunning themselves on the sand. Great value and no issues whatsoever, I really can't recommend this place enough."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed out stay. Great value for what we got
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pro:
The bed is memory foam so it is pretty comfortable
You can sit outside on the patio
Dishes and kitchen are clean
Con:
This is a noisy unit. The neighbors are loud and there is lots of traffic noise
The wifi is really slow, 1 nvps
The decor is odd. We didn‚Äôt bother using the tv or coffee table because they are essentially on the floor"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy and her property is a true definition of what AirBnb is! Great location, friendly and responsive communication, and incredible amenities. They have absolutely everything you‚Äôll need here! Best for 2 people, might get tight with 4. Oh, and a sleep number mattress? Couldn‚Äôt believe it. Just book it!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is a paradise for certain! No detail was missed. The natural beauty of Maui cannot be understated and it‚Äôs such a treat to see the ocean from the bed. With so much available in the nearby area this was the ideal place to stay. There‚Äôs ample instructions, amenities, support, and in a great location. The area felt safe and was quiet.

It was very clear how much thought and effort went into decorating and stocking the unit..it did not go unnoticed!
Our unit was close to the pool which was nice, there were grills by the pool that we did use and my husband was so impressed he saw them being cleaned daily, cause ya know sometimes their not. We felt very comfortable there and really enjoyed our stay....it's really hard to leave....both the Studio Unit and Island are beautiful! ..I will return ...to both"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"How every place should BE!
Our very spontaneous request was kindly answered by Tracy kindly. We received all necessary information on how to arrive directly.
In the apartment, Tracy thought of everything. Everything necessary was described and available.
We didn't miss anything. On the contrary, we used more than we could imagine before. Kitchen helpers, beach essentials and so on‚Ä¶
The location in Kihei is super. Beach is across the street and you can see whales jumping out of bed with a little luck!
Everything is easy to find in the accommodation because it was described very well and helpful information can be found in many places.
The apartment was clean and tidy as it could be seen in the pictures of the listing.
All in all, I recommend this place
If we come to Maui for a fifth time, we will first ask Tracy.
Thanks!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This condo was great and close to restaurants and local shops beach access pretty close to.

It was cozy and quiet and in the perfect location, a short drive from the airport, to explore Kihei and the rest of Maui. We also appreciated the small details like the sleep machine and the CD player with Hawaiian music, and all the useful beach equipment. Tracy‚Äòs local recommendations were also very helpful. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unit was great, it has ALL the amenities you need for a vacation: beach chairs, beach towels, binoculars (I saw whales!), beach umbrella etc. all in the closet for you to use! Hosts communication was perfect. Inside the unit is a binder of 50 pages with reminders and recommendations which was super helpful too. Love this place."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, near everything."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy was great very accommodating and responsive. I did a last-minute booking and she was very helpful with what she was able to offer and I enjoyed her place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was amazing - she has a huge binder which lists out every question you can think of in regards to the condo, as well as recommendations on what to do, where to eat, etc. etc. I found myself using it quite often to make selections and it was packed full of good info. EVERYTHING in the condo is labeled - which light goes where, which remote does what. I found this to be incredibly useful as well (dummy proof). I literally had zero unanswered questions from Tracy on everything. She is an outstanding host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay! Beach is right across the street. Jacuzzi was perfect after a long day. Everything in the air bnb is labeled so you have no problem finding what you need. Bed was comfy and so nice I could adjust to the firmness I like while my boyfriend could adjust his side to his preference! Tracy really thought of everything you would need. An amazing place to stay- we will definitely be back!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful beach right in front. Clean and organized place. Easy to reach out to the host and very clear instructions.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb. The space is very comfortable and there were so many features that went above and beyond our expectations that we can't really list them all but here are a few. The bed is a sleep number bed, the AC works extremely well, there are plenty of fans, the kitchen had everything we needed, the pool and hot tub were fun to have right outside the building and the host had plenty of great recommendations and good information about the area. Our favorite part and something that is so great about this Airbnb is the location. Across the street is a cove of rocks next to the beach where sea turtles will come ashore at night to rest. Each night my wife and I would watch the sun set over the ocean and watch the turtles come in. Our last night there we spotted at least 12 huge turtles come up onto the beach. I will definitely be looking to stay here again next time we come to Maui."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay with Tracy! She communicates super well. Everything was just as we expected. The sunsets were SPECTACULAR from the little lanai. Plenty of beach towels, chairs, everything you would need to have a wonderful cozy stay. Super clean and stocked with everything you need. The pool and hot tub were clean and refreshing. LOVE the sleep number bed and the relaxing white noise machine. We would LOVE to come back and encourage everyone to come to Maui, tourism is a HUGE piece of the economy. Just be respectful while she and her residents grieve and rebuild. Mahalo!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"WOW talk about a host that has EVERYTHING you can think of. From light switches being labelled to a huge binder with all the things to do, places to eat and all her top recommendations! It was so great having beach chairs, towels, cooler and a beach bag with the beach being so close we had everything we would need. We just ran to target to get some snacks but Tracy had a brita with water already filled ready to go for us. She truly thought of everything to make our stay one of a kind (you can choose the firmness of the bed and there is a sound machine!). Was very clean as well. We will definitely recommend to our friends and family!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 star stay all around. Tracy‚Äôs place was beyond every expectation that we had and more! If you want the perfect place with every single touch possible, this is it. You also couldn‚Äôt find a better host anywhere else! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!! We will definitely stay here every time we come to Maui!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cute little spot! Tracy was very helpful and made sure that everything is labeled inside of the home and clear instructions. Just a note for anyone traveling with a family, this is a small apartment! It can sleep 4 but it might not be the mostly comfortable for 4 adults! It‚Äôs very cute and I loved it! It was perfect for just me while I was between apartments! Thanks so much Tracy!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The host was very responsive to comments and questions. The room was very clean and well organized. There was a sleep number bed and games that my daughter loved playing with. We were very pleased with our stay! We really appreciated the kindness and responsiveness of the host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I needed a last minute condo that was safe, clean, near the airport but also close to the beach and a cute town. Tracy‚Äôs place met all the requirements! It was very easy to book. Tracy responded to me immediately. I was relieved to find a beautifully decorated and modern, immaculate condo last minute. So thankful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy was great. The facility is great. We were evacuated from Lahaina during the wildfires and she provided the check in information promptly. Also tried to extend our stay on the event we needed it. Great location and responsive host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved stayed at Tracy‚Äôs place! Was the perfect beachy/costal vibe we wanted for our Hawaiian honeymoon! We were super relaxed, really enjoyed the pool, tennis & the beach across the street. I would definitely recommend her place to all my friends and family and we would go back for sure! Thank you Tracy ü´∂üèªüå∫"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place and great hospitality
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing!! Check in was a breeze (they finished cleaning early and we checked in 4 hours early!!), very clean and exactly like the photos, and plenty to do!! My girlfriend and I had a blast with only a minute walk to the beach, plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance, and an incredible scenic view. Absolutely no complaints and we highly recommend this unit to anyone and everyone!!
To Tracy: thank you so much!! We had a wonderful stay and we will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Both hosts were extremely responsive and proactive. Being in Kihei, this location was really perfect for us because everywhere we wanted to go on the island was within 1 hour or less which can‚Äôt be said about other places.
The apartment itself is a good enough size for 2 guests and had everything we needed including beach equipment and cooking equipment. It also has a good grill and shared outdoor hot tub and pool which were great after hiking or even just to cool off after coming back from the beach.
When we first arrived, the apartment was mostly clean except a few things in the kitchen but after the hosts asked me how my stay was going I pointed out some things and they were super responsive and even sent the cleaning crew again for us after which the place was great. It was super appreciated and was a perfect example of amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend this place and the hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good times

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!! Besutiful inside
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracys place is exactly as advertised. They have beach chairs, cooler, beach bag which makes it very convenient. Also, this place is close to all the restaurants and beaches. Tracy was very responsive to my questions and overall a very welcoming host."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful condo. Right accross the street from the beach. Great restaurants in walking distance; short drive to Wailea. Loved it.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy‚Äôs place was absolutely wonderful. Great location and all the amenities you could ever dream of. The bed was incredibly comfortable and Tracy was a fantastic host. Would highly recommend to anyone!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and quaint spot well stocked with anything you would need. Especially glad to have beach chairs and towels. Host was very communicative, even checking in when extra rain predicted. We had a lovely stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute spot within walking distance of the beach. Very clean condo with all the amenities. One thing that stood out was that the room contained a book that had nearly every local restaurant menu in it. That is commitment. I enjoyed the beach scene but enjoyed relaxing in my room just as well. I would definitely stay again if I return to this area of the world.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Maui. Tracy‚Äôs unit was absolutely perfect and honestly the best stocked Airbnb I have ever stayed in. We had absolutely everything we needed and more! We opted to eat at home and the porch had a better atmosphere than any restaurant! You could hear the gentle sound of the water from across the street. We picnicked most days at the beach and the beach chairs and umbrellas were amazing but better than that the unit was stocked with a cooler! Perfect for our to go lunches of sandwiches and fruit! The unit was not only adorable, but clean and comfortable. Also - she stocked with great soft fluffy towels which is always a plus! Tracy was so easy to communicate with and offered lots of local advice. Maui is a magical place and this conveniently located unit was close proximity to so many places. We will be back and would love to stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay in. A condo with all the amenities we could think of & many more that I didn't even expect. What stood out about this place is there were instructions for every little thing. Labels on switches, cabinets, remotes etc, made it very easy for us to settle right in and focus on Maui. The hosts have paid an extreme amount of attention to detail and we benefited a lot from it. We mostly didn't even have to reach out to her for anything because most of it was already in the instructions. On the few rare occasions when we did have to ask a question, we got responses really quickly. Often within 5 minutes.
But seriously, the attention to detail has to be seen to be believed. It would take me a long time to list everything that was in this condo. There's a property folder to read with a lot of useful information and even before we got there, we got a few messages outlining important details.
A lot of thought has gone into this, and we are thankful."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! Perfect for a couple or a single!! So clean, such high vibes, loved it!"

Right across the street from a cute little beach and just a short drive from a few more great spots. Lots of delicious food in the area too. There is a book with a lot of great recommendations for restaurants and sites to see. It is located right near a road, but you can‚Äôt hear it in the condo if the door is closed. We loved our stay and would stay again in a heartbeat!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the better stays in Kihei, A/C blows cold, Wi-Fi is fast and stable, sleep number bed overlooks the ocean, what else can one ask for. ;)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location to use as ‚Äúhome base‚Äù for exploring Maui from.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The location is perfection! You can see the ocean from your bed, breathtaking üòç the attention to detail that She puts into her Airbnb is unmatched. Things that I didn‚Äôt even think to bring, she had me covered! She even provided a sound machine which was a lifesaver since I‚Äôm used to sleeping with a rather loud fan. The beach right across the street has sea turtles that naturally hang out in the cove. It‚Äôs a must to go explore. Everything was spotless and the grounds and pool area were cleaned daily. The water pressure in the shower is also amazing. The amount of info that she provides as well as resources made our vacation go off without a hitch and effortless to plan. We can‚Äôt wait to come back. Mahalo!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place is in a great part of Kihei that is close to the beach, has a lot of places to eat, get coffee etc. They have a bunch of beach equipment as well that will make your life a lot easier since you don‚Äôt have to worry about rentals.
The place was a decent size for 2 but will be kind of tight for 4. I‚Äôm a big guy and found myself almost knock off a couple of artifacts off the wall while turning.
That being said, I would happily book this place again in the future."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy home is incredible. She was very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. She also had a binder explaining everything and more than what you need for your stay, it was extremely helpful. Tracy home was breathtaking and very clean and had all of the necessities for our Maui trip.
The neighborhood outside the condo had a lot of life within walking distance. However, it was very quiet when you were inside . The view was amazing you can see the beach across and it was also walking distanceThis is definitely the perfect place to stay in Maui!!!
A pleasure to experience it."

Lots of random beaches to pop off to, including the beach directly across the street. Tracy and her team are attentive and quick to respond.

All the thought and detail that went into making the space comfortable were very much appreciated. It felt more like a service apartment rather than an Airbnb with the cleanliness, professionalism and touches. Would highly recommend this spot to anyone who wants a home away from home in Maui in a very centrally located area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything was as we expected and more! The proximity to the beach was great and Tracy provided so many thoughtful extras for our comfort and convenience.

Great drink blender so we were able to make our morning smoothies and our afternoon icy cold margaritas! All the cooking tools/equipment you would need. We bought fresh, delicious Mahi Mahi a few times and made fantastic meals when we wanted to relax ""at home"". Tracy left instructions for everything in a super helpful detailed binder. She also promptly responded via text to any questions we had. We had a fabulous vacation in our ""home away from home""!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place is exactly as described by all of her guests - immaculate, cozy, and little details thoroughly thought out to perfection.

We particularly made use of her beach gear, coolers, coffee/creamer and to-go mugs! There are so many helpful labels around the unit to make the transition easy for Tracy‚Äôs Treasure to become your home for your time in Maui! The Kihei location is really central to the island which was important to us. My husband and I highly recommend!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND, super clean updated condo, on the first floor (don't have to worry about elevators or stairs). The condo was well equipped with EVERYTHING you need to enjoy your stay on Maui. The location was less than 30 minutes from the airport and less than 5 minutes from many of the touristy shops in Kihei. Kalepolepo beach park was right across the street and could see it from the condo. The communication with the host was very helpful and she was extremely informative. I will definitely be staying here again in the future."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has everything. Great location across the street from the beach. Tracy had many suggestions for our stay which helped guide us on what to do and see in Maui. We will 100% be staying again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is exactly as promised. The supplies were as described/shown pictures. The location is excellent - it can't be over exaggerated. It's 20-25 minutes to Paia, 15 to Wailea, 30 to Lahaina. You could make-do without a rental car. There is a beach literally across the street and you could use door dash, but you can definitely adventure easier with a car. We found the spare beach towels provided really helpful. If you enjoy a sleep-number bed, this is exactly as described and you will like it. We didn't find it comfortable, but that is just personal preference. It's essentially a glorified air mattress, which I certainly didn't expect. The A/C works well and there are plenty of fans. Everything was clean. The hot tub and pool were very nice and extremely well maintained (saw them cleaning multiple days). The host was very communicative and helpful. We highly recommend the downhill biking on Haleakala with Maui Sunriders out of Paia, and a boat excursion with Trilogy!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the coziest Airbnbs I have ever stayed at. Exceeded expectations. No complaints at all!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the condo was exactly as advertised. The unit included everything you could need while there - and more. We were especially thankful for the extremely detailed Property Guide that answered each and every question we had in detail. The Sleep Number bed with dual controls was a nice surprise. The condo is right across the street from a beautiful beach. You couldn't ask for more for the money!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy's place strikes the perfect balance of cozy, laid back beach vibe balanced with contemporary offerings. It is perfectly situated in Kehei, close to the airport, Wailea-Makena, shops, restaurants, Hana Coast drive, and all other activities on the island, not to mention you can walk across the street to the beach. The outdoor shower on the property was also very convenient after a day at the beach. Tracy's attention to detail is unmatched, the apartment comes fully stocked with everything you could have ever imagined needing and then some. Everything is tastefully labeled for ease of use. Will definitely stay at Tracy's place again, highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great and there were so many amazing features included. Loved that everything was well labeled and easy to access so that we didn't have to stress during our vacation. Ample free parking, comfortable bed, fast WiFi and super clean! Checked all our boxes - would highly recommend. Mahalo!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and Tracy has thought of everything! We had a great view of the beach across the street and location was really convenient. Condo was fully stocked!! Tracy is also really responsive. Would stay again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would book with Tracy again 100%, she was so helpful and responsive. The place was just as described, thank you again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Host was very nice even was able to go in an hr earlier. Place was very clean and cute. You have a nice view. Definitely would come back and stay here.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I always love staying at Tracy‚Äôs air bnbs!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would say the best AirBnB stay we ever had! So many details in the condo that we didn‚Äôt expect. Beach chairs, binoculars, dishes of every shape and size, everything clearly labeled! The place was very clean with plenty of extra pillows and blankets! We didn‚Äôt realize it was located directly across the street from our own little semi-private beach. After driving everywhere on the Island in a week, it was clear this was the best location to stay at on Maui do too convenience and the amount of beaches and activities in the area. Most of the excursion activities on the island were booked up months in advance, however Tracy has ‚Äúa guy‚Äù that was able to book us a luaus and assist with other activities! When we got caught in a traffic jam Tracy even helped us adjust our evening plans! Cannot express how satisfied we were with the condo rental and our Super Host Tracy and her crew!! Mahalo! ü§ô"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great place to stay when you are in Maui, not far from the center of Kihei where you can find so many beautiful beaches to surf or snorkel and enjoy the sun. The place is cozy and has so many beach stuff which you can use for free. I love the CD with local music in it. We listened to it everyday when we were back there. I think It is very considerate of the host. Tracy is also a welcoming person and communicate really well with us."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive from the time we booked to the time we checked out. The place was very clean and very nicely decorated. It was complete with everything we needed for our stay. It really felt like a beach home.
Having a nice sized pool, hot tub, laundry and ample parking on this complex made it very convenient. The beach across the street had an area with breakwater wall that is great for children and amateur swimmers. Seeing so many turtles on this beach was our favorite part. Location is near many restaurants, grocery stores and beaches. High end shopping is also about 10-15 minutes away. We hope to be back soon. Aloha!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay. It beats the price 5x over.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"our stay at Debbie/Doug/Tracy's was awesome. we were on a casual vacation. the place has all utilities one would need, and more. the kitchen was well stocked - had coffee, cereal, milk among others. there were beach towels, chairs and other beach amenities. the place had clear instructions at right locations. music lovers have been taken into consideration with Ukulele and music player. book lovers will enjoy an interesting collection of books. fitness enthusiasts can find tennis rackets and weights. there is a nice patio (not fully private). furnitures reflect aesthetics. sleep quality is very good. Keaka beach is 5 mins walk.
to summarize, yes, we would come back here and suggest to others too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such a wonderful stay here. The place is so comfortable, clean and cozy. I‚Äôm impressed by all the details put into the place. Tracy is so thoughtful and provided clear instructions. The communication was also very smooth.
The location is perfect and not far from all the spots we planned to go. I‚Äôd book again if I come back in the future!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can‚Äôt go wrong with Tracy‚Äôs place. She has thought of everything you could possibly need in each room. Highly recommend you stay for awhile if possible. Comfortable and easy to sit back and completely relax. It‚Äôs quiet, light, bright and yet homey feeling. Communication was thorough, quick and always pleasant and helpful. Highly recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here with my wife for 2 nights after some nights in Hana. 3 star hotel resorts were outrageously expensive for a mediocre and small-sized hotel room, so we decided to book an airbnb. It did not disappoint and the interior of the place was comparable to a $500-$600/night hotel suite on the West side of the island, but at half the price.
Debbie's guest book had a binder full of information ranging from where to eat tips to detailed instructions on how to enjoy her condo. She had labels on all electronic devices and anywhere you could possibly imagine, which made it easy to locate and use.
Her place was very well managed and decorated with a beach house vibe. Great location in Kihei next to popular beaches, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Would highly recommend! She's very personable, too :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Its been 6 days since we stayed at your beautiful condo. We were blessed to have at least 1 night because of the short notice looking, and you were available. I just have to say, it was so peaceful walking in, with the colors an location, I was feeling this. My husband loved it too and wish we booked more nights with you. You will see us again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debbie‚Äôs place was perfect to a quick stay and easy access to things on the south side of the island!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location & great amenities
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Kehei was very enjoyable. Our condo was in great location and comfortable. The beach is literally across the street from the complex. Tracy was very responsive to our needs. I hope to return soon.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything we were looking for! Everything was so organized, clean, and pest-free. We really enjoyed our stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, super amazing stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great studio for visiting the island! We were out most of the day every day, but this is was a great, clean, comfortable home base. Communication was clear and came with all kinds of local suggestions."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down most thoughtfully curarted and put together AIRBNB. Perfect cozy beach front apartment that truly is a treasure.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's place is magnificent. It is in a great location, close to a ton of places to eat/beautiful beaches and the place is fully stocked with everything you can imagine. The sleepnumber bed is comfortable and the place is quiet and immaculately clean. It was the only night out of all the other places we stayed around the island we got to cook a homemade meal as she had absolutely everything stocked -- even a rice cooker, blender, etc. All beach items are available as well. Would absolutely recommend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very last minute trip for us so we were delighted to be able to book such a well rated place. It was smaller than I would have liked but that was on me. Tracy's place is perfect for one or two people. Or a couple with a small child who doesn't mind sharing a snugged bed.
Besides that, everything was very well thought out. I can tell that the owner put some serious thought into every detail. The location was also pretty great. Just a few steps from the beach and a mile from the best shaved ice on the island, the best breakfast spot, a store to get essentials.
Not going to lie, I had fancies of living here for the rest of my life! :)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The gem of all gems.We enjoyed our stay at Tracy's tropical treasure. Great location to be at ! Beautiful updated and clean studio. My wife enjoyed the beach theme, the decor , and all the details in the studio. The day after checkout , my wife realized she left her small accessories bag with my wedding ring in it. We called Tracy and without hesitation she drove one hour to the studio to check for the bag. She found it ! Thank you Tracy and Doug , you two are lifesavers. We are grateful for you."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy & her accommodations are soooo amazing. Literally the most amazing Airbnb accommodations I‚Äôve ever experienced out of quite many. She really sets the bar. Immaculate & jam packed with so many thoughtful details. I have stayed in two of her rentals over the last couple years in Maui & they were both 5 stars in every possible way.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a great place to stay on the south side of Maui, this is it!! This place provides a well stocked kitchen, beach supplies, an assortment of books/movies/games, literally anything you could want was provided by Tracy!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such a lovely stay at Tracy‚Äôs place. She and her team were super responsive from the moment we booked.

Would love to stay there again someday"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend! Great place for a girls' trip for my mother and I. We both felt very comfortable and most of all, welcome here. Tracy is a great host. One of the most organized and detail oriented I have rented through. She has probably thought of everything you will need for your stay long before you do. Love that everything is labeled and it feels just like a home. Plus, Tracy was communicative with us through booking all the way to checkout. Here you get all the amenities of a resort stay with more privacy and less crowds. Great location for those who want to do the road to Hana and short drive to Lahaina and the airport. Additionally, the apartment was VERY clean which was of utmost importance for us right now. Thanks for having us!!!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is AMAZING.. Tracy is fabulous and is so quick to responding to any questions or concerns! The Airbnb is a 10 out of 10 for me.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Debbies for my last two nights on a two week trip to Maui. This studio apartment is beautifully designed , thoughtfully well equipped, and is as pictured . The host was very responsive which I appreciated . The place is right across the street from a beach .
My only regret is that I did not stay long enough to enjoy all the thoughtful details in this unit . It does face a main road but I was not bothered at all . Highly recommend!!!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best place to stay! The location is basically on the beach with access to a pool, hot tub, kitchen and laundry. The weather was great and the afternoon wind allowed for a nice breeze.
Tracy is incredibly helpful, quick and takes pride in offering a true Maui welcome.
This area was less commercial/crowded which I really liked but a quick car ride to the larger hotels and beach fronts."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in TRACY‚ÄôS TROPICAL TREASURES #4 and was everything perfect! The place is really nice, very clean and exactly how it was in the pictures. The place is located in a great spot of Maui, close to restaurants and markets. I can‚Äôt forget the view from the apartment which is amazing, you can open the window shades and see the ocean. I hope to come back very soon to this magical paradise. Aloha üå∫üåà"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for four days and it was an amazing four days! I will say Kihei was close to a lot of food places along with the beaches.

Overall would stay here again when we visit maui again:)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean, super well organized, and comfortable.
Lots of cute artwork, a comfy bed, and plenty of beach gear to use.
Shower pressure was great.
There was quite a bit of traffic noise from the street directly out front, so we kept the sliding door closed for our stay and did not use the patio space; this is something to consider if you‚Äôre wanting a more quiet outdoor seating.
Tracy was super responsive throughout our stay and very friendly!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at! Not usually one to write long reviews but this place literally had everything, and then some. We wanted to find a place where we could cook everyday and the fully stocked kitchen exceeded our expectations. From pots pans, utensils, spices, Tupperware, a tea kettle, coffee maker, rice maker, tooooons of other odds and ends. So much thought went into this place, everything is even labeled which was a huge help. The place itself is absolutely adorable and very well kept. There‚Äôs even movies, board games, cards, tons of travel books, etc. We were able to borrow beach chairs, coolers and even an umbrella for our beach adventures too. We loved spending mornings on the back patio with the ocean view. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place! The owners really thought of everything, highly highly recommend!! We enjoyed our stay so much, thank you!"

You can access the west side of the island as well as go down to the east side with ease, even the drive to Haleakala crater is not that long from here.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phuong‚Äôs place is probably most affordable yet welcoming place on Maui. We enjoyed our stay here 8/10. The only let downs are AC aren‚Äôt that powerful and make a lot of noise at night, and our shower head did start to break when we checked in. Those are all minor issue compared to some 3-4 Star hotel on the island that still have cockroaches in its bedrooms that might cost you more. Thank you for hosting us! Aloha!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host went above and beyond with recommendations and very responsive. It was an absolutely lovely stay. We were very impressed at how clean and spacious it was. No improvements we can think of. We are grateful for the time, sights, and warm welcome!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Hi
The apartment matched description. Hostess is very friendly and helpful. Responds ASAP when I reached out for anything. Phuong was kind enough to allow us the extra flex to take a quick shower before we left for airport even though we had checked out. Appreciate it very much.
Three items I would recommend a change -
1. Change their AC - it takes all day to cool the room down. Possibly it's old and too small a unit for the job.
2. Change their currently available hot plate in kitchen - it really does not heat up properly.
3. Provide water and tissue box in room for guests.
However, in the larger scheme, these are easily changed items. I strongly recommend this apartment as good value for money."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious and updated condo unit in a older complex. Overall it was a good stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay‚Ä¶ great room, great views, and great host! Someone was there to greet us and help with check-in, and whenever he saw us around, always greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed! Room was very clean and comfortable; looked just like the pictures! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At first, I was thinking of canceling this trip due to the wildfires on Maui, but my host's accurate information and advice made me feel at ease. I was'especially impressed with the delicious food at all the restaurants recommended by my hosts. The location of lodgings was convenient to everywhere we wanted to go. The only regret was the presence of insects, which is unavoidable in the great outdoors. Other than that, the rooms were clean and nice. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone who is going to stay there. All in all, it was great."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice studio, had everything we needed for our stay. Very clean, updated and just comfortable! Right by the airport, it‚Äôs not on a touristy side, so it‚Äôs depending on what you want. I felt like it was centered to other locations, very convenient."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was just as it looked from the pictures. AC was great! It‚Äôs actually way nicer and up to date! Very quiet place which is great. Instructions are super clear and check in was easy. What‚Äôs great at night is the place has trees with lights wrapped around it which makes it extremely easy to locate at night! Parking had no problem. Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time thanks to Phuong and Jerra. It was very convenient to be near the Airport and Costco. Phuong was incredibly responsive and thoughtful, she provided us with lovely recommendations. Overall a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phuong‚Äôs place was really nice and convenient! The room was comfortable and the place is close to great local restaurants and supermarkets (<5 min away). Phuong was also very helpful in responding to my questions and giving local recommendations. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Maui!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phuong‚Äôs place was convenient central location and close to where I needed to go for visiting family and local events. Apartment was clean and private. I like that it is not in a tourist area. It is also across the street from one of the best restaurants on Maui!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,feel like staying at home with this cosy unit and fully equipped kitchen. the host recommended lots of good restaurants and very responsive.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay at this place with good view of the mountain, close to good restaurants. I love the location because it is only 10 minutes drive to Kanaha beach, the best place in the world to do wing foiling/ windsurfing. The place also have portable kitchen stove and utensils to cook simple meals/ breakfast and most importantly it has keurig cofee maker :-)‚Ä¶My recommendation for improvement will be to have beach chairs and snorkeling gears available. It would be nice also to have drying rack for wet clothes. Other than that, it is a great place for vacation and Phuong is very responsive to questions / requests."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can get a gorgeous mountain right in front of your window
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, nice, exactly as pictured."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location
Beautifully remodeled condo
Many kitchen extras
Great clean bathroom with plenty of toiletries.
Great value for Maui.
Not a picturesque area but very functional place to stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a stay at Wailuku, has everything you need and close to restaurants, stores and local sights.
Has a beautiful view from the window."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phuong‚Äôs location was a hidden gem. The space and spectacular views of the mountains from the room windows were amazing. the space was clean and very private. Quite area for a small getaway and/or downtime. I would definitely utilize this location again for future visits to the area and recommend friends to stay here if they venture out to Maui as-well.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a good time staying at this Studio. Has everything you need for a short stay in Maui.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay! My partner and I went to Maui for the weekend and this was the perfect spot! We were close to the airport so it was convenient. She also let us check in 2 hours earlier than check in time so we were able to get ready for the beach! We will definitely be staying here again! Great deal.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great option conveniently located to the airport. We stayed 1 night to get a good rest before heading up the road to Hana. Clean space, clean bathroom, everything we needed for a quick turn-around the next morning."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This corner unit was clean and looked exactly like the photos. The view of the mountains was beautiful and the host was very responsive, with many local restaurant recommendations. The AC unit is a bit loud though. I‚Äôd recommend this place to others!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest hostels I‚Äôve stayed in. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit maui
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs as described. Everything was good
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are on a budget and don't mind sharing the space, this is a great spot. The front desk staff was super friendly. They provide local tours as well."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place!!! It was perfect for 4, and the kitchen had everything we needed to make lunch and dinners. The bed is so comfortable, and pull out is easy to make. The location was perfect, and you can see all the surfers right from the balcony! The community was so friendly and nice. The one thing (our fault) that we did not realize was that there is no AC, but they are an abundance of fans and opening the balcony doors cools down the place easily!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful residence very well maintained. Well located for the visits we made ( road to Hana, Haleakala volcano as well as the beaches to Kaanapali ).
The listing's amenities were as described. Very serious host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent central location to drive in all directions. 10 min drive to Walmart / target. Walk to Maui aquarium, Carl‚Äôs Jr, gas station, beach down the road, beach on the bay.
Great view. Loved sleeping and waking up to the sound of waves splashing against the shoreline. Sunrises are awesome. Unable to see sunsets.
Pool, manicured lawn, and grill were nice amenities."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, good view.
A bit far from the action on the island.
It's more like an isolated community great for elderlies.
But overall it was relaxing."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. The view was gorgeous, and the sound of the ocean was incredible. The kitchen was well stocked, and we had everything we needed for the beach."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best place to stay. If you look at the sea from the porch, the time flies by.
I drank beer every day while staying in the accommodation and looked at the sea ~ ~ ~ I want to stay again"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view was amazing; and a great location on the island, easy to get to all sites. Everything was as described. Thank you for sharing your condo, I would recommend to anyone staying on Maui!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Host was responsive and very accommodating (ie: let us check out a bit later).
Description was accurate - right on the ocean, able to see whales, etc!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I wanted to find a place on Maui that allowed us to explore the entire island without having to drive too far, and this was a great location for that. The views from the balcony were amazing. We could not believe how many whales we were able to spot from here. The condo had all the amenities we needed."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved this place. Went to see the whales, could spot them from the lanai with the help of binoculars we had brought. Loved sitting on the lanai in the mornings and evenings, just breathtaking views of the ocean, full moon while we were there. Loved the location, we walked around to the Maalaea Harbor, there were some shops and several restaurants there. We loved the poke so much, would rather buy it by the pound and eat at home than at a restaurant. Didn't take long to drive to Kihei, bought the most delicious poke from South Maui Fish Company in Kihei. Drove just a little way to The Country Market at Maui Tropical Plantation purchasing fresh papaya and pineapple. Wasn't far to Lahaina where we went on a whale tour, wasn't far to Hookipa beach, beautiful there, watched surfers, turtles, was wonderful. If you are there long enough, it isn't far to Costco where we purchased poke there, it was also delicious. There is so much to see on Maui, we needed more time."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place
Amazing view, you can see big whale from balcony.
Recommendations to host : new wine glasses, bbq tools, new towels‚Ä¶. Would make te stay even better"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The location is good for our family with a 14- month old. It is not located in a very touristy area. The condo complex is quiet and has a very nice view on the ocean. We enjoyed the heated swimming pool and the community grill. My baby got the chance to play with local kids:-) We once had an issue with the bathroom faucet and the host fixed it right away! It would be perfect if the condo could be bigger and newer- it looked much bigger and nicer in the pictures.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints. It‚Äôs pretty quiet, the others staying nearby were friendly as well. If you‚Äôre not accustomed to sleeping without AC this could be a draw back. I get really hot at night naturally, but they do offer many fans. It just wasn‚Äôt enough for someone like me who sleeps with my house cold. Outside of that it‚Äôs more than perfect. Beach is walking distance restaurants are walking distance, and the view is amazing"
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view is amazing. The unit needs some tender loving care. Had some issues, company was quick to respond. We asked for a late check out and they said yes. But some how their system didn‚Äôt get the updated info and we got locked out with our phones and luggage inside the unit. thank goodness a neighbor helped us get in touch with the realtor/manager/owner/Mgn company, I was not happy but it worked out. I don‚Äôt believe we will rent the unit again"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend this stay!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,thank you for letting us stay at your place. we loved it everything was soclean & the view was beautiful
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is clean but a bit run down and needs some renovation.
Too late check in time at 5pm and too early check out time at 10am.
Bedroom is near the carpark so it‚Äôs noisy and can hear guests arriving late evening and guests leaving early morning.
Location is good with a nice view."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, easy to get to location. Fantastic lovely hosts! Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean. We got everything what we need without even asking. Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place has an incredible view with a well stocked kitchen and all the stuff you need for a beach day which is a huge plus! The treats waiting for us were really thoughtful and a nice touch. The only downside is the condo is not very close to restaurants and stores but it‚Äôs not too bad to drive places. The hosts were awesome and very quick to respond. Great stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My now husband and I spent 8 days here for our wedding and honeymoon and were so sad to leave! The views and front lawn just cannot be beat in this condo. We saw so many sea turtles right up against the rocks just outside and whales out in the bay üòçüòç
The location was really wonderful for us because we were able to easily explore the entire island and feel centrally located.
There is no a/c which is weird for me being from steaming hot Texas but once we got used to the fans and adjusted the windows it was wonderful.
I would absolutely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Hosts were very accommodating. We walked each morning to the general store and enjoyed coffee and breakfast while watching the sunrise.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was perfect for a romantic getaway. We loved sitting on the porch and watching the water. The room was comfortable and well taken care of. We were welcomed with a little gift basket of Hawaiian treats when we arrived and the hosts were so gracious to reach out and make sure everything was as it should be. My husband and I would absolutely stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed here for our 8 night honeymoon, everything was amazing! The view is just as shown in the photos. There are sea turtles right outside! We slept with all of the windows and sliding doors open and never had an issue with noise. We loved the beach chairs, snorkel gear, umbrellas, there was even sunscreen and bug spray in the unit! The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could need, even a blender and coffee maker. The location is convenient for someone who wants to see many parts of the island, most of the major attractions are within a 20-30 minute drive. The host was very kind and responsive. I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone visiting Maui."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, right on the water. Waking up to sunset every morning, and having the pool right there was outstanding. Right in the middle of the island with easy access to everything and free parking! Loved our stay, and can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall great stay! The location was convenient, the ocean view was amazing, and the hosts were super nice and helpful. Would recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic location, beautiful stay, extremely cooperative hosts."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place has stunning views it located in between the major cities on the island. There isn‚Äôt AC so be prepared to have it be toasty 24/7 but the pool was a nice touch along with the stunning view.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, well located, clean and very peaceful!
Host is very atentious, always reaching back checking if we needed anything.
If we get the opportunity to get back to Maui, we will definetly stay there again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful sunset views! Cute and clean place, went above and beyond to meet our needs for an early check-in!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo is a great place to stay on your trip to Maui. The condo is perfectly located between west and south Maui, just 20 minutes in either direction. The walk to the beach from the condo is quick and easy. The condo itself has everything you need! The furniture is all super comfortable. It was also really handy to have access to a laundry room. I couldn‚Äôt recommend staying here more."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice and beautiful place, and all kitchen utensils were provided, so I had a fun vacation with my family."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this Condo. The host was available for contact any time. The condo was simply amazing. The views are exactly what the photos showed! I loved the location and easy accessibility! I only had one small issue, but I blame myself because I didn‚Äôt pay attention to listing: the condo is only a 1 bedroom condo. There were two photos of the same bedroom where the bed had two different comforters on, so I thought it was a 2 bedroom condo. I brought two teenage boys and they had to sleep on the couch bed together. They never complained and had a great time. Just pay attention to the listing to ensure you don‚Äôt expect one thing and get another. The views were spectacular. I woke up every morning and watched the sunrise. An experience I will never forget!! We had a blast!!!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great! The process, including check-in and out was simple and clearly stated. The AirBnB was clean and provided a ton of useful amenities, such as a cooler, boogie board and beach chairs. We enjoyed watching the beautiful sunrise each morning and swimming in the pool. The location in terms of driving distance to a few areas was perfect - during our short stay here, we were able to explore the Road to Hana, Haleakala National Park and the Wailea-Makena area. The reason for the 3 star rating on location, is it would have been nice to have restaurants/food within walking distance. During our stay, the only place open was Tante's Fishmarket. Aside from that, I would recommend this AirBnB as it was a great stop during out time in Hawaii."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay and the views are to die for. Would recommend 100%!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Airbnb was by far one of the best experiences we‚Äôve had! There was full communication with our host from the very beginning, and they were incredibly accommodating in letting us check in a few hours earlier than anticipated. Everything you can possibly think of is offered at this accommodation. The views fun the balcony are stellar and the breeze that comes in from the ocean is perfect. No need for AC when you have the cool ocean breeze coming through the lanai. The area is also incredibly central to most locations around the island which is a plus! Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again in the future."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely going back to this condo. Wella is so great host. its in the heart of Maui. near of everything you want to visit. Host makes our Maui visit more memorable. Thanks Ading Wella!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Staying here was the best decision we made. We had a peaceful stay with amazing views both at sunrise and sunset. We slept to the sound of the ocean. We enjoyed the location as well. We will definitely stay again next time we are in Maui.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow what a amazing Airbnb. Everything was very clean, lots of kitchen supplies, nice smelling soap in the bathroom, lots of extra blankets and pillows for the pullout couch, and LOTS OF FANS ! They really made sure no one would be hot with all the amazing fans, and there is a amazing off shore breeze. 10/10 would recommend they made such a special experience for our stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So great‚Ä¶ we so enjoyed the stay! What a great view and so close to aquarium. Clean and good communication!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing view and accommodations!
Definitely recommend staying here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for our trip. Check in and access was easy. Room was clean and comfortable for our one night stay. Host was easy to get ahold of and very accommodating. Thank you for going above and beyond.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Completely worth it for the view alone. Even better than in the pictures. Everything else was perfectly fine, and the bed is comfortable."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so nice waking up and hanging coffee with tranquil views of the ocean and pool.
We loved how it was easy to get anywhere from the condo. We could get to Kihei, Paia, and Lahaina easily. We could walk to one beach easily and drive to many many more. We took a surfing lesson about ten minutes from the condo which was nice at 7amüòÑ Host was easy to communicate with and check in/it was easy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The view is absolutely beautiful! There is a small lawn area you can stargaze from that is just breath taking at night. We had to book last minute after our plans changed and the host was so kind to us! We cannot recommend this stay enough!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our 4 nights here. It‚Äôs central location makes most areas of Maui accessible in about 30 minutes or less, which made restaurants, beaches, and exploring easy. Upon entering the condo, there was a personalized note and snacks, including Hawaii famous chocolates. The condo is super cute, homey, and stocked with everything you need to cook at home or head to the beach. Like most places on the island, one should be prepared that there is no AC and opening windows and using all the fans was necessary, especially during the daytime. The grounds were VERY well maintained and amenities such as the oceanfront grill and pool were cleaned daily. There are sea turtles and cute black crabs every day by the sea wall down below the lawn, and a beautiful landscape and pool to enjoy (though not before 9am or you might get griped at by neighbors). Nearby to the condo is the Maui Ocean Center, which is an incredible aquarium and oceanography center, as well as the Maui Tropical Plantation, and many beaches. We chose to spread our Maui vacation out to 3 different spots on the island, but this condo is so cute and fun we could have easily stayed here the whole time and been very happy."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. We were there for the last week of May. From the moment we landed in Maui and throughout our stay the communication with the host was great. Although, I might have been a nuisance early on that was completely my fault as I didn‚Äôt consider the time difference and we landed 6hrs ahead of check-in. That was on me, however, communication was flawless, and they helped get us in earlier. Not advised as they were still cleaning our place when we arrived and I felt extremely bad for overwhelming Loraine, the cleaning lady, she was also great!
This was my mom‚Äôs dream vacation and this place checked everything off the list. The view from our patio was amazing and beach entrance was like a 10min walk. You cannot get down to the beach from here but once you settle in and spend full day trips away from this place, you're glad it‚Äôs for residents only. There is a peace and quiet across the place that really emphasizes your vacation and time away from the big city. Residents here are also extremely welcoming and polite. The place is fully stocked with most things you need from a pair of snorkel gear and fins which we took to Honolua Bay to beach umbrellas and towels that we took to Charles Young beach and a nice little cooler we took to Kaanapali Beach.
This place is smack in the middle of the island and a great starting point for most things. Maalaea Harbor is also a 10min walk so if you booked an ocean excursion make sure its out of this place and you won‚Äôt have to deal with parking as its just a nice little walk away. I mean what else do I say. I hated leaving this place. Book this place you wont regret it. READ TH RULES (PDF) that‚Äôs sent to you before arriving and I guarantee you will love this place 100%. I like to party and rage just as much as the next guy, but this was a trip for my mom, and this is that type of place."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for us! Cozy condo with an amazing view! The hosts were very welcoming and communicated extremely well! Definitely recommend this and the view from your window is amazing
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful view. We appreciated the quick communication and easy process. Thanks again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The condo was in a good location with a pretty view, and it was clean. We enjoyed the stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy checkin and checkout, beautiful view from the deck, convenient to anywhere on the island"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy to get to any part of the island. Views are incredible as advertised. There is no A/C if that is an issue. Would recommend as a great place to familiarize yourself with the island."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice spot to stay indoors and relax, the beach nearby is more for walking, so if you want to go in the water, plan on driving. Nice, flexible owner :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing condo with great views, clean and an easy checkin process."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were clear and communicative, which made the whole check in and check out process really easy. The kitchen is complete with pots, pans, etc. There's a big fridge and a stove. There's also a closet full of boogie boards and things for the beach. Overall a well prepared apartment for a good stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic quiet location with attentive hosts. Beach accessories like towels, umbrella, snorkel equipment were a nice plus. Patio furniture and view were great all day. Pool was warm and quiet. Lock restaurants and marina within walking distance. Beware of local beaches without lifeguards- lock your belongings or you will lose them."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place to stay! So lovely and clean, also walking distance to Sugar beach which is a great place to have a morning or sunset stroll. The hosts are so attentive and friendly! It‚Äôs also very centrally located and super easy to get anywhere you‚Äôd like to go in the island. Do yourself a favor and book this spot, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing place and our only wish was that we were staying longer! It had everything you could imagine and more. The views were incredible and it was the ideal place to truly relax. The location is perfect for exploring the coast from Lahaina to Makena Beach. Highly, highly recommend and if we return to Maui, we're booking here for longer."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home with breathtaking views , super clean, quiet neighborhood, and all the amenities you need. Plenty of space for our family of 3 to relax and hang out."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The sunrise views and just the overall views of this unit was incredible. The location worked out perfectly as it was walking distance to the Ma'alaea Harbor to go on one of the many Molokini Crater snorkeling tours.
Quaint 1 BR/1BA condo with a nice balcony overlooking the harbor and a great view of Haleakala. No AC so once you get in, open the BR windows and sliding glass door to have the tradewinds cool it down if it's hot. I would have liked to see a more updated/remodeled unit.
Overall a nice place to be."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful complex towards the see. Balcony also great view. The apartment was not tiptop clean and the decor was a bit grubby. But host was very kind and helpful.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, right on the beach. Falling asleep and waking up to the sound of ocean waves is priceless!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great spot! We saw so many turtles in the water and loved swimming in the pool. The breeze keeps the unit cool and over all it was a peaceful spot but also close to many activities and beaches!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at Maui Vacation. The host kept us up-to-date with changes to Hawaii's COVID travel restrictions and provided us a ton of information that prepared us for our stay. The house guide was excellent in itself. The condo was in a great location with a beautiful view and short walk to the Maui Ocean Center and other attractions. The bed was comfy and everything was well stocked. We loved our stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location with a great view.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù view
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here! It was the most perfect location on the island if your looking to explore because you can access all sides of the island! Check in and check out was really easy and parking is right in front of the door. Place was extremely clean and offered everything that you need! Loved sitting outside on the lawn chairs with amazing views day and night. At night it‚Äôs super relaxing and you can see the stars! I would definitely come back 10 out of 10.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The condo is great and conveniently located. The only thing is that the mattress in the bedroom and pullout sofa is very soft.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super sweet family to work with! Very clean! Great location!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location. Beautiful sunrises, whale shows all day long during the season, the list goes on. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Great centrally located home base for all there is to do and explore on Maui."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,üòÅ
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view alone is worth it. Every morning we woke up to whales and sea turtles. It was such an amazing experience. The host were always available with any questions we had. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want a quiet place in the best location ever than this should be your choice hands down. It had everything and the view was the best. I miss it already. Especially the bed. We opened all of the windows up and the patio door and had the most wonderful breeze that lulled me to sleep each night. It was hands down one of my top 5 AirBNB experiences!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome hosts who went above and beyond the call of duty. The condo is well-stocked with all the beach essentials, and the hosts even left a welcome package for us! It felt very personal and comfortable, and we wish we could have stayed longer. Highly recommend if you want privacy with a view."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Very clean with beautiful views and clean heated pool. The complex was very well kept. The owners are very professional, thoughtful, and had everything to make your vacation wonderful! She even took the time to make a binder of island history and break down different attractions that are very helpful to visitors. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were even worse. Plan on bringing your own pillows unless they replaced them before your stay. Other than that it‚Äôs a 5‚≠êÔ∏è place with 5‚≠êÔ∏è owners!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the dream place to stay at. Oceanfront, lovely condo with stunning view from the balcony/living room. Plus, very good internet speed. We enjoyed our stay a lot, will definitely visit again. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time during our stay. They provided everything we needed during our stay, and then some. Plus , you just can‚Äôt beat the waves rocking you sleep at night. We didn‚Äôt get to swim in the pool but we could see it from the balcony along with the ocean. Overall, we would definitely come back here next time we‚Äôre in Maui."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay overall, good location with 360 degree views from the deck. Extremely kind and super responsive throughout the stay, would highly recommend if you're looking for a stay in this neighborhood."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful location and great host. I would most definitely stay here again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying here. The host was extremely helpful. The condo has awesome view from the balcony.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend. Great place. Wonderful vacation spot!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"perfect location to start your Maui trip. close to the airport and Ma'alea Bay (aquarium and whale watching)
the view from the apartment is pure paradise üå¥ and the apartment is fully equipped."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome view, quiet, serene and can even see turtles if you sit out. Place has everything you can think of.. from coffee filters to soap for laundry and sunscreen. Best air bnb I‚Äôve stayed at and excellent and clear communication with the host."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this spot! The views are stunning and the condo is cozy and cute. The hosts were awesome and were quick to communicate and help with check in, and answer any other questions we had. The location is very centrally located and close to anything you might need. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is located in Wailuku which is centrally located on the island of Maui on the south side. This puts you in a convenient location of either driving to Lahiana towards the west or beginning the Road to Hana taking the counterclockwise route in the east.
Check-in is simple using a keypad lock to access the property and if you have a vehicle then you can park it close by in a dedicated spot for this unit.
The interior has everything you need for your stay such as a bedroom with one bed, full bathroom, kitchen, living room, and balcony. Beach equipment such as chairs and towels are also available for your use. You also have a view of the ocean and pool in which you also have access during your stay.
As other reviewers have noted, this unit does not have an AC but it does have fans to circulate the air in the unit. Keeping the sliding glass door on the balcony open and the screen door closed can help keep the unit cooler with the constant breeze coming inside.
Overall a good stay and recommended for any individual person or couple looking to stay central in Maui."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I LOVED staying here! The views were gorgeous & the hosts were super friendly! They communicated everything very clearly & were available to help when needed! We didn‚Äôt get into the room until late at night, but after waking up & seeing how beautiful it was, I wish we had made it in sooner. üòÇ If I make another trip to Maui, I will def be requesting to stay here again! Mahalo to the awesome hosts! ü§ôüèº"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures dont do it justice! Host was great throughout and made sure we didnt need anything. Will definitely be back
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location as you are just about center to anything you want to do. The property is amazing with beautiful views and clean. And the host was amazing, communication prior to the trip and during the trip was awesome!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was AMAZING and far exceeded our expectations. Along side the breathtaking views, the condo complex was clean, well-kept, and peaceful. The rental is away from the ‚Äútouristy‚Äù parts of the island, but easily reached with a short drive. The condo had everything we needed for a nice beach day including chairs, coolers, boogie boards, sun hats, goggles, and much more! The complex offered great amenities with two nice community grills, and a heated pool (both cleaned every morning.) The Bay offers a constant breeze which helps cool off the unit or yourself while you sunbathe.
The hosts kept in constant communication with us and answered our questions promptly. They were friendly, gracious, and offered great insight to the many wonderful attractions and restaurants the island offers.
The only slight negative I can comment on is the parking stalls. The spots are very slim, so if you have a wide vehicle, watch your door. Obviously, the hosts can‚Äôt control this, however, I wanted to give anyone a heads up.
All-in-all, we cannot say enough positive things about this rental, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a great, relaxing stay in Maui!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give this Airbnb 6 stars! My gf and I have never been to Hawaii and landed 10pm at night. When we woke up in this Airbnb the next day at 6am, we were shocked with how truly beautiful the sunset was off the balcony. It was quite and incredibly calming as the sun peaked over the mountain. The place was spotless, there was a birthday note for me, and they even had popcorn and Hawaii chocolates as snacks for us. It was also within walking distance of our snorkeling adventure! Truly a great place to stay and will 100% return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous week at this gorgeous apartment, the sunrise view everyday was magical , And the daily walk to the harbor was so refreshing before we had breakfast at the beautiful balcony, I highly recommend this place ."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was exactly as described and communication was superb. We had EVERYTHING that we needed to spend our days at the beach; chairs, coolers, noodles, boogies boards, sun hats... the condo supplied a lot more than we were expecting. We wouldn't hesitate to book this condo again for our next Maui stay."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay at the oceanfront property with a beautiful view! We would stay at this property again in a heartbeat whenever we are back in Maui.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is awesome. You cannot beat the location. It is a short drive to wherever u want to go. The hosts are super responsive and very easy to get a hold of. Also the place had all kinds of info if u were not sure on what do that day. Would recommend this too anyone.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing place! The owners have truly thought through every detail. We stayed for two days at the end of our honeymoon. The owners left a personalized welcome note, have a very thorough guide to the property, recommendations on things to do, places to eat, etc. They also are so kind as to provide beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards which we enjoyed very much on our walk to the beach! The views are beautiful, the building is so clean and quiet. We will definitely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"By far the most amazing place we have stayed at! We were so INCREDIBLY appreciative of all the little accoutrements, from the snorkels and goggles and flippers to things like dish soap and baby powder. They provided everything we could think of, and even a few things we hadn't. The guest book provided all the information we could possibly want and was beautifully organized. It included helpful suggestions for everything from beaches to food. The owners provided great communication from the moment we booked providing updates on the COVID clearance process right up to the day we checked out. We really appeciated their quick responses and super helpful nature.
The home was absolutely stunning and waking up to that view each morning was incredible. Our son LOVED the pool and was eagerly counting down until it opened each day- such a nice touch to have it located in a spot you can view the ocean while you swim. We were initially a little concerned about the lack of A/C but the wind in that location gives a perfect breeze through the unit and keeps it cool. There are also numerous fans to circulate the air. Having all the kitchen untensils and set up we could possibly want made cooking meals a breeze. This place truly felt like a home away from home!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Place is as described. We loved hanging out on the lawn at night üòç

I can‚Äôt recommend staying here enough and look forward to returning!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time staying in the Maui Vacation rental. The view was well worth it! The host responded very quickly whenever I had any questions.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Super convenient location with all the necessities needed for a comfortable stay. The hosts were amazing at communicating during our stay as well as the days leading up. Upon arrival we really liked the keyless entry, and the overall cleanliness of the place.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Before I talk about this place I first want to say that of all the hosts I‚Äôve had using air bnb, Lunario is up there with the best of them. Responsive, caring, and hospitality of the highest standard. She made our trip. Now to the apartment. Clean, comfortable, with solid WiFi. Great location! Super convenient for anywhere you‚Äôd want to go in Maui. 20 or so minutes from the airport, about the same from Lahaina, and 10 min from
Kihei, so if you‚Äôre going to explore, this place is the perfect home base. But the real kicker is the spectacular view. Phenomenal panoramic ocean view from the kitchen/living room. It‚Äôs like having a priceless painting to stare at all day, or like having the beach in your living room. There‚Äôs no substitute for a view like the one here, and when I return to Maui, I will be looking for this place again."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I chose here for a last vacation before baby comes, and there is nothing we would have changed about it! The view is absolutely gorgeous, and it was wonderful to have the balcony to sit out on and have meals. We also loved that everything you need for both cooking (utensils, pots and pans, etc) and going to the beach was provided‚Äîsaved lots of money and was so convenient that way. I also thought the bed was SO comfortable. We also liked how it was a little removed from the resort areas‚Äîhad the more private feel we were looking for. Sugar Beach is about a 10-minute walk from the apartment, and was our favorite beach because it was so calm and not busy at all! We would so love to return again."

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was absolutely beautiful with a great view, the amenities and just everything was perfect and more."
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were there during the Covid-19 shutdown, so all of the amenities (like the pool) were not available. All of the units have a view of the professionally manicured grounds and you‚Äôre just steps from the water. Our unit didn‚Äôt have AC which surprised me. I should have looked at the amenities list more carefully. With the nice breeze blowing through the unit we were never too warm. Overall we loved the place."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING view and chill condo complex.
Loved everything from the view, decor, beach gear, kitchen amenities, etc. I could see myself coming back here and staying an extended time. Lowella was super nice and responsive!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a beautiful condo and watching the whales from the balcony was so much fun! A little bit windy. But Maalea harbor is the windiest harbor in the world.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great views, very clean and easy to get to!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to choose for your Maui vacation. We could whale watch from the lanai. Easy walk to restaurants, Ocean Center, and mini golf. We‚Äôd stay here again."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time staying here. Very centrally located to a lot of places on Maui. We saw tons of whales from the lanai. Very quiet area.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for 2 nights and 3 days, and it was a pity to stay for 4 nights and 5 days in Maui.
First of all, the location is 15 minutes from the airport, 10-15 minutes from the large grocery store such as Walmart Ross Safeway, and Wailea in Lahaina Village. The accessibility is the best,
and the house is bigger than I thought.
It's perfect for two people.(From 4 people, I think you should put an airbed in the living room when you sleep)
The bedroom is cozy, and the kitchen and living room are quite spacious and nice.
There's nothing missing in the kitchen.
Toaster, coffee machine, oven, seasoning salad sauce, jam, honey, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, etc.
There are no cooking utensils and bowls, just chopsticks. It's a restaurant.
I ate really well for 2 days
There is also a barbecue facility that you can use until 9: 30 p.m. outside. It's like a gas stove, so it's easy to use.Go to the nearby Safeway and buy beef and grill it!
The pool is small, but it's for adults.
The water was also clean. In January, the water is a little cold
Paddleboard Sunbad Mat Beach Umbrella Snorkeling Equipment Tubing Bar, Ice Box, and other water play equipment are fully equipped. I love it ~ ~
The balcony view is beautiful, but it is as shown in the photos.
I recommend staying here instead of paying for expensive money and going to a hotel resort.
I've traveled a lot, and it was a great place to stay.
I leave a long time for Koreans to take note ^ ^"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lowella is an honest and thoughtful host. Her condo is clean and comfy. It has great view, and it's convenient to get to anywhere you want to. Her local tips is also very helpful. Followed her advice, we saw at least 30 turtles on the Hookipa beach. We recommend Lowella's place to anyone who wants to visit Maui."
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Satisfied with the place
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Centrally located and view of ocean while sitting on the Lanai is perfect. Pool is close by so you can watch swimmers from the Lanai. It is on the second level with easy access to parking and elevator. Harbor is within walking distance, this is where most boat/dive charters leave from.
I would stay here again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, would stay again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, 30 min to Lahaina, 15 min drive to Kihei, and 15 min from costco/airport. 5 min walk to sugar beach. Theres some shops and resturaunts within walking distance. Condo is right on the water and has amazing views. We got to enjoy the sunrise every morning. We saw 4 whales while sitting on the patio.Condo was nice and clean. It came equipped with everything we needed to enjoy the beach. Chairs, umbrella, towels, etc. Pool was very nice. The harbor can be very windy, but the breeze was nice and kept the condo cool."
2019-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ocean view is real, it is beautiful from the balcony.
If you are looking for a new and modem style place to stay, I won't recommend this place. Because the place is not an independent house, but a very old condo.
The place is big enough, but the smell and the light is not good in this condo. The living room and kitchen have musty smell and the window in the bedroom cannot be opened. So you can just use the fans to make it a little better, but barely helps.
And when we walk on the floor, you can feel the floor is greasy.
Besides, there's gonna be a tax charge when you check in, the host charged me 118 dollars, it is not included in the prepaid booking fee.
In all, I think I spent way too much over its value, it cost me about 1075 dollars for 4 nights, but I don't think it worth the high price."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great stay with Maui vacation fell asleep to the sound of the ocean and enjoyed the fully stocked kitchen can‚Äôt ask for much more
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it! The host was fabulous at communication. The condo includes many amenities that allowed our stay to be very comfortable. Great location! Great views! Affordable. I would stay here again.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW, LOOK NO FURTHER! This is the place you'll want to stay! Lowella's condo unit has a glorious water view, a nicely appointed kitchen, all the extra amenities you could possibly need (sunscreen, insect repellent, water toys, beach chairs, even an instant pot for cooking!) all for the lowest price of any oceanfront condo you'll find on the entire island. If you've been looking at reviews that tell you not to stay in Maalaea, you will regret following that advice! Maalaea is so centrally located while being in a private area that isn't packed with tourists. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation from a spot that is still close-in, this is the perfect location (less than 20 mins from Kihei and Lahaina, 1.5 hours from the Haleakala Crater, 5 minutes from Kahului, etc.). We found the condo to be sparking clean and well decorated. Since we had 3 guests total, there was a very comfortable sofa bed in the living room and Lowella left me a mattress pad and extra blankets to use. Lowella is a great host, and a fast communicator! Highly recommend her condo for your next Maui vacation!!!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The views were fantastic! Really enjoyed the sound of the waves. The condo was well supplied with beach toys and supplies. Location was generally quiet after 9PM but would not discuss private matters on the balcony, could hear others very well. LOL!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view was so much better than expected, the pictures really don‚Äôt do it justice! Loved being within walking distance to the beach, too!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view! This is near a lot of places. Quiet area. Great price and the communication from the host is great. Did not want to leave it‚Äôs such a beautiful place to relax and stay.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED staying in this condo. The location is great and the view is PERFECT. It‚Äôs located right near the harbor which was perfect for us since we went deep sea fishing. Highly recommend!
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice view on the sea
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous views! Great location!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at this condo. It is easy to arrive and quickly get relaxed. The owner has provided all the little things that you need on vacation and don‚Äôt want to bring with you, which was really appreciated. The building has a nice community feel and we enjoyed meeting people in the pool and around the grill and happy hour. Short walk to a nice beach with mostly locals. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for the hospitality! The place was clean, had beautiful views, and was in a great location. We would definitely stay again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, very affordable, great central location!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo had a beautiful waterfront view. You get a private patio, access to a community grill, and a gated pool. It is very quiet at night so no need to worry about noisy neighbors. Location is very close to Paia and airport. Unit is well stocked with beach equipment, coolers, ice machine in the fridge. Place was clean, well lit, and peaceful."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view was amazing!! I was sad to leave such an amazing balcony view over looking the ocean. I would definitely book again if I plan a Maui trip in the near future. ‚ù§Ô∏è Host is also super responsive.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"UNREAL views! Incredibly relaxed, clean, quiet and unique. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any other place for Maui!!! Highly recommend and excited to come back soon!!!!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything checked out. Pretty convenient location to everything.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view is as beautiful as shown! The grounds are well kept and the location is within walking distance of two good restaurants, a few shops, the marina and beach access. It is also centrally located for any day trips to other parts of the island and within 20 minutes of the airport."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The balcony view was so good that I was happy throughout my stay. It was nice to hear the waves. The location was also good, so it was easy to get around a lot. I would like to stay again next time"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Host provided all the necessities plus! We loved it!!! Highly recommend. Great view snd location also.
2019-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay. A good pool and amazing beach with loads of turtles and things to see underwater within a 10 minute walk from the room. If you are with more than 4 people, the sleeping arrangements will be a bit of a hassle. I would recommend not staying in this place with more than 4 people. Everything else was great. The host let us bring our bags early and we could get them later than check out as well! They were really friendly and replied fast."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house provides really nice view! If you look for the peaceful and calm place for vacation, I recommend this house."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were only here for a day but the unit was exactly as described and the owners were responsive and nice. We would stay here again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay here was AMAZING! Checking in and out was a breeze. Speaking of a breeze, when the balcony door and bedroom windows were open, that was all the AC we needed. Some might think it was on the warmer side, but we were able to sleep and be comfortable throughout our entire stay. From the snorkeling gear provided, to the gas powered grill in front of the ocean, we loved what this place had to offer. One of my favorite things about this place is the perfect location, which makes any trip around the island almost equal in minutes. Its right in the middle! Not to mention, if you plan a snorkeling/sunset tour, the Maalaea Harbor has many companies that depart from there - which is only a 4 minute walk! SO awesome.
Balcony view was AMAZING to wake up to - some beautiful sunrises!
On one of our last days, the fire near Maalaea and North Kihei broke out, and we were forced to evacuate to Lahaina. The host was there for us and even offered us a refund for a night to help cover any cost the fire dealt us. We are SO grateful of that. All around a FANTASTIC experience for our first time in Maui. We highly reccomend :)"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The views are amazing! You could sit and watch the waves all day from the lanai! Very clean, had everything we needed and the host was VERY accommodating to our needs! A wonderful place to stay and relax! Walking distance to Beach Bums restaurant and Maui Ocean Center!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Expect a beautiful sunrise to the left of the balcony and follow the sidewalk East that runs along access road to the condo to get to the looong Sugar beach. All beaches in Hawai‚Äôi are public beaches so you can walk to your heart‚Äôs content. Get up with the sun for a glorious day in Hawai‚Äôi.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Incredible host! Would come back again. We had a little accident host was very comprehensive and communicative
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family had a great time. They absolutely LOVED the view and it was close to the airport and the ocean. Recommend this place to everyone!!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place with beautiful views of the ocean. The property grounds are very well maintained and the place was very clean upon arrival. One of the coolest parts was heading to the shoreline (which you can see out of your balcony) at sunset and seeing sea turtles feeding off the algae from the rocks. It's also pretty nice to fall asleep to the sound of the actual ocean in the background.
The place is in a quiet location and is pretty central in terms of driving to more populated areas such as Lahaina, Kihei, or Kahului. Very beautiful place and would absolutely stay here again."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great ocean view and easy location to access anywhere.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location! Centrally located to all the amazing beaches and snorkeling spots in Maui within 5 to 10 mins! AC in living room and inside the room were a life saver. Overall, great stay"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, nice area, no complaints here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this air bnb!! Just down the street from a beach and in a good location. It was very clean and had a hotel-like feel. The hosts even left little snacks for us which was unexpected and very appreciated.
FYI this condo is on the second floor and we did not see an elevator (to be fair we did not look very hard) and so dragging our suitcases up the stairs was a struggle. However, this struggle was well worth it as we loved the condo so much!!
We loved this space and would definitely stay again next time we are in Lahaina!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gracious, responsive hosts. The condo is in a great location , close to beaches and restaurants. The condo was clean and had everything you could need. Bonus was the washer/dryer!
Depending on what you'd like to do- exploring Haleakala national park , road to Hana are full day trips from condo's location. There are plenty of food trucks where you can grab a bite to eat. Overall had a great stay and would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is fully equipped with everything one might need to stay comfortable for a week or more. The communication with the hosts was exceptional. The apartment's location is convenient as it is close to Honolua Bay and Kaanapali Beach. Moreover, it only takes a 15-minute walk to reach a food truck park and the supermarket.
However, it's unfortunate that there aren't many bars or restaurants nearby. Driving is kind of necessary if you want to enjoy a cocktail or a restaurant setup. That said, the location is charming and quiet, and if driving everywhere is not a deal breaker, I highly recommend staying here.
Thank you for being such great hosts!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience ü§ô
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time in this area. Loved every single minute of it. Even though we spent most of our time at the beach, when we were at apartment it truly felt like home. Super close to beach park, stores, etc. love love love everything about our stayed. 10/10 for reals"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was great to stay in this condo. Ac worked perfectly. Washer and dryer inside‚Ä¶‚Ä¶üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªü§ôüèºMahalo

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at this condo it was quiet and conveniently located. Their desk/home office space was exactly what I needed and they made the space very welcoming.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay - we enjoyed our time here
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time in edward and stephanie place. The place is nice and clean close to the beach and great restaurants. I love the details and snacks given to us. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting maui.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I loved staying at Edward and Stephanie‚Äôs adorable place! It was very clean and well furnished. It was comfortable and had all of the amenities of home. Everyone was attentive and responded quickly to emails. I will absolutely stay there again next year!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, and great recommendations!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great place to stay in Maui! My friend and I were here for a week, and it was such a great time! The condo is very clean and spacious, two of us had no problem here. The kitchen was also nice and well stocked so we could cook a few meals. Edward and Stephanie were kind enough to leave some beach supplies like towels, a basket, and mineral sunscreen, which were super useful to us! The condo is pretty well located. You're close to Lahaina (the historic town is still closed as of Feb 2024) where you can find food and beach rentals/lessons (snorkel/surf). It's about a 45 minute drive from the airport as well and just in a nice, scenic, and tranquil neighborhood. If you follow the highway north, you'll find some cool views like a blowhole and some hikes. If you want to do the road to Hana, that does become a little longer, at about 2h45m, but not bad for a day trip! The hosts were very responsive and recommended several local business to rent from and activities to do. 10/10!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient, easy check-in & great location."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great condo and area, would stay again! Walking distance from Honok≈çwai Beach Park where we frequently watched the most beautiful sunsets. Rooms have AC. Modern / homey decor. We were pleasantly surprised by the goodies left and the beach towels, boogie boards, beach chairs, and washer and drier with laundry detergent left for us! A couple of blocks down is a strip of food trucks with picnic and ambient lighting.. we had the Thai food two nights in a row! Great stay, would contact again if returning to Maui."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for reasonable price.
Nice host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were very responsive and helpful! The location is a quick walk away from a farmers market and cafe my husband and I came to frequently. They were able to work with us as we changed our schedule due to last minute flight delays. No complaints here!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Edward and Stephanie's place for just a short night and that was a miss in our part. Location was perfect in Maui, close to beach, great walkable restaurants, easy access to all that we wanted to do in the area, and if you are longing for a great night sleep, the space has the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for the amazing place during our 3 days of staying in Maui! We could explore lots of different places to try for eating and shopping in the neighborhood üå∫
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our travel meant that we were only at Edward and Stephanie‚Äôs for one night, but their place was amazing ! Super cute, ultra clean and they even had some yummy snacks and coffee for us. Great to have snacks for our late night arrival. I would love to come back and spend more time here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This had everything we could need. The kitchen had all the utensils to cook inside or outside. The bathroom was clean and had many towels available. The bed was very comfortable. The AC‚Äôs were great and kept us cold. It was quiet, never heard anyone around us. The pool was a little cold to swim it but had a grill next to it that we used and sat at the tables outside. Easy walk to the beach and places nearby. Had our own parking spot, and there was a lot of visitor parking spots as well. Stephanie and Edward left us snacks and coffee for our arrival which was wonderful and thoughtful. Beach towels and chairs were provided which was helpful as we traveled from far away and did not have them. They left pods for us to do our laundry as well. This space felt like a home away from home!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean condo. Had all amenities we could need. Interior was decorated nicely, and we were waking distance from some cool coffee shops and the beach!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Really nice updated one bedroom! Right across the street from Honokowai Beach Park for sunsets. Laundry, full kitchen, AC, coffee maker, balcony, good WiFi, communicative hosts. Could not have asked for more for my extended stay while working in Lahaina. I definitely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Edward and Stephanie‚Äôs place for 10 days over the February break and it was great. The location is fantastic on the west side of Maui. Easy drive into the Lahaina for shopping or many choices of restaurants or up the coast to some excellent locations for snorkelling and enjoying the water. Check in was easy considering we arrived about midnight. The apartment complex is showing it‚Äôs age but the unit itself was updated and very comfortable and clean. We did not use the pool or the BBQ but they are in very close proximity just across the parking lot. The neighbourhood was quiet and walkable to nearby beach, shopping, food trucks and many amenities. Would stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Good location. Hosts were very easy to deal with and communication was great. Place was as listed.

The location was convenient. Great food, small beach for viewing epic sunsets, and ABC store were all just a short walk away."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I absolutely loved it there. Nice location, food trucks near by and the beach near by. I definitely will recommend it to stay there. Apparemment was clean and cozy, kitchen has all tools for cooking! We had a wonderful time there!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Would 10/10 recommend staying with Edward, Stephanie, and Lauryn! Everything was as described and communication was on point. I was not expecting responses right away since I stayed through the holidays but they always got back to me quickly. Location was amazing and walkable from a lot and short drives from other main attractions. I will definitely consider staying here again when I come back to Maui. Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a great stay at the condo! The condo was nicely furnished as in the pictures and the balcony was a beautiful place to sit on early mornings as it faced the sun. The internet was super fast. The location is great - close to the famous Kaanapali beaches, and the shops at Honokowai had some of the best takeout food we had on the island. Everything was well-equipped, from the kitchen to beach supplies.
We had an issue with cleaning upon checkin, but Lauryn was prompt and proactive in resolving it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Edward and Stephanie's place met the higher expectations we had based on prior reviews. It is in a great loaction to explore west maui and close to a few coffee shops for your morning cup of joe.
We thought it was a nice touch that they had beach chairs for us to use as needed, and thought the bed was especially comfortable.
I'd definitely stay here again when I come back to maui."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, private and comfortable stay. We loved being able to make breakfast in the kitchen, the unit also had beach chairs and umbrella for guest use. The king bed was incredibly comfortable, I haven‚Äôt slept that well in a long time. We would love to return when we are in Maui again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay. Central location in West Maui, it's close to a small park/beach where we often went for breakfast and sunset, and spotted a few turtles and seals. The place had everything we needed, like beach towels, cooking equipment, and beach chairs. I would definitely stay here if I visit Maui again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, close to many beaches and attractions in Maui. Great communication!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location within walking distance to many restaurants! Short drive to Napili bay and other beaches as well. The apartment itself is small but works great for a couple or even 2 adults and 1-2 kids - it‚Äôs not likely you‚Äôll spend much time in the actual apartment anyways. A perfect place to sleep and the AC really helps keep the place cool.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, great value, and great space. The space is clean and aesthetic. The beds were spacious and comfortable. We loved being close to the shoreline and restaurants but having the place be an oasis a little further out. The owners had great communication and check-in and check-out were easy.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was great. We got to every beach we wanted to and it was easy. Comfortable, clean and relaxing condo with great little homey touches like sun umbrella, cooler and beach towels to borrow. Lauryn was a great communicator and her timely replies were amazing!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay was great! Good location close to a small beach and grocery store. Would definitely stay here again :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay! The room is very clean and it‚Äôs so close to great beaches in the West side of Maui. can‚Äôt recommend enough!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful. It is, in fact, a hidden gem. It‚Äôs got a great local neighborhood (park, stores, market and food trucks). It is also convenient to most everything else you would want to visit. The unit itself is very cute and has everything you would need. The pool is great also. I highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,She is really responsible and nice to any issue you would have.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well equipped condo, near to a bunch of nice beaches, and food venues. Bed was king sized and was very comfortable- they used cotton sheets instead of polyester sheets which really helped when it was bit humid. Has A/C in bedroom and in living room which helped with the heat! Kitchen was great included bakeware, and everything that you might need to whip up a meal!
Large flat screen TV for relaxation at night when it was raining and we couldn‚Äôt go out.
Condo includes, ice chest cooler, boogie boards and beach chairs/umbrella. We didn‚Äôt end up using the stuff but it was nice to have.
The only weird thing was that at one point the water was shut off to fix the main pipeline - so we decided to leave early and just shower later. When we came back - the welcome mat had been turned over, the screen door was open and the front door was unlocked and left open just a peak. We let the AirBNB hostess know but it was definitely concerning and inconvenient as we had to make sure nothing was taken.
Overall the place was very very nice and central to everything and Lauryn the property manager was very communicative and helpful.
Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauryn had great communication.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended condo. Very much appreciated the great communication. Everything you need for a great stay close to the beach is provided.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice apartment. Excellent support service. Was a great choice.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The camper van really filled a need for couple who enjoys the outdoors but wants a step up from tent camping! Was it perfect? No‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But, it was pretty awesome! It drives really well and has excellent brakes, a/c etc! The bed sleeps well and was very comfortable (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù). The shower is a place to rinse off with tepid water, soap and rinse as fast as possible (but it was so awesome to have, especially after hiking 12 miles). The toilet was a great convenience, especially when facilities aren‚Äôt available! The fridge works great, the faucet is a well thought out convenience! The key to success is learning the operation of the electric switches and getting reservations at a campground (plus getting the most level parking spot available)! The batteries had plenty of capacity and the fans are one of the best features of this van! It stays nice and cool inside just using the rear fan and opening the screen window at the sliding door! Overall a great experience! Mahalo"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely nice place for the time we spent in Maui
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy and Doug were absolutely amazing. Total professionals and anticipated everything you might need. Always got back to is right away if we had any questions. I found a small item missing they had it to us in 30 minutes even though we we didn‚Äôt need it. They also lent us their personal beach chairs for our last day which was really helpful. She provides a complete and thorough manual of everything you need to know, best restaurants and things to do. And their recommendations were spot on.
Right across the street is a little beach where the turtles come to rest. And the people who live at the complex are so kind and amazing. They make the experience extra special.
The bed was soft and comfy like a cloud and so were all the linens. The place was so cute and kitschy it was charming.
Mahalo Lisa Tracy and Doug. We would highly recommend the little bungalow by the sea to anyone. It was absolutely magical üíñüòò"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We value peace and quiet where we stay and though this cute little condo with the lanai backing onto a tennis court is in a complex packed wall to wall with other such condos the neighbors were in the main very quiet and respectful of others.
Tracy herself was exceptional and super responsive."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place was an absolute gem! Right across the street from a beautiful beach.
Tracy was incredibly helpful- she messaged a bunch of recommendations before the trip including must-know info for popular spots such as reservation requirements for Haleakala sunrise. Beyond that there was a binder full of tips and tricks that was super helpful.
The few times I had questions, Tracy was very responsive and helpful. There were a bunch of neat well thought out touches that made this place feel like home, including a diffuser for us curly hair girlies. It‚Äôs the little things!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home in Tracy's condo. It had everything I needed for my stay while I was in Maui. Mahalo for thinking of everything Tracy!!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place with all the things you need to feel at home. As mentioned in the listing they are not flexible with check-in or out times. Host is very responsive to questions. Location is good but located in the far back of the complex and not in walking distance to much so you will most likely need a vehicle. For the price it‚Äôs a decent place to stay especially since if your in Maui you aren‚Äôt inside much üòÄ
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Tracy‚Äôs place! It was as described in every way, and held some very nice surprises. Tracy is one of the most informative, organized, and responsive hosts we‚Äôve experienced. We highly recommend this spot!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was super nice to inform us ahead of time that there will be remodeling during our time of stay and proactively suggested we could switch to another listing under her management within the same address for an even lower cost!
We happily switched over to another unit and our entire stay was super smooth without any interruption. Upon check-in, we had a few questions around parking and comforters and Tracy was able to immediately get back to us with great answers.
The unit is fully equipped with everything we need. We loved our stay here and would definitely book this listing again if we are ever in Maui for a trip!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay but the place doesn't have any happenings activities close to walking distance. To get some quiet and peace it was great.

The bungalow was equipped with everything we needed plus a lot of extras. It is really nice to have beach towels and beach chairs available. We used the swimming pool and Jacuzzi nighty. They were always clean and never crowded.
Tracy, the property manager, checked in with us and replied to any inquiries stright away.
I would recommend staying at the Bungalow by the Sea: This is it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tracy's accommodations were exactly as described and couldn't have asked for a better location. The beach is within steps and many restaurants are close by. Will definitely come back to stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This air BNB was so cute. It was clean, perfect for what we needed. I loved all the little cute perks. A diary to write about our experiences on the vacation and recommend to others. My bf, was so Intrigued, he read through it, the first night., decor was adorable. I love the small things, like the make up remover towel, and the fully equipped kitchen. I loved how directions were easy to find, and everything was labeled to help navigate the space. The welcome binder was so informative and well put together. So many cute recommendations.
My bf and I came to Hawaii for my cousins wedding, and stayed a week, we left Hawaii engaged ‚ù§Ô∏è
I will always remember this first trip to Hawaii, thank you so much for making this trip possible, adorable, and uncomplicated."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at the Bungalow with my 2 daughters ages 17, and 20. We did not rent a car and it was easy to travel to desired destinations and explore the Island via lyft. The unit is SUPER clean (and I‚Äôm a bit OCD) the owner really stocked the place with all kinds of goodies that came in handy during our stay, beach chairs, umbrellas, ice chests, snorkel gear and so much more. Tracey constantly checked in with us via the app to make sure everything was going great! This has been one of my best Air B N B experiences and we will definitely be back to visit Maui."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to extend our trip and fortunately Tracy's place was available. Since we were already in Maui she was able to get us checked in a little early and we took her up on the late checkout offer, which is brilliant for those with red-eyes out.
The place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the beach accessories and kitchen amenities made it feel like home. It is centrally located for exploring the island and is a short drive to the airport.
We would certainly stay here again and would recommend the place to anybody looking for a cozy, comfortable and convenient stay in Maui."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I adored this perfect airbnb experience. Especially after a very different touristy experience at a Ka'anapali resort, coming to this unit was like coming home while still on vacation! Private, great location 1 minute walk to the beach, and LOVED having everything we'd need right there. Especially found the beach gear and coolers/bug spray useful for our various day trips. Everything is also very clearly labeled in the unit which, as a ""type A"" mom on a family trip, I very much appreciated, haha! Tracy's communication was excellent before, during and after our stay. Would 1000% stay here again. Mahalo <3"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was beautiful in Tracy's apartment - great amenities with everything & more than you would expect from an apartment, super friendly & prompt communication with Tracy & Lisa (also in case of questions due to unforeseen storm damage in the complex, not in the apartment itself), perfect kitchen equipment (would also be fine for several weeks stay), clean bathroom, great with tiled floor everywhere in the apartment (easy, clean to hold), awesome balcony with bird chirping to wake up and great amenities with ceiling fan & air conditioning ... all around a brilliant accommodation that is also inexpensive with the ingenious location on Maui üòç"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We island hopped while on our trip and this spot was perfect. The room is pretty much one street away from a beach and you access multiple beaches in less than 15 minutes. Lawn chairs and other things where provided. The host was very responsive and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. The AC unit can get a little loud but it works like a charm and it's a nice feature that many places don't offer. I like new experiences but if I go back to Maui I would stay here again absolutely!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Tracy's little piece of paradise! Check in/ check out was very smooth, it was very clean, the complex was quiet.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This experience was wonderful! You can tell that Tracy and team have thought through the AirBnB KPI‚Äôs and made sure that they have and communicate all of them. Making it an enjoyable experience and super easy to give 5 stars to! Great Job!!

Lots of movies to choose from, games to play. We would definitely come back again! :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this condo last-minute, the same day I checked in for a 4 night stay. The host had great communication and the condo was just what I was looking for. Definitely planning to book here next time I come to Maui."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great studio located in Kihei, just across the street from the Maui fishpond, which featured a nice beach and protected swim area. I would wake up every morning, throw on my swim suit and walk three minutes for a morning dip in the fishpond. At night, my wife and I would make the same walk and watch the sun go down. The walk back to the condo includes three different showers, which came in handy to shower off the sand. There is also an Indian restaurant across the street, Monsoons, which serves great food and also has a terrific view of the sunset.
The complex is low key, with a nice pool and jacuzzi area. Mornings were spent on the studio's patio, eating a relaxed breakfast and enjoying the salty air. Overall, it was a terrific stay and we appreciate Tracy making check in and check out so easy. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I start!? What an amazing and really convenient place to stay. The team here is very responsive and accommodating. It‚Äôs right in the middle of everything! My wife and I drove all around the island and nothing was more than 45 minutes away. I highly recommend staying at this place. Honestly this is so small but so big for me. The place was fully stocked with Q-Tips and other necessities. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times, I forget certain items but this place had it all. Without a doubt, 10/10 especially if you‚Äôre cooking or out and about a lot like us. I definitely recommend staying here and enjoying the place. Thank you for the fabulous experience Tracy and Team!"

It is located across the street to the beach. Nice walk to the beach.
Host was helpful with the unit and the island attractions. Thank you.
A great pleasure staying at the bungalow at Kihei.
Albert"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Tracy's condo in Kihei for a week in June, and appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout the space. There were a number of amenities like beach towels, coolers, yoga mats, a waterproof phone holder, etc.--all which proved themselves to be useful during our excursions! We were also pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the bed was. The condo complex was quiet and well-maintained, and we enjoyed chatting with both locals and tourists at the pool and hot tub. This Airbnb served as an excellent home base as we explored different parts of Maui."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely fabulous place to stay. right on the beach, clean, safe... couldn't ask for anything else. the hosts are super as well - spot on communication, recommendations, and always ready to help in any way possible. just perfect!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! Genuinely one of the best AirBnBs I've stayed at. The location was great, so was the easy access to many stunning beaches. Amenities were excellent, especially all the small touches that made this rental feel like home. Lots of towels, toiletries, etc. really elevated the experience for us. It was clean, well-equipped, and beautifully decorated."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Kihei. Airbnb itself has the right amenities for a vacation in Maui. There are beach chairs, umbrella, cooler for guests to use. The community has tennis court and pool (although we did not get a chance to use it). Tons of good food within 2 miles of the Airbnb (all on the same road). More than couple of beaches on the same road as well. Great central location, therefore easy drive to west maui, upcountry maui, airport, etc... (all are within 30-40 mins drive). Would definitely recommend to stay here."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed in Tracy's condo for 7 nights. We loved it. The place was nicely decorated, the bed was one of the most comfortable I ever tried and the apartment is really well equipped. Nice tennis court available that we've been using every day and there's also a laundry room in the building complex. Perfect location in Kihei, two steps from the beach and next to restaurants and retails.
Everything was smooth from the check in to the check out. We recommend it 100%! Love from Italy and Croatia :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and excellent accommodations! Just wish I had a few more days to enjoy all the amenities. Tracy has EVERYTHING you need for a great stay.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt recommend staying at one of Tracy‚Äôs properties enough! This is the second property of Tracy‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at and I was just as impressed as the first time.
The communication is effortless and the property manual covers everything, you can tell Tracy has experience hosting and has refined the process.
My favorite part of booking with Tracy is the abundance of actually useful amenities. We used the beach chairs, umbrella, coolers and beach towels daily, everything you need for an entire day at the beach.
I‚Äôll certainly return to Maui as soon as possible and I‚Äôll certainly book with Tracy."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a week to grab in Maui with little advance planning and this condo was just the ticket. It's easy to be skeptical about a place that looks so nice in the photos but we found it just as advertised. Appreciated all of the thoughtful extras included in the kitchen, and for beach time and recreation. The communication from Tracy was superb and allowed us to feel confident and well-informed."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"High recommend staying here! Was absolutely amazing! Everything was so clean and labeled. Location was right across from a beach (with turtles) Also the host was very attentive, welcoming and left information on how to make the most of your trip!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and clean!
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although everything in the description was there, the place was actually older and has a run down appearance. The view was acts tennis court with a sliver of the sea"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I will definitely look up Tracy again. I loved that we could walk right across the street to the beach. Super cozy and couldn‚Äôt have asked for more!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this property! It is so well stocked we did not need anything other than our food. The bed was very comfortable, the room was very cozy and decorated very nicely for an island stay. One of us has a disability so we really appreciated there are two handicap spaces very close to the front door. Everything in the posting was as represented. Pool and jacuzzi were very relaxing with ability to grill. Check-in was a breeze. Tracy our host was very responsive and communicative before and during our stay. We made great Maui memories with this as our base! Mahalo!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Had a wonderful stay at the bungalow! It was the perfect place to rest and relax. Tracy and her team don't miss out on a single detail. There was so much provided and everything clearly labeled throughout the bungalow. It was amazing to wake up and look out to the ocean every morning. The location was great and close to food, shopping, and the beach. I miss it already!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, great space, and a great host."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Tracy has thought of everything! The condo was well equipped and clean. I loved being right across the street from the beach and only a mile from all kinds of services, food options and even more beaches. It was easy and comfortable."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, quiet stay. Walking distance from beach and location makes everything a short drive away. Would I stay again? You bet."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"our bungalow by the sea was perfect for my partner and I. Tracy and co did an amazing job making sure this property has everything you could possibly need. From every variation of utensil / cooking tool to beach fun with toys, towels and chairs. We were beyond impressed by how much was there. The location itself is perfectly tucked away in a quiet community - we didn't hear the road across the street or any of our neighbors. The complex has a pool and tennis court as well. If you cross the street you are taken to what feels like a private beach with amazing sunsets and sundowns. Turtles popped in to sun bathe every day on this beach. I can't say enough good things about this property and its location, we were never too far from excursions and adventures...we were able to do the road to hana start to finish with stops leaving at 5am and back in the early afternoon.
The size was more than enough for my partner and myself and we never felt tight.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tracy was extremely informative and hospitable. The area was also very nice. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a peaceful and comfortable stay in Kihei.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our Maui stay! The place is nice and clean and has everything we needed. The location is great too. Just a lovely place overall!
We really liked the layout of the place, and the bathroom and shower look renovated. The King bed is roomy and comfy. I slept well through all 4 nights. They have both AC and ceiling fans. There‚Äôs a Roku TV across from the sofa, and you can also rotate the TV to watch movies and shows in bed.
They have everything you need for the beach and more. Beach umbrella, chairs, cooler bags, towels, etc. Well stocked! There‚Äôs also a tennis court right outside and they have tennis rackets and balls in the closet. There‚Äôs also a pool and a hot tub in the community we didn‚Äôt end up using, but they looked clean and not crowded at all.
The location is very nice. It‚Äôs a few min drive to sugar beach, where we had a lovely long walk in the morning during sunrise. Amazing view of the ocean and coastline - highly recommend.
Lisa and Tracy are very professional hosts, and they prepared detailed instructions and recommendations for guests. We had a lovely time! This is a really awesome place and great value compared to anything else we could‚Äôve booked. Will definitely rebook if we come to Maui again."

Nice easy to use Roku tv (if you have Spotify you can easily cast your own music to the Roku!). Nice little lanai to eat or hang out at facing the tennis court. She even had rackets and balls if you want to play! It was really nice that there were beach chairs and cooler bags to take on a day trip. It was one of the most affordable spots I could find for an early December trip. I‚Äôd definitely stay again! Aloha!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place. Especially if you like tennis, pool, hot tub, beach and sunsets."

The House provides everything you could possibly need to enjoy your stay here. It was our first time in Maui so we actually spent most of the time exploring the island. Our only regret is we didn't stay long enough to fully go thru the amenities. Will def be back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,such an awesome stay. local to the best spots

There was a very different feel to this Abnb and I appreciate it!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything as described. Tracy was great at communicating. I was having a hard time to find the cooking pans and messaged Tracy. She responded with minutes and unexpectedly she also sent a tea kettle shortly. I did mention it but did not really request it. Thank you Tracy and Lisa for hosting us. We will book again in the future.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I absolutely love this place. It's less than a 10 min drive to all of the best restaurants and it is across the street from the beach. The place is so clean that I did not mind my 2 and 4 yr olds waddling on the floor. The attention to detail is impeccable. They made sure to have something enjoyable for everyone. They have games the entire family can enjoy and even a ukulele with a how to guide. I was even more pleased when I saw a stool in front of the sink for my kids to wash their hands. It is little attention to detail like this that made our experience so wonderful. We will be back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an EXCELLENT time at the Bungalow by the sea. The condo was very clean, full of light, and modern. The bed was also very comfortable with plenty of pillows.
Basically, the condo has everything for every need: tv, dvds, silverware, cocktail glasses (with a recipe book for margaritas!), beach towels, soap, beach chairs etc‚Ä¶.
Tracy was very communicative and gave us great tips for beaches to explore, dining options, bars etc. The Welcome folder is a must-read.
Although we went to a different beach every day, there is a beach across the road and the condo is 5 minutes away from restaurants and bars in Kihei. Easy to do some grocery shopping too.
There really wasn‚Äôt anything negative about your stay.
We truly felt the aloha spirit of hospitality. I recommend Tracy‚Äôs services and the place without reservation."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little Airbnb. The chairs and umbrella were very handy for us. The park across the way had turtles each day which was very fun for us to witness.

The condo itself was such a cute space! She provides a unit that is what I would like to say ""thoughtful"". Seems as if she has thought of everything her guests would need and literally it's there in the condo!
Thank you Tracy for providing my daughter and I a wonderful place to stay and making it comfortable.
We will definitely be booking with you again in the future!
-Tracy Q"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs Paradise was indeed one. We felt home during our stay. Tracy had taken care of every little thing which one would need during the stay, that was super impressive. She had her local recommendation for restaurants and places to visit. One thing which we found outstanding was her communication about her weather alerts. Thanks Tracy for that. When visiting Tracy‚Äôs condo in Maui, you just needs your cloths in your packing rest is taken care of.
Thanks Tracy for making our stay blissful at your condo.
Aloha and Mahalo

She had excellent recommendations and provided us with everything we needed for our trip (I highly recommend taking advantage of the beach chairs and umbrella). There were no unpleasant surprises, she did an excellent job explaining everything we needed to know about staying in Kihei. 10/10 would recommend!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs apartment is as described, a very comfortable space for our stay. It had comfortable bed, everything needed in kitchen and there were so many personal touches all over the apartment. She has full gear for a perfect day at the beach including beach totes, ice box etc.
the location is perfect - right across from a beautiful beach where we saw turtles on couple of sunrise and sunset walks. It is within 2-3 mins driving range of groceries, restaurants etc.
all in all truly a ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù as the listing says"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy was an excellent host. She was so informative and gave detailed descriptions for any scenario we may encounter. She was very helpful and quick to reply. The condo was exactly what we needed for our short stay in Maui.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Just steps from the beach! Nicely equiped with everything you could possibly want for a vacation in Paradise- from beach chairs, to coolers, beach bags, (nice) beach towels and more. Tracy's place also had games, dvds, guidebooks and more. She is a very friendly host, she was very communicative. We didnt have any issues to contact her about during our stay, but if we did im confident she woukd have responded timely. The rental was clean. Thanks for a great vacation!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This condo was beautiful and had so many thoughtful amenities included! You can really tell Tracy cares about her guests and has pride in her condo. The beach is right across the street where you can see sea turtles AND whales out in the distance! It was amazing. 10/10 stay!!

Tracy was super communicative and accommodating. The unit was absolutely stunning and spotless. Her decor and attention to detail was over the top. Absolutely adorable and high quality and had everything you could possibly need. Fantastic location.
Very much enjoyed our stay.."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tracy is a first-rate host ! Everything was exactly as described and we had everything we needed ! There were some weather issues on the island during our stay and Tracy was a great and proactive communicator ! We will definitely stay here on our next visit !
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy is an excellent host. Fast communications, very accommodating, lots of recommendations for guests. The place is very clean and well stocked with beach gear. If you are primarily doing beach activities, then this is a perfect place.
Tracy spent a lot of effort on the ambience of the place that makes you feel right at home in Maui instead of a cookie cutter Airbnb/Hotel room. Truly a nice place to detox from the busy urban life. Depending on your priorities, this could be a huge plus or a minor inconvenience. The three of us packed a LOT of gear for our 18-day trip so all the decorations did take away some storage space. But if you are just a regular tourist this should be a nonissue.
My only complaint would be for the overall property complex. The laundry space seemed to be down for a while and nobody was doing anything about it. And they somehow decided to do a lot of constructions right during a busy holiday season. These are factors beyond Tracy's control though."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Places looks exactly same as shown in the picture. This place is close to the Beach and few minutes drive away from the major destinations. Ample parking spots are available.

Other beaches that we went to were just a short drive away. Tracy's condo was perfectly located for convenience to the highway to get to the airport and close to all the shops, grocery stores and restaurants in Kihei. It was so easy to find and easy to check in. Tracy was proactive in her communication prior to our arrival and was always willing to provide any information we needed. The king bed was very comfortable too! I would stay there again...highly recommended!"

Overall was a great experience and would highly recommend staying at Tracy‚Äôs!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time I booked with Tracy. The first time was in the same complex, but a different unit. Like my first stay with Tracy, my stay was great. The unit was clean and had everything I needed. The bed, too, was really comfortable, so much so that I asked Tracy where she purchased her pillow from, to which Tracy promptly responded. Tracy also let me know, unprompted, that my room was available for early check in. I look forward to my next stay with Tracy."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy went above & beyond for our stay! We were stranded at the airport for 48 hours due to delayed flights. We reached out to Tracy to request an early check-in.

She has all the amenities you could think of to relax and enjoy a nice getaway. Highly recommend!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will *always* love staying at Tracy's places. Super friendly, love the labels and tremendous amount of information. Her team is super on top of it and I even met some of the cleaning and maintenance crew. All stellar people. I've recommended to my following and anyone going. I love staying in Kihei too to be away from lots of the stereotypical tourism. If you are someone who doesn't respect someone else's space, don't stay with Tracy. If you're responsible, reliable, quiet, and respectful, you will love any of her listings."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute space with feel good vibes! This is not a manufactured vacation rental but rather a place curated with love and guest comfort in mind. The artistic decor enhances the island experience. There was even a ukelele to play, good quality beach towels, coolers, tumblers, yoga mats and beach gear provided. The bed was incredibly comfortable and loved seeing the ocean right across the street from inside the unit. Also enjoyable was the comfy lanai furniture. Host has gone out of the way to provide a lot of extras that are appreciated for both short and long stays.
The complex is well located to lots of great beaches in Kihei and easy access to the rest of the island. The pool and easy parking were a bonus. I would stay again and recommend."

The place itself was warm and inviting and her attention to detail in creating such a neat space really made this such a memorable trip.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place . Clean and safety.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a treasure. This is what I would describe as home away from home. This place has everything and is an adventure to explore on its own. Tracy has a binder to introduce you to space and provide information on the island.
Parking is easy, getting to the location is easy, and the location is great. You are on the edge of Kihei so it is not super loud, and you are in driving distance to a lot of great views and restaurants.
For those who love enjoying the provided amenities, please read the binder that is provided in the stay. It was very fun to read and to find out what else the place had in store for us.
Easy 5/5 across the board.
Cons and Limits:
- Night time can have some loud people driving by, but there are earplugs provided in the night stand drawer.
- The binder recommendations are great to start exploring Maui, but your tastes may differ. The restaurants didn't really fit ours. Not a bad thing, but something to consider."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tracy‚Äôs condo was great! Very clean and everything you could possibly think of she provided us.

We had a great time and the beach across the street had a plethora of turtles.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was amazing! Tracy really means ""just bring your toothbrush"". She provided everything imaginable. The beach right across the street is a little gem.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy was a fabulous host. She has everything you can think of while staying in this unit. We were right across from the beach and minutes away from restaurants, stores, and other beaches. Convenient location, a good size (fit our family of 4 perfectly), and it was very clean.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"These place was great, it was clean it has everything you need to make your meals, the Pool was great big enough, everything is amazing, also most of the places are close enough there a little beach in front of it you can even walk over it‚Äôs great for kids"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tracy and her staff delivered an absolutely flawless experience for us at this Airbnb. Everything met or exceeded our expectations. Communication was extremely thorough and consistent from the second we booked through pre-arrival; checking in with us during our stay; and during the checkout process. It was one of the most professional Airbnb stays I have had. Everything was thoroughly well done and delivered above expectations. We even received a text that our Lanai was cleaned ahead of schedule and ready for early check-in.
During our stay, I had the chance to speak with other guests who had booked with other Airbnb providers and they did not have nearly as good of an experience as we did. I had raving reviews for Tracy and her team and began to almost feel guilty that our Lanai was perfect end-to-end where other guest who had booked with someone different did not have nearly the same flawless and professional experience."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed the condo! the design was really nice, beach materials provided, and there were no bugs. Tracy provides a lot of information about things to do. Most importantly, after days on the island, the beach in front of the complex is the only place I saw that had sea turtles. many of them!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I stayed at Tracy's for a long weekend -- we love Kihei and have stayed in the area many times since childhood. Tracy's place was wonderful, just across the street from the beach and incredibly clean. We had a few situations where we needed her help (getting locked out and forgetting items at her condo) and she was incredibly nice helping us out each time. Would definitely stay there again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really great experience. Easy unloading of the car, no stairs. BBQ and pool on site. Great views out the back at sunset.
The unit is a bachelor pad, with lots of ammenities."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute spot very close to beach with lots of useful beach stuff. Tracy also had great recs for things to do.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect in this unit, host gave a ton of great location and food recommendations. Public, not crowded beach across the street that doubles as a turtle sanctuary!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, pictures were accurate, and Tracy went to great efforts to make sure things for my stay on the island were available - ample beach towels, chairs, blankets and a host of other things for different travelers.
Communication was solid, check in was easy‚Ä¶ overall a great spot to land in between adventuring around Maui!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was clean, easy to access, and as advertised."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great community, tennis courts, pool, and great hospitality. The owner also provided toiletries and beach equipment among other things."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 4 really enjoyed our stay at this conveniently located condo. All of the details have been thought of and I think this is a great value. It‚Äôs not perfect but was better than our expectations given the limited availability for Spring Break. Very clean and comfy within a couple of minutes from the shops and restaurants of Kihei and within 15 mins from the airport for easy return when you are done with your adventure. Thanks Tracy!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a perfect place to end our almost two week vacation in Maui!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet condo was exactly what I‚Äôd hoped for during our stay on Maui! Stacy thought of everything to make our life easy while we‚Äôre there- from COVID travel updates before our trip to the best places to visit on the island (and when, to save a few $). It was nice to be in central Kihei, next to so many places- but not smack dab next to all the restaurants and activities. I highly recommend sunsets at the beach across the street, the mango stand just a mile down the road (the picked mango pairs perfectly with pok√© from Times market), and sipping Lava Java on the porch in the morning while listening to the birds chatter amongst each other!
This pale Seattle gal also appreciated the aloe/sunscreen in the apartment too! I added to the collection before the flight home.
Mahalo for this wonderful (centralized!) retreat for so many beautiful things that Maui has to offer!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mahalo nui for having us stay at your beautiful home.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a well stocked temporary home in Maui, this is it. We love staying in Kihei, a little easier to have a spontaneous vacation and not worry about reservations with easy access to a lot of beaches. Tracy‚Äôs place was probably the most well stocked and thoughtfully curated home. Labels galore, never a question of how to work anything or concern on where to find something. She has all the beach essentials needed for your stay (chairs, cooler, umbrella, towels) really well done. Looking for a beach view? A quick walk across the street will get you just that.
This is a large studio setup (the bedroom and living room are one in the same) but was more than enough for the two of us.
When you get there drive around the parking lot until it dead ends to park closest to the unit, you‚Äôll need to walk up the ramp and then to your left to reach the unit."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great place that I can say will be on our list for our next trip! Tracy was very attentive both with communication, and with how her condo was set up. All you need to pack are your clothes! Everything we needed was well stocked and made our trip stress free. Just steps away from the beach and restaurants, it was the perfect spot to satisfy our every intention. Rest easy knowing that this little paradise is exactly what you need!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very conveniently located and close enough to the supermarket to the sea.The items in the room are very complete, a very good place, I will choose this place again next time I come next time I come"
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy‚Äôs condo is beautiful, clean, she is very responsive just let her know what you need. It will be done in to two shakes of a lamb‚Äôs tailüòä. If you are not driving and need to walk to stores check the pantry first see what you need. Get change for your laundry, ear plug for street noise and rent a boogie board."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great, with a very comfortable bed and a perfect location. Tracy left very detailed notes and helpful tips for everything, which was awesome. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy‚Äôs unit was affordable and convenient to what we were wanting to do. The condo was sparkling clean and INCREDIBLY well labeled and was just what we needed as a home base for a few days. She has thought of EVERYTHING and had lots of extra touches and items for her guests.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy‚Äôs place was in an awesome central location in Kihei. Very clean and as advertised. Much nicer than other places we stayed in Maui. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if we come back to Maui.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really beautifully decorated, feels like home. Clean and comfortable. Love the beachy vibe."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place was a perfect spot for our Maui trip. Her place is very clean and stocked with many items. She is great at communicating and has a binder with all sorts of helpful information. The condo is directly across from a wonderful beach where we saw turtles every day! I will definitely consider staying with her again. Hopefully, she will keep acquiring more rentals because I would love to take me entire family to stay in one of her condos. Also, there are no hidden fees. She is upfront and thorough with her guests. Mahalo Tracy!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You could tell that Tracy had thought of every little detail when it came to the condo and its amenities. We loved the beach chairs and umbrella, but the little touches like Aloe for sunburns and a noise maker at night were really nice to have. The bed was amazingly comfortable. There was quite a bit of roadside noise, but the high tech sound machine made a huge difference (option #19 White Noise). Great, comfortable place to rent in the area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tracy‚Äôs place is five stars across the board for the price. Clean place, great location, and an attentive host who thought of everything we might have needed for a comfortable stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay - right in the middle of everything you need to see. I recommend going down to Makena beach - was a blast!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs condo was exactly what we needed! Easy to check-in, close to the beach, comfortable stay. Hopefully we will be back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend staying at Tracy‚Äôs place! Very accurate description and communication is great! RIGHT across the street from the beach, could see the water from inside the condo. Close to everything you need in Kihei. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for letting us stay in your beautiful condo. EVERYTHING we needed was there. My sister and I enjoyed the location and the decor.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good location, very close to the beach, Tracy is a very enthusiastic personü§ùü§ù"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy‚Äôs place is amazing, it is everything we wanted and more. It is literally a two minute walk to the beach where there is an ancient lagoon wall that sea turtles come to Rest in morning and evening. The residents are amazingly kind and helpful with any I do you may need. We could not reccomend the is place more, especially for kids. We have a 4 year old, who will remember our first family vacation forever!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location with steps away from the beach. The condo is well stocked and extremely organized with everything clearly labeled. We had an excellent time.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traci pays attention to details and it matters. Labels conveniently located to help you find everything you need. Comfortable atmosphere. Cool air conditioning, which is very important. I most of all you can feel the cheer that is in Tracy‚Äòs personality when you walk into one of her places. This is not the first time I stayed at Traci‚Äòs And it will not be the last!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, close by all the major spots. Steps away from the water. A very cozy and comfortable spot to relax while in Kihei."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming, economical and great location. Terrific way to explore Maui on a budget."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy's place was an amazing place to stay for our week in Maui! First, the location is so convenient ‚Äî close to local food places, a beach is right across the street, and is a great home base for exploring the island. The condo itself is an incredible example of making people truly feel like they are at home while on vacation. Not only is it beautiful, fun, and full of charm, it is also STOCKED with everything you might need ‚Äî kitchen essentials, entertainment, and beach gear amongst many other things. The bed is also huge and very comfortable. The complex itself is safe, clean, and full of other friendly travellers and the pool is clean and well maintained. Tracy was super communicative, and left a tonne of wonderful tips for our stay. Would highly recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy‚Äôs condo was perfect for our family of 3 (my husband, 9 year old daughter and I).
The king size bed was so comfortable!
And there is a pull out sofa, but we didn‚Äôt use it for sleeping.
The kitchen is stocked with a few essentials to help with cooking. And has plenty of pots, pans, plates, bowls, cups, etc.
There is even a Brita in the fridge for water.
There was plenty of shampoo and conditioner options as well as a hair dryer.
Tracy even has the essentials for the beach. Chairs, beach towels, coolers, toys, etc!
We really enjoyed drinking our coffee every morning out on the back patio.
The pool is well maintained and right near this unit.
The location is perfect. Kihei is great for access to some small, not overly crowded beaches.
The condo is right across the street from the beach. And this beach has turtles come ashore every night and they are so wonderful to see in the morning.
Just remember to stay at least 10 feet away.
There are plenty of restaurants right up the street.
And a grocery store.
The condo is in an easy location to head to Wailea, Lahaina, Paia, and so much more!
Tracy is very communicative and provided so much great information.
We absolutely loved staying here and will definitely be back!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy's place was very comfy and she left detailed guide for every amenity available. It made us feel very comfortable in Maui.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will literally be across the street from the beach! It‚Äôs very clean and neat!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. There was no detail left undone. Tracy is extremely thoughtful in the way she organizes her Airbnb‚Äòs.
Most of the residents there are extremely polite and friendly only One of the residents was pretty rude and left a note on my rental car. But I am a black girl and when I travel alone people tend to pick on me. I‚Äôm sure others will not have this issue."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. The check in book had lots of good suggestions and info. The unit was very clean and well equipped. The bed was sooo comfortable (probably the best nights sleep I have had in some time). We loved being located right across from a small beach and just a few minutes away from all of Kehei's restaurants. We loved how easy Tracy made our stay on the island. definitely recommend!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with 5 star upgrades at an affordable price! The location gave us access to popular destinations along the coastline. Every detail was thought of when this place was redone. Tracy, our host, was always quick to respond to my questions and has a Guidebook binder that elevates your stay in Maui. A local knows best! Highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it is one of the most beautiful places, greta decoration and super clean!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Close to the beach, very comfortable setting, loved the beach touch. This condo included a lot of extras that were necessities on my vacation. Highly recommend and will absolutely visit again."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to hang your hat while in Maui!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy was super friendly and a great help for our first trip to Maui. We stayed three nights and enjoyed every bit of it! 10/10 would recommended to anyone staying in Kihei.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great value and a great host!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WHAT A LIFESAVER. My fiancee and I had booked a camper Jeep and then got to Maui and ALL the campsites except for one were closed. So we got on AirBnB and found this gem. Great location just about 100 yards from a huge beach with breathtaking sunsets. You can't see them from the apartment but you can just across the street. The condo has a great king bed with fans and a great breeze throughout the night. It's about an hour to Haleakala summit with great access to upcountry and small town Maui. My advice: book this place, get a Jeep, and drive the backroad to Hana. So much fun. Great place to stay while we were in town. Thanks again!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! Well appointed for those early mornings and Long Beach days. Comfy beach chairs and towels and everything you could possibly need while on vacation. It was like being home because she provided everything!
Additionally, she labeled everything in the house... and I mean everything! She made it easy to find everything and the labels on the doors were nice reminders about parking, locking, and check-in/out procedures.
Finally, Tracy was a super communicator... on our last day we ended up needing luggage storage early in the morning. We sent a message and she responded within minutes with an option that helped us out!
This was more like staying at a family property than anything else.
We highly recommend Tracy‚Äôs place!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place was amazing. In a great location, clean, and everything was so easy. It was easy to check in, she has everything labeled so it is easy to find everything. It‚Äôs easy to find the garbage disposal, easy to find the light switch in the middle of the night, and easy to use the tv with very detailed directions. If you want a great, easy, convenient stay for your vacation Tracy is the exact person to make your life easier."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time in Maui. Location, location, location. We were in Kihei, steps to the beach, and local groceries were very close.
Easy checkin, and the condo is steps to the pool & jacuzzi. Tracy is a super host‚Äî she supplied the condo with everything you‚Äôll need for your vacay. We cooked a lot & saved money on food. Parking is so easy and it is on the ground level too. The CONS : being on ground level, we could hear the heavy footsteps above. There is no set dining table to eat together, but we were fine with the bar set up (max 2ppl) when eating. It was no big deal. Overall, we had a great time. Highly recommend this condo."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, close to the beach and has good options for food nearby. Check in and check out was smooth and parking was easy. The unit was in great shape and I can‚Äôt think of anything that we felt like was missing. Highly recommend if staying in Maui."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place exceeded all expectations! Everything was super clean, the unit was amazingly well appointed, the bed was comfortable, Tracy was super communicative and easy to work with, the location is great and right across the street from a nice little beach with sea turtles hanging out often, and the complex itself is perfect for a quiet family vacation. I would 100% rent this unit again and without hesitation highly recommend it! Thank you, Tracy!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tracy was a great host, she was very responsive even with short notice. The place was very cute and very clean. Highly recommend!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying at Tracy‚Äôs place. Has everything you need and much more! Amazing book selection. She was super communicative and kind. Would stay again when in Maui.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing time at Tracy‚Äôs place. The place was very clean and the location was fantastic! All the local tips and info were especially helpful. Highly recommended!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, literally across the street from a quaint little beach. Lots of amenities! Anything you could need for the beach is available! Would highly recommend and stay again if able :)"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was amazing. The location is so perfect on the island. The beach is right across the street and there is a pool & hot tub on site. Tracy is the most detailed and thoughtful host I‚Äôve stayed with so far - the condo has all the ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù you don‚Äôt have room to pack into your checked bags for vacation. The king sized bed is WONDERFUL and so comfortable. We even asked her what kind of mattress it is so we can purchase one ourselves :) Tracy helped me make our stay super special for my now husband, as we were there for our honeymoon. Would stay here again and refer my family and closest friends to Tracy as well!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and accurate to Tracy‚Äôs description. Loved the color scheme and all of the thoughtful touches. Very clean unit.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy provides you with everything you need to hit the beach! There are beach chairs & towels there- even tennis rackets for the tennis courts! (We tried to use them but it was a popular amenity - get up early!) Really fantastic spot.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Summary: pros - great community amenities, location, convenience; cons - tight for family of four but works
We had a great stay with Tracy! This condo has a fantastic location and community. It's minutes away from the farmer's market, Safeway, Times, and Foodland (best poke value!) and central to everything on Maui from Lahaina to Waimea to Kahului (Walmart, Costco, Target). It seems to save about 20 minutes on every trip whether it's coming from OGG or going to Haleakala or Hana or Waihee, etc.
We also enjoyed all the community amenities. The pool, hot tub and tennis court are all very well maintained. The hot tub gets a little social into the evening -- everyone is very friendly especially the long-term residents. The laundry room has about 10 washers and 10 dryers all with app-based payment capability in case you don't have coins. We never had any trouble finding parking and multiple people offered help with our Jeep rental (do you need a hand taking the top off, what's a fun off-road trail).
We found all our necessities for living and cooking in the condo. We had a family of 4 (kids age 12 and 8) and it's pretty cozy. Sleeping was fine with the sofa bed (the king bed is super comfy) but there isn't a place for four people to eat together. We cooked breakfast every morning so it would usually work out that two would be eating at the counter and maybe one standing and one cooking etc. It's probably best for a smaller (or younger) family but if you're flexible it works fine. There were also plenty of accessible outlets.
The beach park is super convenient right across the street. There is a green space for doing yoga or exercise and a nice sandy beach. Older kids may want a longer beach to walk/explore, but it's perfect for sunsets and younger kids (there is a breakwater to block waves).
Weather was perfect during our stay (Kihei gets maybe 10 days of rain a year?), but in case you want to stay in there are tons of movies and some games.
Tracy is super responsive and answered all our questions immediately. She provides a ton of information and is very helpful. Hope to visit again soon!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay. The place was very clean and stylish. It had a big kitchen which was wonderful. Our favorite part was the bed. It was soooo comfortable!! The condo is also located in a great location. Just down the street from all the restaurants and cafes. Also in the middle of the island so you can easily access other parts as well:) thanks again for being so accommodating, Tracy!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and friendly with a detailed binder of all your need-to-know information. Location was fairly convenient to most places around the island. Tracy was always very responsive and made our vacation stay more than comfortable.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The amenities were incredible. Didn‚Äôt have to go the store for anything other than food. Super clean, super cute. Perhaps the most amazing part of our stay was the communication. We were in Maui when a hurricane was supposed to hit. Tracy sent us tips for safety and even she even had a worker check in on us and give us an extra flashlight. Definitely book this spot."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Mahalo Tracy
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I felt so nice here, the host is great, so many amenities provided. Best hosts award for sure! Thank you so much Tracy üôè"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was an amazing host! She has designed and decorated her place with comfort and convenience in mind! We found her place to be our home away from home! We truly felt like home and not as if we were staying in a strange place.
We originally planned to island hop to Maui in May for our anniversary, but due to the islands closing for travel, our plans were out on hold. Thankfully inter-island travel opened July 1 and Tracy‚Äôs place was available and just perfect for our little three-day getaway!
Her coffee table guide included EVERYTHING you needed to know about this island along with recommendations.
The king size bed...wow! We didn‚Äôt want to leave it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è And having a full kitchen stocked with essentials to prep or cook with was an added bonus. AND she includes beach day supplies! She has thought of EVERYTHING to make your vacation just perfect!
Mahalo, Tracy!! üåàüå§üíô"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Tracy has thought about every step of your trip, thoughtful variety of beach and shower towels, beach chairs, local guides (some are hand written by other guests in one of the notebooks and some in form of travel guides and some in her binder) and more!!
She even has the name of all local restaurants that are open during Covid, in case you want take out orders.
This place amazing. Thank you"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy has created a unique and thoughtfully appointed space in Kihei. It‚Äôs clear a lot of thought has gone into making the condo as comfortable and convenient as possible. Everything you might need is included, from shampoo and conditioner to beach chairs and towels, to extra pillows and bedding. The location is directly across from the beach, and the condo itself has great feature, including a king size bed and queen sofa bed, entertainment center, all the kitchen supplies you need (including a water filter‚Äîalways appreciated!) and spices for cooking, plenty of clean dish towels etc.
I absolutely recommend this space for couples and small families looking for a sweet and convenient getaway in Kihei! Thanks for the lovely experience, Tracy!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is a very colorful Maui experience! Tracy has stocked the place with everything you need to make your stay smooth and easy, plus everything is labeled so you don‚Äôt waste time looking. The book of tips and recommendations was a really nice touch and made finding cool dinner spots easy. We enjoyed our stay so much, we even decided to stay a few extra days! 10/10 recommend!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a great location and Tracy's knowledge of local places is unsurpassed! We loved our stay and highly recommend!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey's place was fabulous, just what I needed and I slept like a rock in the amazing bed. The location was great, walked across the street both nights i was there and watched the sunset. It was super easy getting in utilizing their clear instruction, while in the space, you could choose to play games, cook, watch movies.. Furnished with beach chairs, yoga mats, tennis rackets... Wish I was there for vacation instead of work.. I Will book this place again when I come back for sure! Grab groceries and it feels like you may have just moved in to your own little get away. :)"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed staying at TTT#3 very much. We could not have asked for better or more thorough communication. Everything from check-in to finding amenities and convenience items. We appreciated having a kitchen where we could actually cook meals comfortably. Finally, the unit was quite clean when we arrived."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Very clean. Tracy has added lots of touches to try to think of things you could need.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy has got it down to a science!!
She has really put her heart into creating a welcoming and comfortable vacation home at a very reasonable price. We absolutely loved our stay at TTT#3 and definitely hope to return in the future!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place was beautifully decorated, extremely well kept and clean! Everything was labeled which made things easy! Would recommend!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs room is in an excellent location with plenty of nearby things to do. It is a great value place to stay with tons of amenities and thoughtful touches. Always check the drawers or look around before you go out to buy something you need/forgot. Tracy has most likely thought of it and it‚Äôs in the room somewhere. There‚Äôs a pull out / swiveling TV, cool mood lights, a little porch outside, and so many other nice details. Overall, I highly recommend this stay in Maui."
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,good
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our favorite location out of the 4 (yes, FOUR) places we stayed in this apartment complex!
The bed is extremely comfortable and the place was sparkling clean. It is next to a road but it is not terribly loud, and it is across from the whale sanctuary where there happens to be a lot of sea turtles.
Check this place out if you can while in Maui! üå∫"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy is a great host who clearly cares about the experience of her guests and that is evident by all her thoughtful touches to the unit.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place has a really accurate description. Tracy was an Amazing host we really liked the quality of the unit everything was new and high quality. It was not a basic equipped unit everything was top of the line. Tracy thought of everything anything you could ask for was provided in the unit. We really like how clean everything was when we came in and how nothing felt old or worn out. We really liked the view of the ocean across street and this unit is very close to the pool and hot tub.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location away from all the big resorts. The triangle is 2 miles away and gives some night life. Big Beach is amazing and close to the place. The pool and hot tub are an added bonus after a day of exploring the island. If you plan on staying here read through Tracy‚Äôs book of recommendations and tips they come in handy! Tracy is also super easy to communicate with and responds in seconds!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tracy‚Äôs place is simply excellent. This was our first trip to Maui and the accommodations were ideal for us. It is located in a terrific area, across from the beach and close to many other gorgeous beaches. The condo complex is very clean and well kept. The condo has every possible amenity you could want or need. Tracy is very prompt in her responses and she has literally thought of everything a guest could need. Her binder of info and tips is a great addition to the whole experience.
An excellent choice and we would highly recommend it."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place to stay in Kehei.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy's was awesome! The apartment had everything, all the amenities, a binder Tracy put together with great information about the area and anything else we could have needed, and the location cannot be beat. We ate at Piko Cafe down the street for breakfast nearly every morning, there was also a great place for Mexican food called Roasted Chile's, and Miso Phat sushi was less than a mile away. It is close to GREAT food and right across the way there are a few beaches and coves to choose from that were the least bit crowded. It was like we had our own private beach! We did the road to Hana which started a few miles away from Tracy's. Everything about our stay was perfect and it's all thanks to Tracy!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy has thought of absolutely everything you could possibly need. If you just show up with a bathing suit flip flops and sunscreen you'll have a great time. The binder will not let you down.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy's place was great! Would highly recommend and it even has a view of the ocean.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay at Tracy‚Äôs unit! For first timers to Maui, the location could not be beat. Quick drive to all major attractions. Loved the amenities - coffee maker, beach towels and other comforts of home."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracy's place was more than we could possibly imagine! She thought of everything a guest could possibly need! From beach gear to ice chest to snorkel equipment. The place was clean and had everything we needed to cook dinner. Right across the street from the beach. Simply amazing! Will definitely stay again!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was as cute and clean and well stocked as the photos. Easy to locate and check in and had everything you could need.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy‚Äôs home was beautiful and her hospitality was way beyond our expectations! She definitely provided my family with all that we needed and much more to make our stay in Maui amazing. We only stayed two nights, but I wished we stayed the entire 10 days we were in Maui. We loved the baby beach, perfect for our 3yr old son, just a cross the condo and we experienced swimming with turtles at sunset both nights. Thank you so much! I highly recommend her condo as it makes you feel like your in a Hawaiian home. I loved all the positive quotes around and the overall decor! We look forward to staying there again in the future. üòç"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location! Out of this world amenities! Exceeded my expectations! Super user friendly!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Everything is labeled and east to use. Great communication. An altogether positive experience for us.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is there for you! So clean, colorful and comfy!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well Tracy's place is just amazing! Honestly, I stay in two different airbnbs while I was on Maui and I have stayed in different hotels on Maui as well. Tracy's place is my favorite! It is so clean and very cutely decorated! She was so quick to respond to any questions I had. It was in a perfect location, right across the street from the beach and only a few short minutes to drive to fun shops and places to eat. What made her place so nice, was her clear commitment to her guests. She provided many different amenities and had a large binder full of information including an overview of the condo, restaurant menus, and places to go while on Maui (beaches, road to Hana, etc.) Thank you Tracy, I'll definitely be back soon!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at Tracy‚Äôs place for two nights. The place was impeccable and right across the street from beach access. The bed was super comfy and the decor gave you a beachy feel. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy it.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, and all the extra special touches in the apartment."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had such an amazing time at Tracy‚Äôs place. The Complex has plenty of parking, there is a pool, and the beach is just across the street. The condo itself is well maintained and very clean. All the main restaurants and shops in Kihei are just down the street ($10 uber/lyft) so it‚Äôs super convenient. My wife and I really enjoyed staying here. Tracy is a warm and generous host and we will definitely stay at her place again the next time we make our way to Maui."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs place was very clean, in a good location close to the triangle and restaurants. She has all the amenities you could ever want. Would definitely come back again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely amazing thanks to Tracy and her excellent attention to detail. The condo came stocked with everything you could imagine and then some, need beach gear? She‚Äôs got it. Picnic set? That too. Sore after a long day of riding the waves? Heated blanket for that. The sheer amenities alone saved us some serious coins and allowed us to invest that much more in our vacation. We come to Hawaii several times a year, and I can safely say that from now on I will only stay in a place offered by Tracy."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Trust me this is the right spot
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here, you will be glad you do! Tracy has thought of everything - all you need for a great beach day, pool time, local activities, places to eat, and staying in activities are included. The place is super clean and looks just as the pictures show. Access to the pool and parking are easy and close to this unit, and the whole complex is nicely kept up. The check in and out procedures were easy and the ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list before leaving was clear, concise and a breeze to complete. The personal tone of the stay was helpful and real nice ."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a super cute place! The decor, cleanliness, well-stocked studio suite turned out to be even better than in the pics! Only steps to the pool and right across from the beach. Parking was plenty and its central location made easy access to N & S Kihei. Grab your rental car from the airport and you're all set for your holiday. Tracy easy to contact and responds quickly. I was extremely happy I picked this place, it made my stay even better than imagined! Thanks Tracy, I'll def be back!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,HIGHLY recommended! There‚Äôs nothing Tracy didn‚Äôt think of! Her place is central to everything we wanted to do in Maui and she even had a connection with someone who got us all of our adventure tickets for a low price!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, everything you could need is there. Beach across the street is just ok. Not within good walking distance of restaurants."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracey‚Äôs condo was perfect and exactly as it appear in the pictures, which is adorable. Tracey has left a great book with lots of detail regarding the area and has provided a lot of extras that you wouldn‚Äôt normally get with a rental (like beach chairs, coolers, pool equipment, yoga mats, and even a wine chiller). Beach access is amazingly convenient. If you are thinking about booking this one, do it! You won‚Äôt regret it."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite thing about this apartment was all the amenities that were provided. Tracy did such a great job providing everything we could possibly need. My favorite was the beach chairs! We took them to a bunch of different beaches to relax at. It was always easy to find parking and Kihei is a great central location when visiting Maui. Tracy‚Äôs place is also a 5 min drive from grocery stores and restaurants. Would love to stay here again!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy is a perfect host. Her attention to detail is incredible. The unit was extremely well-equipped and nicely-decorated. Everything was as described and more! I would highly recommend booking at one of her beautiful condos!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy's place is perfect for a couple or group of 3, great location, sparkling clean, and very comfortable! Fully stocked with nearly every amenity you would want--lots of kitchen supplies, beach chairs, reusable totes, books to borrow, etc. Also had great linens for the pull out couch--something that is often neglected other places! As the member of my group to sleep on the couch, I was super appreciative of that :)"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience with staying at an Airbnb and I was pleasantly surprised at how convenient, clean and cute this condo was. My friends and I thought it was a great value and I have already recommended Tracy as a host to my family members planning their next vacation to Maui üëç"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tracy‚Äôs #3 place was exactly like the pictures. It was such a cozy little place and decorated very cute! The bed was really comfy. Tracy thought of so many small details and it made it so convenient because she had everything you could ever want or need. She also has everything clearly labeled so there isn‚Äôt any question about what goes where or how to use something in the unit. We appreciated the beach chairs and umbrella and used them every day we were there. The location of the condo is perfect. We enjoyed the little beach across the street for a beach day, as well as sunsets at night. The pool and hot tub were nice to have on site and very clean. There was a lot of information in the binder on the coffee table about the area, as well as the guest books that previous guests have written where they had eaten or visited there and their experiences. Tracy was very quick to respond as well when we had a question while we were visiting. We can‚Äôt wait to come back to Tracy‚Äôs place when we come for our next visit to Maui. If you are hesitant, I assure you you will love it as much as we did!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tracy has thought of everything. My only reservation about rave reviews is that it may not be available next time we want to stay
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"You will not find a better more well stocked space anywhere! The bed, the linens, the Towels were upgraded with high end quality. Every detail was attended to, local recommendations, Mood lighting, fans and AC, a huge TV, close proximity to the pool, an Ocean View, a comfortable sitting area outside, the Bed was the most comfortable Bed you can imagine with a hypoallergenic bed cover you melted in. The kitchen had upgraded new appliances, There were beach chairs and flip flops, books and videos, I was torn to leave sometimes!! The closeness to Restaurants, Post Office, Gas, everything so near. Wailea a mere 7 miles away. Target and Walmart close for incidentals it was absolute perfection and as a Host Tracy deserves an award for attention to detail. The space was Immaculate! There were even ample Hangars!! Art on the walls, Colorful d√©cor, you name it! I was in the most amazing space, I would highly recommend Tracy and her Unit 155 hands down as compared to any other experience in Maui. She is Truly the Host with the most!! Thank you for your fast responses and great taste!! I will be back!! ~ Jody Yetti"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing place!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB was amazing. Nice central location that is easy to getting to Road to Hana or to Lahaina, next to a nice beach. Great restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes. We felt extremely welcomed by Tracy and the amenities in the condo. We would definitely stay here again."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy‚Äôs place is perfect. We highly recommend this property. We felt like we were just at home and this condo had everything! We definitely would stay here again and recommend to any friends and family.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy's spot is awesome! The location is very central to many beaches, cafes and shops! Her communication and the check-in process were superb. Definitely recommend the space to couples looking for a cozy and welcoming spot."
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy‚Äôs had a beautiful look to it, reminding us of paradise, and the pictures are accurate. Overall, it was a good place to stay!
Tracy puts a lot of thought into making her place a ‚Äòhome-away-from-home,‚Äô and it shows. She includes all the necessities and some great amenities! It has everything that you really need. Sunscreen, bug spray, soaps? She‚Äôs got it! She even has lawn chairs and yoga mats if that is something you want to use, and a ton of other stuff too. She has really tried to think of everything. There are even washers and dryers on the premises that have reasonable operating hours; however, we‚Äôd recommend doing it in the daylight because once it‚Äôs dark, the path there is unlit so you need to be more careful.
In terms of location, it‚Äôs an amazing one! It‚Äôs close to many amazing things like snorkeling areas, beaches (there‚Äôs one literally right across the street), wonderful food places (some of our favorites are just a few minutes down the road), and more! She also provided a useful binder of information and recommendations. While some things were outdated (i.e., the menus were outdated and a listed restaurant was closed), it was still ultimately helpful.
Parking was easy and finding a space wasn‚Äôt a problem. Also, Tracy is very responsive by AirBnb and gave us several recommendations, though we didn‚Äôt get to meet or talk to her in person as she isn‚Äôt on site.
We did drop one star due to a few things. First, the bed is extremely soft: you literally sink into it and it‚Äôs hard to move. It ended up making us feel stiff in the mornings, and my wife got lower back pain. The couch would have been a better option to sleep on for her. Even I found it to be too much, and I prefer soft beds. Second, the floor was a little dirty; it left my white socks gray after walking around for a bit. Not a big deal, but something to consider for those who like to walk around barefoot. Third, the AC unit was inconsistent and would sometimes stop working and need to be turned off and on again to get it to work. And finally, keep in mind that unlike other AirBnb‚Äôs, you have to strip the bed and take out the trash yourself rather than having them do it.
But those things did not really take away from our enjoyment of the place; overall, it was a good and convenient location to stay at!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, lovely amenities, and wonderful host! We were so happy!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this!! It's such an awesome spot with all the amenities you need. Perfect for 4 adults. Love the setup and parking is easy. Location is really great to hit all the top Maui sites. Extremely clean, loved the place!!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy's condo was all colorful and fun to stay. I'm jealous of the people who have stayed here for longer than 2-3 days because, the house as well as the location is filled with a lot of things to do. The house is organized with great attention to the needs of people coming in to stay and making it easy & accessible with the labeling. I recommend visitors skim through two books in the condo - one, Tracy's Property Binder and two, the Visitor Diary. Both of these have plenty of recommendations with what's & what not's of the area. All in all, a memorable stay."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tracy's place is in a great location, close to beaches, restaurants and supermarkets. The condo was clean and organized with all the amenities you need and more. Staying at Tracy's was easy and convenient making our trip that much smoother."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wow we had an amazing time at Tracy's Tropical Treasures #3. I cannot say enough good things about it. I mean the location was perfect (we really love Kihei). Parking was easy we never had any difficulty finding a spot. The room was spacious, cute, comfortable, organized and clean. Tracy really took great pains to make the place warm and welcoming but at the same time, keep the fun spirit of Maui in the decorating. Tracy really went out of her way to make sure that we had everything we needed for our adventures in Maui. The small touches were my favorite. Just little things that she did to make the studio a home away from home (but better) and the bed was so comfy. I would love to come back here and visit again and if I could, I would stay at Tracy's Tropical Treasures again."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Tracy‚Äôs Tropical Treasures and we absolutely love it!!! SO close to many great beaches, actives (snorkeling,whale watching, hiking ,Maui Ocean Center, Maui Brewery to name a few), amazing food! Tracy is always very helpful and responsive to any questions you may have. Thank you so much Tracy for making us feel at home! We can not wait to come back to Maui and stay at one of your tropical treasures again!!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy‚Äôs place did not disappoint! Waking up every morning in a bright place that embodies paradise gave me the energy I needed for those early morning dives and hikes! Everything about this stay was wonderful - from the extensive kitchen equipment (we cooked a delicious thanksgiving meal here!) to the friendly community within the complex (had a great chat with the neighbors!). The location really can‚Äôt be beat. It‚Äôs a good center locations for everything you want to see in Maui and not far from a number of scuba piers and nightlife. Highly recommend Tracy‚Äôs‚Äô
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo was in a great location and Tracy thought of everything possible to supply for amenities, we had everything we could possibly need from table cloth weights to a wine chiller and anything in between. Tracy was very attentive and responded to anything needed within minutes, makes all the difference in the world to have a responsive host. I would recomend Tracy‚Äôs Tropical Treasure properties to anyone looking for a great Airbnb Maui experience"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great!!!
It was close to all of my places I had lined up not to mention the recommendations Tracey had in her book to top it off. It had every amenity possible Hahahaha, well thought out for guests. I‚Äôd recommend going for to the next individual here."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a find! Tracy was very helpful and gave us great tips on what to see while in Maui. The super cute condo was a good size for the three of us and was well-stocked. There is a ‚Äúbaby beach‚Äù across the street that our ten-month-old loved, and the pool was the perfect place to cool off in the evening. Perfect location, great amenities and a helpful host made for a wonderful vacation!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tracy‚Äôs place is amazing! Great location in Kihei and central to several activities throughout Maui.
Amenities and extra touches throughout the place are amazing, from the kitchen, bathroom, and all the available books to read at the beach."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely amazing!!!
You will be glad you chose Tracy‚Äôs
No exaggeration. Tracy has prepared a place where all has been thought out and handled. You will be glad you chose this unit.
Even the most critical soul will be content here. üèÑüå∫üëç"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot to be in Maui- Tracy's treasure is truly a gem!! Highly recommend to anyone!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place To Stay,Very Clean And Warm. Close To Everything. Very Hospitable. Highly Recommend It. Larry"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We love Maui and we love Tracy's place! The rest of the glowing reviews are true...Tracy has thought of everything to make you feel at home. And everything in the space is clearly labeled and organized, and comes with a notebook of extremely useful information about the place itself and suggestions for the area. It's very cute, packed full of amenities, and extremely comfortable and convenient. I highly recommend staying at Tracy's, it will make your experience in Maui that much better!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was everything prior positive reviews said it would be. We were centrally located in Kihei just across a kids beach. The condo had everything we needed and then some. Tracy also provided tips in a handy binder. We will definitely look to book this condo again in the future.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay.. Tracy has included everything you need for a week in Maui! Kihei is a hidden gem... away from the hustle and bustle of Wailea, but a very close drive/Uber to everything. The town of Kihei itself had great restaurants and happy hours, and we loved the location of the condo! Everything in the condo is thoughtful, from extra beach towels to mood lighting. Tracy has truly thought of everything you need for a great time in Maui!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There‚Äôs a reason Tracy‚Äôs place is ranked #1, well, actually many reasons! Location is perfect for people who have never been to Maui before. A stones throw from a beach across the street with big sea turtles (if u know where to look) and access to a great pool/jacuzzi area that isn‚Äôt overrun with people or kids and is super mellow, exactly what we wanted. Everything in the condo is so well thought out and labeled it‚Äôs better than a hotel because in a hotel you may need to call the front desk at least once. Documentation and instructions so clear you have everything u need with minimal research and a remote click away! Very comfortable environment, and super easy to check in/out. Honestly one of the best Airbnb experiences we‚Äôve had to date. Location is right near everything in Kihei and about a 20 min trip to airport and about a half hour or less to Lahaina. Kihei has lots of great places to eat and local charm. I highly recommend this place and if we come back we hope it‚Äôs available. Thanks so much!!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our very first visit to Maui and I can promise you we will return and the only place we plan to stay is at Tracy's!! The entire experience with Tracy was beyond exceptional. The space is well designed, very clean and super organized. There was nothing else we could have asked to have been available in the space. Tracy has clearly thought of everything a traveler might need. Tracy has a 3-ring binder filled with all kinds of insider tips to enjoying your time in Maui. We used many of her tips to make the most of our stay and several of the suggestions we wouldn't have known about without her thoughtfulness. The book shelves are filled with wonderful reading options to help you learn about the area and includes a wide variety or books and DVDs. The space is colorful and bright. It just makes you smile! All of the little touches throughout the space make it truly divine! If you plan to visit Maui, don't spend days and days like I did researching tons of options and trying to figure out the best place to stay...there is NO DOUBT, Tracy's place is truly remarkable and something not to be missed!! Thanks Tracy for allowing us to stay!! We could not be any happier with our entire experience!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the cherry on top of our trip to have a clean, comfortable place to rest our heads after a long day of adventures. Thank you Tracy your place was perfect."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy's place is in a great location on Maui. Close to beautiful beaches and great food. Tracy provides you with anything you might not want to pack (think beach towels) and most things you may forget (think aloe). Lovely place to stay!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect stay, we will definitely rent with Tracy if we return to Maui. She has a true gift for hosting, immaculately clean, every comfort provided, very organized and well labeled for ease.
A/C, 3 large ceiling fans, beach chairs, beach towels, movies, books, mood lighting, large smart TV, games, island instruction manual, and what we loved the most... a notebook with handwritten notes from guest stating their faves on the island. We copied the best of the best repeated things in that guestbook and did those things! Thank you, we will be back."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tracy‚Äôs place was amazing. She put so much time and effort into making her place feel comfortable. Anything I could possibly need was already there. Loved it so much
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location in paradise, central to pretty much everything. Tracy is a great host, the extra touches she puts into both her communications and the condo are what make the trip enjoyable. When she says everything you could possibly need is there she is not kidding around. Comprehensive local information, a FULL kitchen and everything you need to set up camp at the beach. We will definitely stay again if ever in Maui again."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, easy parking, close to it all."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, good location and stocked with everything you can think of."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is very nice place to stay, lots small decorations in there. A wonderful experience of my first night in Maui. I hope I can stay longer when next time visiting Maui."
,,,"My friend and I reserved this Airbnb for 2 nights originally. We arrived at 2pm, went back to the beach for quite some time and got back around 730pm that same evening. Not even an hour there and we notice cockroaches (decent size and little baby ones) crawling all over the kitchen counters, walls, and even ceilings! We immediately grabbed our luggage and left. Refused to give any payment back to us. Unethical"
,,,Nice but small and hot. Host tried to say I burned the linen on a bed I don‚Äôt use
