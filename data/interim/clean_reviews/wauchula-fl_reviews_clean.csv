2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely lake house to enjoy sunsets and good bass fishing. Our dogs loved the large fenced-in yard and the hosts are great communicators. We look forward to returning!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent place for a quiet getaway. The view of the lake from the backyard is beautiful and peaceful. My stay was for a business trip, so I couldn't take advantage of the lake or the boats they have to use, but I'm sure it would be fun. The house is old but clean, functional, and comfortable. The couches in the living area are comfortable and offer a great view of the backyard and the lake, and the pool table would be great entertainment for a family or small group of friends."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home is spacious with a gorgeous view of the lake. Kitchen was well stocked, abd the home was clean."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent location for bird watchers and fishermen!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our favorite Air B and B’s…and we have been to a lot! Very well appointed, so much fun! Many things to do and so peaceful. Our pups loved running around the huge yard! We felt so comfortable. It was a great reprieve for two Florida teachers! We definitely will return!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was very pleased with the location and amenities. Right from booking Phil was very communicative and helpful. Loved the big fenced yard for my dogs and peaceful sunsets over the lake.
Everything in the house was comfortable and clean. I will certainly be staying there again in the future."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"the house was very comfortable. sunsets beautiful, everything you needed. good location to town. enjoyed our stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place that we will be returning to!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying here and we would definitely come back again. The scenery is beautiful, great views and wildlife would always visit on the dock. It’s like a home away from home. Great space and pretty comfortable. They were extremely communicative and check in was easy, even though we didn’t get there until after 8:30pm/9pm the night of check in. I would recommend this host to anyone and would definitely recommend this home for anyone needing a place to stay in the area. It’s close to everything you would need and not fair at all from Sebring that has even more to offer (15 mins if that from Publix)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful for dogs and everyone!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had a wonder stay at the lake house! It felt like i was at home, the views looking over the lake are breathtaking"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sonya and Phil are great hosts. Cozy, clean and convenient location. We will be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Weather was cloudy and it drizzled during my stay, but it didn't damper anything. I enjoyed it even more without the beating sun and didn't need to turn on the ac. The air was clean inside and out. Picture-perfect view of the lake and beautiful moss-covered, large oak trees from the comfort of the cozy and spacious family room's nearly wall-to-wall windows--great layout. I saw a group of cute ducks in the morning dunking their heads in the water for food and shaking their tails in the air. There is sand and the water is clear. Plenty of equipment for fishing and spending time on the lake. Overall, very serenely peaceful and ultra-relaxing and the hosts are a friendly and responsive couple."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a diamond in the rough! Like a trip to camp as a child. The sunsets are hallmark quality. We werent real active, but enjoyed lots of eating, movies, football and sitting outside .
Very relaxing. Quiet atmosphere.
Looking forward to another stay in the summer time. Would love to walk out on the dock.
The hosts are very nice, pleasant, accomodating and responsive"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at the lake House. We always enjoy our selfs with all there is to do. Fishing early mornings, Bass and bluegill. Horse shoes on beach and corn hole. Game of pool at night. Enjoying the nature, owl, Sandhill Cranes. Our Greyhound loves the full fenced yard and laying on the beach. The house is always clean and comfortable. I personally just love this this place! Being from Michigan it reminds me of going up north to the cottage. clean and comfortable..
Thank you
Phil and Sonya
Ice always in the freezer and stocked with bags. Don’t forget your beach towels. We always put a foot rinse bucket on the back porch. :) see you next time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our relaxing time at this lakehouse. The inside was a bit dated, but fine and comfortable for a low key trip and very consistent with the advertised pictures. The owner communicated upfront about the fact that the dock was unusable due to damage from Hurricane Ian. The provided kayaks were also a bonus. We cooked most of our meals at the house and didn't find that we were missing anything essential in the kitchen. There was also a separate wet bar area in the living room with a sink and mini-fridge which made for a nice place to make coffee and keep drinks cold. Overall, we will likely plan to come back for another stay in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Phil & Sonya, your place was as we had been informed it would be. Big beautiful house, excellent lake access. House well stocked with everything you needed to stay. Also well stocked with things to do outside. Privacy and feeling safe to stay there was excellent. Clean linens and very comfortable beds and pillows. Plenty of tv access and games. We even caught fish! Thanks again"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent a few days at the lake house for Christmas. The house was so lovely and quaint. We had everything we needed and more. The new pool table was great fun and the sunsets were so gorgeous over the lake. Phil and Sonya were extremely helpful when the heat wasn't working on Christmas eve. They made a special trip to come and check everything out for us and it turned out to be an easy fix. They even brought extra blankets and a space heater just in case. We loved our time there!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this house. It has everything you need and more! The lake views are mesmerizing!
Great place to disconnect and enjoy nature."

It had more than we could have asked for including kayaks, a canoe, a fishing boat, outdoor games, indoor games, the most beautiful sunsets, and all of the amenities necessary to make this place feel like home. Phil and Sonya are attentive and quick to reply. We appreciate the open communication and opening up their lovely home for others to enjoy. We will definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home and great hosts. We look forward to booking again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We usually come to Sebring for the races and stay at the hotel, however, this time we decided to stay at an Airbnb by one of these beautiful lakes. We were lucky enough to find this cozy home away from home.
Phil & Sonia were great hosts! Responded very quickly, and were very accommodating. Sonia was also great at communicating with us and checked we were OK during our stay. I mean we couldn’t ask for better!!! Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful, the house was also clean. Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily! We would definitely book again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great house, it has truly been our home away from home for a week!
There are so many things to do, both inside and outside of the house, you almost feel it’s wrong to leave it and be elsewhere. The swing on the dock is pure delight for your soul.
Would definitely recommend and gladly stay again given the opportunity.
Thanks Sonya and Phil, we have really appreciated how attentive and accommodating hosts you have been!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and spacious with an amazing lake view. Phil was an amazing host!!! Two thumbs up
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at this lake house was such a wonderful experience! Loved the location and fenced area, which was great for our pup to run around and play. The guys took out the Jon boat and kayaks to fish every morning and came back with a few great ones! The hammock and swinging benches were nice and relaxing. Beds were confortable, place was clean, full kitchen to cook was great. We had a really nice time at the lake house. Nothing bad to say. Can’t wait to come back in the future!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place on the lake with covered dock, sunset view, lots of lake toys, a little sand beach area and a fenced in yard for your pooches. House was older but well taken care of and clean. I have no complaints and would definitely recommend."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved loved the Lake House trust me you will not want to leave, getting up going fishing off the dock and closing the day with beautiful sunsets. The best part was our pup got to come we hardly left the property ..so relaxing and great communication with the owners. Only one suggestion is bring your Firestick for the TV so glad we did we were able to watch Netflix ect. Home was clean and had everything you needed there and beyond. 100 stars!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent property to relax and have a great family time outside from the city.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This lake house is very comfortable and has great amenities such as floats, yard games, a hammock under the trees. The lake is beautiful and there are several canoes, kayaks and a little John boat. The dock is large, private and covered which makes it the perfect place to catch that lake breeze on the dock swing. The front and back yard are fully fenced (my German Shepherd could jump the fence so if you have an escape artist…). There were no close neighbor dogs when we were there if you have a reactive pup. The kitchen is fully furnished with kitchenware, even a crockpot and air fryer. The outside grill is small so if you want to grill meat and sides for a family of four, you may need to cook in batches. The beds are super comfortable, the furniture in the den cozy. There is traffic noise from the road which is my only complaint but it’s not heard in the house. Our family spent a whole week there and rarely had to leave. It was our home away from home and we really enjoyed staying there."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"house is great, plenty of room, love the lake and close to everything"

Phil and Sonja had the house clean and well stocked with everything (even a cast iron skillet)! Safe and quiet neighborhood. Will definitely try to stay here again next time we plan to be in the area!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a very relaxing stay! The lake is so peaceful and the sunsets are incredible.We kayaked, canoed, and even took the Jon Boat out. Nice touch having the trolling motor to get around. Built a fire in the outside pit, played pool after dark and enjoyed having the little bar area with a separate mini fridge. The beds are comfortable and we slept great! Checkin was seamless and communication was good. Would recommend for a peaceful getaway."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at the lake house, the property was great, did some fishing, kayaking, and even had an otter visit us on the dock to eat his fish. The house was cozy and well stocked and just what we needed. We hope to return!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at this property. Phil and Sonya made it incredibly easy and had the house ready with everything we may need.

It felt like being up north not pretentious and locals very friendly. The weather was great and fishing was amazing. We enjoyed the house and game room in the great room.

We will definitely go back another time."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lovely lake house is more than what I expected. I was hesitant to book it as I thought lake Letta is not big enough😀 . But it turned out that Lake Letta is the best as the water is so clean and the whole lake is so tranquil (it is big) the whole time. The lake house stands out with the beautiful dock and my family enjoyed a lot with fishing and sunsets sightseeing on it. The lake house has more than enough amenities to give us what we need during the stay. The house was built many years ago but has been maintained very well and spotless. Highlights: My puppy got so excited running in the huge fenced front yard; fishing and got big size bass and crappie, and cook fish over fire pit; amazing sunset and sunrise; placid lake with lots of privacy; quick and easy communication! Thanks a lot for sharing your beautiful lake house!"

The home is spacious, has everything you need. The sunsets are remarkably beautiful. There is an electric boat and kayak provided. The owners are very friendly, they answered all our questions, told us about all the local sights, and treated us with local delicious oranges. We recommend this house for a great remote vacation."
2018-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This house feels like a true cottage, warm, cozy and a great lake view. However, it's on a busy road and we found the surrounding area quite depressed and uninspiring. If you would have 6 people in your party, be aware there's only one really outdated bathroom in the house."

The house has everything you need to cook, a great collection of books to read, dvds to watch on tv and a pool table/ping pong table. The beds were comfy. There is a highway out front, but we did not notice any real noise inside. Phil and Sonya were always just a phone call away. The fenced yard was great for our little dogs to experience real freedom, they loved it. A real peaceful place to getaway."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a lovely month in Florida. We love everything about Highlands County and found your lake house perfect. We are grateful for your permission to bring our dog.

2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful and much bigger than it appears! Sonya and Phil even left us breakfast in the refrigerator. Cleanliness is my number one thing when using Airbnb and we were very pleased!! All the beds were queen size, which is definitely a plus. The location was perfect for us in that we love being on the water and was very close to the people we came to see. It has the older style and decor that is very common for the area. We booked at a very short notice and they were very accommodating. We will be back! Thank you so much"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had such a good time at this lake house - we will be back!
2017-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sonya and Phil are excellent hosts and very responsive. Their house is big and gives you a feeling of being at your Grandparents house when you were a kid. They were kind enough to leave a few food items and orange juice which was very thoughtful. The accomidations and amneties are all there. The sunsets are simply amazing, almost every night I was there. You're within a 15 minute drive to grocery stores etc. If you're looking for a restaurant goto Market 27, Taqueria Merlot, Chicanes or James Brown BBQ is good. I would stay here again and Thanks!"
2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 3rd time staying at Sonya and Phil's lake house and each time we never wanted to leave. The house is so relaxing. Coffee in the morning looking out at the lake and our hectic life takes a back seat. We look forward to staying again and again. Thank you for sharing your home. I think I'll bring my kayak next time!
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful weekend at the lake we had! House was bigger then expected and the view was spectacular! Nothing beats sitting in a tube floating on the lake with not a worry in the world. Looking at going back our next chance!

2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful home, super clean, very comfortable, well-equipped and ideal for our wanderings in Highland County. Our hosts made sure to include everything we needed in the kitchen, a nice gas grill on the patio, super comfy family room furniture to watch TV, nice linens on the beds.
What a delightful location right on the lake for beautiful sunsets and watching the ducks, water bird.
Even though the house is located on a busy road, the traffic dies down at night."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice lake house. Key hand off and return could not have been easier.

Well appointed home, comfortable couches and chars. Satellite TV with nice channel selection, but no internet service. Beds comfortable, nice sheets and towels.

Looking forward to coming back next year."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and I am glad we chose Phil for our first host. The house was more than we expected (bigger!) and provided everything we needed and more. We have rented private homes from other organizations, and this is the first time the host thought to leave breakfast items for us, which we took advantage of, and greatly appreciated.

This was also our first trip to Florida. We hope to return as we have friends less than 2 miles from this house. We will definitely try to rent it for our next visit and we hope it will be available!

Thank you Phil!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house was terrific. The Host was great to work with, made sure our needs were met and not overbearing with checking on us. We had a great time. The house on the lake was so comfy and relaxing. The sunsets were fantastic. We hope to come back"
2015-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Hi Phil and Sonya, The Letta Lakehouse was a great getaway, we loved the sunsets over the lake and the privacy of a lakeside home. The oranges you brought by made a great treat too. We hope to visit again when come back to Florida, hopefully in January 2017. Sincerely, Marty and Carol."
2015-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The lakehouse was great, just what we needed. I rented the place on behalf of my in-laws so they could also attend a big family reunion in the area. Place was clean, well-kept and in a gorgeous location. Amazing views from the main living room! Good communication, easy check-in/departure with minimal fuss. Very happy."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time and enjoy the lake house. It's an amazing view when the sun sets and it's very quiet. 5 out of 5 and would definitely visit again.
2015-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely stay we had at the Lake House! We enjoyed a relaxing weekend and really enjoyed every aspect of the house...despite the rain.

Phil and Sonya are thoughtful hosts who really made the stay that much more enjoyable.
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is home- lovely and serene. It has everything I needed to help take car of my sister. Cooking was great because they have every kitchen utensil needed.

2015-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A truly serene home! So spacious and rustic with every amenity! We cooked and rested - enjoyed the stunning sunsets and each other's company. The BEDS WERE FABULOUS!!! And we really appreciated having a washer and dryer. Everything was so easy!
Especially gracious of Phil to leave breakfast goodies in the fridge for us! I was so grateful for that!!! MOST EXCELLENT property and Host!"
2015-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sonya and Phil always connect before our trip and make sure we have what we need for a fun weekend. The listing address could be more accurate (just says: 2080
Avon Park, FL 33825 United States). The neighborhood is quiet, although being that it was Memorial Day Weekend there were a lot of fishing boats, jet skis, air boats and swimmers on the water so there was plenty of entertainment to watch from the patio. :)"
2015-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at the lake letta lakehouse. We had a really good time and our kids loved it. Phil was great to work with. No complaints. Would definitely stay again.
2015-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Phil and Sonja were great host. Anything we needed they were right on top of it. Great place to stay and just sit back and relax. Would recommend this house to all.
2015-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, the Lakehouse was everything we expected... a retreat for our family's rejuvenation. It is clean and relaxing and hosts, Phil and Sonja have always been very accomodating.
The view is spectacular and the sunsets are breathtaking.
This is our 3rd trip to the lakehouse, and, God willing, we will return again and again.
Thank you for your hospitality, Phil and Sonja!
Simcerely,

The host is living 20 minutes away, you can get help easily. Highly recommended.

Florence and Raymond"
2014-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay at the Lake Letta house and it was as wonderful as the first time. Everything you need is at hand and the house is spacious. The sunsets are spectacular! We met the owners, Phil and Sonya and found them delightful. We highly recommend the Lake Letta house!"
2014-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience with host, Phil Rasmussen was very accommodating in every way with anything we needed.

The Lakehouse was clean and had a dehumidifier so there were absolutely no issues with air quality or odors. For those with allergies, like me, that is always a concern; but the place was free of any odors or mold or musty smells. Was just perfect.

My husband was recuperating from kidney stone surgery and so it was a great place to just relax with no stress. I was able to cook for us and watch TV and just chill which is what we both needed. And stores in town were not far and easy to get to.

The sunsets at the dock were breathtaking and so I took many amazing g photos. I had my 84 yr old mother with me and she thoroughly enjoyed herself and claimed the recliner in front of the TV as ""her spot.""

We have two dogs and even though we kept them on leash when outside, the fenced in yard was reassuring. A great place for families and also a very cool Tree House for kids to enjoy.

The wildlife was plentiful including a hawk on the fence the first morning watching the squirrels play. Thought he might have one for breakfast but he was just enjoying watching them run around the yard...they were great entertainment.

There were also blue herons and red crested sand hill cranes and fish jumping in Lake Letta.

I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.

Thank you for your hospitality, Rasmussen's. We'll DEFINITELY be back!!!!!

Sincerely,

Tom & Rachael Streifel

2014-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Lake Letta house. We felt right at home the moment we arrived. Very quiet and relaxing. Everything we needed was there. It reminded me of going to my grandparent's house. The dock and the lake were wonderful and we spent every evening out there until bedtime.

We just got home yesterday and I've already requested another week in July. Can't wait!"
2014-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful time in this Lakehouse. We enjoyed time out on the dock and out in the lake on the canoe. It was relaxing, and so much more than we expected. (more beautiful than the pictures we saw)
Though we didn't get to meet the host, Sonya was really helpful. We had all we needed to enjoy our stay there.
We hope to return again someday :)"
2014-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great property and views! Used for a booking for two consultants for my company and they had a great time. Was central to the speedway and still a quiet place to come home to. Phil was extremely easy to work with!
2014-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place to stay and relax on vacation. Phil and Sonya had everything that you would need for a relaxing time. Very nice people to rent from and took care of everything. Beautiful house and lake.
Would stay again at this place."
2014-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was exactly what we needed. The lake view and sunset was incredible. It was so quiet there. We left fully relaxed. We travel to the Sebring area several times a year and hope that we will be able to stay at the lake house again and again. Thank you for sharing your house Sonya and Phil.
2014-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at the Lake Letta Lakehouse. Just what we needed to get away and relax. Sebring and Avon Park are nearby for your conveniences. The house was very large and comfortable. More than enough for two, but easily accommodating four or six. The lake is beautiful and the dock offers a wonderful view. Phil and Sonya were excellent hosts. We spoke to them on arrival via phone. They were very hospitable. At one point during our trip we had a small issue, but they were very quick to resolve it. Overall the experience was very pleasant and we would definitely go back. Highly recommended."
2013-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lake Letta Lakehouse was a perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I, and the house itself was very comfortable. What was meant to be a relaxing weekend spent by the lake ended up as so much more. As Avon Park and Sebring are both very close to the house, and both were offering festivities during the weekend we were there. The sunsets from the dock are amazing and the view from the house is also great. Phil was a great host, with simple instructions for check in and check out as well as instructions for things around the house. I would highly recommend the Lakehouse for a great vacation or getaway. Oh, and by the way, the girlfriend I mentioned earlier became my fiance on the swing in the dock."

We enjoyed our stay there.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wendy's place was AWESOME! Everything was perfect... The house was extremely clean and that's important when traveling with a little one who wants to get into everything... I felt right at home. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. the cameras outside made me feel even more safe. The house was decorated beautifully. Everything was new and fresh.. and omg.. that kitchen with the view... there isn't one negativething to say... we have stayed at about 100 airbnbs... but this one... Wendy is doing it right... the pool was clean.. so much space both indoor and outdoor... tvs in every room... comfortable beds...new appliances... everything updated... new pots and pans...restaurants close... grocery about 10 mins away... I would stay at Wendy's place again without hesitation...
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wendy’s place is truly a home away from home. The house itself is breathtaking. I pray this airbnb stays booked and busy !!!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful time capsule of a place! Full kitchen, bath, and laundry. It even has a piano! Full dining room and eat in kitchen so you don’t have to eat out every meal. Only issue was the WiFi which seems to skip out a bit. Or it could've been our teenager. We especially enjoyed coffee on the screened in porch in the mornings. Stay here!! You will be happy you did!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely phenomenal. The location was easy to find, & the perfect distance from my nieces graduation and Sebring shopping/dining.
There was house warming charm as soon as we walked in. My dad noticed the record player aknits instantly & put on some tunes! -Haven’t seen him smile like that in a while! The flexible check in was my first point of pleasure, the cleanliness and “right at home” feel was by far my favorite. Plenty of yard space and more than enough room inside for family gatherings. Made me want to bring my whole family back when we come to visit my sister! 🥰 The bathrooms were clean and stocked with anything if we forgot something (but I don’t pack light. 😉)
-Our host Micheal was always responding almost instantly with anything I asked. He was very friendly, and very flexible with us, and that I am extremely thankful for! The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood and is so beautiful at night! The price was unbelievable!
100/10
I DO RECOMMEND!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb stay, experience. Michael was more than friendly and helpful with me and my guests, everything was perfectly beautiful. We are even thinking about booking with him again next year for Sebring 12 of hour race. There were even Klondike bars for us in the freezer and delicious coffee. The house smelled beautiful. It was perfect and quaint. The beds were comfortable, not too soft not too hard. Thank you!"

Home was very clean, including bathrooms. However, 1st time making coffee found old, used coffee grounds in basket. TV would not turn on using remote. After a little frustration trying to figure out why, discovered the TV system was left unplugged from wall outlet. Water had an odd odor and horrible taste. Had to purchase bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth. Suspect this is public water system issue."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kendall is an extremely friendly and very helpful host. Since we did not have internet access, we (!) had slight trouble finding the apartment in the dark. But one phone call was enough and Kendall was with us 2 minutes later and escorted us to his apartment. And this one is just so beautiful, cozy and inviting, you feel right at home from the first moment. In retrospect, we were really sorry that we only stayed for one night (we had a meeting in Largo). We would have loved to stay for a few more days. Next time we are in the area we will rent this apartment again immediately without having to think about it and can highly recommend this accommodation and Kendall to everyone else."

My wife and I felt that our kids were safe and that Kendall's home was well sanitized. The linens were very nice and bright white and the beds were very nice and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer during our stay was amazing! The house had more than enough space and furniture to accommodate a family of four, but could just as easily have accommodated a family twice our size. Kendall was very easy to work with and was very responsive. It is nice to see a host that takes care of their property and goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed.

The home had a lot of natural lighting from the windows and high ceilings with an open airy floor plan. Only personal issue I had was the house smelling like FeBreze when we first entered. I do not do well with perfume smells. But once I opened the windows it was all aired out in no time. Most probably would not even been bothered with this, but it was my only complaint. I still give the place 5 stars."

From the moment you walk in you’re greeted with an open floor plan, that matches exactly the pictures on the listing. 2 living rooms gave my family plenty of space to stretch out and relax. The kitchen was fully stocked, and when I mean fully I mean everything you could possibly need to prepare a meal, from dishes, to cups, utensils, to coffee and creamer, and seasonings, pots and pans, a cutting board, peeler, blender, toaster, microwave, you name it, this kitchen has. The beds were super comfortable. Lots of towels that smelled freshly washed. The home has a washer and dryer which came in handy for us after a long day on the lake.

The coffee cake Kendall made us was probably the most delicious I've ever had- I'm absolutely sure its because she poured her heart into it. I hope to make this our escape! Thank you for hosting us. ❤️"

Mildly humid during the storms but the dehumidifier came in handy! The espresso bar was yummy and a nice little perk as well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the area. Kendall and Rhonda's Cinnamon coffee cake was exceptional. The quaint downtown area is nice to walk and for antiquing. The shop owners were so friendly it was amazing. Every 4th weekend the downtown area has extra sidewalk vendors. We will definitely visit again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute cozy getaway! The place was adorable. Super friendly host :)
Will definitely be back when over in that area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Grovehouse was far superior to accommodations we have used in the area in the past. Kendall and Rhonda anticipated our needs and made us feel so welcome and secure. Their lovely space is sparkling clean and inviting. You will love it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place, definitely a gem in the Arcadia area. Quick communication with the host. Very clean and relaxing. Will definitely try to stay again next time I’m in town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kendall and Rhonda are friendly, accommodating, and responsive hosts. The location is peaceful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,VERY NICE STAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY FAMILY ENJOYED IT
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! These folks went above and beyond to take care of us.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at the Grove House. Kendall and his wife were excellent hosts and the home was perfect! My husband and I traveled with our 2 teenage boys and they absolutely loved their room upstairs. The espresso machine was a hit and the unique decor was a fun touch!
The bed in he master bedroom was so comfortable and we really enjoyed the large kitchen.
Outside we enjoyed bumping the volleyball with each other and wandering through the orange grove.
Oh, and the coffee cake was delish! If we are in the area we will definitely stay again. We had such a fun and relaxing time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were very responsive and helpful at all times. We arrived late night so it was dark to get to but they left the outside and some inside lights on for us. Getting into the house was very easy, the parking spot is super close to the entrance. Once we made it inside, there was a nice handwritten note along with freshly baked coffee cake on the table for us. That was the cherry on top, what a sweet gesture! The house was very clean, they literally had everything we needed, they were very accommodating as well. In the morning we went out to walk around and see the area, a golden retriever came to us (from a neighbors house, I assume) and was so friendly! It was a great surprise.
Overall, the place was great, comfortable, peaceful and everything we needed for our stay. We definitely wish we could’ve stayed another night. Amazing hosts, thank you for being great and loving what you do!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Grovehouse! What a perfect spot in Arcadia. When we arrived, we were greeted with a warm cinnamon coffee cake on the kitchen table. It was delicious! The 2-story apartment/house gave us plenty of room to spread out. The upstairs area was perfect for our 2 teenage boys with twin beds, 2 sofas and a foosball table. (The stairs are steep and probably not suitable for small children.) Downstairs we enjoyed a very comfortable queen bed, beautiful kitchen, full size washer and dryer, and clean bathroom. It was very quiet and peaceful the entire time we were there. We enjoyed dinner at the outside table. Each morning a group of beautiful peahens would come through the property foraging for insects. We really had a great time and would stay here again next time we are in Arcadia!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay in a beautiful, quiet place. We came out here for fossil hunting and the Grove house was a perfect place to lay our heads down after two full days of digging in the river! We will definitely be back to play more fooseball! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time visiting Central Florida. Now I know where all of the Oranges and Beef comes from. There are miles of farm land in this area. The location in Arcadia is a little remote but did work for my visit with just a 40min drive to my weekend destination. The apartment was very clean and modern. Exactly as described and just like to photos. There is no TV...which at first I was not sure about but didn't effect my stay as I was able to catch up on much needed sleep in the peace and quiet of the surroundings and the super comfy queen size bed. There were way more amenities in the apartment than I needed for my short stay but I really appreciated the coffee bar and the nice home baked cinnamon coffee cake waiting for me when I checked in. Thanks Kendall, if I get back to this area again I will certainty try and stay at the Grove again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great little spot in an orange grove in DeSoto county. We came to the area for a few days of work. And the place was perfect for the 2 of us. Kendall was so nice. The place was quiet. Well furnished and clean. The kitchen area is a little tight for relaxing, but the upstairs loft bedroom area was great for chilling out. We enjoyed our time sitting on the patio outside and listening to the sounds of nature. Thanks Kendall!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thiis is a gem of a find! Kendall's place is such a cool spot. It was perfect for my family fossil hunting trip. Kendall was super responsive, very friendly, and overall such a great host! They even left us a homemade treat for when we arrived and it was delicious! the location is great. I can't say enough good things about this awesome place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the nicest Airbnb we’ve stayed in. Was super clean- looked brand new. Beds were comfy and the coffee bar was a hit. We had a blast searching for fossils in the Peace River and driving to the gulf for sea shells. Thanks again for the awesome home away from home!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful country setting with beautiful orange grove nearby! So clean, so nice!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We did not want to leave we felt so comfortable and at home. Everything we needed was already there waiting for us. Peaceful and quiet. Such a beautiful interior, clean. Who needs a TV when they supplied so many fun things for us to do as a family! We will be back :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, peaceful stay"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much for the warm hospitality

I will definitely return
My friends/roommates loved it too
Thank you again Kendall"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a peaceful vacation. Waking to the clean air and watching the guinea hens in the morning was a treat. Everything is clean and freshly decorated. We will definitely come back !!!
Our host Kendall was very accommodating and even had a warm coffee cake waiting for us. It’s these little touches that separate the good places from the awesome places.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location and home were beautiful. The place was clean, and Kendall was helpful and responded promptly. I would recommend families to check this place out. Very cool upstairs area with games and unique lighting/fixtures. Very fun!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kendall was a fantastic host. I only stayed for one night, but everything was perfect. There wasn't an item out of place and there was no shortage of comfort while I stayed there."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place. Different than your traditional Airbnb with an open floor plan and unique decor. We enjoyed our stay.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a relaxing and positive experience at the Grovehouse! We would definitely return when back in the area! Thank you for the delicious coffee cake and peaceful time away!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find, very peaceful and immaculately kept. The only couple of things worth mentioning is the beds were a little hard and the WiFi wasn’t great but they resolved that immediately. I think adding a TV would be helpful for sure. We would’ve loved to relax and watch a movie. It was super convenient having a washer and dryer, everything was clean and the upstairs was fun with the games. The steps are a little shallow so be careful on those middle of the night bathroom runs but overall the place was great. We left a small BBQ for the next family to enjoy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We were working in the area and it was so convenient and comfortable for our time there. They were flexible with our check in and check out and even made cinnamon coffee cake!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a great place nice and spacey clean. The only thing that did not work was the Wi-Fi password did not work so he just didn’t have Internet and my phone would not work in the house. I think they were trying to get that fixed
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place nice people! Thank you again.

Hope to return pretty soon to stay longer! I promise you’ll enjoy your stay!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to relax and truly feel peace! Everything was great! there was a cinnamon roll cake that paired amazing with the wide selection of coffees! Had a charcoal grill that worked out perfectly for last night. Highly recommend and will stay again any chance it's available!
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice place to cook and nap. (Other than the stove runs low in temp.)
I do wish I had brought a chair and umbrella in order to sit outside. There’s no where to really be outside other than in the ant infested yard. (No porch) Don’t forget to pack books and board games. I understood there was no tv before check in but there really isn’t anything for entertainment, so bring your own.
I would describe this place as a not-so-quiet country get away.
I would prefer being out that far in the country to be alone and not be sharing the building/ yard with other people. Or the feeling of being surrounded by people which this place very much has."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location. Quaint fun and absolutely stunning. The hosts are super attentive and so friendly. You gotta try the bread. It’s to die for.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect country get away for a time of rest and relaxation! Very clean and homey atmosphere!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can I leave more stars? This was a fabulous gem. While it did not have a tv, the foosball table provided entertainment instead. Kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easily one of the best places we’ve stayed at, if anyone is looking for a quiet place to stay this is what you’re looking for. The owners are very welcoming and helpful, the place was clean and stocked with almost anything you could need. Our night spent here was amazing and we can’t wait to come back!!! (quick note, the cake is to die for, I had to bring some home for the fam!!!)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful hosts! Special touches... very relaxing! Great home concept!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place! Great hosts! That coffee cake is no joke! My wife thought it was really cute and as she puts it ""Pinterest Worthy"". Came with friends and we ate that coffee cake in one go! If they shipped out that cake I'd order it. ☕🍰"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place. The pictures do not do it justice. You’ll have to see it in person. They’ve done such a great job Turning this space into a home away from home. It’s very cozy and they have everything you need to be comfortable. And the coffee cake was amazing. Don’t overthink this place just book it you won’t be disappointed.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is excellent and brand new property. The owner is very friendly and communicative guy oriented to do everything for you. You will find water, fruits, oil, cheese, selection of sauces in the refrigerator and signature cinnamon pie on the table so if you arrived without visiting a store you will survive. The first floor is traditional with top quality of everything: from refrigerator-washer/dryer to lines and mattress. On the second floor you will find a sort of sophisticated country style design. Have you ever seen chandelier made from old spring mattress? :-) You will also find kids corner on the second floor and table football to play. The location is 1 h drive from beaches of crowded Sarasota and not very far from Orlando and other destinations in Central Florida. Perfect peaceful retreat both for businessman and family tired from big city."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We put together a guys trip to do some kayaking on the Peace River and just get away for a few days. Fred’s place was perfect for what we were looking for. Enormous property with full access down to the river. Cows, horses, wildlife and just a huge open space in rural Florida. Not fancy but certainly comfortable. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely return."

The house was surrounded by open pastures filled with wild life.
The property is equipped with a large work shop, this made a great place to cookout and socialize if wanted.
would stay again if in that area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found this on last minute ,needed a place that was close to work and from after long day standing on rocks,place was quiet and comfy.."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Get glamping set up! It is everything it is advertised to be. The hot water time frame was something you definitely have to plan for and the shower is tiny, but it’s an rv. Was surprised by the location being in a backyard of the host, but again it’s simple accommodations. It was great for a couple and a/c was great and the bed was comfortable. Over had a great stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marleny was a lovely host! She was very communicative and helpful with all of our needs. Would stay again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly as described Marleny very responsive to questions and very prompt to reply. Keep in mind this is a RV so if you don’t like travel trailer camping or RV living, this may not be the place for you but for me and my needs it was perfect. Very quiet peaceful country neighborhood very close to shopping Thank you."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Worked great for our visit
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host! We were only in town for two busy but quick days and having a local place was great. Everything was as described. Enough room for our family to grab a shower at the end of the day and sleep! We didn’t use the kitchen as Giovanni’s is our fave place for dinner when we are in town but it was stocked with supplies if needed. Quiet street and no issues.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice get away
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our family during the Thanksgiving holiday. Thanks for being a great host! We will return.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ana is always great! The house feels bigger than it looks from the outside. It's obviously had some nice renovations done in the recent past. Kitchen and living room are big. The bathroom looks like the only place that could still be renovated - it's more than adequate as is though. In all, great, quiet place to stay and Ana is very friendly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Everything about the stay was great. Relaxing and quiet location! Ana was very nice and communicative

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our first stay in Wachula, overall we were
Very comfortable with the home . Had all the accommodations we needed.
Definitely will consider staying there again."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice weekend get away.

location for our work in Hardee County. Ana was responsive and nice!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and very roomy!
Had no problems at all. Ana is a great host!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ana's place is a real gem! It's in a safe and quiet neighborhood, at the end of the street. the location is beautiful. The place was a perfect home base for our fossil hunting trip. Ana even had extra amenities like extra toothbrushes and other toiletries. She was super responsive, very easy to work with, flexible, and all around an excellent host. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Convenient
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, roomy place. quiet area, would stay again."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ana was very friendly and responsive to our needs. I do think there could be a few improvements. I would suggest a dresser in each bedroom. There wasn't anyplace to put your suitcase down. Although there were hangers in the closets, we like to take a few things out of our suitcases. ie. personal products, blow dryer, make up, hairbrush etc. There was just no place to set these item down. (We like to unpack). We were visiting friends in the area so were planning to have them for dinner and there were shortcomings in the kitchen which Ana and I resolved. I went to the store and she reimbursed me immediately. The step down to the dining room I would say could be a problem. All of us tripped at least once. I wish I had some yellow duct tape to mark the step. The bathroom is old and in need of a good scrubbing or renovation. I feel like she is just starting out and is trying really hard to make it nice. We wish her all the best."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host highly recommended
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place so we were happy about that. Playing Streamsong so this was 20 min!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ana was very kind and always responded super fast to any questions. It was also extra helpful to have a washer/dryer. Thank you!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ana was very kind. Would definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived at the home after dark and were feeling a little uneasy about the location. It was the last house on a street of some cluttered and junky homes. Not being from the area, we just weren’t sure about the safety of the area. And with it being dark, it was hard to get a good feel. However, after staying for a few days we felt that it was a safe area and the neighbors were friendly and kind! The house looked just as the pictures. It was simple and roomy - perfect for our family of 4. The home has basic essentials but nothing extra. And that was just fine for what we needed. It was clean, orderly, and open. The beds were comfortable, and it was nice to have access to Netflix for our kids to watch some shows. The host was responsive to a couple of our questions and very friendly. Check out instructions were simple and to the point. Overall, we are glad we stayed at Ana’s home and are thankful that we had it as an option while in Wauchula!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ana's place was a great place to stay while our group was in the area! Ana was very responsive and easy to communicate with! The house was in a quiet neighborhood with minimal traffic which made our stay peaceful. The house was as expected, and we would definitely stay there again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay and very comfortable.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ana was super responsive from the beginning, accommodating & went out of her way to follow-up with me before my stay, during which was a holiday & after. The large & well equipped kitchen was just what I needed to finish my Thanksgiving cooking! A mini getaway to see my family plus bring my dog while giving us our own home to relax was FABULOUS! We’ll be back for sure."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and organized place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ana,

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My disaster team was in Florida working after hurricane Ian and needed a place quickly. Ana got back to me within 5 minutes & in 10, we had our rental. Don't let the outside fool you, the home is very roomy and Ana was a wonderful hostess. She checked in on my team to be sure they got in OK and to see if we needed anything. She also provided an air mattress as we had 4 team members deployed during the time we rented Ana's home.
We would definitely reach out to Ana in the future to rent this quaint home if ever deployed in the area again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"comfortable 3 bedroom with lots of room, saved 350 per night playing golf at Streamsong. 20 minute drive to the resort."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice house! We were really glad to find it so close to Bone Valley Fossil Farm where we went to find sharks teeth and other fossils!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I rented this for a friend of mine coming into town and my friend said it was wonderful! Ana had excellent communication from the moment i booked it! I highly recommend renting from her
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"10/10 for being the first in Wauchula. that's the hometown we visit and with bringing extra guests it accommodated well for all. Very spacious , so much room inside. it looked lovely inside we really enjoyed it there. the neighborhood is fairly quiet. the owner responded very well and in timely manner with any questions we had. def would try again if we have extra guests again. thank you soo much."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at the beautiful Cracker Hammock Cabin this past weekend. It was an amazing experience overall, very peaceful, lots of amenities and perfect for a nice getaway, we would both highly recommend it! We definitely plan on coming back again!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Cracker Hammock Cube was a beautiful place to stay in a beautiful area
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"WOW where can I begin! This cabin is absolutely amazing , we were able to disconnect from the big city, really experience nature and had a great family time. This cabin has great board games for the kids and family. There was an amazing fire pit and we’re able to make smores with the family ! There is an amazing outdoor area where there is a barbecue place, pool table, ping pong table , dart game and lots of entertainment for the whole family. There was a big swing outside that was a hit for the kids. Extremely picture worthy for the gram! There’s a library section that’s outdoors and so nice specially for photographers ! The host was absolutely amazing and responsive. It was very easy to check into the cabin key lock was available. Overall I highly recommend this air bnb !"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Our second year hosting the Donnie Canary Foundation Shotgun Saturday and staying at Omar's Cracker Hammock. It has become our peaceful, happy place away from home. I recommend it for outdoors type people that like to be away from the crowd.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Omar and Betsy's place was awesome. As advertised. Beautiful secluded location. Well stocked kitchen and bathrooms. Very clean. Would stay here again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for large families with kids. So much open and secure space for kids to run around. The swing was a lot of fun.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This cabin was exactly what we were looking for. We had a softball event about 10 minutes away and our families stayed there and really enjoyed the property. I highly recommended this place !
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Would defiantly stay here again
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Came to Sebring with 6 guys to race in the PBOC winterfest. The house was perfect.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a real gem. We were a family of 12 and we fit comfortably. We live in South Florida but wanted something different than a beach house and also didn’t want to drive 10 hours to get to a cabin. The property has a lot of things to keep you occupied without getting bored. Plenty of games, the outdoor play area is super cool, the kitchen has all the necessary supplies, plenty of plates, silverware, mugs, cups even wine glasses 👍🏻. We were greeted with a nice basket of snacks and 2 bottles of wine, perfect to kick off our new year’s weekend. There are a lot of lakes very close to the property (we visited lake placid) and it was very cool. Supermarkets 10-15min away. Very private property. Overall….. family approved! Thank you Betsy!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We traveled to Seabring to participate in a race. The place was as described. It was great for our large group of adults, with plenty of space to spend time together in the loft and open space kitchen, living room, and dining room. We will consider staying here in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice cabin. We had a great time. I would recommend installing a couple of ceiling fans at the barn.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice property to relax and enjoy with the family, owners are great. I would only recommend to put a curtain in the master bathroom downstairs, everything else was great"
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,The place is nice and cozy with a lot of wildlife around. The only thing missing that would make this ideal is a swimming pool.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very cool and unique log cabin very near Sebring Raceway. Perfect for a large group. We had a group of 9 and all had room and good spaces to sleep and prepare for long days at the track. Everything worked, was clean and as described on the listing. Owners were great communicators and entry and exit were easy and quick. We plan to return to Sebring and hope this property is available for our future dates."
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,"The first night we had to fix the A/C. Thank goodness we had a certified AC tech there.
The septic tank was in need of service."
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"Unique property, good for a group that loves the outdoors!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at this cabin for a long weekend getaway with my in-laws and children and we all enjoyed it every much. So much space and outdoor areas for the kids to roam and explore. Quiet and peaceful. The outdoor areas was our favorite. The cabin is spacious and clean.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for a family or friends getaway. Plenty of amenities, things to do, and just plain relax. Would highly recommend for the Sebring area."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"We went to this cabin to escape Hurricane Ian and it proved to be a safe, and enjoyable place to stay. Unfortunately, we ended up in the storm's path, but only lost power for about a day. As a result, we weren't able to take advantage of the many great amenities on site and in the area. Omar was an excellent communicator, expressing concern as we rode out the storm. The cabin itself is roomy and very comfortable. There are lots of games, outdoor fire pit and fun outdoor kitchen and bar area. We hope to go back one day when we can fully enjoy this fun getaway!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,A great place for our family to stay for the races at Sebring. Everything was exactly as advertised.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home exceeded our expectations in person. For being a shared (but closed off) space, we were pleased with the privacy we had. The home was clean and just how Shaina had described it to be in her listing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I think the cleaning fee was a little high.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was exactly as described. Great location and easy to find. Instructions for checkin were clear and they had great recommendations for activities nearby.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Lovely place great host had a wonderful time would highly recommend
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was the perfect place for what we needed. We stayed here a week and it was convenient to have a washer and dryer. Make sure to follow the quiet time at 11:00pm though, we were only watching TV and didn’t think it was that loud but apparently the person in the house thought it was and banged on the wall a few times. Needless to say we weren’t able to watch tv after 11:00 the rest of the week. Other than that, it was a great stay! Clean, plenty of towels, toilet paper, bed linens. We would stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We slept well; we felt safe & comfortable. It’s a very cute place and many amenities like cooking supplies & personal items, too. It’s very clean and well-stocked.
Our little dog’s enjoyed it, too. Their temporary pen (while we were away at a wedding) fit perfectly in the kitchen area, and the bed was big enough & comfortable for all of us!
Overall, it was a delightful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay! Thanks again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is in a very good location, it is very accessible. It has everything you need to be calm and safe. The instructions are clear and simple. Very cozy and cute. Cleaning is good, you have cleaning and kitchen materials accessible for your stay."

The bed is very comfortable and big. Great shower too. Shaina was very quick to communicate with me. Location felt safe and private. Easy to find, park and access. Everything was as described, but even better!! All around great time! Would highly recommend this Airbnb!
Thank You!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were exactly as described. My stay was peaceful and very quiet. The kitchen is completely stocked with any type of cookware you may want to cook with during your stay. I did have a little trouble finding a comfortable setting for the shower. It seemed extremely hot or extremely cold. But, that may have been me not being used to my settings at home. Overall, everything was awesome. And I would highly recommend Shania and Kyle's place. I would definitely choose to stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaina's home was conveniently located to our family and all the places we wanted to visit. The space was very roomy, clean and comfortable. A great value for the price."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Just like it was described.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place to stay. The bed is SO comfortable. Really great to be able to bring our dog with us as we explored the lovely town of Wauchula and the surrounding area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was everything we needed! I messaged Shaina when we booked as we were attending a wedding and needed to check in early. She was very responsive and super accommodating. We were able to check in early and get to the wedding on time with no issues. Inside was very cozy and had everything we needed. If you are looking for a pet friendly accommodation with all the comforts of home, don’t hesitate to book here!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The location is conveniently located to restaurants, the place is simple, clean, and quiet."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious studio close to restaurants.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very lovely place, my husband and I felt right at home… Shaina the host always answered right away when we had a question about something… the place was very peaceful and beautiful… we would definitely recommend this place!!!! 👍👍🥰"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great overall experience. Everything was as advertised from the photos and descriptions.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super cute and cozy space within walking distance to downtown Wauchula which has a nice selection of restaurants and even an awesome coffee shop. Shaina was super friendly and communicated promptly when we had any questions. I loved that there was a full kitchen with plenty of supplies to make our own meals especially since we came to escape a hurricane! The best part was we could bring our fur babies with us! Definitely a great place to stay . Five stars for me !
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and clean.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I highly recommend this place. The size is perfect for two and offers a warm cozy feel! I was playing golf at Streamsong which was 30 minutes away. I love the courses and I’ll be returning next year and booking with Shaina again!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome! Clean and beautifully decorated. Felt right at home and easy to use amenities! We will certainly come again if I’m the area! Host was absolutely excellent and proactive in communication!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a little difficulty getting in but only because I couldn't get into my AirBnB account. Shaina sent me several emails and texts but it took a while for her to respond as she was out of town. She eventually let me in remotely and sent me a text with the door code.
The room was spotless and had everything I needed. My only issue was the softness of the bed. I have a bad back and prefer to sleep on a hard mattress. The King bed was a quality one... just too soft for my back. If you have a similar issue, a back board would probably resolve the issue.
Highly reccommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here.. Shaina and her husband are always great.. Not our first stay here and surely not out last.. Very clean home...
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a great place to stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Has everything you need for a comfy stay. Nice peaceful town. I will be looking for this place the next time in town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaina is always a great host. Have visited Craftsman on 8th several times and has always been a good experience.
Thank you for making our stay very special.
Micelle Berg"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Having seen the photos and description of this wonderful place, I added 30 miles to an already long bike ride. It was well worth it. The place was clean and well appointed. Clear instructions made for an easy check in. Being just two short blocks from Main Street, restaurants and cafes are close by. I had a fantastic stay. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage was very clean, cozy and comfortable. The porch is super cute and very peaceful.
The back road to use to get to the parking space was a little confusing since it doesn't really look like a road, but made sense once I found it.
Houses around cottage could use some TLC, but it was very quiet and the police station is pretty much next door.
Traveling alone I tend to have my guard up more, but I have to say that there was no point where I didn't feel secure at Shaina's place.
Now if only there were some restaurant's, pubs and shops on Main St., it would be awesome since you can easily walk there in a matter of minutes.
Will definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I definitely will be back!! Very clean and had everything needed.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent studio apartment with private access. The space was very clean and very well stocked.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and i enjoyed our stay! The place is spacious and very comfortable, and has everything as mentioned in the listing. The hosts are welcoming. We would recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Nice quiet neighborhood a walking distance from the city center, a park and a cute local pizza shop (Giovanni's)."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always enjoy Craftsman on 8th. Shaina and Kyle are friendly and very helpful and they reacted quickly to any questions or concerns that may occur.
This is the 4th visit with them and will definitely stay again.
It’s close to Main Street where there are antique stores, restaurants and on Friday night it’s family fun time on Main with games for adults and children.
Thanks again for a great stay.
Michelle"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Shainas place was peaceful and super clean which we really appreciate. Quickly responded to our questions upon arrival. Great value for the space. We didn’t use the kitchen but it looked like it would have been a good place to cook. Towels and all bathroom necessities were provided as well as some extras. I appreciated the trays of ice in the freezer very much (I’m an ice hog). We did not hear any roosters (for that I was grateful!😜!). Peaceful place to have coffee on the porch in the morning before heading out for the day.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it.. Pefect get away.. Home from home.. Host we phenomenal.. Highly recommended and we will be booking again...
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"For visiting relatives in a nearby RV park, Shaina’s place worked out very well. My husband and I were both able to work all week while my in-laws visited and we caught up with everyone at night. Shaina’s had plenty of room for 2 people. King bed, nice bathroom, full kitchen, and a screened porch with washer/dryer. It was very clean and comfortable. It was 10 min from the RV park. There is not much to do in the area so I wouldn’t just choose Wachula as my vacation spot. However, I’m sure we’ll visit the relatives next winter/spring and I will definitely hope to stay at Shaina’s again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value. Easy to get to. Amenities were good.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cozy place in good location. quiet and clean and comfortable
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here to attend a race great location Shaina very accommodating with check in & out place very clean and perfect for race weekend I definitely would recommend this place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Exactly as advertised. Thanks for an awesome quiet visit.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the little town and ability to walk to restaurants. Very laid back and relaxed area. We had plenty of space and the porch was nice for drinking our coffee. Definitely recommend it! We will be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything as described, comfortable, just what you need!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful place, and more spacious than it seems in the pictures."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice central location, exactly what we were looking for. Easy to check in, quite neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing and exactly as described. Shaina was quick to respond on arrival day and even left the light on for me as I was delayed getting there. While this place is attached to Shaina's house you would never know it. The bedroom / living room is good sized with a comfy bed and a reclining love seat along with a good sized TV. The room also has a window unit and a ceiling fan that keeps the room quite comfortable. The bathroom is good sized and stocked with everything you need and the water pressure in the full size shower is more than adequate along with the water temp. I didn't use the kitchen but everything is there that you could need along with a full size fridge. By far the coolest part was the screened in porch that had a washer and dryer, which I didn't use, but also had a table and chairs where I could sit and drink a cold adult beverage while answering emails after a long day. I can't say enough about this place as it was a great choice in a quaint small town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Craftsman on 8th in Wauchula, Fl. is a great, clean and very comfortable. My 94 year old father lives in Wauchula and we always love staying here. Shaina and Kyle are so friendly and helpful but also gives their guest the quietness during our stay. Friday night we walked to the cute downtown Main Street to enjoy the Friday Fun night. Games for kids and music through the streets.
You will not be disappointed in staying here. Very clean!
We will return soon as my dad will be 95 in April.
Michelle
Alachua, Fl."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was like being at home. Me and my boys had a great trip. Check out bone valley for sharks teeth. It’s 10 minutes from the house.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shaina & Kyle are exceptional hosts. They genuinely care about guest comfort. For example, I interrupted their dinner to state the tv remote was missing. After searching with no success, they drove to a store and purchased a new one that evening even though we insisted it wasn’t necessary! Their guest suite is located in a quiet neighborhood. Shaina has equipped it with many comforts you have in your home. The screened patio is a pleasant place for meals/coffee. The bed is very comfortable and we slept soundly. Thank you Shaina & Kyle for a relaxing stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good host, listing is how it’s listed"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place for our quick overnight trip to the area! The guest suite is attached to the house but you would never know. Nice & quiet area!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, responsive hosts! Shaina answered any and all texts immediately. Very convenient location and the house was perfect for my needs. I will definitely stay there again next time I need a place in Wauchula."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can’t even begin to express our gratitude to Shaina. We booked her Craftsman to flee from the worst hurricane this country has ever experienced. She and her husband welcomed us and our two dogs, gave us detailed check-in info (with pictures) and provided everything one could possibly need, including snacks, condiments and canned goods.
They promptly answered every single question.
Then the real test of a Superhost!
We learned that neighbors of ours from Port Charlotte were heading north with 5 birds, 3 dogs and a cat. Shaina agreed we could help them, but also sent us full shelter information for them. They ended up with a whole classroom and bath of their own at a local shelter. Meanwhile, from her mom’s house, Shaina recommended that we go shelter, too, because their historic bungalow is surrounded by tall trees. We took a chance and got through the night safely. Shaina even told us, the next morning, that we could stay, but we headed home."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed over a week,Convenient as it is close to the hospital. You have the common necessities available.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,great hospitality and clean. price was great too. I would recommend to anyone!

2022-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Clean, compact, cozy and comfortable for two. The neighborhood rooster and his random crowing was amusing at first but became annoying by the end of our stay. Shaina was an excellent communicator and was quick to respond to any inquiry. Overall, a good value and an excellent location in Wauchula."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, clean and safe location!
Washer and dryer, screened porch porch for morning coffee.
While traveling alone and needing to stay near Wauchula, this was great!
The host was super accommodating and gracious!
I’ll certainly be back for future visits."

Looking forward to our next stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place with all the amenities of a hotel and more. Bed was really comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious with a great shower. Felt like we were in a relatives house. Very clean and private. It was a little hard to find in the dark but managed to find the back door. could use a little more light out back but was perfect. Owner kept in touch with us the entire time will be back again next year.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we needed while in the Wauchula area — centrally located, super private and all the amenities we could ask for! This unit is clean and comfortable. Shaina made sure the unit had everything that we would need during our stay. After three days of fossil digging in the Peace River, having a washer and dryer available was a huge bonus. We would absolutely stay here next time we are in the area."

Shaina was a great host and she treats her guest almost as if they are family. Go ahead and book the room, you won’t regret it!"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Shaina, was so easy to accommodate us. We came to Wauchula to visit our 93 year old father and her place made us feel so relaxed during our stay. We will definitely recommend her and our next return to stay at Craftsman on 8th."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice quiet little town.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaina did a great job of accommodating me while I dwelled in her home. She was very courteous and willing to help in any way. This home is located in a safe area near a police station, restaurants, and a gym. I would stay here anytime."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Shaina is a wonderful hostess! Her attention to detail makes this such a great place to stay. It was clean and had ALL the amenities one could ask for. I had a wonderful stay and would definitely be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shaina's place was very clean and provided many comforts. The washer and dryer were wonderful, as was the kitchen. The bed, while not particularly comfortable, was exactly as it appeared in the description. She was very hands-off, yet helpful in her communications. If I were in the area again I'd stay here another time."
