Will definitely stay again once hunting season starts. üòä

It is right up next to their shop, which didn‚Äôt bother us a bit as we had no desire to sleep all day when there was so much beauty to see outside, but you can hear some work being done, saws, power tools, etc. during mid-day.

When we arrived the house was very easy to spot and definitely one of the better houses on the block. Easy parking, and enough room for a 22ft boat and two cars. It does have a outdoor extension cord for overnight charging. The interior it‚Äôs self was as expected and clean. Clean grill and nice sheets! Only complaint is it was very warm in the house and took a while for it to get cool. Also the smell of septic had gotten pretty loud at the end of the trip. Overall great stay! Will be back!"

Kirk and Heather go above and beyond to make sure you have a clean cozy space .
They have really thought of everything when it comes to things you need during your stay .
Soft comfy linens , towels , bedding , games , all of it was better than a 5 star hotel .
We stayed in this air bnb to fish Lake Murray and the day we arrived , Heather - one of the host met us and made sure we could plug our boat in .
My hubby was super stoked about having a place right by the house to keep our boat .

The only reason for not having 5 stars across the board is likely due to previous guests and not the host. One of the gaming TV's was not working properly and it appears that other guests had played with the wiring. They were responsive and tried to get it fixed. GIven the chance to go back, we absolutely would."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"When we walked in the door the first thing everyone said was ""Too bad we are only staying one night!""
The house WAY exceeded our expectations. It was in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. The house is new! We didn't have time to experiment in the kitchen or lounge on the couch watching the big screen or hang out in the super cool backyard. This was a GREAT place to stay!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Smelled clean and fresh when we walked in. The kitchen was wonderful to have especially because I'm handicapped. The bathtub in the master was also a blessing due to my muscle disorder. My only complaint is when checking he tried to charge me a pet fee and I didn't bring my dogs. It felt like he was trying to get More money from me. It was very uncomfortable. I had my pet sitter email my receipt to prove I didn't have my dogs in case he changed me.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Shecotah were amazing. We loved every part of the stay and the house. Gaming, cooking, sleeping, pure enjoyment. Our service dogs absolutely loved the enclosed fence. It smelled very clean upon walking in. We will be back to stay at Jason and Shecotah's place when we are back in Ardmore!"

2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"The Airbnb was like the pictures, it was pretty and it smelled great. There was several things around. The game room was cool, it would just be q good idea for there to be a futon or sofa bed in there just in case, but over all great and clean place"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stayed for 2 nights and had no complaints! Definitely recommend if needed!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thhis house was BEYOND amazing for the price we paid! The house was beautiful and clean. Very quiet and super friendly neighborhood. Lots to do for the kids, which helped a lot. The open kitchen was a major bonus when it came to having a family of five so we could still all sit/stand and eat together in a beautiful environment. The stores are so close, you could walk in any direction and find one (which helped with early morning vacation runs). If you are a book lover.. you will find yourself captivated at the book collections, as I took many pitctures for future references. But most of all FOR ALL YOU HARRY POTTER FANS!..... THIS IS YOUR HOGWARTS HOUSE! Oh and some amazing pizza places close by too!"

Great house and even greater host will definitely stay again and recommend them if you plan to stay in Ardmore..

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with our stay at Jason's house. it is in a nice subdivision, very friendly neighbors, relatively new subdivision. I think Jason made a extreme afford to accommodate for those who are a middle class. for money we paid we got exceptional service: beds are very comfortable, nice clean showers , smells fresh. one of the rooms are designed as a Harry Potter and my youngest son was in heaven from all play stations etc. Freah waters daily, so you do not have spend money to buy water. Lake about 10 min away, down town close. People in Oklahoma friendly and want to do it right for you.
one thing thought: if you want to cook , bring your own spices, oil, salt/pepper, sugar etc. there is plenty of elegant and nice utensils . Make sure , do not take anything accidentally, the host has expensive taste only because he wants everyone feel like a Royalty Thnak you"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Go grab a cup of coffee before you red our review of Jason's Airbnb space....
This is an incredible place ! Quiet. Clean. For the $ Value it is an exceptional space - meaning we have paid more and have received a lot less. If you are one of the lucky few to get a reservation your are very fortunate !
Jason's description of his place is spot on ! Actually - you will be amazed when you walk in the door - it's perfect 10 stars.
Jason was very receptive to our communication and his recommendations for dining were excellent. We stopped at the Cafe Alley and also had drinks at The Dew Drop Inn. Both places are very close [not walkable but close for driving] and they are just across the street from each other. They are not open everyday so - make sure you check that out before making plans to eat or drink there. The prices are very affordable and the portions are huge. Try the carrot cake - best we've ever had !
The space is at the end of a cul de sac and very quiet. No street noise at all."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super fun place to stay. Loved the great books in the house and all the happy potter collection. Has a variety of games to entertain anyone. Couches and beds are very comfortable. Defiantly coming back to this home when I return to Ardmore.

The shower was beautiful and the hosts thought of everything in case you forgot like shampoo, conditioner, styling tools, hair products. There were plenty of clean towels and everything was very well organized. Our first night there we killed a water roach inside, we didn‚Äôt tell the host, it was not a huge deal to us, it had just rained in OK so expected. Kinda funny seeing the kids jump around lol! The pool area was beautiful and well lit at night, speakers, floats and pool toys with lots of seating to lounge around outside the pool. Very relaxing. We even had some fresh peaches right off the peach tree in the yard, delish! Keep in mind it‚Äôs a kitchenette so no muc kitchen sink or stove inside the pool house but there is both outside in the bar area.

2022-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, but this accommodation is more geared for a summer stay. It rained, and it we had to carry our suitcases as there was no sidewalk on property only a yard to slog through. The heating system is sub par for Oklahoma winter. Door is beautiful, but it sticks on the guttering, and we we had to squeeze through. The door might need a little winterizing. The patio outside was neat, and the pool looked inviting, but it was not something we could access in the fall/winter."

Hosts also allowed us to check in early and leave a little bit later, and had some great recommendations for food and fun in Ardmore! Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The moment we walked in the club house it smelled SO good! The club house is in a beautiful spot, with wonderfully nice folks, & its decorated with comfortable furnishings. The swimming pool was so relaxing. We will definitely stay here again when we travel to Ardmore. Thank you so much for sharing your sweet home with others."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay and great location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Book with confidence! You will have everything you need to enjoy your next staycation or visit to Oklahoma. The bed is very comfortable, there is a fine selection of coffee, complimentary bottled water and the pool is wonderful. The hostess and host are lovely and my boys enjoyed themselves swimming while we relaxed. Definitely worth every penny. There is even Netflix! You will love it here ‚ù§"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"the hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating. we were allowed to check in earlier and check out a tad bit later than the check out time. their pool was very clean and the location was quiet. the hosts sends detailed instructions for parking to avoid any conflicts with neighbors, but it was super easy to understand. the only thing was the bathroom door knobs were very loose and we had to close it from the outside if one of us were inside. 10/10 would book again whenever I visit Oklahoma again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute pool house space in town. The studio is clearly a passion project of a creative craftsman. Our young boys loved the loft above the bathroom. We would stay again if passing through town or playing at Lake Murray.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, quiet location! Beautiful pool house that we adored. Everything was perfect. Friendly owners. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were fantastic! The place is beautiful and so cozy. If you‚Äôre needing a place to relax and get away, this is the place to book. Close to the lake and to main st. Very friendly and sweet to book with. Can‚Äôt wait to take some more time to get away and stay again soon."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to be if you are looking for easy access to a pool, laid back, relaxing and a 15 minute drive to a beautiful lake. The room was clean and communication to the host was as easy as it could be. They have the sweetest dogs and the host is some of the nicest people we have met."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! My kids loved the pool. Place is very clean and organized. It‚Äôs located in a great location in Ardmore.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing cozy getaway, your minutes away from anything you may want to do and soaking in the pool to finish your day off was the best thing! My weekend wasn‚Äôt long enough , I wanted to stay more with how much I was enjoying the peaceful, relaxing oasis."

2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute pool house cottage located beside the main residential home. Owners were super nice and communicative. We weren‚Äôt there at the home much during our short stay in Ardmore, but location seemed quiet. The only thing I would mention is that the pool house doors only lock from the inside by deadbolt, so you are secure when inside; however, we were not able to lock doors when we left (although we WERE able to padlock the gate leading to the pool house cottage)."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Pool house is awesome! I slept in the bed over the bathroom and it was very comfortable just a little scary coming down for a 58 year old. Owners are super friendly!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The host, Buddy, was very friendly and hospitable. He put extra effort into the little details and it was very much appreciated. He even provided a keurig and k cups, wine glasses and other essentials. The location was perfect for the baseball tournament we were visiting ardmore for and he allowed us access to the pool. Our stay was enjoyable and if we are in the area again, we will definitely stay here."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Check-in/Check-out was easy and we were allowed to check out late. The home is located in a historic neighborhood in the middle of town, with quick access to restaurants and the interstate. The pool is nice and there is plenty of seating around it and a fire pit. The inside is nicely furnished and comfortable. My son found the loft to be really fun. Soft drinks in the fridge were a nice touch. We will stay again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my boyfriend had an amazing stay , hosts were very kind and helpful when reaching out for any questions we had!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was absolutely great !! The hosts were very helpful and the place was really nice !! Definitely would recommend staying here!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect space for my daughter‚Äôs wedding preparations! We live out of town but the venue was in Ardmore and we needed a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù. Sheryl was very helpful when we needed to change the reservation date and check in time. Completely satisfied and very impressed with the accommodations!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was great!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,this place was simply amazing. everything we needed was already there. Definitely booking again
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,It was nice. It is in the middle of a shopping area which took me by surprise lol but it was a convenient location! Close to everything and the lake ‚ù§Ô∏è we had our birthday party here with a few girlfriends and had a great time. The house is very noise proof and I liked that. There was everything we needed! It was a nice night!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,You couldn‚Äôt ask for a better hostess and the price is impeccable for the number of guest that can stay
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a fantastic stay at the homes on holiday drive! Sheryl was incredibly informative and gracious, making communication a breeze. The house was spotless and incredibly well-stocked, truly making it feel like a home away from home. Every detail was thought of to ensure a comfortable and welcoming experience. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-notch stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Sheryl's property is home away from home.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. the home itself was very nice and convenient to sleep such a large group. However the theatre room is not set up properly, and quite didn't match the photos in the posting. There is no nearby storm shelter for emergencies. The hospital was available to secure shelter, but its across town. during our stay there was a huge tornado outbreak that definitely hindered our trip. ( not any fault of the owner)There was not any electricity in the whole town, which limited the amenities of the home and made it pretty difficult the morning of checkout to locate all of our belongings and clean up better after our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay - we rented multiple houses for a baseball team for a tournament weekend. So much better than a hotel! Host was excellent. No issues.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This house was perfect for our large group. Plenty of bathrooms, nice open floor plan. The only down side we experienced was being so close to the highway the noise was a bit much when trying to sleep. That being said, I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, very convenient location. Everyone in our family had a great experience. Took a lot of stress away that comes along with traveling."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large House, Great place to stay."
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,Large house worked well for our traveling group of twelve. Excellent location right of interstate. Lots of eating places nearby. House was clean but is close to needing some updates. Would stay again if traveling with large group plenty of room at a great price!

The homes are clean and the beds are always soft and comfortable. Sheryl is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She goes above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. If you are passing through Ardmore or vacationing at the beautiful Lake Murray make sure and plan early and stay with Sheryl.

The theater room was so much fun for the family to unwind and relax in. The location appeared a little ‚Äúrandom‚Äù at first and I was worried about interstate noise, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem AT ALL. The house was quiet and sooo convenient to literally anything you would need. Sheryl was quick to respond to any questions and was so accommodating.

We will definitely be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home in a great location. So close to everything needed in Ardmore! The neighborhood was quiet and so pretty with historical homes!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My granddaughter and I love the house. It is definitely a place I will stay at if I am ever back in that area. I truly recommend staying there.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved this charming house and neighborhood. It was so cozy yet plenty big enough for our family of 5 adults, plus dogs. The backyard was so nice for pets and playing games with the family. Great location and nestled in such a beautiful neighborhood. Definitely recommend taking the time to walk or drive around a few blocks. Nice sunset views right down on the main street by the museum, recommend checking it out as well (it's free). Really a great place to stay! Laura was very accommodating and always quick to reply. Plus she leaves snacks!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place for a weekend getaway! Was everything and more than what we needed. I'd highly recommend as a place to stay. We booked it simply due to the proximity of Turner Falls, but it's in a beautiful neighborhood, easy to find, and close to stores. Has comfortable furniture, fabulous jets in the tub, and just a cozy overall setup. I'd definitely stay again if I'm ever in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood near highway, meeting and exceeding any every need and expectation. Traveling in later than expected was greeted with a snack bar and personalized welcome. Something about that moves me, and clean. Laura‚Äôs place is very clean and newly remodeled with new furnishings.
I respect that very much and hope others will as well. Much to say, all very good. Especially the Jacuzzi tub. Short stay but did enjoy that twice. Highly recommend! Look forward to travels this way again. Laura‚Äôs is top of list."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house with easy access! Perfect for what I needed for the weekend. Will be staying here again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,All great.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The beds were very comfy! I wondered if the highway noise would be a factor, but the home must be very well-insulated. No problems!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peculiar yet super convenient location! Was nice and clean. Would stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very satisfied with our stay. Felt very homey and fit all of our needs.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I really appreciated the texts advising what to do in case of bad weather (which we had). We had stayed here before and enjoyed the accommodations and our stay. Swadley‚Äôs BBQ was awesome! Just sayin
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, relaxing atmosphere! Comfortable beds, comfy living room furniture!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sheryl met me and my family when we got there and made sure we had everything we needed which was great.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Sheryl's place was an excellent spot to stay while on a road trip and we loved the feel of staying in a cabin!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was great and Sheryl was great. Location was a little out of the ordinary but we grew to enjoy it.
House was amazing!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and quiet. Would recommend to friends and family.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This home is very comfortable, but the location is not what I expected for a woodsy getaway. There a few trees. But it is located in an industrial location."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sheryl‚Äôs place was perfect getaway for me, my teen and her best friend. Very clean and cozy. The bed was INCREDIBLY comfortable. Location was very close to highway, places to eat, stores so we could quickly get about our day. Would definitely stay here again."

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a visit with family.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host. Beautiful area. Highly recommend and will stay again next time I come through.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house was very clean and plenty of amenities. Very enjoyable experience with our great granddaughter.
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Homes on Holiday is a great concept. The location is convenient and easy to find. We stayed in the Outdoorsman and the decor matched the description. The house had comfortable beds and a great open concept for the kitchen, dining and living room. This home is older and could use some updates, especially the washer and dryer, but it was clean. I also feel that the living room could use some more lights. The over head lighting was just not enough to really illuminate the room. If you are sensitive to noise from a highway you should know the location is right off of interstate I-35 and you can hear the traffic all day long."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay while visiting Winstar Casino!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place clean and felt safe. It was easy to get to and made my trip relaxing.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We will be returning and recommending to anyone staying in the area. Felt right at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at The Outdoorsman was fantastic. I wish we would have been there for more than one night. We loved the decor and even though you are close to the highway it is very quiet inside and feels remote. Sheryl was very responsive with anything we needed. I would highly recommend this place anytime you are in the area. We will be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for another great stay! Great location right off the highway. Sheryl is quick to communicate!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Sheryl‚Äôs place is very convenient. Perfect for our Ardmore stay!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Though it was just a 1 night stay at the place, we had a very pleasant stay. Sheryl was responsive for my messages. Very near to the highway and there are many restaurants nearer to the place. The house has everything for a perfect stay. Would definetly consider this place for any of our future trips. 10/10 rating! Thank you so much Sheryl for a great hospitality."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a good stay. The traffic noise kept me from sleeping very well.
Bed was comfortable and bathroom had good water pressure.
Right across the street from a new Freddy‚Äôs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous cabin - spotlessly clean- great location.
Will definitely return.
Thanks you"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"It is an amazing place to stay, we didn‚Äôt hear cars from the Highway, it was good, definitely we will be coming back if we have to."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, lots of restaurants near by. 22 mins to Winstar casino."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place! Just wish I was in the middle of a snowy mountain (it was 100+ degrees outside).
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The house was awesome. All the houses in the group were so cool. But it was a disappointment that after you obviously put so much into the area around that the view was so bad. The cool patio and waterfall were right in front of the car lot. The noise from the freeway was pretty loud in one of the bedrooms. Maybe a privacy fence to block those views? Also, a stool to help us short people get in the beds!
Not wanting to complain because we thoroughly enjoyed the house itself. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great! We had a lovely quiet time there. I would gladly stay there again.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Had a great stay. Close to many of the restaurants near the interstate.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in. Really clean and super spacious! Also lots of places to go around that area!. Will definitely come back again !
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, and Sheryl is a great host! We enjoyed our stay. It was very clean and spacious. Would definitely recommend staying here!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place - just like home. Had everything we needed. Beautiful lot with peaceful ponds and fountains. AAA+++
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Right off the interstate! Perfect for us because we were passing through. Great clean place
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place ! I would recommend to family and friends. It‚Äôs located near everything !
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sheryl was an overall great host. She took care of us & accommodated us to the full extent. The property itself is clean, organized & beautifully decorated. As far noise goes (referring to other reviews complaining about highway sounds), the highway sounds are NOT an issue at all. I‚Äôd recommend this property & host to anyone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I spent 6 nights here. It was a very clean and comfortable home. We had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. We really enjoyed the outdoor area with the porches and fire pit. This home is close to restaurants and shopping. Ardmore Regional Park is close and it has beautiful walking trails.
But the best part of our stay was the welcoming host! Sheryl was responsive and available and made us feel right at home! I would love to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,great location and beautiful home üè°
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place to stay in Ardmore!!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. Highway noise was tough. Sheryl was great and accommodating. It‚Äôs a good place to hang your hat if you are in town for a baseball tournament. The cat was cool too. Lol
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was perfect! We stayed in one of Sheryl‚Äôs other homes on our trip down and loved it so much we decided to stay at a different home on the way back! Would highly recommend & we especially loved the kitty that‚Äôs on the grounds. Made us very happy!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Lovely host. Weird location embedded in car dealerships and restaurants. Only stayed one night cuz we were just passing thru from Texas to Ohio. Very comfy beds and well stocked kitchen.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very satisfied with the stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Worth every penny and comfortable. Great location and house was clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was a great place to stop in our overnight trip home from Texas to Indiana. It had a perfect amount of room for our family and was convenient to quick dinner options.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,If I have to go to the Ardmore area again I would always choose to stay here. So nice and clean - great location to all the things we went and did. Thank you so much for hosting a great location
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sheryl was so awesome! We loved staying at her place and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our favorite Airbnb to date. Location was great for us just passing through because it's very close to the highway. As soon as you walk in, you forget where you are. Very cozy country/modern cabin feel. Had everything we needed and even had stuff for my kids. Perfect place for a family. To top it all off, Sheryl was amazing. Fantastic host. When the roads were icy we ended up needing a late check-out. Not only did she accommodate my family, but she called and checked on us several times to make sure we were okay or if there was anything she could do. We will definitely be staying here anytime we pass through Oklahoma. 10/10 recommend."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good for a family, nice homes but could us a bit on maintenance"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We chose this place because it was the halfway point between our home and our family, and also because it was pet friendly. The price is great considering how many people can stay there. We also appreciated that we were able to stay only one night since many places appear to have a minimum stay of 2 nights, and she even allowed us to check in almost an hour early when we arrived sooner than planned. We will definitely consider this for future family visits. Thank you for everything, Sheryl!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always enjoy staying here.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Passing through Oklahoma on a family road trip, we found Sheryl‚Äôs listing to be very accurately explained. Clean, cozy and very affordable. The home is easy to get to from the interstate and offered a perfect spot for a nights sleep during our travels. I especially appreciated the low rate and cleaning service as we never mind tidying up after ourselves. Sheryl was easy to communicate with, I‚Äôd suggest this stay to others when in the area!"
2023-01-01,3,Stayed with a pet,This is not a residential property and seems used for rentals only. It is a weird arrangement of houses right along i35 frontage road. You will want a white noise machine for sleeping. It is a sizable home for a group but a hotel is a better deal if traveling with a small party. Some chain restaurants are walkable but not a super pleasant walk with i35 noise and tire plant smells. I would have prefered a stay in a more residential area away from the highway.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Will stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always enjoy staying here!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a gem. It looks like a mountain cabin, but it's between two car dealerships. Clean and cozy cabin with beautiful Christmas decorations. Has that HOME feel!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I have stayed here multiple times. Always a great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home.
Clean, spacious.
Host was communicative helpful and gracious."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very great place to stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really great place to stay. Great location.
Home away from home."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and nice
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to relax on our way back home from vacationing at the beach. The accommodations were spacious, quiet and cleanly. Very comfortable place to stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Good relaxing stay for us. The owner was very pleasant and easy to work with. The house is in a very good location in town.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family greatly enjoyed our stay at the Outdoorsman. The house is so clean and comfortable, and the property is very well kept - right down to the two cute fish ponds! In addition, the cabin is dog friendly - which was a big plus for us. Sheryl, the host, is super sweet and very communicative. We will definitely add this to our list of ""must stays"" the next time we're in Ardmore and you should too!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here because we wanted to take our boat on lake Murray and stay the weekend. Great location next to a lot of restaurants, stores, etc. and only about 15 minutes from the lake. Great communication before, during, and after our stay. Would highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This outdoorsy cabin was super comfy and a favorite of my husband and daughter. Everything was clean and as described in the advertisement. The small pond in the yard was so pretty! We would definitely stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This place was perfect for our vacation! It is a beautiful home. It smelt incredibly clean when we walked in as well. The location is great. It was central to all the different activities we were doing. Sheryl was helpful and kind. Thank you all for the amazing stay ‚ô•Ô∏è
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sheryl has an amazing place. The location to Lake Murray could only be better if it was right on the lake. It a short drive to the lake and easy access off of 35. The home is well equipped with everything you would need for an overnight stay or extended stay. The beds are very comfortable rooms are good size and the bunk beds are sturdy and also very comfortable. The AC works great! I would recommend Sheryl house to anyone coming through this area.
Sheryl was a gracious host. She was very responsive and easy to deal with I give her and her house 5 stars!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Everything was over and above advertised. Surprisingly great location. Awesome host.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sheryl is so helpful and responsive to any questions and provided us with a flawless rental experience. The accommodations are extremely comfortable and accessible to so many great local features.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location near eateries, the lake, grocery etc. Comfortable beds, clean hot showers, great kitchen and accessories for cooking/serving meals. Overall wonderful for our blended family of 7 to hangout for our summer vacation ."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place, Convenient location, awesome host. Super Clean."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a amazing time at Cheryl‚Äôs beautiful cabin. Communication was super easy and the cabin was very tidy and equipped with everything we needed. My niece loved the gorgeous ponds in the back and hanging out with kitty that patrols the property! I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone !
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Nice house and roomy. Some pretty outdoor areas. Nicely supplied kitchen for light cooking. Too much stuff like condiments and food products that need to be sorted through instead of allowed to pile up in drawers and cupboards. Even stuff like crap meat left in freezer door. It needs the be said that I 35 being so close makes it very noisy. Hard to sleep. Too loud to enjoy sitting outside.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for a Baseball tournament. Responsive host, clean, and conveniently located."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Cute little house and great location. Will be back! Kids loved having a Freddy‚Äôs within walking distance for frozen custard!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great! We‚Äôll definitely be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay in Ardmore. Easy access to everything. Clean and comfortable! Will definitely use again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,we loved the outdoorsman. and appreciate host extending our stay on such late notice
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Spacious cabin ambiance. Lots of space and very comfortable. Gracious and quick-responding host.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was such a great place to just sit around and visit. The beds were very comfortable. Kitchen well stocked. In the evening we would sit out on the deck and watch the little pond. It was lovely!! Tons of restaurants to choose from very close by. Thank you so very much!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My brother, his wife and my nieces and nephew loved this AirB&B! It was a beautiful and cozy place to lay their heads and grief stricken bodies after we laid my son to rest. They absolutely loved the theme, it was well worth every penny and we are very thankful for your hospitality. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! Plenty of space for our family of 5! The home is near busy roads, but it didn‚Äôt bother us as we had read another review that mentioned this so we were prepared for that. Still ample space for our kids to play outside. We felt safe and cooked most of our meals at the home with everything we needed to do so."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here. It is close to restaurants and the highway which was very convenient. Lovely cabin with lots of space and everything you need to cook a meal. Highly recommend to stay here. Our host was great as well, great communication!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Outdoorsman was perfect for our
Family. It was cozy and had everything we needed. Our family enjoyed playing cards and having meals around the table. Sheryl was excellent and answered questions very quickly. We will be back."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,It was very homey and was perfect for our family vacation beautiful home and very good communication from the host thank you so much again
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sheryl was by far the most gracious host that we have ever came across, if you find yourself in the Ardmore area then you would be doing yourself a disservice by not staying in one of these lovely homes the hospitality know we were given was second to none and we were treated like family, Sheryl called us a few times just to make sure we have everything we needed and if there was anything that she needed to do to make her stay more pleasurable. If I could‚Äôve given this place 10 stars I would‚Äôve I highly recommend you give them a shot if you‚Äôre ever in the area"
2022-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The cabin needed a deep clean (ceiling fans, cobwebs, blinds, etc‚Ä¶.). The appliances are all so old/low quality that if you dared turn on the washer, dryer, or dishwasher- you forfeit the ability to have conversation or watch television.
The kitchen is filled with left behind items that are essentially trash, and the mismatched, cheap dishes, pots and pans and silverware made me feel like we were staying at a bachelor pad. The food particles in the silverware drawer especially grossed me out.
It feels like there just isn‚Äôt any intention behind the Outdoorsman.
The bathroom cabinets are also filled with left behind items. There are only filled holes to give an idea where you could once hang towels on racks or hooks- now the only option is to put it over the rusted shower curtain rod‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt look at the shower curtain. Just do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt look down while showering.
I appreciate the location is close to the interstate, but I didn‚Äôt know it was sandwiched between 2 car dealerships whose extremely bright lights never turn off. Between the bright lights and the very loud noise from the interstate, I found it very difficult to sleep.
The positives were that it is easy to get to. The check in process was super easy. Cheryl, the host, did email on our second day to see if we needed anything.
So, I guess it‚Äôs really a matter of expectation management. But for over $200/night total, I was hoping for a bit more."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,I had a wonderful time in Ardmore. The house is beautifully furnished with particular attention to all the details for the best comfort. It made our Christmas one to remember. When I am come back to Ardmore I will definitely book with them again.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at Homes on Holiday! Last summer we stayed at the smaller home & this year we needed a little more room. Everything was clean & the home was ready for full relaxation after a day in the sun. I love the location of these homes being right off the highway & close to restaurants & stores if we need anything! Sheryl‚Äôs homes have it all! Even some shampoo & conditioner if you forget! & laundry detergent (which I forgot) to wash our towels for use the next day! The outdoorsmen was perfectly sized for our family of four plus my in laws who came along this trip! Our 3 year old was super excited there was even some toys, coloring books & crayons & puzzles in the kids room! Thank you, Sheryl! Booking with you is becoming a tradition along with our annual Turner Falls trip!!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. After a very long and hot day visiting Turner Falls Park this place was so relaxing to come back to. We had everything we needed to cook dinner and breakfast. The back patio and little pond added to the relaxing atmosphere.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Superb place with an excellent host.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is clean, well stocked and spacious. For the same as we‚Äôd spend on a hotel we had an entire house for our family, with plenty of beds. The location was somewhat noisy from the highway, but most hotels are, too. It didn‚Äôt really bother us because we were tired! Plus, they‚Äôve really tried to make this a cute, homey atmosphere which beats a run-of-the-mill hotel room by day, in my opinion. I think we definitely got a great value for our comfort."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,cozy and clean. Close to restaurants and highway.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,very clean comfortable house. was great for relaxing which is what we came to do. kitchen had everything we needed and location was great for food delivery. didnt even need the wifi because had great cell signal entire time. love the patio and koi fish pond. overall was great would highly reccomend

2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Much more than we expected! Great location, wonderful owners and very clean."
2021-02-01,4,Group trip,"This is a nice place to stay. I would mention that it does sleep 8, but not everyone gets a bed. This wasn't an issue as Sheryl provided an air mattress and bedding for it. I just thought it would be helpful information for those looking to book. Sheryl was very responsive to our requests and was a great host. As others have mentioned, this is next to the interstate and there is highway noise that can be heard in the house. This didn't keep anyone from sleeping though. The furniture is nice and comfortable in the living room. We would stay again if in the area."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place to stay. The location is perfect. Close to restaurants, stores and interstate. The house is cozy and clean and makes a great getaway place. We enjoyed it and had a great time."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very nice and clean, and well taken care of. We really enjoyed our stay. Anytime we needed anything we got a very quick answer. The only thing I would say that is negative is that the pictures make you think that you are in a a quiet neighborhood but you are really between 2 car dealerships and the freeway. So it is a little bright and noisy. But this was a minor thing and the place was great"
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay in this cute cabin. Great for a family and loved that it was pet friendly! Would highly recommend.
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,WOW is all I can say about this cozy cabin - it's super spacious and the hosts supply everything you can ever possibly need. My family and I had a very wonderful time. I can't wait to come back!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic communication, chick-in was a breeze. Perfect space for a family!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the log house cabin feel! Close the blinds, and it can really feel like a getaway. But then you have the convenience of being in town with so much that is accessible. There are a number of things (store, restaurants, entertainment)that are within a one mile radius or so. The house was clean and had everything needed. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like at other times of the year, but the house was beautifully decorated for Christmas which was an unexpected and sweet bonus for us!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location off of 35. Thoughtful decor touches
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place. Close to everything.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sheryl had clearly taken the time to make sure the place was extremely clean and we had all the necessary items and amenities that we needed. Sheryl‚Äôs place is vaguely misleading, as it‚Äôs actually a model home by the highway, BUT - that ends up not totally being an issue since the place itself is so cozy and charming!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a really nice open concept house that can accommodate larger families. We stayed there with our five kids and two dogs and were very comfortable.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, location, highly recommend!"

2020-08-01,4,Group trip,Lovely place. Would totally recommend. Very homey feel and we had a great time!
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place very spacious and good amenities too. Perfect space for a family of six.
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"Super clean! Was a little different since it is a model home, but overall great."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The only thing we were thrown off by was the location, from the pictures we expected it to be out in the woods but that was our fault for not paying close attention! We ended up appreciating being so close to everything
The cabin itself was so clean! We felt right at home"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you're traveling to Ardmore or Lake Murray this is the place to be

2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Sheryl is amazing and makes herself available if or when you need her. Very thoughtful. The home was beautiful, clean and very cozy. I will definitely be back and recommend her homes to others."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sheryl‚Äôs Huntsman House was just as great as the other accommodation we‚Äôve rented through her in the past. These houses sit in a convenient, if odd, location, and everything was sparkling clean. Communication and check-in left nothing to be desired."
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,This is a great place to stay and a great deal for the amount of beds you get with it. The kitchen has everything you need to make meals and Walmart isn't too far away. Although there are also lots of choices to eat near by. This is a great place to Stay.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy cabin exceeded all expectations! The host, Sheryl, is amazing - quick responses and thoughtful accommodations for our baby!

Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Return visitor, beautiful newly updated home, home owner easy to reach.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property is secluded and private! The property is well maintained. We shared this property with two other couples. Each couple had their own bedroom.
We brought our ATV and were able to cruise around the property. We also enjoyed some fun trails at Lake Murray! We relaxed on the wraparound deck and by the fire pit! While taking in beautiful sunrises and sunsets!
We did a little a fishing but unfortunately didn‚Äôt reel one in!
If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place to relax, unwind and get recharged this is the perfect place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The best airbnb we have ever stayed at. Great hosts, beautiful location."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We will be back! This was perfect for my family and parents who joined. We fished at the pond, played outside with our kids, and sat by the fire pit for dinner! The mornings were so peaceful and the colors in the tree line and the sky made it very hard to leave. Great place for families of all sizes! Can‚Äôt wait for our next trip. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is the fourth time I have stayed at this beautiful getaway. It‚Äôs always such a relaxing, wonderful experience. The grounds were in pristine order and I noticed they have added some really nice play equipment if you have children. The addition of the new dock a couple years ago has made hanging out on the lake so nice. One of my friends was fishing the whole weekend. We really enjoyed strolling around the property.
I‚Äôm so thankful to have such a wonderful place to rejuvenate. You never have to leave the whole weekend!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love staying here and getting some country / lake living in with the kids. It has become a family tradition that keeps bringing us back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,WOW!! I have to say that this place is nothing short of amazing. We travel a lot and stay in homes a lot but this place was the best. We have a slip at lake Murray (Murray Harbor) and we travel down most the summer and stay. This is the first year we found this home and hope to use it more frequently. It is minutes from our harbor and set back away from the road. Driving in almost takes you back to a movie. Long winding dirt drive trees all around and open fields. As you drive up to the house you can see the lake and dock to the right. Playground area in the back and a nice size home. Then when you walk in you see how well this home has been kept up. The interior was amazing felt like coming home. It has three big bedrooms with comfortable mattresses. Spacious living areas and a very well equipped kitchen! The bathrooms were spotless and everything was in its place. We absolutely loved our stay and hope to be back soon!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay as always! It was our 5th time here. We enjoyed the fishing dock and caught quite a few fish! We swam and played putt putt at Lake Murray also. Had s‚Äômores by the fire at night and enjoyed dining on the patio. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Serenity and peace is what you‚Äôll find at The Lake House. Barry & Felicia are wonderful hosts providing everything you‚Äôll need to cook, bake or grill. But most importantly our favorite attribute to their place is the relaxation. Our family and friends enjoyed their stay with us and we are so grateful to come across this beautiful space."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This a very private, cozy and comfortable house. You won‚Äôt want to leave! Close to the lake has the private pond with an awesome floating dock."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time staying here for a long and much needed weekend getaway with some of our friends and even our pups! We loved the views from the porch every morning, nights by the fire under the stars, and all the cool things to do near by. We really enjoyed going to the lake which was only about 5-10 mins up the road and we kayaked for hours and just relaxed down by the water. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting a fun stay with a group of friends and/or family and to bring your dogs as well, ours loved it :) We hope to be back again soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay if you want to be in that area or looking for a place to get away and to be family and freinds!
My friend caught a 4-5lb bass from the pond there and makes for good view from the house!
Nice covered dock on pond to sit or fish!
üëç
Thanks
Randy & Janice"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the serenity of this home. Having the ability to explore the many trails and watch wildlife from the porch. The new floating dock is awesome! There were many board games to play, and bocce ball for outdoors. Check in is a breeze. Be aware though, if you bring a pet, they are not to be on the furniture, beds or carpeted area (the carpeted area being the bedrooms and the hall to them, but there is a gate that can be used to separate that area.) I would definitely stay again if in the area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying here and it was just another wonderful time. The property is so amazing, private and relaxing. Many strolls around the pond and countless hours on the porch overlooking it all. We were really lucky birdwatching and two eagles came flying by and landed in the trees. An amazing site! We head out during the day and go down to the lake and walk around some of the trails.
Everything in the house is quite clean & comfy and well stocked. Until next time!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second time staying here and we had such a great time! Love the patio, fenced in yard for the dogs and tons of acres to walk around. We will definitely book again!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful piece of property was better than I imagined. If it‚Äôs a full moon you‚Äôre interested in, see it appear over the lake and it, along with the stars, makes for a serene evening. This house was spotless, comfortable and large enough for five or six. Thanks Barry and Felicia for a great getaway."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a short stay but the property is beautiful and it definitely made us want to come back when everything is in bloom.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and is well worth the price. The trails and acreage are amazing and the home is well kept. Thank you again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic property! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to a return visit in the future. Great scenery, beautiful pond, plenty of space for outdoor recreation, cozy porch and home - all the amenities for a perfect getaway."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great country getaway with large pond and plenty of acres to explore. A stone‚Äôs throw from Lake Murray for boating. Great place to stay if you plan visiting Lake Murray.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Convenient location, easy access and securing.
Amazingly zenful home. The peace this home brings is the perfect R&R. The beds were comfortable, we all slept well. Great water pressure even with people in each shower.
All you have to do is bring your clothes, food, fishing poles and s'mores. (Some firewood too) You'll be glad you stayed here."
2021-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"One of the prettiest properties and homes we have ever stayed at. Peaceful and isolated.
That said it did have some cleaning needs. Also some items were broken. The chairs by fire pit were weathered and cracked. There were also a heavy amount of biting ants around the pit area and yard. There was not much access to fishing because of overgrowth around the lake. The dock was in bad condition and partially under water. We did find some hair in fridge and ice maker didn‚Äôt work. We did not want to use the jets in the tub because they were dirty. We also found dirty towels and bedding in washer and wet bedding and towels in dryer when we arrived. Those items aside a bit of caution to others looking to go to Ft. Sill Graduations. It was not convenient for us personally. As we were not from the area we didn‚Äôt realize Lawton was 2 hours away. We were there for Ft. Sill graduation. As a note for any family going to graduations at Ft Sill they do not allow soldiers to leave Lawton area on family day. So we were not able to utilize the home during most of our stay and had to remain in Lawton."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay at a great location! We enjoyed the lake on the property, caught some fish and kayaked. We also rented a boat from Lake Murray marina and ate at the Foggy Bottom cafe. This way our third year in a row here and I‚Äôm sure we will be back!"

Basically this house is the whole package for a wonderful get away!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is amazing. The view off the porch is beautiful. It is conveniently located close to the lake and not too far from Ardmore for any necessities needed. It was an amazing stay, only wish it was longer."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great lake house in close proximity to Lake Murray. Excellent location! Beautiful land and pond with trails to explore. Kids enjoyed fishing for bass and blue gill off the floating dock. Would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an awesome rental! The home is comfortable, nicely furnished and located in a peaceful out of the way location. There is plenty to do in the area, but honestly, I never wanted to leave the big porch that opens up to the beautiful outdoors!"

2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Second time staying out at Lake Murray and this location was just as beautiful as last time, with the welcome addition of a new and nice tornado shelter just in time for tornado weather. Right down the street at Lake Murray was a big, new equipment rental and putt putt course that looked really fun for summer.
Fantastic place with beautiful views, a pond full of bass, plenty of things to do, and getting better all the time!
Thanks, Scott"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"absolutely love staying here! If you're reading through previous reviews, please seek out my other one from December 2020. Such an amazing place with amazing hosts!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don‚Äôt think twice on booking this place if you find it available. We had a long weekend trip from North Dallas, very comfortable distance driving.
Upon arrival, everything very clean, pictures just don‚Äôt do justice. Cabin confortable, working and in good condition.
Our kids can‚Äôt stop talking about all the activities, and press us for a new date.
There are fish in the lake, but difficult catching them. We did get a 3.5 lbs big mouth bass, and some little ones. (Used rattletrap, worms didn‚Äôt seam to work).
Stargazing is a plus around the bonfire in special chairs for looking into the sky.
5 stars for Barry and Felicia, always sharp returning calls!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for the family to get away for a week. So peaceful and quiet, with lots of woodsy area to roam around. Very dog friendly. Everything was very clean and exactly as advertised. I walked around the lake the first afternoon and managed to catch 7 bass in about 2 hours. Lots of wildlife around, although the deer were pretty shy. The hosts were great at responding to questions. Highly recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"This air b and b is a nice and very clean place to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet, but still very close to many amenities. I would caution about scheduling to far in advance if one wants to rent it in the months of January and February like I did this year, because one doesn't know the weather conditions."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect place to get away and enjoy some incredible outdoor time. The walk around the stunning property is fabulous. The house was just what we wanted for our family of 5.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Barry & Felecia‚Äôs beautiful place.

We will definitely be back again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Meadow Lodge was our 2020 Christmas get away. Our family enjoyed every minute of this beautiful 78 acre ranch. Barry and Felicia were amazing and provided a quick response to any questions we had. The house was clean and the beds were very comfortable!
Our boys enjoyed all the wild life on the property from deer to the beavers in the lake and stargazing at night. It was just an overall experience that we will forever cherish.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely amazing! we loved the trails, the pond, hammocks, fire pit and just the relaxing and free environment this property offered. Hosts were amazing, met the cleaning staff and they were very welcoming (we got there as they were leaving) and they made sure to tell my nephew happy birthday and made it so positive for him. Turner Falls is a short drive a way and we spent a day exploring and hiking there and then came home to this awesome place to rest and relax. Thank you guys so much! highly recommend. We don't have a negative thing to say‚ô°
can't wait to stay again!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING PLACE! The property is really nice with a very sizeable pond and walking trails. Beautiful location minutes from Lake Murray with great fall foilage.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at this home. Plenty of bedrooms,great kitchen and family room space. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to cook great meal. No fear of running out of dishes or towels! The place was very clean and very homey.
The star of the place is obviously the outdoors. The beautiful pond that is visible from the porch, the trails to walk and discover. We sat out at the fire pit each night stargazing. Went down to the lake a couple times to beach, Tucker Tower and the nature center. Awesome time. Will be back."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stay at a lot of secluded air bnbs like this one and I have to say, this is the best one we have ever stayed at!

2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing weekend at the house. The house has everything you will need for the most part. We weren't able to go hiking around the property since we stayed at the lake all Saturday but it appearsthe trails go around the back of the pond. We hope to be able to come back and explore more. The fish weren't biting the morning before we left so we're weren't as lucky as others. So we also don't have much to say on that but we did catch one small bass. Overall being on 78 acres you feel very secluded from everyone. If you are looking for privacy, relaxation and nature this is the place for you! We did see raccoons and deer while we were there. We can't wait to visit again and for longer next time. A weekend just isn't long enough! Thanks again for allowing us to stay at your beautiful property!"
2020-08-01,4,Group trip,"The land this house is on is just beautiful! It is so serene. We loved looking for deer in the morning and spending our evenings on the porch. My husband also really enjoyed fishing in the morning and after dinner.
Consider bringing a pistol on the walk though, as we found a large pig waller not far back on the trail. Wild boars are very aggressive and dangerous!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Three generations of family enjoyed our stay at this beautiful property. The fishing was great and the view of the land from the porch was outstanding. I saw geese in the morning, deer in the afternoon, and heard coyotes yipping in the distance during the evening. The hosts were very responsive to communications. We will be back!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house and land are absolutely amazing. We spent an entire day on land riding atvs and honestly could have spent ur entire stay at the home and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Fishing at the pond was great, trails and yard were very nice. We were able to ride and see wildlife, trails are also well manicured for walking. House was beautiful and well taken care of. House was sticked with a ton of stuff that came in very handy and we didn't have to take too many trips to the store! I can't say enough good about this special place. We plan on camping back again and staying longer!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This poperty is amazing if you love wildlife/outdoors. We had such a good time and super close to the lake, but the pond (huge pond) was amazing too. This was our faviort famiy lake trip so far! Very relaxing and cozy!"

Everything was very clean and the kitchen was well-supplied with pots, pans, dishes, silverware, etc., that we needed for meal preparation.
We enjoyed hiking the 78 acres and appreciated that paths had been mowed to make our walking easier. The fire pit was ready to go for us to build a fire. A large stack of wood was available and the pit was clean and even had kindling stacked in the pit. A stack of chairs is also there to use around the fire pit. Such attention to detail!
I live in the Dallas/ Ft. Worth area and my friends live in the Norman/OKC area and it was the perfect half-way spot for us to meet for a girls' weekend. We definitely plan to return!"

If you like camping in the outdoors but still want the luxury of a kitchen, heat and/or air conditioning, and a soft bed....this is your place. Would stay here again no question.

We plan on staying there again!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome weekend!! Beautiful and homey house with all the comforts of home!!
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! it was quiet and very accommodating. We will definitely book again if in the area.
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent house with everything you need, very close to the state park. This made for the perfect New Years Eve."
2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay would definitely recommend this location!
2016-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place rocks! Very clean and secluded for family gatherings or meetings. Not one complaint about this place. I wanted to stay longer.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing property, simply beautiful. Everything was right in place as promised. Highly recommend this property. Planning on booking it every year in October."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! It was so nice to get away from the metroplex for a weekend and enjoy nature. Enjoyed fishing off the dock and hiking the trails. We will be back.
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barry and Felicia. Thank you for making our end of summer family reunion special. We normally lodge at Lake Murray but found those accommodations aging and too small for our needs. We left a review in the guest book and hope you find it sufficient to express our appreciation for the quality and the enjoyment of our time at Meadow Lodge. Joe Lovelace
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at this property for five nights. My family enjoyed every single one! Nice country setting, quiet, and very peaceful. Fishing, hiking, camping, you can do almost anything with no outside intrusions! We will be back, can't wait!!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience, so much so that we decided to ask for an extra day which we were granted! The cabin amenities were awesome. The recommended locations were exactly what we were looking for. With quick access to lake Murray and Turner falls, we definitely plan on returning soon!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING! The property and the house were so clean and well maintained - it was great! We enjoyed our entire stay at the property - very close Lake Murray which was very busy for the holiday weekend. It was great to be able to relax with amazing views of the property. You are able to avoid all of the traffic and watch the fireworks from the picnic table for clear views or from the porch (just obstructed by trees) for a more comfortable seat. We will definitely be back again!
2016-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This property was great. A lot of space and very comfortable. It was located close to Turner Falls and Lake Murray. I would recommend staying here to anyone and plan on coming back when I am in the area.
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place! Enjoyed our stay,much better than we ever dreamed! Can't wait to book again!"
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property was very convenient to Lake Murray and Turner Falls. The private pond was very nice; we ended fishing off the dock rather than going to Lake Murray. My 2 boys loved it! The house itself was clean and had cold AC. Tons of patio seating and a comfy hammock to relax in. I'd recommend staying here.
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Meadow Lodge was the perfect place for our extended family vacation. We had three generations in our group and there was something for everyone! And we were close to some major outdoor recreation areas including Turner Falls, Lake Murray, Arbuckle Wilderness and Chickasaw National Recreation area.

The property is beautiful and very well kept! The house was large enough to accommodate four adults, two teens and three young ones without feeling crowded. And the fenced front yard was a great way to let the little ones play outside without worry! The wrap-around porch quickly became our favorite place for dining and relaxing.

Barry and Felicia have created a wonderful ""home away from home"" and have thought of every detail. We loved the house and plan on making this a family vacation spot every 2-3 years!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a group of 8 people which was made up of several children and we had plenty of room to spare. The house was every thing we needed. The views were fantastic. We had a ton of fun fishing my son even caught a 5 1/2 pound large mouth bass! Tons of fish in the lake, walking trails, we brought a kayak and boated around the lake and caught even more fish from different area's. We had so much fun and we will be back again to enjoy!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was probably one of the best airbnb experiences I've had. We made a family vacation out of it and took my mother and sister. The property was so beautiful. From the gorgeous lake to the wild flowers everywhere. Barry and Felicia were super accommodating and let us ride our four wheelers on the trails. That seriously made the entire thing. We fished in the private pond and the younger kids enjoyed catching the perch. The fire pit at night was the perfect location for smores and late night conversations. The wrap around deck was the perfect place to have our morning coffee and evening meals. The inside of the house is very up to date even though the only time we spent in there was cooking. The outside was simply stunning! Can't wait to come back.
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived and let me tell you the place was perfect. The owner had mowed a good portion of the tall grass down so it was a easy walk to the lake and around the property. Thank you so much for that. The house was just as stated on the website. Very comfortable and had everything that you could possible need. My husband and I bought along our daughter, son in law and granddaughter and they too enjoyed their time in the peace and quiet. Although we live in Washington State our daughter and her husband are already talking about going back. Thank you Barry and Felicia for allowing us to stay at your awesome house. It is just what all of us needed."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry & Felicia definitely made our stay stress free. The land was beautifully kept and the house had everything you needed.

We cooked a couple of big meals after hiking and never had to go out to buy extra utensils or anything."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry and Felicia were great hosts, very responsive and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The property is unique and exceeded our expectations for a stay in the countryside. Quiet, comfortable and enough room to spread out. We'd definitely recommend."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place to meet as a family for my son's homecoming from Korea before continuing on to a new assignment in Italy with Air Force. We were fortunate to find this place on Airbnb. What an amazing spot! The directions to this secluded oasis were easy to follow and we were thrilled from the moment we saw the place and it's setting - It is just as described on the website. We settled in quickly and found it easy to kick back and relax. The home was spacious and well kept. We had lived in the Ardmore area for over 20 years and have many friends there - I was excited to tell them about this getaway spot and encouraged them to check on availability if they ever have company come in to town. My best friend came out one evening and her husband commented that it would be a lovely place to just get away from town for the weekend. We unanimously agreed that whenever we are able to get back to Oklahoma we will check for availability here first! It's like a home away from home - only more peaceful. If I can figure out how to post pictures from our visit I certainly will.
2016-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a beautiful, relaxing, comfortable getaway, this is the place! The property itself is perfect for anyone who enjoys being close to nature but wants to unwind in comfort ... there are enough sights and trails right on this property to fill an entire stay but the nearby vicinity is full of opportunities to hike, explore, and indulge in great beauty as well! The hosts' instructions were thorough and well laid out, making for a stress free stay. The house and surrounding land are so much more lovely in person than in the pictures! There were five of us and the house was large enough that we didn't step on each other's toes for the week we stayed here! Lake Murray is less than five minutes away and offered horseback riding, an amazing nature center, and beautiful trails. The Chickasaw Cultural Center, Chickasaw National Recreation Area, and Turner Falls were close adventures as well. The night's sky is incredibly clear and provides a lovely back drop for nice hours around the fire outside. Absolutely wonderful family vacation!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry and Felicia were great! Overall, the house gets an A, but for the price it gets an A++. I will stay here again.
The property was about an hour and fifteen minutes from the DFW area, and very easy to find with a phone GPS. The locking gate and 300 yard driveway put us back away from the sparsely used road the property sits on. This let us have peace and quiet, but also feel very safe the entire time.
Upon arrival, I walked up onto the pack porch and looked out upon the beautiful trees and large pond within eye sight from the porch. While sitting out at night we could hear turkeys gobbling, and they were so close I could hear them fly up into their roosts when it was getting dark.
The best description I have of this property, is that it is like a secluded campsite, but instead of staying in a cold leaky tent, you get to stay in a great house with quality appliances and comfy beds (and wifi and cable). The scenery is beautiful and it was incredibly relaxing to sit and be outdoors. The best part, in my opinion, was the privacy. If we would have stayed on the property, the only living things we would have seen were the squirrels, birds, and turkeys that came struggling across the pasture. The house its self was great and the pictures accurately portray it. We had a group of 5, and had more than enough room. I would say that you could comfortably sleep at least 8 or 9 people with everyone on one of the beds, more with the couches.

My only complaint about the entire stay probably doesn't apply to most people, and that is that the fishing on the pond was not great. We still caught 8 Large Mouth Bass, but our hopes when planning the trip were a little higher for the fishing. (Me and my friend who also fished are pretty knowledgeable about fishing and can pretty much catch fish in a swimming pool.) If you want to fish, the most effective baits we found were top waters right before dusk, and small plastic grubs with a spinner attached.
Our group hung out on the dock for hours relaxing and enjoying the beautiful pond and land. Beach towels were provided by the host, and we took full advantage of the bright sun and nice dock. The entire back pasture down to the dock was mowed so we were never in fear of walking in grass we thought there could be snakes. I'm sure this took a lot of work and time, but it was much appreciated.

Again, I will defiantly stay here again, and will recommend it to my friends.
The low price does not reflect the quality of the property, but the kindness of the hosts. Book it up and enjoy a great get away with your family or friends."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barry's place was a perfect fit. Got in on a Monday evening and threw a couple Ribeye's and shrimp on the Grill while taking in the view of the lake. Enjoyed having a full kitchen setup, and outdoor dining area. The entry process was simple. The beds were comfortable as one can imagine for two giant humans (I'm 6'3"" and my girlfriend is 6'1""). There were 3 bedrooms with 3 beds and a bunk bed to choose from. The acreage- Even though it poured raining I had to take a couple turns around the 1.5 mile trail. As an avid hiker I appreciated this amenity the most along with the dock where we did a bit of guided meditation using the Breathe app on our phones. What a serene location for that. Other than a minor hiccup with the microwave not working and the new AC unit being configured backward, which barry promptly had fixed within hours after our call I give this home 5 stars!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We travelled up from Dallas just for a couple of nights to stay at Barry and Felicia's place. I didn't meet either of them but they were very responsive by phone and email and all their instructions were clear. The house itself is spacious and quaint and the beds comfy. But the bests part is the land..we went for a number of walks through the property and around the property's lake. The peace and quiet is just lovely. We also drove down to Lake Murray State Park - although next time we will remember our bikes as it is not far. I am sure that place is just so much fun in the summer and the lake is huge! We had a fire in the evening and watched the sunset from one of the back fields. Cooking facilities were great and the BbQ worked as well. We would definitely come back. Thank you!
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great! It was as listed and the perfect place for our girls weekend away. There were 5 of us and we had plenty of space to spread out and then come together for meals and talks. We built a fire and had s'mores under the stars, took quite walks around the property and even just laid in the sun on the wooden dock.

Barry had everything ready for us. When I had a question about checking out a little later on Sunday, he replied to my email right away. He was gracious enough us to let us stay later and have the grilled burgers we were craving for lunch :)

We will definelty be coming back here for another girls getaway."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Rebecca has a beautiful well maintained home. She's very responsive and easy to communicate with. We have really enjoyed this property the couple times we have stayed.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We wanted to stay here for the pool! The pool was great and we were able to enjoy family time. The house could use some attention: there was a broken ceiling fan that was missing half of its blades, one room has a tv wall mount but no tv, we had to hook up the surround sound ourselves. Cleanliness wise, we don‚Äôt feel like the $200 cleaning fee was worth what we walked in on. Overall, the house was good, pool was great, and we had a good time."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,My family of 8 really enjoyed the home. It was beautiful and roomy. I wish I would have realized there aren‚Äôt tvs in the bedrooms but other than that our experience was wonderful.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Becky was easy to communicate with and house was very nice!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Becky‚Äôs beautiful home is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. Swimming pool was amazing with the nice sitting area to relax . It was not far from the local grocery stores , restaurants or gas station. Communication was great too. We would highly recommend this wonderful home. We will for sure love to stay here next time we go to Ardmore."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a few issues and Becky resolved them quickly , I was impressed with this.Really enjoyed the pool house very clean and inviting."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the 4th of July weekend to visit family. It‚Äôs a beautiful home with everything you need. Totally stocked with essentials. We spent alot of time in the pool, which was really nice. Great place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house and pool were perfect! There was plenty of room for all of us! We had a great time with our family! I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking to getaway to relax and enjoy time together!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay, the home was well appointed clean and comfortable. Nice kitchen with good cookware . would definitely stay here again if I was ever in the area again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was perfect for our family get away. The pool was well equipped to keep the kids busy for hours. There is a surprise working space which is far enough of way from the family for some privacy to get things done. The host is extremely responsive and friendly. We highly recommend this property if you are in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place and excellent host
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay in this spacious home. Loved having the pool and the private backyard. Kitchen had all amenities and basics in the fridge and cabinets. Quiet and safe. Beds were comfortable, air conditioning worked great. Loved having the garage during the rainstorms."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beck‚Äôs house was a great place to stay with the family. We all had a great time in the pool, with ping pong table and board games. We appreciate the great communication as well. Will definitely come back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great and as advertised. We stayed there while in town for a baseball tournament (a few dads and our 10 year olds). The kids loved the ping pong table and pool, although the water was freezing. The only issue I had was that apparently the dad who sent me the link to book didn‚Äôt have the exact number of people staying in the house. The owners or property management, after watching us on video, reached out to ask how many people were staying there. We told them 5 adults and 4 kids. They said we only noted 2 adults and 2 kids on the booking. Therefore, they proceeded to charge us an additional $200. We rented the entire house and used the same number of beds we would have used if it were 2 adults and 2 kids. There are no other amenities provided based on occupancy and the house has 5 queen beds. It didn‚Äôt seem right to be charged an additional $200. However, we did ask & get approval to have the other kids and parents over to cook out some burgers and dogs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time in this spacious & beautiful home!!! Definitely will be back .
