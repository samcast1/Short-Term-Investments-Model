2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Airbnb was exactly as pictured and described. I went there to relax and do nothing and that's what I was able to do. It had all the amenities I needed to just cook and chill. Laurel was friendly and responsive. Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Laurel’s home exceeded my expectations and was even better in real life. Her home didn’t feel like a tiny home, it was sooo incredibly spacious. I loved the many different light fixtures and the windows that looked out into nature, it created such a cozy ambiance. This space was everything I could have asked for and more. Laurel was so sweet to greet me and tell me I could message her anytime with any questions. I felt right at home. Thank you for hosting me Laurel! I hope to be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Laurel is a great host very friendly and communicative.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My boys and I were on our way back north and the tiny home was a much needed contrast to the bust Anheim hotel we had been at. We had a peaceful evening snuggling on the couch after dinner watching a show. I drank coffee kn the patio in the morning watching the wildlife and enjoying the mountain view. The kids loved the loft led bunk!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute tiny home! Felt safe the entire time as a solo traveler stopping by from the city. Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best stay at the Tiny House! The house is so charming and just as it looks in the photos. My duaghter and I stayed with our two dogs and felt right at home. The location is just magical with deer and rabbit and horses all around.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Me and my friend need a peaceful place for the night when visiting northern California for its nature, and we recommend this place in the following characteristics: it is located in a very private area, some dark drive in the evening, but the layout of the house is very cozy, quiet and dark, perfect for me and my friend catch up and chat with a glass of wine, away from home; the place has everything, TV, AC, functional kitchen, coffee maker and glasswares, and kitchen wares if you want to cook, good wifi signal; last, waking up in the morning, facing the sunrise in the mountain, with a cup of coffee is exactly what I need for the weekend. The host is very responsive, and replies very quickly. Love the paintings, lovely touch and fits the environment. I recommend this place for anyone who wants a close to nature stay and enjoy a peaceful getaway."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,nice and cozy
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an awesome stay and experience! The views were epic and we very much enjoyed the horses that were around the area as it seems to be a large horse community (we also got to see a lot of cool toads at night, if you’re in to that).
The restaurants were really nice and not to far. But if cooking in is what you’d like, the kitchen was pretty set up with appliances and cookware.
Again really awesome experience and hope to be back in Red Bluff soon!"

We stayed overnight on a long drive and the location was very safe and accommodated our moving truck. Laurel stayed up past midnight to greet us and help with check in, so kind and thoughtful. On top of that, the tiny home was clean and so cute. The bed and linens were super comfy. Would absolutely recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laurel is the absolute best! She was so easy to communicate with and was so friendly. Her tiny home is beautiful and was perfect for me and my needs. She went above and beyond and helped me feel right at home while I was on a solo trip to Red Bluff. I’ll be reserving this spot in the future for sure!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great stay at Laurel's Tiny home! The place was clean, quiet and comfortable. Exactly as described.
The host, Laurel, is on site, and you can see her house from the tiny home but I didn't feel this impacted my sense of privacy at all, and barely even noticed someone else on the property.
Very comfortable and cozy, perfect for a rural feeling retreat."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was looking for options in Redding, but found this gem.
It's better than what can be caught on camera.
Great for a couple looking for privacy and time all to yourselves or for a small family looking to get away for some quality time with your children.
I took my 15 and 11 year old for some much needed RnR.
They loved the tiny house and amazing views. I enjoyed the stars and the quiet of Mother Nature. Got up before Sunrise to listen to the silence and the awakening of Coyotes howls and the birds chirping at Sun break.
We all loved the Tiny House and time together."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Omg this place! Magical.
I was up early to catch the beautiful sunrise, we took our walk down the country road past horses, cows, friendly neighbours. The weather was perfect for the huge outdoor shower.
Inside the bed was comfy, good pillows, big windows for that perfect California breeze to come in.
I highly recommend this place and we’ll be back for sure, but for longer next time."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely property, quiet area that is tucked into the rolling hills of Northern California. Came across many deer and rabbits as it got dark. The airbnb has been thoughtfully put together, enough room for 3 adult women to spread out and relax, and it had everything we needed to enjoy a couple nights in. Love the outdoor shower! Nice hot water with good pressure that cleans the day away, comfortable bedding. Love how sweet Luna and Mally (the owners dogs) are, they even came up to us and let us pet them. Laurel is very kind and friendly, came out to chat and let us know of a couple good eating options, and told us of some work they were doing. Overall very pleasant experience, hope to make my way back up there again! Thanks Laurel"

Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a relaxing stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nicely decorated stay. Beautiful details, and has everything you’d need. Her dogs Luna and Mally are adorable too. The property is very remote and extremely quiet - a definite change for city dwellers like myself.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 recommended
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at 'The Tiny House' was an absolute joy. The house may be small, but it's so comfortable and has everything you could wish for, from a well equipped kitchen to an abundance of fresh towels in the bathroom. The accommodation is set in the most beautiful location, views and sunrises are stunning. Just sit outside and be surrounded by nature, birds, deer, squirrels - we have never stayed anywhere so tranquil. If you're looking for a relaxing getaway, this is definitely for you. Red Bluff and all the local amenities are a 10-minute drive away.
We have to make special mention to wonderful Laurel who hosts this property. We have stayed in many Airbnb over the years, and she was the best. Her communication is quick, and she will always help. Her hospitality is as warm and friendly as she is, she really does want you to have the best time. We have no hesitation in recommending this lovely stay, 10/10!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The fact that she built the tiny home and has kept it up immaculately is impressive. Every detail has been thought out from both the indoor to outdoor shower! Yes the outdoor shower is very private and useable, although we choose the indoor one as we were just there one night. The outdoor seating area was lovely and the hand carved table top was amazing workmanship. I would have loved to stay longer. It was peaceful and serene with a great sunrise which we both saw as we got a good night sleep in comfortable beds. Do be aware that there is no door between the two sleeping areas and as I snore, my sister did not sleep as well as I did in the upper larger bed!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laurel's place was perfect for our quiet weekend getaway. I've never been an avid bird watcher, but I found myself falling in love with the adorable birds that would come up to the bird feeder. The tiny home is located on a property surrounded with great views for stargazing. Laurel is also an excellent host and I applaud her for crafting such a beautiful stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First tiny home experience and it was a great place to spend our anniversary. Laurel was extremely friendly and responsive! Would stay here again :)

The tiny house is a gem, thoughtfully constructed and lovingly cared for. so much character! My boys wished we could have stayed longer :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a wonderful place. Laura thought of everything and the tiny house experience was just fantastic. Youd never know you were in a tiny house as it had everything you need. We saw a deer, jack rabbit, and two sweet, beautiful dogs. Hope to stay awhile next time, but just passing through."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My sister and I had an amazing time at this tiny home. It was clean, serene, matched the pictures and we loved seeing all of the wildlife. We watched the rabbits every morning, played with the dogs the last night, enjoyed the daily deer visits and watched the countless birds, squirrels and chipmunks.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed birds, bats, rabbits, deer, turkeys, and lots of clear stars. Beds were comfy and roomy. Kitchen fully stocked. Board games available. Fire pit and patio table were inviting. Bathroom was completely adequate. Outdoor shower was great bonus. Much more fun and peaceful than a hotel stay. Host was kind and responsive. Highly recommend. (Maybe bring mosquito spray)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I truly can’t say enough good things about Laurel‘s place. The images don’t do justice. It’s even cuter and cozier than the pictures capture. Delight at every turn.
My son loved it so much he asked several times if we could skip the national parks he loves going to and just stay at Laurel‘s.
Laurel herself is a gem. So sweet and contentious. Gave us plenty of space and also super quick to respond when needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect retreat for a long (and super hot) weekend! Laurel is very responsive and her place was just as pictured.

Great place 🙏🙏🙏"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and calm place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! We loved everything about our stay. The host, Laurel, was super friendly and kind, offering us drinks when we arrived. The home itself was well-appointed and we loved the American West aesthetic of its decor and furnishings. The bed was super comfortable. The layout was perfect with a good sized fridge, dishwasher and ample space in the bathroom.
All of this made us happy, but the real attraction is the killer views and peacefulness of this property. Imagine waking up to birdsong and the tinkling of wind chimes. Then take your coffee out on the patio and breathe in the fresh air. You may even get a visit from Luna & Mally, their friendly dogs. Don't forget to use the outdoor shower for the full, immersive experience of it all. Talk about feeling refreshed! If you are spending time in the Shasta/Redding area, this is well worth the stay. Or even if you are just passing through. You will not be disappointed! Five Stars!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a wonderful time during our stay! Got some needed rest. The place was so calming and quiet and it had all the amenities you would need. My husband and I really enjoyed the place as explored Lassen National Park

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely LOVED the stay at this beautiful tiny house. It was so comfortable and I felt immediately at home (which tends to be difficult for me outside of my own home). It was quiet and peaceful with so many birds flying around throughout the day. Laurel was very responsive and even had the AC running prior to our arrival (since it was quite warm the day we checked in) which was very nice of her! Will definitely come back here for another getaway and would recommend this place for others :)

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There is a long dirt road that leads up to this place with a beautiful view. The tiny house maximized every space. The beds were very comfortable and the bedding was high quality. You wouldn’t believe we fit 3 people and one had a walker. The men were pretty fascinated with the outdoor shower. Next time we are in the area we will be sure to stay here. Thanks for the experience.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Even though the place is tiny (like a RV space), but it has everything you need and it is very clean. There are not much to do around, but it is very quite and peaceful surrounded. Laurel is very helpful and responsive host to work with."

She had cold beers waiting for us and a fire all set up, ready to be lit. We had a nice time sitting around the fire and stargazing. We watched the birds, enjoyed the peace and quiet, and even watched the sunrise. Laurel was so attentive, and gave us great recommendations in Red Bluff and Redding.

Pay attention to the details of this sweet little space and you will be blown away by Laurels attention to design and detail. We loved sitting on the patio and listening to the birds and just staring out into the valley. The Red Bluff valley is the only thing you see within your view and it’s stunning. I even felt inspired to open my watercolors and paint it! We will most definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This tiny home is the perfect size! It has everything you need and more. The outdoor shower is a must especially on hot days. There is a short stretch of gravel road that I think any vehicle could make just be mindful of your speed. Would definitely recommend for anyone to stay here!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay. It’s my second time here, and I plan on staying again. It’s in a slightly remote, very peaceful environment, but close enough to major freeways that it’s convenient for time crunched travelers. Laurel (the hostess) is great! As you’ll see from the pictures, she has great taste, and has considered every little detail to make your stay feel 5 star, at a reasonable rate! I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was clean, new, light, and airy and we felt very comfortable during our stay. Laurel is a very sweet and gracious host— a true, original Airbnb experience. She was very responsive and accommodating.
Glad we decided to extended our stay when planning this trip— so worth it to slow down and soak it all in!
On top of that, it’s the perfect, stylish tiny house experience with the outdoors just steps away. We had privacy and a beautiful view of the sunrise over the mountains. Lassen Volcanic Nat’l Park is a good half day excursion if you’re looking for some adventure."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laurel is a great host! She makes sure you feel right at home.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is beyond stellar! Laurel is a lovely host. She even offered a car for us to go into town if we needed. Beautiful scenery, birds to be watched from the patio, and the tiny house was perfect for the two of us. So peaceful."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second time staying here. This place is a perfect getaway to relax
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a treasure high in the hills of Red Bluff. I couldn't have asked for a more comfortable place to rest between legs of a cross country road trip. I will return.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent two peaceful nights in Laurel’s well-equipped and comfortable tiny home. The smell of cedar paneling and buzz of hummingbirds around the outdoor patio/shower was incredible! The interior living area had great AC, windows with views and was more spacious than I imagined!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our second time at Laurel’s tiny home. We come for the outdoor shower! Always a great stay ❤️
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming and comfortable tiny home, with everything you need right at your fingertips. The kitchen is fully stocked and easy to prepare food in, the bathroom is spacious, and my daughter can't wait to go back to spend more time in the loft. Lots of nice touches like the cloth napkins and premium soaps, lotion, and shampoo. The night sky is amazing out in the quiet countryside."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Oh my gosh, such a cute place! The outdoor shower was my favorite! I could hear the birds chirping the whole time while in there! It felt like a movie!

Definitely coming back!"

I was looking for a quiet and peaceful place to relax and this place is exactly what I was looking for. This house is very comfy and was equipped with everything I needed.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Laurel has created a peaceful and relaxing tiny place. Her tiny home has full amenities, plus extras. You will want to set your alarm, because the home is positioned to enjoy a beautiful sunrise. Laurel was born to host."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely stay we had! It is clear that Laurel takes pride in hosting guests. She provided thoughtful touches like the glasses in the freezer and robes to use for showering. The outside shower was a fabulous way to refresh and relax after a long travel day. Laurel was a great communicator and explained everything about the house clearly. The air conditioning worked well considering it was so hot outside and we were very comfortable. I was impressed by the kitchen which had everything we needed to make a delicious dinner. We didn't get the chance to sit outside and enjoy the view because of the heat. We will have to return.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,100% recommend this adorable place. The outside shower was the highlight of the stay. Laurel is amazing and made us feel welcomed.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We have a great stay at Laurel's place. The location is quiet and safe. It is easy to find and not far from Red Bluff and Lassen National Park. It is a place to relax and have a good night of rest.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is super cute. Although it’s tiny, it has everything we needed. We have 2 adults + 2 kids and it fits just perfect. Laurel is a great host and very responsive to messages. She even prepares drinks in the fridge so we feel so welcoming. Will definitely recommend to friends and family for a unique experience :)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Laurel’s place is super cute. We were a family of 2 kids and 2 adults. We fit nicely with many sleeping options. The kitchen is actually very well equipped with an oven and dishwasher. The bathroom was also large for a tiny house. Although some reviews say it’s close to the main house I think it’s positioned well to give you privacy. Laurel is also an excellent host offering marshmallows, setting up our fire pit and some bottles of beer. We visited the nearby Lassen Volcanic Park which was just about an hour drive. There’s also a lot of places to eat in the town of Red Bluff and a Walmart if you forgot something."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laurel is the most amazing host for the tiny house! Wonderful communication, super easy check in. The location is beautiful and the tiny house is perfect! It’s very clean and tidy. Everything we needed was in the tiny house. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying again sometime!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place to stay. All the comforts of home. We weren’t able to enjoy the outside as much due to the time of year but the views and sunrise were stunning. Laurel was a great host.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cute place. It was my first time staying at a tiny home and it was absolutely amazing. Decor and cleanliness was absolutely impeccable. I gave it a four-star just because the Wi-Fi wasn’t working, which is very necessary since our phones weren’t working. We had issues with the showerhead as well. We were never able to figure it out but other than that it was amazing. The bedding is 10 out of 10"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An amazing stay! The tiny house is so cute, cozy & had everything we needed! Would definitely stay again."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely make a reservation for Laurel’s Tiny Home! It’s an absolute gem with gorgeous views.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place where everything is well thought out! Super cute, very worth it."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay at Laurel's tiny house with the incredibly comfy bed and incredibly awesome view. Red Bluff is exactly between Los Angeles and Portland, so if you ever make that trek by car, Laurel's place is the perfect spot to rest for a night."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most beautiful tiny home. Gorgeous views, the perfect get away from city life. The host was so welcoming and accommodating. The stars are gorgeous. My only regret is that I didn’t stay longer"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious tiny home with tall ceilings. Didn’t have to crawl or duck to get into bedroom at all. Plenty of storage. Great layout and easy check in. Very clean and welcoming space.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laurel is a wonderful host. She really provides maximum details to her tiny. The beds and bedding were fabulous! There were some adorable shops in the historical downtown and we found some must haves to take home. I highly recommend staying at Laurels’ tiny.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute tiny home that was able to house 4 adults rather comfortably. Super healing surrounding nature and great place for a short getaway!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything that other guests have noted is accurate- lovely setting, super hospitable host, very well appointed space. I will absolutely be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the third time I stayed at Laurel's tiny house. It is a 10 minute drive off the I-5 freeway to get to it. It is worth it to take the little time to get to this beautiful location. The house is comfortable and everything is well organized.
I recommend it highly. I also suggest that you understand you are not going to want to run into town or go out to eat so much as sink into the place once you get there. So bring your food, take-out, provisions with you with that in mind."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the perfect home away from home getaway. My husband and I loved how cozy and comfortable the tiny house was during our stay. I especially loved the view we had outside. We're definitely going to come back in the near future :)
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laurel's tiny home is just perfect! Every nook and cranny is well thought out. All the finishing touches make this tiny home feel luxurious, without being overdone.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Laurel's tiny house was like a dream come true to me. I always dreamed of experiencing tiny house living and could not have had a better first experience. The place is adorable and has such great energy. I got everything I wanted and more! A perfect getaway to relax and be close to nature. In addition, Laurel is a very sweet person and has two loving dogs that I got a chance to meet as well."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The absolute perfect place to get away to unwind and have total rest and relaxation. Laurel has her tiny home facing beautiful views. The home itself is so pretty with just the right amount of color and attention to detail. Everything you need to be comfortable and feel at home. Her guidebook listed Casa Ramos as a good place to have dinner. We tried it and it did not disappoint. Delicious! Laurel is so friendly and thoughtful she made this trip wonderful for me and my husband! So amazing cannot wait to return! Thank you Laurel!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed. amazing views of sunrise and moonrise ( that's right, we saw the moon rise when sitting at the campfire). loved the bonfire and roasted marshmallows all courtesy of Laurel. Laurel is a great host and always responsive. the house was big enough to accommodate 4 adults and 1 child. You will appreciate every detail that has been taken care of in this house."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As all other reviews mention, Laurel's tiny home is absolutely great! The tiny home has all of the amenities you need and you can tell a lot of thought and work was placed into making sure guests have a great stay. We only stayed one night, but my wife and I can definitely say this was the coziest night we slept on our trip throughout the area. We would definitely recommend and hope to be back in the future!"

We enjoyed Laurels recommendations for dinner and hope to be back again to this cozy home ."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved our stay in the beautiful tiny house. We were there in mid-November, so the ground was green from recent rain, the trees had fall colors, the sunrise was breathtaking, and all other hours enchanting. Wonderful."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this is a very beautiful place...very picturesque. it's to tiny for a family of 5...but anything smaller than that...Stunning.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay with a great host. Would come again!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice palce
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed staying at this house over Mother’s Day weekend. We received entry instructions prior to our arrival and the house is clean and well maintained. We’d definitely stay here again next time we’re in the area to visit relatives.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Instructions were clear and helpful for check in with notes on everything (WiFi, heating/AC, Dishwasher). The place was very clean and cozy, perfect for staying a few nights. Overall me and the other guests were very happy with our stay and would recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot in Red Bluff. The house is very nice, clean, and well styled."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna's place was a great place to spend the night - spacious, clean, with comfy beds and the AC works quickly to keep the whole place nice and cool. We didn't spend much time there but would definitely stay again if we're in the area"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was just as described and cleaned very well when we arrived. The host was extremely flexible with our check in and made it a priority for us to check in earlier than the typical check in time. Would stay here again and suggest this place to anyone looking to stay in Red Bluff.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place and location. Brianna is great to work with and has a nice place with back yard and off street parking
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a clean, cozy home that offered easy check-in and check-out. Brianna was able to accommodate us last minute and prepared the home quickly for our arrival. She was a wonderful host who responds quickly."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Convenient right off the highway. Comfortable. Plenty of space with secure garage or back of house parking. We just stayed one night while driving through but it worked perfectly. If you are a light sleeper there is some street noise as the home is on a main road. But we use some white noise so don’t bother us at all
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Quick trip but worth it! Felt safe and the neighborhood was quiet. Thank you for a great experience.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly what the pictures depicted and it was wonderful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We have previously stayed at Brianna’s other property and loved it, but it wasn’t available for our travel dates so we booked this one and we are so glad we did! It is in a very convenient location on a main road (a bit noisy but not unpleasant and we were prepared for this after reading the reviews) and close to town. The house was clean and beautifully decorated, and very child safe inside due to minimal decor and furniture choices. It had everything we needed, and our young children loved playing in the spacious backyard. It was great to have working AC and heat. Very convenient parking at the back of the house. There is no washer or dryer - we missed this, but it is mentioned on the listing. We will stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the surrounding area
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was great. Would definitely recommend if you're staying in the area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was easy to get to. I noticed somebody said something about the street parking. There’s plenty of room on the side of the street to back into the driveway without being in traffic. The wood floors were super cool the rooms had some very nice touches.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very nice and clean. We felt at home as soon as we walked in. Hosts left very clear instructions making check in and out easy.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, Brianne was extremely helpful, loved my stay, very relaxing."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brianna was very accommodating for our last minute stay. Very helpful and friendly. The house was perfect. Great location and easy to get to . We had a very comfortable stay. Would book again.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here Monday - Friday while in town for a work training. The house was very tidy and we loved the comfortable beds. Large kitchen and living room too! Several fans and AC units throughout the house (we turned on the heat since it was a little cold and the rooms warmed up quickly!). We didn’t have time to enjoy the backyard, but there’s a cute area with lights and a grill.
I would recommend parking behind the house, because if you park in front of the house you have to reverse into a busy street. Finding the parking area behind the house was difficult at night, as the side road isn’t marked. It was somewhat noisy from the road, especially in the front room closet to the street."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. The house was clean and beautiful. The host was responsive and friendly. We will come stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host and stay! Charming older home with thoughtful updates. Host is very responsive and easy to work with!
I would like to see the kitchen be a little better equipped but we managed. Home faces busy street with traffic, not a deal breaker!
Home was clean and comfortable. Heating/air are individual units, not central so it took a bit to warm up the common space.
2nd bathroom under construction at the time of our stay but again, we were able to manage with our family. Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was super cute and tidy. Check in was very easy and the house is in a good location. The beds were comfy and we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was beautiful and I enjoyed my stay. Thank you again Bri for the welcoming stay in your home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay overnight as we were passing through. Super cute aesthetic— vintage yet cozy. The furnishings were comfortable and the home was nice and warm. The bedding was so soft and I was very pleasantly surprised. Would stay here again if in the area. The host let me park in the garage which was the selling point for me as I was moving with all my belongings. 10/10!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value considering the location and house! Brianna is absolutely amazing with communication and very motivated to make your stay great! As mentioned in many reviews, it is located on a busy street. Fortunately with the garage it felt secure. There is a back bedroom which was relatively quiet, but one bedroom is on the street side. The heating system (mini splits) was lovely and effective. We didn’t get to enjoy the outside area due to rainy weather but it looked like it would be nice to enjoy a glass of wine outside in good weather…the bed we slept in was comfortable, albeit firm. The kitchen and bath are both thoughtfully stocked. We will return again on one of our drives between Washington and California."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic, spacious and clean. The kitchen was fine for light cooking. I would suggest coordinating with Brianna for what your specific needs are. I told her we were baking a cake, and she made sure a cake pan was available. I enjoy cooking, and a cutting board and chef knife would have been handy."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay at this Airbnb! We needed a place to stay to visit our grandmother for the night and Brianna was very responsive and accommodating! The place was so clean and cute! We will definitely stay again :)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Brianna home was lovely and felt right at home.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna's place was a perfect stop on a trip toward Southern California. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable. With a full car, it was so nice to have a garage. Everything was as described, good communication, would stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,quite and huge place to stay when you visit lassen and Mt Shasta.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy access, great host, lovely quick stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Charming house. We had a great stay. Host was very responsive. Thanks!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot to stay, and felt very safe! We were on a multi-day roadtrip headed north on I-5, traveling with a small U-Haul truck. I didn't trust staying at a motel with the U-Haul, so I found this Airbnb and I'm grateful I did. Brianna was very accommodating, and we parked the UHaul in the backyard with a locked fence and it was completely out of sight from the road. Our truck was totally safe and I'm glad for the peace of mind! In addition the home was extremely clean, comfortable, and Brianna was easy to reach and quick to respond."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,always a perfect place to land for a few days!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Brianna’s house was absolutely wonderful. It has been nicely updated but still kept the classic bungalow feel. Centrally located to downtown and walking distance to Starbucks. It is located in a busy street but you would never know it from inside because it was so quiet. We stayed four nights with two small children and felt right at home. Absolutely will be staying here again on our next trip to Red Bluff! Highly recommend
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great, well kept house! Had a very restful stay here. Will absolutely stay again if in the area for work or passing through. Brianna was an excellent host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A really nice house and area to stay. we only passed through for a night on our way to Yosemite but it was very comfortable, clean and easy to find and get into. host was responsive and had all we needed."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Needed to find a 1 night, same-day accommodation as my travel plans had suddenly changed. Found this lovely airbnb, with front and back parking. We made it after dark so it was a little tricky finding the street access to the parking behind the house, but once we did everything was good! Loved the house! You can tell a lot of thought went to each room and the overall mood of the spaces. Home had everything we needed to relax and unwind before continuing our travels the next day. Very happy to have found it, would definitely come back again!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is easy to find, right off the freeway and close to gas stations, food and Starbucks. The house was extremely clean and it felt like home. I'd definitely stay there again if I was in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy access, spacious and comfortable!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying here. A lovely and clean house with a nice, responsive host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was fantastic. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were driving back home after a long trip, so only spent one night. Had a nice restful stay. Beds were comfortable, big complete kitchen. We particularly liked having a garage to keep the car since we were traveling with kayaks and car full of gear.
We would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for our quick stay. Extremely clean and comfortable. Super comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brianna was an amazing host who went above and beyond in every way! We ran into car trouble while passing through the Redding area and needed a place to stay last minute. When I reached out to Brianna, she responded within minutes. She was extremely flexible, understanding and accommodated our needs on very short notice. The house was exactly as described/pictured, great value, and we felt right at home there. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and we appreciated the ample parking areas. As other people have noted, it is on a main road. We were a bit worried about that at first but it ended up being perfectly fine! If you’re planning to park in the back of the house I would recommend getting there in the daylight the first time. Brianna’s instructions were very clear and accurate, but we arrived after dark so it was a little hard to see where to turn in. I would absolutely stay here again and would definitely recommend yo do too!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic AirBnB. It is roomy, beautiful, and well decorated on the inside. There is a large patio in the back and offers a wide array of amenities. It seems secure with a lot of security devices installed on the outside of the house."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic place. Very easy to find and check in and very comfortable. Great for groups
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Have stayed in multiple house by this host. Love everything about her homes. Her decor and small touches are lovely. Response time is phenomenal.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Brianna’s was amazing. The home felt safe and secure, and the interior was already cooled for our entry. The pads provided in the bathrooms were a lifesaver for my wife. We would definitely book again when we’re back in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Close to everything. Spacious and comfortable!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very good experience!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,LOVED this place! would Definitely recommend it for a nice comfortable stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Brianna’s beautiful and pristine home! The space has a garage and back driveway for your car as well as a backyard patio to enjoy, and the inside spaces were as pictured. The rooms cooled down once we turned on the AC units. Brianna’s instructions were clear. We slept in the back bedroom and we’re not bothered by the highway noise."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place. clean comfy and easy to find.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a nice, comfortable break from hotel hoping while we traveled through northern Cali! Easy to get to with being on the main road, while still being tucked in a nice neighborhood! Close to grocery stores & restaurants. Brianna communicated with us well & the pack-n-play she offered came in handy!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is beautiful and cozy. Wish we could have enjoyed the back area but it was too hot for us to be outside. Just a bummer it’s right on the highway, but made it an easy walk for coffee in the morning."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna’s place was a good stop over spot for us driving down to San Diego from Seattle. Having AC in the two bedrooms and dinning/lounge is a must during very hot summers, and they we on with ceiling fans going ensuring the house was very cool
Being able to bring our car into the garage with a nice added benefit so we could leave all the items in there without unpacking
Getting in was easy, house was clean, beds comfy, fridge was big and helpful
Thanks 🙏🏽"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay for a girls weekend and isn’t a far drive from some great hiking areas!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute place... very homey. Would recommend to anyone. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for one night on a long road trip up I-5. Our host was accommodating of family of young children and helped us by setting up a pack and play. The house was super convenient, clean, well kept up and nicely decorated. We appreciated it wasn’t far from a Starbucks in the morning so we could grab breakfast on our way out of town. We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean place, and very nice host.😍"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one day on our way to Lassen national park. The place is clean, convenient, and has plenty to offer."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Brianna was a great host! The house was beautiful and she was very responsive during our stay. The location is convenient to grocery stores and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Breanna was a good communicator. Her place was very clean and as described. We had everything we needed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, hospitable space, helpful host who provided clear instructions. Recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We arrived in Red Bluff from out of town to attend a funeral and our previous rental cancelled our reservation last minute so we had no where to stay. I connected with Brianna explained our situation and she went above and beyond for us and got us right in. Her home is absolutely beautiful, clean, and has a very at home feeling about it. She is definitely worth the five star rating!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my second time staying at one of Brianna’s places since I had such a great experience the first time. Her place is beautifully decorated, she stocks her fridge and pantry with extra items in case you need something and the place was spacious and sparkling clean. I appreciated all the little touches that made this location homey. Brianna is also very kind and responsive. I will continue to book her properties when I pass through Red Bluff."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The most impeccably clean property we have ever stayed . . . nice boho/Anthropologie decor vibes. The private parking was very convenient. Great location for Lassen Volcanic NP. Very helpful, communicative host."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Good stay for the night. The beds were okay and the bathroom/kitchen were very clean. Having a garage was extremely helpful! The house was really warm when we arrived after dark, but there are fans and AC units in the bedrooms. The home is close to the freeway - a plus if this is just a quick stay for the night, but a downside if you are sensitive to hearing traffic drive by at night or in the morning. I couldn't find coffee/cream which is usually a common amenity, but not a make-break for us. Overall, an okay place and I wouldn't mind staying another night in the middle of a trip!
Wifi was decent, at about 500 mbps download speed and 20 mbps upload speed, which was a plus for our work project."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, beautifully decorated lovely home in a great location."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for an overnight in Red Bluff. House was spacious with a good layout. Had everything we needed and a bit more!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was great, right off the freeway practically!!! Near gas stations and very quiet neighborhood. Very clean and comfy beds. Great Communication from Brianna.. within 20 min or less, she responds. Thank you Brianna! Will definitely be referring you to my family when they travel from Idaho!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a pleasant stay. Clear instructions. Close to Lassen National Park. Marketplace is nearby.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house has a sense of design, but the lighting is a little dark at night.The room by the road was not too noisy at night and I slept well.Nice stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna provided a beautiful, comfortable, relaxing place for us to stay and was so easy to get a hold of for any instructions or assistance! After our wonderfully simple checkout we drove 3 minutes down the road to one of the best breakfasts we’ve had in a long time at Rockin’ R Restaurant. A truly lovely and memorable experience!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our event was at the fairgrounds. The location was perfect. The backyard came in super handy with 2 toddlers. They were able to play and run in a safe enclosed space. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Definitely staying again on our next trip
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for the night. Clean and quaint!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Matched the description! Very positive stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful home and was exactly as described. Definitely worth the price paid but I would not say this is completely child friendly. If you stay here with kids I’d just do a quick sweep to proof it before letting a child of “running around” age loose. Other than that, Brianna was very responsive and she took great care of us, I’d for sure stay again if in the area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is very nice and accommodating. We felt right at home. Beds were comfy and the towels were soft. My Wife’s favorite part was the shower. Centrally located. Would definitely stay again.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly as described!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this house on short notice, and I had a unique request due to my traveling circumstances and Brianna went above and beyond to accommodate my request at the last minute. I really appreciated it! The house was charming and cute, and it is well represented by the photos. Very clean too! One of the mattresses was especially comfortable (firm but with a thin top layer of softness), so much so that I took I photo of the tag because I may want to buy myself one in the future. Very good value overall!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderfully place to stay in Red Bluff. Thank you so much!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and cozy! Just as the pictures, cute style with plenty of room."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our toddler had probably the best nights sleep she’s ever had in the very cozy bed off the side of the living room. Cozy heating/cooling in each room. Beautiful house, beautiful floors, reasonable price, accurate description, sweet touches. We were able to make a hearty and nourishing breakfast from eggs in the fridge and pancake mix in the cupboard. Nothing was expired and it was clear that supplies are checked regularly. The only reason for slight drop in stars was the closeness to Highway (although nice fenced off backyard if you have littlest or pets) and it was a bit of a challenge finding the driveway in the night (neither of which are the hosts fault). Oh, and because we have babes, a bathtub would have been great but we made the beautiful shower work. Definitely would stay here again!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Well decorated place. Beds are very comfortable and the house is clean and spacious.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,comfortable place to spend the night. slept very well!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. It was clean and a great atop on our way to Oregon. The front door want usable (got stuck) so needed to use the back door which was fine. We were able to walk to nearby restaurants.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a beautiful home and perfect!! Loved everyday I was there and she was great and helpful for anything I needed:)
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location right off the freeway. House was very clean and comfortable.
Host was responsive and easy to communicate with. We hope to stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brianna was an excellent host! She went above and beyond to make sure I had everything for my stay. She even got me situated to make sure I had enough dishes to meal prep for my work week. I travel to Red bluff for work every other month and will be staying at one of Brianna’s locations each time!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute home with modern touches along with rustic charm. Super clean and spacious. My daughter loved the back yard basketball hoop. The house had everything we needed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"It is a cute place, very neat and clean, with a convenient location. The host was very responsive, the check-in/out and parking situation was excellent.
Would highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"Brianna was a great hostess. She was good at communicating. There was some food for us to use while we were there. Very helpful! Cute decorations. Everything we needed.
The house is on the main road, and it is busy with traffic during the day, but things quiet down nicely at night. We liked that we could park 2 cars in the back.
Great stay! Everyone in our group liked the place!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was PHENOMENAL!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely be bringing myself and my team back to stay here when we are traveling. This was nothing short of PHENOMENAL!!!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is EXACTLY what I want in an Airbnb. It was spacious, very clean, organized, cute, cozy, soft bedding, and a great bathroom. While the location is on a main road, it feels set back enough and that main road access makes it so easy to get anywhere quickly. I would definitely stay again and hope to!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house in a convenient location! We’ve stayed at another spot of Brianna’s before when visiting family and both were perfect!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pleasant overnight stay in a spotlessly clean and newly renovated property.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is on one of Red Bluff's main roads so there is traffic noise. We actually slept in the back bedroom which did soften the sounds. The home was simply furnished and easy to find. It provided us with the space and most of the amenities we needed. I found the bed comfortable. Perhaps it's my older eyes, but the lighting in the living room was extremely dim. Overall, it was a good place for our extended stay (5 nights)."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. It’s on a busy road, but the back entrance makes it easy to get in and out. The two main bedrooms are nice and large and have their own temperature controls. Kitchen has the basics needed. Bathroom has been nicely updated. Restaurants and grocery stores not far away. Perfect location if you’ll be spending time at the fairgrounds."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had an amazing stay at Brianna's place! The house was super cozy and in a great location in town. Brianna stayed in contact with us to help with anything we needed. She was a total sweetheart and very professional! We can't wait to come back and stay at her place again! hopefully, soon! Thank you for everything!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a beautiful place, with decorations that make it feel like home. The location was perfect for us, and with Brianna’s detailed directions we were able to find it with a breeze. We greatly appreciated how clean this space was, how quickly Brianna responded to our messages, and how comfortable the beds were!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and cozy. Looked exactly like pictures, felt like home during our stay. Host was responsive and friendly. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful home. Brianna was helpful
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Brianna is a wonderful host. The house was exactly as shown in the photos, beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was spotlessly clean. (The entire house was very clean!) We really enjoyed our time in this house with the wood floors and charming atmosphere. We hope to return and stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome and the host is great! Couldn’t be happier with how it all worked out!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband, dog and I stayed here on our move down to Berkely from Seattle. The host was friendly and communicative, and even allowed us to sleep in/check out an hour later since we got to the bnb so late. House was clean and cute, and had a nice little back yard with a fire pit. Highly recommend this spot!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was filming a wedding in Redding and needed a place to stay for the night. Brianna's listing was perfect for me and my team. The beds were comfy and having a ceiling fan in every bedroom was nice. Very clean and homey. She was very responsive throughout the whole process and I would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was great. Our group was very grateful for the opportunity to book. Would book again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were a last minute stay at this perfect Airbnb. We flew into Sacramento, and we picked a place on the map to shave off some drive time for the next day to Redwood National Forest. Some people complained about no natural light, but that was perfect for us and our two small children. The bed was comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed for our short stay. She even had complimentary coffee and some oatmeal that my toddler enjoyed. Very safe area in a cute town! The only suggestion I have is possibly let her know what time you’ll arrive, so she can turn on the AC. It was warm when we got there, and it took about 1-2 hours to cool off, but once it did, it was perfect."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience and great value!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, I always stay here when I’m in town visiting family."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place in Red Bluff! I would definitely stay here again!!! Clean, looks exactly like the photos. All the little extra details are wonderful!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here on our visit to Lassen, NP. Read a few reviews and were a bit hesitant before booking. Now that we’ve stayed there, saw how much thought, consideration and love went into making a beautiful, spacious and comfortable place to stay, we’re so glad we did!
We had ZERO issues with the water getting hot (as mentioned in another review) and no issues with water pressure (which had also been noted in another review) heard no noise, at all!
Considering the cost, the spacious size of apartment and its convenient location and cute little town, we would not hesitate to stay again or recommend friends and family to stay.
Quite pleased all the way around!
So thankful for hosts like these folks who make beautiful spaces for travelers. Loved it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here! Beautiful place and worth every penny.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Minor noise from other guests the first night but still very nice place. Enjoyed walking around the area and exploring different places.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay for a weekend getaway!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at Audrey’s place. Great little place, a street from downtown Main St."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is cute and quaint and sits in the heart of historic Red Bluff. We stayed with two small kids and had no issues, however if you chose to do what we did be prepared for the stairs and loading and unloading with kids 😅 The place is accurately described and the decor is perfect. Only other suggestion is if you stay for long periods of time just know that there is little to no natural light since it’s a loft in a historic building. Some light peaks through the kitchen window, but after 4 days I was confused what time of day it was when I woke up. No fault of the description or the hosts! Just be prepared! The snacks were a nice welcome gift and my two year old was exciteded about the oranges!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay I love red bluff and thank you to the host definitely will be back soon!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a really cute older apartment. Worth climbing the stairs to get to. It's beautifully decorated and very clean. The only downside I could say would be that the hot water takes forever to come out. It was quiet and easy to check in and out. We enjoyed our stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I thought this airbnb was one of the nicest of decors I've seen. Beautifully decorated, spacious rooms, inviting and calming colors, high ceilings. The sheets on the bed were soft and warm. There were treats, extra toiletries. Night lights in a few of the rooms. My husband and I walked in and said, ""Wow""! We would definitely stay there again. My only regret was that we weren't there longer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are a lot of great things about this cute little Airbnb. It’s as cute as the pictures make it seem. Everything is comfortable, there are cute touches everywhere and amenities that make your stay easy and comfortable. Great towels, linens, snacks, coffee, portable heaters (because the floor heater isn’t great) and it’s all very clean.
However there are a couple things to note - the kitchen water pressure is super weak, so washing dishes takes a bit. There are children neighbors (or other guests) who run and scream in the echoey hallway, kids being kids, but during the day you can totally hear it.
Lastly, this one is just weird and while it didn’t bother me, I do know people who would have immediately left once they found out… there aren’t any windows that open. Really, there aren’t really any windows at all. They are all boarded up and painted to look like wall. There are TONS of mirrors in this place, which almost make you not notice there aren’t windows. The one piece of gl"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Recently stayed here and had such a nice time. The unit was clean, cozy, and we loved the complimentary snacks and drinks! Worth every penny, will definitely stay here again! And Julie was very responsive and friendly, which I appreciate so much! Awesome getaway."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Lots of homey touches - interesting decor, clean, games, large TVs, an amazing spread of snacks, etc. Inexpensive but they try to make it feel nice given the building it’s in. Great communication from the host. Lovely budget Airbnb!
Cons:
One of the most firm beds ever. Felt like a box spring. Didn’t really have basic essentials like olive oil. The photos look like there’s two windows, but there’s only one that looks out into the stairwell area and can’t be opened. Not a big deal but I did see that this place is listed as having no carbon monoxide detector. So if you’re cooking, or if you’re Covid-aware and want to ventilate the unit, you can’t.
Some things they can’t control but you should be aware of:
The complex is very old, dusty, and common areas could use a facelift. There’s no lock to get into the complex. Downtown is pretty desolate But it’s in the process of beautifying. The doorway is old so the one lock didn’t really feel secure."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was beautiful and clean and in a great location
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment! Spacious and well equipped, beautiful design, old architecture with high ceiling is a plus! Would definitely come back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was cozy, quiet and amazing! I would recommend to this spot to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for our stay!! it was so much better than we had expected. there was little cereal boxes and oatmeal to make in the kitchen and fresh milk and bananas. felt very welcoming :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice enough, it’s an old apartment, probably built in the 1910’s or 20’s. Good for us, we like that. Very spacious! 12’ ceilings. It’s a rental, so cabinets and fixtures are not of the highest quality, but at least everything was prett new and not run down. Everything was clean, decor and furniture was good. Entry area was a bit run down, a little freshening up would help the ambiance. Audrey did a great job with little touches that are very much appreciated. All in all, we were happy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place felt very welcoming as soon as we walked through the door. It was clean and well stocked. The refreshments Audrey had was a nice touch!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great for a one-night stop even more .. thanks for everything
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Audrey’s place was lovely! It seemed more spacious than in the photos. Very polite and responsive host! Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Audrey and her Co-Host Julie were amazing! Communication was quick, detailed, and friendly. The space was very comfortable, homey, and had everything we could have wanted for a relaxing weekend. The main strip is a block away and a quick walk. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host and a good, clean apartment."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place reminded my wife and I of our first apartment, but with updated interior and better layout. The building is very old and quirky. Lots of changes to the structure in it's over 100 years on the planet.
The building entry doors didn't have functioning locks, but each unit felt very secure, though there was evidence of attempted break-ins. We felt plenty safe though. Place was super clean throughout. Really appreciated that.
Our kids loved the snacks that were provided and really helped our road trip get off to a great start. The AC absolutely handled the local weather highs (I used to spend summers in nearby Redding and had feared any place we chose would just have an old swamp cooler or barely functioning window units). Frosty and chill all night even though night time temps never went below 80 outside. My wife would have preferred a softer mattress. I have to admit it was the absolute hardest mattress I've ever slept on, but I slept easy.
We would happily stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very responsive hosts.
About the place: here are the pros and cons.
Pros:
- Well decorated
- very clean
- fully stocked kitchen and bathroom
- very responsive host
- high speed Wi-Fi
- 2 smart TVs with Netflix included
- board games
Cons:
- street parking only. And that has a 2hr limit during the day (8am-6pm or so)
- the main entrance to the building does not have a deadbolt or a lock meaning anyone can enter anytime.
- unit is in the second floor , no elevator. So suitcases have to be carried (25 steps)
- no dishwasher
- there are only 2 window ACs - one in the living room and another in the kitchen. No AC in the bedroom
- no windows in the house. No exhaust in the bathroom
- unit is in a dated building in downtown.
Overall, it was worth the nightly rate at $80."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super chic place to stay in Red Bluff! Audrey accommodated every need. And the space…. Oh, the space has a great vibe for relaxation. Linens, blankets kitchen & bathroom showed personal touches that are above expectations!

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Chet's home was spacious and had all the amenities we needed. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. I agree with the last review that the decor was a bit funky for us but it was shown in the listing photos so I knew what to expect. The rolling green hills and oak lined roads were just beautiful. Dibble Creek Outpost is right next door and was the perfect spot to eat after a longs days work in Red Bluff.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family of 6 had plenty of space and the place is pretty private with only a couple of houses visible from the front deck. The decor and paint scheme is a little funky but, our family really liked it and it fit our needs perfectly. If you visit, be sure to go to the Dibble Creek Outpost for a meal! Great food, good portions and excellent service!!"

My friends and I had a wonderful stay here! Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My father in law lives in Red Bluff and staying at Chet’s place when visiting has been a lifesaver. Much better than a hotel.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If your looking to be away from everyone and enjoy some quite. This house would be it, it’s a roomie house with a beautiful outside view.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A large, comfortable home a few miles outside of town in Red Bluff, CA. Lovely grounds, views, and porch for relaxing on. We were only 2 guests but it would be a wonderful spot for a family or larger group holiday. Chet went above and beyond to stock the place - it was really like a fully furnished home, with coffee, tea, etc. and snacks. We stayed there to hike at Lassen Volcanic National Park (~1 hour 15min drive to the visitor center) and also stopped off at Burney Falls State Park."

My favorite detail of the house was the soaking tub in the master bedroom. The beach vibes in there made it more relaxing for me.

The kitchen was very easy to navigate. My little one enjoyed having smart TV apps to watch before bed. Family friendly, we enjoyed our stay ."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was exactly what I was looking for. Very secluded and more open than I expected because I wasn’t aware of the property size from the pictures. Large home inside with great heating system that kept me warm in cold weather. The sky is blanketed in stars at night and downtown red bluff is less than 10 minutes down highway 36.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful place to stay with all the comforts of home. The street is about as charming as I've ever seen. There is some subtle noise from a nearby train at times that could be a problem for very light sleepers, but with some white noise I was just fine."

I loved both the decoration and the size of the home, especially the yard. It was very spacious and fairly priced.

I highly recommend booking this stay for anyone visiting Red Bluff!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"i found brianna’s place a day before we left for red bluff and she was so accommodating. we drove 8 hrs and she allowed us to checkin a couple hours early— which was really gracious of her. the neighborhood is SO peaceful and the streets lined with the most beautiful 100 year old trees and homes dating back into the 1800-1900 was very interesting and charming. the minute we entered the house, we were smitten & pleased. the place is just amazing. spacious and well decorated, clutter free which i really need. i saw the review about the noise of the train passing through, but honestly - it wasn’t even a nuisance nor did it feel like it was close by, and it didn’t rattle the house one bit. i kinda enjoyed hearing it pass by twice during my stay- i would recommend this place to anyone who is still up on the fence about it. it was a really nice experience and i would return again if i was ever to stay in red bluff again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I've stayed at Brianna's Airbnb before so was delighted to stay again on my long drives between Central California and South coast Oregon.

2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This may not bother a lot of people but the house does smell musty. We have to be very careful about this because my husband has severe asthma and he did get an asthma attack. The house is located about 4 blocks from a train track and trains passed several times day and night. The kitchen is very nicely done and easy to work in. Great appliances.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a very long drive, it was great to sit on the front porch to relax listening to the breeze caress the sycamore trees that line this historic street. Everything was perfect and we will stay here again if possible."

Overall very pleased with the stay and sort of wish it could have been longer!"

I highly recommend staying for a long weekend here!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this place and Brianna was very helpful and responsive. The beds are comfortable, kitchen was amazing, loved the tub in the master bath.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Just stayed for a night on the way home to Oregon. It was pouring rain,so we did not check out the backyard. Brianna let me check in early. There were generators that started up next door at 8am which broke the peace,but for our one night, it was fine."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna was a caring and attentive host, and her space was beautifully decorated with modern comfort, historical significance, spectacular artwork, and positive messages, books, and magazines for an overall delightful experience. I especially loved the deep old fashioned tub for soaking after a long drive, meditation cushion in front of a full length mirror for my morning practice and the lemon tree out front. Our morning neighborhood walk of the mature trees and Victorian Homes Tour in late fall was divine. This is is a special place for sure, so deeply grateful she shared it with us."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cozy and in a beautiful neighborhood. Felt right at home during our stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and quiet home in a convenient location. The house was equipped with everything we needed - pots/pans, utensils, toiletries (e.g., shampoo, conditioner, etc.), extra heaters and fans, etc. The layout was also nice and esp. with a toddler running around, I appreciated the openness and comfortable furniture and décor. We didn't spend that much time in the sunroom or yard bc of the weather/temperatures, but they were cute additional spaces. It was our first time traveling with our toddler and Brianna was so responsive to my questions, even going so far as to measure the provided pack and play for me (this was above and beyond!). Check-in and house entry was seamless. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brianna’s Victorian has quickly become my favorite place to stay when visiting family and friends.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Brianna's historic home while working in Red Bluff for a couple days. It was a roomy little house that is so cute, and the neighborhood where it is at is full of amazing Victorians. A slice of the good old days when houses were not cookie cutter! With exception of the train in the distance now and then, it was incredibly quiet at night! The house had a problem with the water heater and Brianna was very communicative and gracious in coming to a resolution for me. I was there for only one night but it is the type of house and neighborhood that made me wish I had time to sit out on the porch enjoying coffee in the morning or a glass of wine at night. Maybe next time!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Arrived late and left early but enjoyed our stay. Lovely house in a cute neighborhood. Great communication and easy check in.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brianna is truly an amazing host. Every amenity we could have for a comfortable stay was provided. The airbnb is beautifully decorated, modern, and homey. Brianna responded immediately to every question and provided recommendations in the town, which is only a few blocks away. Of all airbnb's in the area, this one is, by far, the best bang for your buck and you will truly enjoy your stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay. Beautiful home. Beautiful neighborhood. Very clean. Very comfortable. You can tell the attention to detail on the decor. Great value. Would definitely book again if in the area. Highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I took a spontaneous couple's trip here and absolutely loved it. The house was located in a great area- only a two minute drive away from downtown and less than 10 minute walking. The neighborhood was really quiet and beautiful as well. We arrived on a 90 degree day, but the house was well cooled. The AC worked perfectly and the house was at a very comfortable temperature throughout our stay. But the best perk for me was that the TV worked great and had a lot of different streaming services for movies, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything in the house was extremely comfortable in fact. Even though we only stayed for a night we had an amazing time- we felt like we were staying in an actual home instead of a rented out room/house. And the host, Brianna, was super easy to get a hold of and book with. She even helped me rebook my reservation when I booked for the wrong amount of people, and gave me dinner recommendations for places in town! Overall, I would highly recommend this place. It's great for short and longer stays as it's a decent amount of space, very comfortable, and close to everything you need in town. If you're thinking about it, definitely book it and have a great time!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brianna's place is amazing and charming. We enjoyed it a lot and will choose her again when we visit Red Bluff. I wish great experiences to all future guests !!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an adorable and well-maintained little historical house! So cozy and comfortable. Great value for the price. Only two drawbacks: It's close to the train track and there is some train horn noise at night and in the early morning. Also, it would be nice to have air conditioning in the bedrooms (it is only in the main room), but the extra fans in the closet do help. All in all a great stay, and we would definitely come again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at this beautiful home. Has everything you need to perform with plenty of space. We were there on a weekend that it got up to 108 degrees. Thank god for Brianna’s powerful air conditioning that we had to look forward to. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay again.

Great location centrally located near the post office and within walking distance to just about everything. Love the vibe and feel of this place. Just don’t be afraid of having to walk up a somewhat daunting set of stairs from off the street up to the main hallway of the complex.
Julie’s loft is very relaxing once inside and easy to check in. The layout feels good and the teal color scheme sets a very chill vibe.

Just needed a quick place to crash so can’t comment on the location or options around town…it was a bit tricky to find the door to the condo in the dark - it’s not lit.

This marvelously old building appealed to my deep sense & respect of m/for history, & while the 22 stairs up to the flat may not be for everyone, I felt completely at home & wasn’t sure how or why I’d ever leave! Julie had absolutely EVERYthing in every room that one might need. I cannot wait to go back 🫶🏽"

It was really nice to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants downtown. It’s not the most toddler-safe (lots of easy to reach cabinets and large mirrors leaned against walls without being secured) but it’s small enough that it was easy to keep a close eye on the little one and make sure she didn’t get into too much trouble! :) All in all, a beautiful little apartment that we highly recommend!"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was very helpful, the rooms were clean, and it was more than just a loft or a studio. It actually had four rooms: a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Although there was no central heat, they were a number of radiators throughout the apartment. She also kindly had earplugs in the top drawer of the night tables in case the night time trains posed any noise issues for guests. The linens, duvet, and towels were plentiful."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a really good value for a place to stay in downtown Red Bluff. The unit is pretty large and older with lots of character. Julie provided a selection of treats and food items, and the kitchen is well stocked for cooking. Internet service was good and the TV has a variety of streaming services. Like most places I have stayed in Red Bluff the trains run frequently through town and do make some noise. There is also some traffic noise from the fairly busy street below, but for the price I was willing to put up with a few annoyances. Overall this was a nice comfortable place to stay in a lively area with nearby restaurants and bars."

Right in the middle of downtown so everything is in walking distance. We were lucky to stay on Farmer’s Market Wednesday! Julie is quickly responsive answering questions, too. You won’t be disappointed if you have the chance to stay here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place overall. Such a welcoming home place and would defiantly recommend to anybody.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely flat with comfortable living room in the center of town. Nicely furnished with attention to detail.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness of the unit; the ample linens; towels; free refreshments; and how well put together the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room were. It's a comfortable setting with just about everything you need.
Just a heads up there is a nearby train track with trains passing through and their horns can get pretty loud.
Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie’s apartment was very cute and pleasant to stay in!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place does not disappoint. It’s feels very home like. The bed is so comfortable it made it hard to get out of. The decor fits very nicely with this place. Overall I had a wonderful time here and would recommend this place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie is easy to get ahold of. Place is safe and secure. Very comfortable. I’m a travel healthcare worker and it feels like home away from home. My first choice every trip ❤️
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location downtown!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect half way stop-over between Olympia, WA and Anaheim CA. We found a healthy restaurant just down the street and we enjoyed walking around the interesting neighborhoods. The place was very shabby-Chik and we the retro feel. Julie the host was a great communicator - everything was smooth and easy. We hope to get a chance to stay hear again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect place to rest after an extremely long drive. Julie’s communication is on point and she is a very generous and understanding person. I was only needed a place to rest my head for a couple hours but once I entered Julie’s place, I wished I could have stayed longer. Everything is clean, neat, well organized, and well stocked (we really enjoyed the decorations and colors schemes as well). Located in downtown area, we arrived and it looked very very empty in town. The address provided leads you right to the front door to the building. If you arrive when the sun is down, the lights from the room are on so you know exactly where it is. Check in was easy and efficient. We slept very well and did not hear much noise from the street even though it is in the downtown area on a Saturday night and Sunday morning. Overall I would recommend staying here for a good experience."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place is amazing, loved the downtown view, we loved our time in this place, the apartment is very well organized, you can see the effort and the love Julie put into it. And she is very kind, she provided the snacks for us, and we sure had our go at them! You won’t regret it, book it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding location and decoration…..convenient and stylish. Had a good night there on my road trip, will back again, thanks"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy place! Enjoyed all the amenities! Would stay here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little condo for our overnight in Red Bluff. Julie was a great host.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie was great and she really made the unit was so charming with the tall ceilings. I’ll stop thru again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sick little apartment
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was super cute and well located! The snacks/breakfast in the kitchen were a nice touch, too. Thank you!
We let Julie know that the kitchen and bathroom could use a good cleaning and she was responsive and let us know she would address these items for her next guests.
On the other hand, the bed was spotless clean! We also didn’t have any trouble parking or getting in, so we appreciated the detailed instructions she gave us. Thanks for a lovely stay, Julie!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place loved everything!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, comfortable, clean. Has all the necessities. Great location! Be prepared to walk up 25 stairs in a steep stairwell!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location right in the middle of town. Comfortable and relaxing. Julie was easy to get ahold of for anything. Little things like snacks an other things left for us. The thought was very sweet. Thank you again Julie we will definitely stay again
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here. I was so tired from a long drive. Julie is very sweet and responsive. The building has a kind old Red Bluff historic feel. I was surprised at how many little extra details came with the rental. Snacks, so many pillows, and many streaming services. Nice area. Pretty low key and safe. I will stay again on my drive back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great location for a great price
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an excellent stay at Julie's place in Red Bluff. The first thing I noticed was the effort and home feel of the rooms, as all the decor is aesthetically matched and well placed. The loft is very comfortable even in 100F weather as there is a newer AC unit for the living room, as well as one for the bedroom. I kept the bedroom one on at night and closed the door, which was very effective! I also appreciated the light blocking curtains, as there is a large window right by the toilet. Keep in mind that the location is very centrally located, so there is some car and train noise at night, but it really did not affect me too much as I stayed weekday nights, so I would guess weekends are busier.
Lassen is only an hour away, and after a day of hiking, this is definitely the place to relax and spend the night. Julie is also very friendly, communicative, and accommodating. I can tell she really puts effort into making the place comfortable, clean, and classy. There were many snacks and refreshments, and I helped myself to the water and juice in the fridge, saving me a trip to the grocery store!
All in all, I had an amazing stay and would definitely recommend Julie's spot in Red Bluff!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my home away from home while supporting my mom in the hospital. Thanks!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place is very charming and we enjoyed staying there while we were visiting family. It has a great location, a little noise at night but nothing too bad."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great centrally located loft that had great amenities and was super clean. Close to restaurants and a short walk from a beautiful Victorian section of town. Minutes from I-5. Recommended for budget travel that is easy to get to. Julie is a great host and communicated extremally well.
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It was a decent experience for us. Most of the things were fine except some clogging issues in the bathtub. Apartment was kept clean. It would have been nice if there was a facility for clothes ironing.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was cute and served it’s purpose perfect for me. Julie was accommodating with water and snacks already in the unit. Also, Julie communicated effectively and made the process easy for me."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute loft! check-in and out was a breeze, and the loft was very clean and well put together! She was very responsive and easy to communicate with. We only stayed for a night, but it has all the necessities for a longer stay as well. Would stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,cute and centrally located.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The loft has all amenities you would need. Comfy couch. The bed was perfect for us for a good night sleep. Definitely would come back.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,You can use my private review on for this as well!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stay for our one night stop in Red Bluff. The house was so clean and felt very homey. We had everything we needed. Julie really puts a lot of small touches that make you feel so comfortable. The bed and couch were extremely comfy as well!! Check in was seamless and Julie’s response time is so quick which was reassuring. Definitely would recommend and stay again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Good location. Street noise can be a bit loud at times. Easy check in and out.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place was great for our quick getaway. Fun and artsy style, full kitchen and not too far from outdoor activities."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Can’t wait to visit again
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The decor is amazing and such a great way to get the comforts of home when traveling. She goes out of her way to make sure your happy!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very charming and had everything we needed. It’s beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The outside of the building looks old and so it was a great to see how nice it was inside. There was a little street noise, which wasn’t very bad, and the train going by all night. We were fine with it, but if you want absolute peace and quiet this downtown location won’t work for you."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie’s place is in the perfect location and the decor is really cute. The snacks and other touches were appreciated. I’d definitely stay there again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Julie's place was great! Just what I was needing, a clean sweet space to rest my head on a quick stopover. The bed is a dream. Thanks, Julie!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, clean and centrally located to downtown Red Bluff. walking distance to great food, local shops and post office.
My partner and I loved the sound of the train at night."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's apartment is the perfectly place for a little getaway. The space was clean, well-stocked, and very cozy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice little apartment in a good location downtown. The place is clean, well-stocked and Julie was attentive to my messages throughout my stay. I also appreciated the snacks that she left in the apartment. I would certainly stay here again."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place worked out well when I couldn’t find a place closer to Lassen.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute stay, nice sheets, clean, and convenient location."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved the homey feel to it. Restaurants close by for food. Also not far from the 5. Only 30 minutes to Redding and other things as well. Well worth and loved my stay. The extra goodies she leaves was extra thoughtful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is the most amazing hostess. She goes above and beyond for her guests, she did for us.
I arrived late, she had juices, milk, honey buns, cupcakes, apples, bananas, cereal both hot and cold, coffee, creamer, and hot chocolates and a sparkling cider.
She made my trip possible and my kids really happy by having this place for us to use so we can be together. The apartment, is quiet other than some street traffic, its cozy, warm and clean. the best place to stay."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We were slightly cold all night so definitely be prepared for that! And you can literally hear everything that goes on outside, the windows are very thin..That is the only reason I gave 4 stars though. Other that that It was a great place to stay for the night while passing through! there was a very beautiful Mural of Luis Armstrong that you could see from the bathroom of the airbnb as well."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very charming apartment, cozy and clean! Extremely good communication from host. If you’re a light sleeper, consider bringing earplugs due to traffic noise and nearby bar."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Julie has done a great job of providing everything needed for a comfortable stay in the apartment! Everything was clean, welcoming and well-stocked. We appreciated the snacks and breakfast items that she left.
It's kinda cool that the unit is above a storefront. The stairs are somewhat long and steep, but there's a handrail and non-slip treads. The unit is in a downtown area and not far from some railroad tracks so be sure to bring your white noise or earplugs. The trains run throughout the night. White noise really helped to block it out.
Understand that the unit is in an old building, so everything in the structure isn't pristine, but the character gives it a cool historic vibe and Julie has furnished it with everything new. We walked to a great place to pick up dinner. The location was perfect for our trip to Lassen National Park, only about an hour away. We would definitely stay again if we're in the area."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Don’t expect to much. There are nicer places but this worked in the spur of the moment. There was ALOT of traffic noise that made it very hard to sleep. Also definitely NOT 5star but clean and safe feeling.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little flat
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute little space with everything you need. I liked the layout and location, reminded me of living in the city with the apartment above stores like that and the main road right there. The building itself was rather quiet but I did enjoy the traffic outside, it wasn't like a big city but just enough to remind me of my youthful days. Oh my and the snack baskets were a really really nice touch. That made my day when I walked in and saw those."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The color scheme and ambiance is charming. We enjoyed the nostalgia of a walk-up unit.
The space provides strengths and weaknesses. Relax, enjoy and be adaptive.
Overall, it is worth the almost film noir experience. You can imagine Phillip Marlow knocking at the door in search of the elusive, beauty who holds the key to solving a dark mystery."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value!
Fully equipped, nicely furnished, 1 bedroom apt.
Definitely stay there again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a unique little gem! It’s definitely an old place but so much character. You’re on top of a furniture store, how cool. Decor and refreshments are nice as well."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cool to stay above a historic business district in a small town!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very reasonably priced unit in main area of RedBluff
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My 3rd reservation, in 10 days at this location.
5 ⭐️ stars."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and lovely place to stay ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for exploring. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to relax. Communication was amazing. Very clean. Highly recommend. 5 star..
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Our only issue was the area, little uneasy coming in after dark with the hallways and building front door not secured with a lock code. We had a bum sleeping on sidewalk one evening at 930 pm when we came in.
The space was great. Bathroom could be updated but outside is that we enjoyed it. We were left nice snacks and plenty of coffee! Bed was comfortable, quiet for sleeping and peaceful. TV worked great. Used AC and worked well. Parking was easy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. The host was so accommodating and helpful. Will definitely be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay. We love the eclectic decor, proximity to downtown and walkability of the neighborhood. The kitchen was well stocked with coffee and some snacks. Everything was spotlessly clean. Plenty of kitchen utensils and pots and pans if you choose to do your own cooking. We had our toddler grandson with us, and I might not choose to bring him again, but would highly recommend for couples, especially those who want to get out and explore, but it’s equally a space you could just hang out in and read all day. We will definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and kind host!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great price for a last minute pit stop.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft apartment is very spacious. It is old so keep that in mind, but they have done a great job decorating and making it feel homey.
Water pressure is very low, WiFi is blazing fast at 265Mpbs, and there were free snacks, coffee, creamer, and juice.
The bathroom sink did not drain, we did bring this to the operators attention and some nights we were able to hear the train which is about 3 blocks away.
Location is perfect and you can easily walk the historic downtown and you are less than a block away from restaurants, bars, and shipping.
They really thought of everything here, they included a nightlight, tissue paper, Brita water pitcher, and a Roku TV so you can stream via Prime, Netflix, or other app.
Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for almost 2 weeks, was really quiet and clean. Even had some goodies there for you."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot, this place has it all.
I would recommend for sure."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"the only negative is that we could only stay one night as it was booked out. Well stocked, loved the snacks and extra drinks."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here and definitely will book again if we ever need to be in the area again. The hosts were very responsive and helpful.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this space. It was centrally located near downtown red bluff and walking distance to tons of restaurants. The apartment was decorated very cute and felt cozy. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you Rene!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the most affordable option for our stay in Red Bluff. For the price we paid, it was 5 stars."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beats company payed hotel adds variet
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun western/horse theme. Quiet building and side street off the main drag. Nice touches, like juice and milk in the fridge. Massive flat screen."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cozy little space. Comfy bed and everything worked. The building might not look luxurious on the outside but great care has been out to the actual living spaces and everything feels warm and cozy. Host was very responsive to any questions.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Thank you very much!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A comfortable place to work for a week with a warm, bright living room and well-stocked kitchen."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall I'd recommend this unit to able-bodied single travelers or couples on a budget looking for a central location in downtown Red Bluff. *Pros*: Price, location and well-equipped kitchen (though no dishwasher). The couch and mattress are both very comfortable. *Cons* (especially if you are traveling with a baby or small child, as we were): twenty-six stairs straight up to the unit without much of a landing at the bottom, there are only two windows in the unit (none in the bathroom or bedroom, and there was unfortunately a very strong smell when we arrived that took a couple days to air out), bedroom was cold at night as heat is only in the living room, and the sheets/pillowcases were made of microfleece (just an unusual fabric to be used in a shared setting, in my humble opinion). Again, all of these ""cons"" may be worth the price point, so I wanted to put this detail out there so travelers can make an informed decision!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay!! Host was great and super communicative and place was so cute! We will for sure be back!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy space in the middle of town. Easy walk to shops and restaurants. Space was well appointed, larger than I expected. You can tell the host put a lot of effort into making sure guests have everything they could need."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and homey
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience! The decor was so nice and everything was very comfy. I can’t wait to visit Red Bluff again. I would absolutely stay at Rene’s!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rene’s place was perfect! We had a great time visiting Lassen Volcanic National Park. Another fun place was Tuscan Ridge Estate Winery. What a fun place to do wine tasting! We would definitely stay here again.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool spot, it had everything we needed and worked great for a place to stay while visiting the surrounding areas"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this unique 1906 historic building, adorned with impeccably done Western style decor that makes every corner comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. From the luxurious 3-seat sofa to the high-end queen hybrid mattress and well-equipped kitchenette, the space oozes charm and character. However, during a heat wave that hit the area, the window air conditioning unit seemed to struggle to keep the house cool, but this was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise delightful stay, and I understand that it would typically not be an issue during normal weather conditions. In closing, the remarkable job done in blending history with modern convenience, beautiful Western art, convenient parking, and tasteful design makes this space a joy to experience and a gem that reflects true craftsmanship and hospitality. I highly recommend this place to those looking to immerse themselves in a tastefully decorated space right in the heart of downtown."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a convenient location!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive. The apartment was exactly as it was described. The Wi-Fi was strong and we were able to work remotely with little to no issues. We really appreciated the little complimentary goodies, it was such a nice touch that most hosts don’t do anymore. We absolutely would recommend staying here and plan on staying here in the future if we are in the area!"

Can’t wait to return :)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place has everything we needed for comfort and more. I enjoyed the location of the area because everything was nearby. It's a very comfortable stay and the neighbor is quiet.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Price-performance top; Clean & cozy
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The apartment was nice and very comfortable
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house apartment was great, and the host had basic food and drink items already available for us, which I was not expecting! Very sweet gesture! The bed was comfortable, and overall, the home was very relaxing. The only downside was one of the apartments. The next door was smoking a recreational drug, and it was very strong when you went into the hallway. Luckily, it could not be smelt in the apartment itself, though. Another thing to be cautious is that the stairs are very steep, and there is no elevator. There is a hand rail for the stairs, but I just wanted to inform someone who might be handicap. Will be coming back again if we are in Red Bluff again! Thank you so much."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this place! Every time i stay at one of Julies places it never disappoints!!!!! I loved this place, super cute super clean, it had everything i might of needed or forgot to bring. Thanks for another great stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and Rene's place checks all the boxes: clean, spacious, and comfortable. The old town Red Bluff commercial area is struggling but it is clean and has lots of character. The street activity in the evening was minimal and I had no regrets parking the car on the street and sleeping with the window open. There's a straight-up American diner experience (bacon, eggs, pancakes) just around the corner."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay amazing host.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, exactly like the pictures. Great location for being right downtown, can walk to so many restaurants, shops and bars. Bed was super comfortable. I really enjoyed staying here."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was warm on arrival which was a nice shift from the cool winter outside.
The instructions for entry were clear, the place was super clean and welcoming.
There is a lot of leather goods throughout the place, so keep that in mind if you have any disposition towards that.
Would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Another amazing stay!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely adored this apartment.
The decor and vibe was right up my alley. Such a beautiful stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Beautiful location!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love it when folks rehab an older building into short term rentals. Not that fond of the western decor, but it looks nice, and I loved the high ceilings. The downtown location was great, an easy walk to restaurants and shopping."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool little place. Would definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Rene and Julie’s place. They were very prompt with communication and had nice little amenities at no extra charge for us to use. There was ample parking right in the front and you could even see your car from the window. The place was especially clean. Would stay here again! ☺️
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend & I absolutely loved our stay! The place was beautifully decorated and, by far, had the most comfortable bed I slept in during all of our travels! Appreciated the snacks and all the little thoughtful touches (especially the cool wall art...so inspiring). We'd definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rene’s place was just as described on the site and the stocked goodies was a wonderful added plus. From the very start of my stay, communication for check in was incredibly clear and precise.
It’s so close to Main Street and walking distance to bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, and small business shopping.
Parking was also a breeze. I stayed for a week and moved the car maybe once a day but ran into zero issues having the car parked out front.
Being born and raised in Red Bluff, this was the perfect place to rest. Cannot recommend it enough and will definitely be staying here for future visits!"
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, good place! Host was very responsive and accommodating. However, the bathroom is in need of a complete remodel."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"At first sight of the outside of the building it is not appealing and you have to climb 25 stairs to get upstairs to the loft which was tiring with all the luggage. Someone was keeping the back stairwell door propped open which made the hall very cold. But once you enter the apartment the inside was very clean and nicely decorated. There were 3 space heaters to help with heat distribution as well. It is an old building so it had its character. Kitchen sink has the hot water on the cold water side but once I figured that out it was fine. There was a small leak from the heavy rain and the owner quickly had someone come out. All that said, the bed was clean and very comfortable and there was lots of goodies and coffee. Even juice and milk in the fridge. Once you get past the rough exterior then you see the lovely character inside. I would stay here again and it’s listed at a great price. It was a pleasant stay."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very comfortable place to stay for a few days while visiting the area. The renovations to the old building are done with comfort in mind and the decorations are very well thought out. all household amenities are well stocked.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place and worked perfectly for us. Check in was confusing. I'd texted in the morning requesting the check in code and letting them know that we were going to be there between 3 and 4. The message I'd received a few days before stated we could check in any time. We arrived at 3:15 and still didn't have code. I called and the woman said they were working on the toilet and that I wouldn't be able. to get in until later. Shortly after that after we had taken a walk, we received a text saying we could check in and a code. Why hadn't they just called or texted me earlier that day? Then a person told us we couldn't get in the front door. We'd need to go in the back. We went in the front anyway. Just confusing!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Liked it so much I extended my stay and will be back again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rene's place is a wonderful apt with in walking distance to restaurants and little shops. Its uniqueness and size made the apt soooo comfortable. Would have loved to longer!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well appointed apartment in a great location in town. It's in an older building, so expect what comes with that, but all the furnishings, appliances, etc., were new. The decor was eye-pleasing, and we were very happy with how well-stocked it was with beverages, snacks, fruit, and coffee. Would definitely come back here!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our last minute stay while traveling up the coast. It had everything you could need! Host was communicative and helpful. The bed was super comfortable! And the place was very clean! Beats a hotel room any day!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had an excellent stay at Rene's play. It was clean, spacious, pleasantly decorated and very, very well-equipped. Lots of new items and you can tell that thought and care has been put in. The western/cowboy theme was fun too!
At first we felt the building looked a bit sketchy - there had been a recent fire and it still looked in need of some fixing up. But once we got inside we were very pleased with the place. A great base for visiting Lassen National Park."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, with everything that I needed already there (soap, bath towels, etc). It was a great stay. There was some yelling/cursing and loud bangs coming from another room in the middle of the night but I never really felt threatened or unsafe. Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone. Great atmosphere, no smell of smoke or anything like that, nice views over the city street."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay. We stayed in Red Bluff because my daughter was riding at the rodeo at the Tehama County Fairgrounds.

Well appointed kitchen with cooking utensils and cookwares, plus spices beyond just salt and pepper. Nice coffee/tea area. Not alot to do in walking distance, other than pleasant walks in the neighborhood. Lots of hiking and river recreation options nearby, as well as Lassen NP. It was a great spot to stay with our dogs for a retriever event in the area, and a restful and relaxing spot at the end of the day. Pet friendly and supplied with items to help pet parents keep the property clean."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful, small home out in the country which is exactly what we wanted!"
,,,"Julie is a great host! Great communication and the guest basket was a great touch….

However, the listing accuracy is horrible.
It states it’s a downtown location- which is fine… but it fails to mention there is a bar on the corner that bikers must like as they revved their bikes at high speed…and the apartment is one of many on the second floor… it had extremely paper thin walls… we could hear every bit— and I mean every bit of outside noise… cars, bikes, people talking and walking by, not to mention the train — might as well have been outside with all of it— should’ve been more concerned when I saw the provided ear plugs … which did not help in the least… I would hate to see/hear the noise if we were there at a busy season… no way to not hear or camouflage these noises even with a fan on, the air conditioning on and also using a white noise app on my phone… street noises were horrendous as the walls/windows did nothing to block it out. It was clean but It is an old apartment- floors creak, short shower head( and I’m only 5’2). And thin light curtains on the windows that are see through.. the back stairway is sketchy, rickety and steep. We didn’t try the front- as we only stayed there a few hours after arriving because of the no sleep/noise issue... we packed up and went to a hotel…
Communicated this to Julie and she was great and sympathetic- but could not refund us our stay per Airbnb policy…?"
