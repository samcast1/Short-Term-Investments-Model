2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! The kids were blown away by all of the Mickey things and carried all of the characters around all weekend. The playroom is a perfect touch for a family friendly rental. Who needs Disney world?!
Having three bedrooms was incredibly convenient as well.
Steve and Charity were both very prompt with responding to any inquiries!
We will be back to the Mickey Mouse House for sure!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,It was great! Great last minute place for us to stay!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I stayed here while we were on our way back from a work trip for myself. While the theme was cool and good for my kids. I felt as though the mattresses were old and not real comfortable. The comforter on the beds seemed to be dingy and I just didn’t feel like I was sleeping in a clean bed. The trundle bed in the far room was also dirty and I had to dust off before putting my kids to bed. The water pressure was also an issue for us. It was not the great and the water seemed to be very hard. The furniture and decorations seemed dusty as well. I was also not a fan of the real feather pillows in the living room area and while we were there the internet was not working and the cell signal was not great in that area either. Overall it was an ok stay but we will likely not stay here again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. The Mrs Pacman game was awesome! We'll definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute place that was Mickey Mouse themed. Every time I would turn around, I would find something else that was Mickey themed! The kids loved it. There was an old pac man machine and they really enjoyed that! They loved the play kitchen too! There was a quiet little playground/park close by and we enjoyed that! Great stay for us in a quiet neighborhood!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice & clean

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I have been to Mr. steven before and will come back whenever I have the opportunity to a very quiet place and hosts to match very polite
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay. Charity is a great host and the house is very nice. We stayed here for a few days while attending a seminar and it was great to be able to relax in the recliners at the end of the day. I highly recommend this place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charity's place was so fun. the Disney theme was delightful. The space was very open, spotless, and so cozy. The beds were great and the area was quiet. There are other units but we didn't hear anyone. We slept so well and felt so safe. Charity was very communicative and warm and friendly. We would definitely stay again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would stay again when in the area!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheap and yet a lovely place to stay. Charity even had little snacks and pancake mix etc in the kitchen which was lovely. Definitely a good place to stay for a few people if it isn’t supposed to be super expensive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my husband are very grateful for charity's listing we were on a trip from Colorado to Tennessee and her adorable Mickey mouse house was just what we were looking for it was clean comfortable she was very responsive and a wonderful host. Also the price was outstanding it meant we didn't have to sleep in the car that night. Thank you again charity for everything that you did for us and thank you for being reasonably priced unlike some other airbnbs.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in the area to visit family for a short time. The living room had two recliners. No other Airbnb we have used in the past (6 or 8) had recliners. For us this made relaxing away from home especially nice. The king sized bed we used slept well.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great helpful host. Really enjoyed staying here. Probably played 5,000 games of Pac-Man on their full sized game."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a nice cozy and clean place 😄
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the place Charity and Steve are amazing host if you have an issue and reach out to them they respond really fast
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is Grand and beautiful the pictures don't do justice to just how beautiful it truly is. If you're looking for a spacious clean relaxing Airbnb this place is perfect for you. Every room corner to corner was clean. The house is decorated with the most beautiful things eye pleasing antiques and gorgeous paintings. It reminded me of an old Victorian style charm. We will definitely be staying there again if ever in the area. Dave was wonderful and very friendly. House was exceptionally clean in all rooms.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was everything as described and more! We are a family of 4 and it was in a nice area and so relaxing. The front porch was a nice place to gather and the park across the street gave the kiddos a fun place to play while we cooked. We will def stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,David is very friendly and quick to respond to any questions you have. As a repeat guest I can say his home has always been perfect.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the house on Moffet, it was even better than what we expected. Very clean and comfortably roomy. We highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice house and nice place to stay with your family
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The pics don’t do this place justice. It’s located in one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Joplin. Such a lovely calm neighborhood and the house had so much charm. We had a wonderful experience.
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very beautiful place to stay we’re in town for Mother Road Mayhem and man absolutely blew my mind love the place and how amazing David was!!! Highly recommend to stay here if y’all are in the Joplin area
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The House on Moffet is a real gem. The photos don't do it justice. Wonderful, relaxing, cozy, welcoming, comfortable, well-equipped, and a nice eclectic mix of vintage design. Our host David was highly responsive and well-organized. We loved sitting on the porch listening to crickets and frogs at night and watching thunderstorms roll through, as well as cooking family dinners to share at the formal dining table, and relaxing in one of the two living rooms, reading a book and listening to some records (BYO vinyl). The neighborhood is excellent - perfect for morning or evening walks among some of the oldest historic houses in Joplin, and a park right across the street makes it ideal for travelling with kids. If you're around on a Saturday, make sure to hit up Empire Market a few miles away for fresh local produce, meat, and baked goods. The nearby Bruncheonette on Main St is also not to be missed, and only a lovely 15 min walk away. We eagerly await our next opportunity to visit!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was beautiful! As soon as you walked in you could sense the invitation to relax and enjoy! I'm trying to figure out my schedule for when I'll be back in town:)) thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful home. The decorating was fantastic. We were so busy that we really didn't get to lounge around the way we thought we would do. I would recommend that home to anyone who is looking for a place to stay while in Joplin.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best BnB I’ve stayed at by far. Inside the home to outside. The moment I pulled in and parked to the moment I hopped in the car and left I felt right at home. Beautiful place that photos don’t do justice and should cost more than it does. I have stayed in places more expensive that we’re not near as nice or as well kept up.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough about how wonderful this place and the hosts are! I think our group of 4 collectively said ""wow"" about 18 times upon our entry into this place! absolutely gorgeous home, great instructions, we felt so at home! Any time we are in the area this is the only place we will stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! Remodeled older home but kept all the charm!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our two night stay in this lovely home. It was very evident that the owners took a lot of care into planning how to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This house is very spacious and has multiple indoor (two living rooms) and outdoor (front porch furniture and backyard table and chairs) spaces, so guests have room to spread out and relax."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our 2nd time staying here. we loved it so much, that we chose to stay here again. We asked David a question and he was very quick to respond. We highly recommend this place. We definitely will stay here again if we're in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay and greater space feels like home..
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don’t do this house justice. It was so relaxing, and a great place to stay for our vacation. I didn’t even want to leave! Any questions I had, he responded quickly and was so nice and pleasant! 10000% recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and beautiful home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was incredible! The house is gorgeous, and we absolutely love the neighborhood. David even had Spinal Tap available for us to watch (my wife’s favorite movie). We will definitely stay here again in the near future. Thank you so much!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely house. We were able to have family over for several dinners and it was a great gathering place.
Loved sitting on the porch watching the lightning storm and just relaxing.
Highly recommended. David was incredibly responsive and helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was absolutely stunning surrounded by other beautiful homes. Very spacious and cozy loved our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,David was an excellent host and the home was beautiful! We loved the history and the decor!! Thank you!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home is beautiful. Peaceful area with a park across the way. The pictures don’t do it Justice. Highly recommend
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. The pictures don't do this place justice----its much better than the pictures. The whole place exceeded our expectations. Before booking I reached out to David and he responded very quickly. During our visit I reached out to him and he was very quick to respond. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again. We feel honored to be his very 1st guests!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! We really enjoyed the garage as it was plenty big enough for larger vehicles to be parked in, with even plenty of space to move around after parking inside! The only thing we wish it had was a strainer. But, other than that we’ll definitely visit again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend Dominic’s place. It was perfect for our work group and we had plenty of space.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Dominic's place was great. He booked my colleagues last minute and it had everything we needed for a long term work stay. Thanks Dominic!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dominic is a very kind and generous Host who goes out of his way to help you. His house is very spacious, clean and well kept. The backyard is huge and the location is ideal for getting around town. I would definitely recommend a stay at Dominic’s house in Joplin."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place, we felt right at home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dominic is always hospitable! We love staying here when in Joplin.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to stay when in Joplin. Newly remodeled and clean
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Would definitely come back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Newly remodeled. A go to place for my husband and coworkers to stay while in Joplin working!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful! It is very new and incredibly spacious. The beds are comfortable, and extra linens are provided, which is nice for cool nights. A pack-n-play on site is so handy too. The fully fenced backyard is HUGE. It was so nice to let the kiddos play outside! The table on the patio is really enjoyable. The garage parking is such a nice perk that many AirBnbs don't offer.
Future guests, be sure to bring shampoo and conditioner. The amenities are light; there were only two towels in the large master bathroom, but the washer and dryer on site made that manageable. We did have to wash several dishes prior to any use because unfortunately, a previous guest had put them away dirty. We appreciated having dishwasher soap to make it easy.
Dominic is a great host. He was responsive and helpful! He could not have made checking in and out any simpler, and we were very grateful for the keyless entry. Thanks for a great stay! We would definitely book this place again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was big and beautiful. We had a couple questions and Dominic answered quickly each time.
The neighborhood was a bit loud between a busy street, local construction and barking dogs, but we took box fans and slept great! Would recommend and would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Very spacious for our family of 8. We had a great time being together as we were in Joplin for a big family event in Pittsburg on Saturday. And….a Chiefs Super Bowl win topped it all off on Sunday! Would recommend to anyone visiting the Joplin area!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 2nd home I have stayed in owned by this host. Loved it!! My coworkers did as well, we highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very Beautiful and Clean. Perfect place for a little weekend getaway. Beds are very comfortable. Easy check in, private, and very nice yard space. We would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Brand new renovation. Lots of space!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Good stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and spacious.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,grt place to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spacious house, comes with washer & dryer and other appliances . Host was very nice."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very satisfied with the house. It was just what we needed!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Shelly’s Homes are the absolute best! She is an amazing host! We’ve stayed many,many times and it is always a perfect experience!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great for a few days stay in Joplin. It was very clean, beautifully decorated and the location was great for the activities we had planned."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The positive: The home is clean, has a lot of room, and has beautiful decorations. We loved having access to the huge garage, and we had plenty of room for 3 vehicles (one inside the garage, plus 2 in the wide driveway). The house is perfect for two families - the walls and set up gave all of us full privacy in our sleeping quarters. There is a huge walk-in closet in the master bedroom suite, allowing us to have ample room for all our formal clothes for our daughter's wedding. Plus, it was very nice to have a fenced-in yard for our dog. The bedroom furniture is beautiful.
Would have been nice: To have a full-length mirror, a few more laundry pods, and a couple more trash bags. The kitchen was missing a few things, but Shelly had missing items sent to the house after we called. Note: The master bedroom mattress is firm, which my husband liked, but I had to buy a memory foam topper to get more comfortable. It is also very high, so shorter people may struggle a bit to get into bed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice clean place
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place. Beautiful house. Nice and cozy. Was able to sit outside at night and enjoy the weather and area. Close to main strip in town. If I’m back in Joplin again, this will definitely be a place I’d want to stay."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shelly’s home was very nice and very nice and clean inside! We felt right at home and the neighborhood was also nice and quiet!! We’ve stayed in a lot of air bnbs and Shelly’s house has been the best and her decor was so pretty! Very well kept up. We cannot wait to go back and visit family because we will stay there again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time we’ve stayed here and it was great again. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, and look forward to staying here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed here twice. We have a dog, and there is a nice fenced in area in the backyard. Our daughter attends MSSU. When we visit, there is plenty of room for her to stay with us in comfort. Both experiences have been amazing! ❤️
Shelly is a magnificent host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shelly is a very professional but courteous person. Not to often do you find someone like that. Amazing experience and I stay in Airbnbs more than my house
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shelly was very interactive from inquiring to check out. Her place was very nice and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived. From the fresh baked cookies and coffee to the fresh clean smell throughout the house. I would for sure book one of her properties in the future.
The only downside I would callout is we did not realize there was a camera in the living room till the night before we left and my son was a little embarrass as he had walked from bathroom to bedroom with no clothes on. I had done the same , I just don’t embarrass easy. He will survive but I just wish it were known and we may have been a little more discreet 😉"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house, felt right at home. This was a last minute booking for us and Shelly was responsive right away. Great location! Exactly what we needed for the night."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. We will return next time we are in Joplin!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,When booking a place in joplin we look for one of Shellys houses!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very welcoming and comfortable home, and easy to get around town!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic host to a beautiful home. The house was immaculate. Our host was helpful, proactive, and always available. We have stayed here the past two years in a row and will definitely be returning for a third."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The host was very responsive when I had questions as well as very friendly. I stayed here the night before my wedding as a quiet place for me and my bridesmaids to get ready and it was extremely spacious and accommodated the six of us perfectly. My husband and I also stayed the night of and the night after the wedding and it was a very quiet and peaceful place for us to be able to decompress. It was very clean and stocked with clean towels and linens. Overall it is a beautiful place and I would highly recommend it to anybody.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,delightful stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very roomy, comfortable beds, amazing host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've been at several of Shelly's properties and they are all clean, comfortable and stress free. Shelly is a considerate and gracious host and we enjoy staying at her homes."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was wonderful! The host went above and beyond to help us if we weren't sure where something was or if something wasn't working she was willing to come out. The host was also willing to work with us on a late checkout which was so gracious. A couple minor things like one side of the loveseat didn't recline and there was a small dent in the wall in the master bedroom, and the fenced in yard was pretty spacious but didn't have a door directly to it. Definitely minor things that didn't effect our overall enjoyment. Overall it was just what we were looking for and we will hopefully stay there again on our next visit! ❤️"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed many times! Love Shelly’s bnbs. Clean and comfortable! Absolutely perfect!! Shelly is awesome!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! Not too far from anything you might want to do. It was clean and everything worked as it should. My wife was intrigued by the automatic garbage can! We both liked the luxury of being able to park our vehicle in a garage. We would stay here again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. It was so cozy & beautiful. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in. We had everything we needed in each space of the house. The host was so friendly and very quick to respond to any concerns or questions. We loved our stay! 10/10
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful stay with my kids!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home is about 10 minutes from the highway and in a friendly area. Three cozy bedrooms and 2 full baths were plenty for us and our 2 teens. Happy New Year!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had another great stay at Shelly’s home. We spent more time at the home this time, having our grandkids visit us instead of visiting at their house. We had a wonderful time baking cookies, playing games, crafting, and watching movies.
Thanks, Shelly, for a wonderful time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town for a family reunion / Christmas celebration. The location was perfect to go between family homes in Webb City and Leawood. Everything was immaculate and all bedding including spreads are cleaned between guests which is important to me. Layout was perfect for hanging out together no matter if you were watching TV, at the dining table, or cooking in the kitchen. The fenced in yard made it easy to give our dog some outside time. The home was beautifully decorated for Christmas providing a tree under which to place our gifts and an electric fireplace to hang our stockings. Shelly was very responsive, helpful and kind. We will stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love this property so much and have made many memories with our family! Shelley is an extraordinary host! We love her!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My parents and I loved our stay. We appreciate that pets were welcomed as it allowed us to spend extra time with family while visiting from KC. The house was already decorated for Christmas and was lovely. Can't wait to stay again.

The place was fully stocked with everything you’d need — even laundry detergent, full kitchen, extra towels, fans for noise/air, throw blankets, etc. The place is larger than the photos show, we were extra comfortable! Super clean and there is even a one car garage w/ a drive way to park your other vehicles. We really couldn’t have asked for a better place or host. We will absolutely book with Shelly again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at this house. For people looking at the photos of the house it looks much better than what the pictures show on the website. The inside of the house is light and comfortable. One of the best features was the movie screen.
We loved the fenced yard and so did our dog. There was a nice sitting area in the yard.
Remember to bring detergent with you. We forgot. The bedrooms do not have any lamps, which we needed so we picked up a cheap lamp. The floors are hardwood and have a colorful rug that is really attractive in the living room.
Also, remember to put the # sign after the number of the code. We didn't put they were happy to help is figure out what we were doing wrong. We would stay again and recommend this place to others."

Both beds were VERY comfy which is exactly what I look for when booking. The 8 ft fence was fantastic for our fur baby who loved the back yard. Only word of warning for light sleepers is there is a fire house around the corner whose sirens went off multiple times a night. Not the hosts fault at all, just wanted others to know in advance. Thank you so much Emily! We look forward to staying again!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice place - clean - c.ute backyard with nice privacy fence and sitting area - decent neighborhood but very lose to noisy, busy street at night - only bright overhead lighting, no lamps, or extra blankets, for a touch of coziness."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were babysitting our 5 & 6 year old nephew and niece and thought it would be fun for them to have a sleep away. The thing that caught our eye about the house was the projector and screen - and it was a big hit for the kids! They even slept on the pull-out couch in front of it. The house was very clean and communication was smooth. The house has all you need for a stay but the addition of some ""extra's"" like spare shampoo, salt and pepper, would make it even better and I'm guessing they will come with time. Very private backyard and quiet neighborhood. We had a great stay!"

I liked it so much that I actually tried to book another night unfortunately it was already booked but they were great and the house was it was just what we needed

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I recently had surgery at a hospital in Joplin, and I was fortunate enough to stay at this lovely Airbnb. The location couldn't have been more perfect, as it was just a stone's throw away from the hospital.
The host, who went above and beyond to assist us during our stay, made this experience truly exceptional. From offering helpful tips about the local area to ensuring our every need was met, she was a true gem.
The house itself was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. It provided a peaceful and welcoming environment during a challenging time.

The house is cute and in a good location. Overall the place seemed clean. The beds were clean and comfortable. The hosts provided enough towels and wash clothes for the weekend.
Cons:
- We found 2 live roaches in the kitchen. 1 on the first night and 1 the morning we checked out. I told the host and they offered no discount or refund, even with no photos.
- There were very large, disgusting crickets in the house. We found them alive in the kitchen and both bedrooms.
- Two of the windows don’t lock. This is a safety issue considering they are all on ground level.
- The deadbolt on the front door is damaged and the portion that turns the deadbolt just falls off in your hand."

The house is in fact very bright and cheery, and also very comfortable and thoughtfully equipped. There are lovely old house touches like the clawfoot tub and more modern conveniences like the white noise makers by the beds.

Len went out of his way to help us get inside the property at night after I lost my phone and the entry code. I am truly grateful for his assistance, and we hope to return someday. The property was flawless, and the Joplin locals were incredibly welcoming. I've given Len and Suzette 5 stars across the board, but I wish I could give even more!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Airbnb for the price. Seemed like a brand new build. New appliances worked well. Shower pressure was great and temps were nice and hot. Air conditioning and heat did great with the crazy spring weather. The bed is firm and comfortable. TV moves out from the wall to change the angle and all that kind of stuff. The Wi-Fi speeds were pretty average, manageable for scrolling social media but probably not fast enough for gaming. All in all, was very impressed with the cleanliness and interior design in this new tiny home. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable tiny house. Interesting setup as it’s on the “backyard” of house but parking next to house in alley was perfect. Bed was extremely comfortable. Shower had great pressure. Couch is modern style so on the form side but that’s normal for the style. Great front porch. Kurig had coffee so we didn’t have to go get coffee everyday. These are the small details that make a stay great. A Walmart Brand coffee is 100% perfect!!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little place was just as described. Honestly, this has been the nicest Air B&B we have stayed to date! Everything was as described and Len messaged that it was ready for us much earlier than the listing offered. The hosts were very responsive when we had questions. The only suggestion I have for others looking to stay here is that the bed and couch are very firm. I read many reviews that said ""comfortable bed"" but I am realizing my opinion of comfortable isn't necessarily the same. Just wanted others to know in advance."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Charity's place was a great place to rest on our journey home. The location was just down the road from Wal-Mart and Pizza Ranch, two of our favorite places! LOL. Both beds were comfortable. The bathroom was well supplied with all the products needed but could use a little fixing, especially the caulk around the bathtub and the vanity sink was not secured to the wall. The living room had plenty of seating, but beware when you sit down...the couches slid across the laminate floor too easily! I thought the little pet bed under the TV was a cute addition....and there was a KC Chief's blanket rolled up if you get a little chilly!! Go Chief's!!! The art pieces that decorated the walls were a unique touch. I hope the artist makes many sales from them! Also, I think this was the first home I've stayed in that had live plants! Way to go, Charity!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charity's place was beautiful and spacious! My niece and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay. She was particularly fond of having a TV in her room.

Would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were passing through town and could only stay one night. Which brings me to what we loved the most of how convenient and easy to check in everything was. After a long drive and getting in close to midnight, we had no issues finding the house or getting in. Plus the beds were extremely comfortable and the shower and bathroom a cute and refreshing time.
We had a rough night the night before and said to stay only one night but had to keep time to our next destination. Otherwise we would’ve like to stay longer to rest."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I will definitely stay at Charity’s Joplin Art House again! It was perfection in a quiet area, just far enough off of I-44 and outside of Joplin to be quasi-rural, yet, within 15-20 minutes of Joplin retail, activities, parks, and restaurants.
Her house and amenities were exactly as shown in photos and listed. Beautiful art hung in every room of the perfectly furnished house. The house was warm and spotless, even after winter-weather pipe troubles and, subsequent, clean up not long before I arrived. Amenities were exactly as listed and convenient to access.
Charity was very personable and communicative, both, proactively and responding to my questions about additional restaurants. Instructions to the property as well as for check-in were detailed for simplicity. She also made sure to remind me of her flexibility with check-in/check-out times then suggested an even later time.
Thank you for the comfortable space and friendly correspondence, Charity!"

I was delighted to discover Charity's beautiful little house! For the price of a hotel room and easy to access with my animals, it was a blessing! The colorful interior and beautiful artwork brought a smile to my face after such a long trip. My furrbabies loved piling into the large pet bed and enjoyed the special treats.

We had dinner at one of Charity’s recommendations, 10 minutes away, and it was terrific. It was a small little restaurant that smokes all their own meats and makes their own pasta. It was delicious.
We brought our dog with us. She really enjoyed the large yard. Charity had a dog bed, toys, and dog treats all waiting for our girl.
There are snacks for everyone else too! The place is not luxurious but it is homey and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and safe.
We would not hesitate to stay again if we visit Joplin in the future."

Highly recommend! We will definitely be back!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was immaculate with a fully equipped kitchen and then some (only had to buy food). I felt welcomed the minute I walked through the front door. It had everything I needed including a garage (above and beyond my expectations). Really appreciated having a washer and dryer, and ice maker (I'm an iced tea-a-holic). Peaceful area and still close to restaurants on the main strip. Bed was so comfy . . . had no trouble falling asleep quickly. Was a perfect get-a-way for me!! Jean and Gary did an excellent job with communications as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone passing through Joplin."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing place to stay! They had every amenity you can think of available to you. This was one of the best Air BnB's we have ever stayed at and we have stayed at many. We will definitely be staying with them again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place for us to stay and bring our standard poodle. We were in town for a wedding and it was exactly what we needed. We loved the black dog lodge theme as we are fans of black dogs ourselves. Thanks for a wonderful experience. The hosts were extra helpful and communication was excellent!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I just stayed here for the second time. I was able to notice even more attention to detail- beautiful lighting and hand made pottery (Gary’s), pretty pillows on the sofa, and again, oh so clean"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time to Missouri from Denver for a family members wedding. Gary and Jean’s home is quiet and comfortable. Everything was perfect and we would stay here again and again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I don't think the pics do this home justice. It is a beautifully decorated, up to date, comfortable place for people with dogs. Even when the weather was not cooperative, we stayed comfortable. The owners live behind the property so are close, yet not so much so that you feel no privacy.....quite the opposite. I will recommend it to anyone traveling through as I believe it is probably one of my best experiences through traveling home rentals. Thanks so much Gary and Jean!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were traveling with our three girls and two large dogs. I have never had a more comfortable, clean, and thoughtful place to stay. We find it hard to travel with our large dogs but this dog themed rental had everything a pet owner could need. The yard was massive and well maintained. The house was incredibly clean and had treats for us and the fur babies. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great place to stay, especially with fenced in yard for the dog. Cute decor. Great accomodations. The hosts thought of everything! Will definitely book this house again on the next visit to Joplin."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time here. A great place for you and your dog. Our big boy loved the back yard and did zoomies to show his approval. Comfy living room, nice shady patio out back and beds slept great. Lots of nice extra touches like an assortment of coffee pods, shampoos, & dog cookies. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a fantastic home and wonderful hosts. I can’t say enough positive things. We have never felt so welcomed with our pups! We will highly recommend. Also found a great trail 10 minutes from the house with a beautiful river and bluff views.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our first stay away from home with our recent rescue dog was a huge success at this beautiful home. Our boy Rudy loved running laps in the big backyard after his long car ride. This lovely home was just as advertised and was comfortable and welcoming for our family. It’s close to restaurants, has a well supplied kitchen, and the bed’s slept great. Dog treats, bowls, & bags were a nice touch. We only had a brief stay, but are looking forward to our return stop there on our way home next week. Highly recommended if you’re going to be in Joplin!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Gary and Jean’s place was a great place to stay! My husband and I were moving from Texas to Illinois and we stopped here for a night and it was amazing! We loved the decor - especially for our all black German Shepard! It fit perfectly! Will be staying again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a fun and amazing experience my whole family had - pets included- while staying at the Black Dog Lodge! I bought concert tickets to Sublime with Rome at Downstream and found this absolute gem!
Very quiet and friendly neighborhood. Such a beautiful, home and so close to downtown and Downstream. Everything in the house was so nicely designed and modern, from the furniture, lights, and shower fixtures to the art and pottery dishes. The extra care and detail put into the safety of the gigantic yard perimeter was outstanding. Had a wonderful morning on the covered patio watching my dogs frolic! Hosts were superb and very helpful!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Gary & Jean’s home could not have gone better. Somehow the house looked even better in person than in the photos, this is rarely the case.
The home could not have been any cleaner or more comfortable. My stay there was a quick one- I got there with my three dogs after 9 pm and we were on the road first thing in the morning. I wish I had had more time to spend in the house because it really was perfect un every way.
I am now driving cross country several times a year and am planning to stay here overnight each and every trip."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at The Black Dog house! Our family came together from 3 different states to stay here for our son’s college graduation and we had 2 dogs with us. Gary and Jean left dog snacks and human snacks, provided bowls, leashes, and towels for the dogs and a well appointed kitchen with utensils, basic spices, and snacks for us as well! There were even games and a Hulu and Disney+ account for us to watch movies if desired. To say we are satisfied with our stay is putting it mildly! We hope to stay here again if we’re ever back in the area! Wonderful hosts!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gary and Jean’s house is one of our all-time favorites. Absolutely spotless and perfect for the pups we brought. It’s also an extremely convenient location, minutes from food and coffee!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely time at The Big Dog Lodge! The place was clean and in a nice location. Our 3&4 year old grandkids loved all the dogs around the place. There were pillows, shower curtains, magnets and more for them to find and enjoy. We also had two dogs with us and the fenced backyard was a perfect place for them to run and explore after a five hour car ride! Thank you for a great stay at The Big Dog Lodge. I will definitely search for it again to see if it’s available the next time we are passing through Joplin."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome hosts. This house and the owners are amazing! The best experience we have ever had! The house is super nice and the amenities are the pinnacle. The house was clean and well kept, beds so comfortable that I actually slept until 8 one morning! This is larger details but here is the clincher! The paper towels, toilet paper, trash bags, all were top notch. Stuff we buy at home. They don’t skimp! This house was well worth the money! My family and I will stay here again if we stay in Joplin. If you need a place to stay in Joplin, you won’t be disappointed! It is close to everything without being in town. I can’t say enough good things about this house or the owners! Amazing."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gary and Jean’s home was absolutely perfect for us! I’m from the area and still have family there. We were able to have a beautiful comfortable home to stay in with my mother, brother, nephew and our dog Opal! Probably the best part of this house is how dog friendly it is and how you can tell they love animals. Backyard is HUGE and fully fenced. Our dog loved it. Will 100% book here again if available. They also supplied snacks and drinks."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Black Dog Lodge is a home away from home! We absolutely loved having a real home to stay in and share with our family! All the thoughtful touches like the dog (and people!) snacks, the games, the whimsical, comfy decor (the doily table runner was much coveted!), the suitcase racks in the closets, and the well equipped kitchen really made the house a home. The dogs give the large, fenced backyard two paws up!!
The beds were very comfortable and the bedrooms were beautifully decorated. The common areas were comfy, spacious, and relaxing. Every room had multiple charging ports and outlets. The washer and dryer and the covered back porch were much appreciated bonuses!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I would first like to say, Shelly was absolutely amazing. Her communication was terrific. Before, during, and after our stay, she was very humble, understanding, and such a wonderful host. Our original trip dates changed and Shelly let us change our dates and let us check in early after driving a 19 hour trip from our house to hers. Her house was very simple and reminded me of my own home. We stayed over Christmas and there was a perfect amount of Christmas spirit in the house that we appreciated. The best thing was the 4 inches of snow that fell while staying there and her yard was perfect to get out there and roll around in the snow. We can not wait till we can come back and stay at this little red house. I would recommend anyone to stay at Shelly's house. The house was hands down amazing but Shelly is the reason we will be back because of the wonderful hospitality she showed us. We could not have asked for a better house, host, and trip to Joplin. Can't wait to come back soon."

I have stated at a handful of Airbnb's and this was by far the best! You can't go wrong with staying at The Little Red House!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute, brand new place! Decorated nicely, nice new queen beds, plenty of space and nice new kitchen! I'm not sure how they fit 3 bedrooms in there and still had walking around space and a sectional couch, but they did and it was great! Perfect spot for hanging out with family in town after Thanksgiving dinner. Sofa also reclines. Master bedroom has separate bathroom. Was worried about location since it is on the West side of town (can be sketchy), but it turned out to be one of the new neighborhoods built after tornado, so all new houses. Owner was very nice, do not park more than one car in the back, she will call. Needs the rest of the driveway paved as it is only a parking pad (maybe where a basketball pad used to be?)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Amazing Place! Loved the layout! Comfortable beds and furniture! I’ve stayed at Shelly’s bnbs many times in the past! These are my favorite bnbs hands down! So clean! So convenient and So Comfortable! Don’t look elsewhere this is the one you want!

Tim and Sandy were welcoming, warm, proactive, but gave Mom and I plenty of privacy as well. All the instructions were clear, the space was beautiful and comfortable. The hot tub came in so handy after long days of cleaning, organizing, and hauling belongings. We were able to relax together and watch home videos of Dad in the evenings as well. The cinnamon rolls they provided were incredible, along with OJ and milk. They even gifted us prayer stones. Hands down this will be the only place I want to stay when I come to town now, and Mom feels the same. Tim and Sandy are good people who clearly know what they're doing."

I’m here to tell you nobody does that. They even provide a special towel to wipe my dog’s feet because it was raining. These folks are at the top of the hosting game and I will definitely be back. Thanks again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were a little nervous as it was our first time staying in an airbnb but this was a great experience and we would absolutely do it again! One of the main reasons we picked the hideaway was for the private hot tub which was super clean and so cozy with the candles in the evening. The cinnamon rolls and drinks Sandy set out for us were delicious and very thoughtful. The privacy and comfort of the hideaway made it perfect for me and my man to unwind and spend some quality unplugged time together.

The house feels cozy, it has air conditioning in the room and in the living room to be able to control the temperature to your liking. The kitchen was clean and well equipped, it was a pleasure to cook there.
It was the first Airbnb really pet friendly we stayed in. She has a towel to clean her legs, cover on the couch, a vase with treats, lots of garden to explore, my puppy had a great time.

We loved the pool and we took many soaks in the hot tub. There is even a short trail that goes all around the property which is great for an evening stroll. The porch was the star of the show as my wife liked to sit out there in the mornings and drink coffee and watch deer eating the corn. We also ate meals on the porch and sat in the cool rockers. When we got there, we had cinnamon rolls from a local bakery waiting for us as well as milk and OJ in the fridge. Tim and Sandy really are incredible hosts and made us feel so welcome on their property. They even opened their garage for us to park in when a storm was coming! The best part is that it feels like you are in the country when in reality you are just a couple minute drive from town. I can't imagine picking a better place for a couples weekend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The hosts were absolutely wonderful and super accommodating. We absolutely loved the Hideaway and ended up extending our stay by an additional night because we loved it so much.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Sandy's Hideway was the best arbnb experience we have had yet. From the wonderful breakfast left for us to the pool to beat the heat. It was by far over and above the normal experience. Tim's recommendation to eat at the Famos restaurant and the icecream shop in Carterville was outstanding. This place stays booked so if you are lucky enough to get a reservation you will want to stay here. Also thanks for the prayers rocks and prayers!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very cozy and I don't think I could have found a better Airbnb.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Where do I begin...
First, I'll start with the hosts, Tim and Sandy. They were absolutely amazing!!! Very communicative, accommodating, and welcoming. Words really cannot describe just how personable and generous they were.
In addition, the cottage itself was beautiful. The area was so quiet and peaceful. The cottage was also very cozy and quaint. It had everything I needed... from the comfortable bed, nice linens, and quality, fresh-smelling towels, everything was wonderful!!
I'd also like to make mention of the pool and hot tub. Both were very clean and a fantastic addition.
I have visited many Airbnb's and the 'Hideaway' has by far been the best. I will definitely make it a point to return, and highly recommend and encourage anyone else considering this property to see for yourself."

The pool was so warm almost didn’t even need the hot tub but couldn’t pass it up and boy did it do the trick for my back and neck from driving! All in all this place was quiet and as comfortable as can be and just amazing!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at The Hideaway! It was easy to find the home and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Sandy are 2 of the nicest people I have ever met! They were on top of everything before i even thought to ask! They both communicated with us very well and were super helpful with all of our needs!

Thank you very much. We will definitely see you again. If I stop by, otherwise we'll be waiting for you in Italy"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This was beyond my expectations. I travel and stay in Airbnb’s frequently, and this is in my top 5!
The house is ADORABLE, immaculate and beautifully decorated. The host was so accommodating and kind. What really did it for me? The extra touches! The AC was on and a welcoming 70 degrees. A carafe of OJ and milk in the fridge. A snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich in the freezer. Fresh cinnamon rolls. Hot tub turned on and ready to go with a basket of pool towels and romantic candles. They even had all of the grill utensils laid out on the grill in case we were to want to use it! Although we did not cook, I am someone who does so with passion, and I can tell you they have everything you could possibly need to cook a great meal. All of the kitchen utensils, appliances and dishes are top notch. The mattress was so comfortable, not one of the cheap IKEA mattresses. The water pressure is AMAZING. If we are ever back in the area, not only will we stay again, but we will stay much longer!"

There’s a trail that is cut down for you to walk and see a bit more of the property. We took a walk, grilled some food, and played some board games during the day. Then during the night we had the fire going and made some s’mores and ended the evening soaking in the hot tub with some wine and beer. The hosts are very accommodating and pleasant . Tim was very nice and friendly when showing us the place and Sandy was extremely sweet for the cinnamon rolls and adding extra towels when we thought we were gonna have some guests over. 10/10 recommend the hideaway."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved The Hideaway! We would recommend and definitely love to come back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best place to escape from the city! Peaceful and relaxing, this place allowed for a recharge. Highly recommend and look forward to booking again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little gem was absolutely the best! We were stuck from out of town, with a dog and this was such a wonderful experience (had being stuck in a hotel for weeks) this is absolutely what we needed. The property is beautiful, wonderful amenities, fully stocked with anything you could possibly need and They go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable.
This by far is the cleanest and most comfortable airbnb we've ever been to and if you are looking for a weekend retreat from the hustle and bustle, this is your place!!
p.s. The cinnamon rolls are delicious!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim was extremely pleasant to deal with and made us feel right at home before we even arrived. The Hideaway is a fantastic place to stay. The property is gorgeous and well cared for. Would absolutely recommend and look forward to visiting again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"So beautiful and relaxing. Wonderful getaway on the edge of town. Hosts communicated and were right nearby but never on the property so we felt very secluded and private. Only issue was occasionally the internet was out in the evening. Other than that, it was everything we hoped and more. We highly recommend this."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love staying at the hideaway!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There is a reason this place has only 5 star reviews! If I could give it 10, I would.
My friend and I decided at the last minute to stay at Tim & Sandy’s hideaway. Tim was immediately responsive. When we arrived (early might I add as they were happy to accommodate) the place was exactly as pictured, super clean and peaceful. Tim was happy to help and show us around and even left cinnamon rolls from a local bakery for breakfast along with OJ & Milk (& even happily gave us a stick of butter we forgot) we grilled, had a fire going all night, soaked in the hot tub, and even walked the path that Tim cut for us along the property line and took in the sunset while walking along the stream. My dog Boomer was happily welcomed and had the time of his life. I could go on and on but I’ll just say, if you’re on the fence about booking this place, JUST DO IT! I can’t wait to come back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim & Sandy were very accommodating, friendly and gave us a restaurant suggestion (Famos grill), which was fantastic! We were passing through town, after a long camping trip, celebrating our anniversary and wanted something relaxing with a hot tub! We loved the cottage, it was comfy and homey! We will definitely return and will stay longer."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This may be the nicest Airbnb we’ve stayed at! Beautiful setting and so nicely decorated and the hot tub was a welcome addition.
We would definitely stay again when in the Joplin area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim and Sandy’s place was great! It’s well appointed and private, but still a quick drive to Joplin. The hot tub is the icing on the cake!
There was a chance for severe weather during my stay, and Tim graciously offered a spot in his shop to park my new truck. We dodged the storms, but it was a relief to not worry about hail.
I’ll definitely recommend the Hideaway to others. Thanks Tim and Sandy!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Would love to visit again. Thanks for allowing us share your beautiful space :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t even know where to start with this review.
First off, if you’re on the fence about booking this place JUST DO IT!! When I tell you I’ve never been, not just surrounded, but completely engulfed in amazing hospitality it’s no exaggeration! Tim & Sandy were absolutely amazing hosts, they were quick to respond & our trip wouldn’t have been as great without their recommendations for absolutely everything. Everything in the home was breathtaking from the views to amenities (I’ve never slept so good)! We loved the privacy & comfort of the location, anything & everything you could ever wish to do is within 15 minutes of this space which made this location right in the sweet spot.
Everything about this last minute trip was perfect. My fiancé & I are already planning our next stay here. Don’t second guess yourself, book this place! From the location to the personal touch from amazing hosts, you won’t regret it. BEST TRIP EVER!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what I was looking for! Wanted to give my wife a a few nights away for her birthday.... Tim & Sandy hit it out of the park! Great communication, cute cute hideaway, and the nicest largest hot tub we've ever encountered. Almost like stepping into another life for a day or so. We'll be back..."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this place: the peace and quiet, the coziness, the cleanliness, and the thoughtful touches like the breakfast Tim left us. Best of all were the hot tub, patio, and back yard -- we saw two deer come right into the yard! Tim was a perfect host and easy to communicate with. Of all the Airbnb's we've stayed in, this is our favorite."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the hideaway was an absolute blast and Tim & Sandy are a treat. They added a few extra details to help induce the coziness of the house . I definitely recommend booking this
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing getaway spot. If you're thinking of staying here, don't hesitate. It was clean and relaxing, and the hot tub tops it all off."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome comfortable and clean place.Beautiful with things to do I took advantage of the tire swing. The morning greeting from the manager ( beautifully behaved dog) made our day wonderful. Felt like special guests.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend stay for our anniversary. The Hideaway was immaculate and charming. The first morning we enjoyed a visit from 6 deer just a few yards away from the front door. The second morning, we experienced a beautiful sunrise through the trees at the back of the property.
We also had fun visiting several quality flea markets and antique malls in the surrounding towns.
It was a great visit overall!"

I am looking forward to staying here again soon!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an excellent stay very relaxing and clean place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hideaway was awesome! Tim was very friendly and extremely helpful, we were never in need of anything during our stay. Each morning was like watching an episode of Nature. One morning my wife and I watched eight to ten deer moving through the field and wood line. Then we noticed a doe was injured on her front leg. Next we saw two coyotes following closely behind the deer. We observed them until they were out of sight. I'm not sure what happened after we lost sight of them but it was an awesome experience! We are definitely staying at the hideaway next time. Thank you Tim!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hideaway was exactly what we needed! We loved the hot tub and how cozy the place was. Extra points for the cinnamon rolls and fresh juice!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Hideaway was our little piece of paradise for the night. Country views in every direction yet 5 minutes away from food/entertainment. We hated that we had to leave. I wish every Airbnb host was as good as these two!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little place for our quick getaway! Everything you could want in a secluded hideaway and then some. Our little guy enjoyed looking at the deer that arrived shortly after us. Amazing hosts! The thoughtful extras, from the cinnamon rolls, milk and juice to the dog bones, were great touches. We're already looking forward to planning our next trip!"

Reservation was set on short notice as my family was heading through the area and needed a place to stay for the night and hosts were nothing short of perfect. Tim and Sandy were awesome… accommodating, kind, helpful. You name it. We hope to make this a frequent stop as it is the mid point for our family to meet. Would come here again and again no doubt."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a place! The perfect little getaway that's still close to town (Joplin and Carthage) but makes you feel like you're remote, nestled in nature. The kitchen is well-equipped, the bed is super comfy, the view from the porch (or the couch) is lovely, and the hot tub is divine. Tim & Sandy provided so many personal touches in this well-appointed space, I felt right at home. And Tim was super responsive with all my questions. I'll bookmark this one, for sure!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an awesome little place to stay. Relaxing in the hot tub was nothing short of amazing
,,,Worst Airbnb experience I have ever had. Internet was out when I checked in. Modem was replaced next day. Then 1 day later internet went out again. Host had disconnected the internet. Decided I was moving out the next day. Host came over and was yelling at me to stay. That internet would not go out again. He came in the place and was yelling. Was crying. He continued to bang on my door until about 9pm. Left the next morning with no further confrontations. Not enough towels were given. No garbage bags. Horrible experience
