2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very big space and with very nice amenities.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely Gorgeous Suite!!! Very clean and comfortable, great location, looking forward to staying here on my next visit to Logan."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this place. It's super clean, in a great location, and has everything you need. The host was responsive kind. I will definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this cute, very clean condo. Kitchen stocked with dishes, glasses, cookware, etc. They had salt, pepper, olive oil, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and creamer pods.
Beds & pillows were very comfortable including the bunk bed which was sturdy for my full-grown teenagers. Plenty of fun games, blanket throws, and great TVs. I should have taken the time to read the description more thoroughly. They do not supply sugar or washcloths. Not complaining but that might be helpful for someone else. Grab ice on your way over too. The early morning music downstairs did wake us up. Play white noise or bring ear plugs if you are light sleepers.
Great location. Cool urban vibe. My kids loved going down to Starbucks on their own in the morning. We also loved Great Harvest around the corner, and The Sportsman about a block north which had nice clothes (Kuhl, Fjallraven, etc.), a bike store, and skis.
We would 100% stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our stay there was great! Not only was it clean and in such a great location, Isabel was very accommodating! We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, centrally located and very clean. My only negative would be road noise but you are in town close to restaurants and bars, so to an extent, that‚Äôs to be expected. Nothing that a white noise app can‚Äôt drown out üëçüèª It‚Äôs also nice to have Starbucks downstairs in the morning ‚òïÔ∏è"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place in downtown Logan! I‚Äôm so happy to have these apartments available to my husband and I when we visit his aunt. Super clean, super convenient, and so comfortable. Much nicer than the hotel options in town and far more reasonable! Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Beautifully finished space in a great downtown location. Really spacious apartment with a full kitchen. Basic cookware for simple dinners (pasta, baking, eggs). Has both a table and a bar for eating/working. I was able to work remotely with good internet. The off street parking worked well. Nice neighborhood. I wish all Airbnb‚Äôs were this nice."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars in all categories. Will be my go-to place when I'm back in Logan. Clean, quiet, modern. Starbucks below is ultra-convenient. Great communication with the host. Great location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this apartment! I highly recommend this Airbnb. Perfect for individuals, couples and families. Owners had great communication which made check-in/out easy.
Extra perk: I loved that we were provided coffee, tea and hot chocolate! Perfect for the cold nights! The beds were super comfortable too!!
We will definitely be back! Thank you again for your hospitality!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed two nights at this cute little apartment while visiting family in Logan. It‚Äôs riced well for what you get. Nicely remodeled, huge TVs and well stocked. The location is great and made me wish we lived above a Starbucks although my bank account is happy I don‚Äôt."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay and host was great and responsive. We came over Christmas and she was kind enough to provide a tree inside the place, our family loved it"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic little pied-√†-terre in historic downtown Logan. The space is comfortable, well appointed and perfect for a family with kids. The location is about as walkable as you can get in Logan with long time favorites like Cafe Ibis, The White Owl and Factory Pizza just steps out the door. There are lots of great new restaurants and shops in the area as well. 10/10 would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful unit fits seven with surprising ease
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,location is under construction stayed 7/15/23 once its finished it will be a great location. Hard to give full 5 stars when it had construction noise early in the AM and walking through a construction zone. Will be really nice once Starbucks is completed in the lobby area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little comfortable apartment in the heart of downtown Logan. Clean and functional with large TVs and basics for a pleasant stay. Well managed. A great spot.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space. Squeaky clean. Very responsive.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place! Right on Main St ‚Äî walk to everything, and short drive up Logan Canyon to trailheads.
The apartment is spotless ‚Äî great kitchen, big bedrooms, super clean everything, very strong recommendation!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay for my daughter and I while we toured the college. We walked to all the best restaurants! There was construction outside which I thought would be loud and bothersome but when inside is was very quiet and relaxing. The apartment was beautiful and very well planned. The wonderful gift basket was a surprising treat after a long drive to get there.
I would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"very cute nice place, comfortable with everything we need."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for a wonderful graduation weekend for my son at Utah State. Perfect location, walk ability, great food, theaters, nightlife, small park across the street very close to the University. This suite was very cozy, although we were not aware there was construction going on, however, we were up early each day so it didn‚Äôt bother us. We would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place tucked into the down town area. Stayed quiet. Great step up from any hotel.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an ideal spot for me and my two kids to stay in Logan. Right in the heart of the old downtown, with restaurants and shops we could walk to and anything we wanted or needed a short drive away. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well-equipped. I contacted Isabel a couple of times with questions during our stay and she got back to me ASAP."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a fantastic place for us to stay! Very close to everything we needed to do. Also very responsive and accommodating hosts!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,So cute! Perfect for out of town guests to connect & get to know Logan.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here at the last minute and Isabel was so helpful! The place was clean and well stocked! I did forget to ask for blankets for the sofa bed so be sure to ask for some of you plan on using it! Everything was so nice and modern! Ohhhh I loved having the washer and dryer there on site! The kids loved the snacks they gave us too!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place for a family to stay. Right in the center of down town, clean, and very convenient. I would stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This is a great place and I love staying here. I will stay here again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The GREAT: Isabell's place was so cute and looked just like the pictures. It was VERY clean and included a lot of extra snacks and drinks, which were very much apprecited. The beds and furniture were all very comfortable. Isabell answered all of our messages so quickly and was VERY helpful every time we had an issue.
The not so great: The parking situation is less than ideal for middle of the winter situations or people with a lot of stuff (luggage) to get into the apartment because it is very far from the entrance of the building. Also, the free overnight parking located behind the apartment says that there is no overnight parking during the winter. Isabell was quick to assure me it would be fine to park there anyway, but it did leave me a little nervous parking there.
Without the parking situation, I give Isabell's place12/10 stars! BUT, even with the parking situation, I still give it 9.9/10 staras! We would stay here again in a heartbeat (and likely will)!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great Airbnb. I‚Äôll break it down.
The hosts
They were awesome! I had a few quick questions about parking and the entry and they were so fast to reply. They were also extremely accommodating, and let me know often that I could reach out whenever if I had questions or needed a pack and play or extra sheets. They made our stay smooth and fun. It‚Äôs great to have reliable hosts.
The location
Awesome. I loved being in the heart of things in downtown Logan. It‚Äôs right within a short walking distance of a bunch of great restaurants, book stores, antique shops, bakeries, and theaters. It‚Äôs the place to be for sure.
The space
We stayed with 6 people and it was plenty of room. It looked newly remodeled and we loved all the decor. It was warm and cozy. One thing that may be a drawback is it‚Äôs an older building, there‚Äôs a laundry near the apartment, and there‚Äôs construction sites nearby so there are noises at night. Not too bad but may be hard for extremely light sleepers."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great place to stay! Very modern design, new, and spotless. We loved the huge TVs and how well stocked the kitchen was. The location couldn't be better- right down town and within the same block as several restaurants. We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Logan!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in a good area and great hosts. A little dirty though..
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was decorated very cute and Troy and Aubree were very friendly in their communication. I wish it had been a little cleaner and quieter, but overall it met our needs for our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very affordable cute little place, they checked on me a couple times to make sure I didn't need anything."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay they where nice and kind. Very communicative. Cute place.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"They were very responsive and flexible about check-in time. The basement apartment was clean, there was a king size bed, and a comfortable pull out sofa. It was quite loud in the morning and night with multiple small children above."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a good stay. They place was well stocked with everything I needed from the kitchen to the bathroom. Would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location in town, hosts are extremely good at communicating and making you feel at home!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Troy and Aubrey's place was clean and comfortable and a convenient location for visiting my son at USU.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy and Aubree were very friendly and great communicators during our stay.
The accommodation is not a ""cozy cottage"" but a basement apartment in a small older house which did not meet our expectations.
Our biggest issue was the king-sized bed. It was too soft and sagged in the middle. There was no mattress pad and the sheets were so thin that they slipped around and pulled off the edges."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,-
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It has everything you need in the winter time and very easy to go to downtown. Thank you for your lovely home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay right in the heart of Logan. Quiet neighborhood but so close to everything you might want to go do!
Second time staying here, and we loved it! Felt so homey and comfortable."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was comfortable and clean. The king-size bed was a big selling point for us. The bedroom was a good size and very comfortable; it didn't feel crowded. The smaller sitting area with a fireplace was cozy for the two of us on the nights we stayed in.
The ceilings were low in some places, and the bathroom was small. This wasn't a deal-breaker, but it is important to be aware of. My husband is 6'2"" and it was a close fit; someone taller may hit their head."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the place and the location. It was close to what we came to visit for.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cozy place to stay! Fully stocked kitchen and a comfortable living room. SO much better than staying in a cramped hotel room! Felt right at home.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot with a nice living room, spacious kitchen, and all the amenities you‚Äôd need. The hosts were very friendly and responsive and the place was very clean."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great! They were very responsive and made sure we were taken care of. If you're taller than 6' 3"" (like I am) make sure you duck when you go in, the ceiling is a little low but otherwise everything was wonderful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was perfect for us for our long weekend in Logan. Suited our needs perfectly! Would definitely book again on another trip there.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was perfect for us and Troy and Aubree were brilliant and considerate hosts. We highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and the bed was comfortable. It had good ac and plenty of space.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,wasn't expecting a basement there was noise from up stairs
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice and quiet place to stay. Flexible and responsive host
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used this location for college drop-off and it met our needs very nicely. If you're in town for anything related to the university, it is just a very short drive straight up the road to campus, which is very convenient. There are restaurants, grocery stores, etc all close at hand. It's really a good spot for a visit, whether to USU, or hiking/outdoors adventures, or similar.
Troy and Aubree were both proactive and responsive in communication and made us feel welcome. They had given very adequate notice that the space was part of a home with children, so any family noises were expected and did not bother us in the least.
We will hopefully be back through over the coming years and will keep this home on our short list from here on out!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and a clean place close to town.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place for the price!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very cute and cozy. Bed was excellent. comfortable and king sized! Kitchen is large and has most of everything you'd need for a weekend stay. Probably even longer.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely basement apartment with ample space and privacy. Troy and Aubree were friendly hosts, happy to accommodate our needs and provide local recommendations!
Note: we could easily walk to Westside Coffee for a delicious breakfast ‚Äî try the a√ßa√≠ bowls!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was great!! Thank you!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy and Aubree's place was very quiet, except for the sound of children - is a very family oriented environment which was comforting. It was very clean and spacious with the necessary kitchen amenities such as a microwave, strove, coffee pot, refrigerator and I believe a dish washer. The bed was very comfortable with cushy sheets in a bedroom with lotsa room! It is centrally located - grocery stores are not very far away and there is bus service if one does not have a car. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. I really enjoyed my stay, and would definitely like to stay here again, should I return to Logan. Thank you, Troy and Aubree!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Troy and Aubree were fantastic. The place was clean and comfortable. It's s a great place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked very last minute (just hours before check-in) and they were very kind and quick to get everything ready for my family to check in! It felt very homey, it was comfortable, and had everything we needed! It was a plus that we were so close to main amenities and were able to walk to the places we needed to go."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great neighborhood, close to Summerfest. Other than having to haul everything up and down a flight of stairs it The kitchen is minimally stocked, so bring your own coffee and supplies."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was great! Nice place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Surprisingly spacious and cozy spot for a couple / individuals stay in Logan, UT. It's a basement apartment, so there's always going to be drawbacks; but for the price and quality it's a good spot. Communication was always prompt and friendly."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cute place. I had isa couple concerns. One, the sheets smelled musty so I had a hard time sleeping. It was too late at night to bother the host. Another concern was definitely not enough outlets which is a building code violation. Third, I honestly did not need to be reminded to ""messaged the host if I needed anything"" . especially more than once. I also did not need to be reminded to have a fun trip. Give your guests their space. When they need help, They will reach out. I say this out of kindness please understand."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a basement apartment. The owners live above with several young children it‚Äôs a busy little family that gets going each morning about 7 am. You won‚Äôt be able to sleep in. The washer and dryer is in the storage room and shared with the owners. They are extremely accommodating when you want to use the washer & dryer, no issues. The place is very clean and comfortable and in a safe area. The kitchen is very old but very clean. If I had to guess the home is 70 years old and it looks like it but it‚Äôs clean and comfortable. We like to sleep in but that isn‚Äôt possible. So if your an early riser this is for you because it‚Äôs a great place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From a solo female traveler‚Äôs perspective: Troy and Aubree‚Äôs apartment felt safe and was exactly what I needed. In addition to the door‚Äôs locks, they had also installed a bar on the inside of the door so that you couldn‚Äôt get in even with a key. I felt safe in the neighborhood, and appreciated Troy and Aubree‚Äôs local recs! One thing to note is that you can hear the family above the apartment, but it didn‚Äôt bother me at all. Some white noise or music/tv would drown it out. I enjoyed my stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy and Aubree were kind and accommodating hosts. Their place is clean, well equipped, nicely decorated, and very close to downtown Logan. It is quiet despite being so central (no street noise) and the bed is very comfortable. Thanks Troy and Aubree for a great stay."

Our kids were obsessed with the treehouse in the backyard; on the way home my daughter kept whining, ‚ÄúI miss the treehouse!‚Äù Lol! The bed was very comfy too!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in Logan, Utah was my first time at an airbnb and it was a very nice experience. Check in was a breeze. The place was spotless, the bed was better than my own with extra handmade quilts that made it extra comfy. Every morning I enjoyed a nice hot shower to start my busy day. The hosts, Troy and Aubree made sure I had everything I needed. Checkout was as easy as checking in.
I hadn't noticed when I booked this airbnb that they mentioned having small children. I was saying to Aubree how much I enjoyed hearing the soft sounds of their 2 small children singing.
I also really appreciated the reasonable rates and would not hesitate to come back."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aubree is super friendly and the place is a cute gem! Perfect location and she gives amazing recommendations of where to eat/hike etc. Great experience for a short stay overall!!!
We‚Äôre grateful for the opportunity to stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a basement apartment in a family home. The space was quite large with a big kitchen, living room, and bedroom. The bathroom was a little tight but it worked fine for me (at 5'7""). There really was a lot of space for the price which was a pleasant surprise.
You can hear that a family lives upstairs as was described in the listing. I only heard them during the day though...nights were just the very lovely sound of crickets :)
I used the internet to work at this apartment with no issues. The signal was reliable and plenty fast for me to remote into my computer at work.
Aubree was so great to work with and easy to communicate with! She was very helpful when my plans changed slightly."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location close to everything you need and great hosts

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quaint, clean place. Air conditioning was nice. Our experience was good even with a mattress that forced us to the middle of the bed.
Was a great choice for what we needed this trip to Logan."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value with friendly owners upstairs. The owners children were definitely present but as long as you aren‚Äôt trying to sleep in they aren‚Äôt a problem. We‚Äôll plan on staying again on our next visit.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Logan. the king size bed was very comfortable and we loved having an AC unit in the bedroom. It is very centrally located and Troy and Aubree were very quick to respond to our needs. We'll stay there again on our next trip.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Responded timely and was so helpful!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place is small but comfortable to stay in. If you like quiet mornings then this wouldn't be a good fit since the family live upstairs and kids run early in the morning all over the house. Host is great at communicating with you about your arrival and anything else you need. The place is close to downtown, restaurants, and stores. I would stay there if I go to Logan again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay in Logan - central and walking distance so a lot of good places to get coffee, eat, etc. Lots of pillows, which is always a plus. Did hear the kids upstairs a few times, but that's definitely spelled out in the description! Thanks for the stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Duplex super close to main street, Very Quiet and great landlords"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay that was near everything. The beds were very comfortable and it was clean. We were just needing a place to sleep at night. This place was perfect. The hosts were very communicative and responsive. It is a basement apartment so we did hear some footsteps but nothing too loud or distracting. We had all we needed. I would stay there again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super lovely family and apartment had everything we needed! Great location, central to Logan! Our daughter loved playing with the hosts kids in the tree house! Thanks so much for hosting us!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding hospitality!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice little space for myself and my 3 kiddos. They even let me borrow a playpen for my 1 year old, since I totally spaced bringing one."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fine place to stay in Logan.
2021-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very roomy one bedroom with nice flooring. The kitchen drawers were dirty and had peeling layers of shelf paper. Made us not want to cook there/ use the cooking Utensils in the drawers. It was also drafty. An extra heater in the bedroom would have been nice. Some blinds didn‚Äôt work.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was needing a place for myself for long term and it worked out perfectly! It was a great location. It was just me staying there, at an Airbnb that was technically for 4 guest, so Troy and Aubree were kind enough to allow a couple friends stay for a few nights during my 4wk stay. that was definitely a bonus! If there was any issue they were on top of it and offered assistance at anytime. I greatly appreciated their accommodation. üòäFor me it was an excellent home away from home, especially since I didn't have one yet. Thank you!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay! Had everything that we needed to work remotely there for a week (stocked kitchen supplies, fast wifi that supported multiple simultaneous zoom calls, toiletry basics). Very nicely furnished and felt very modern and comfortable! Hosts were very helpful and responsive to questions. Only thing to note is that the apartment is the basement level and there were many footsteps/children making noise/piano playing upstairs. It was not disruptive to us and our work calls that we take on headphones were uninterrupted by the noise, but it definitely was not silent if you are looking for that. Not sure if that is the usual activity that occurs upstairs but that was our experience. Overall great place to stay and super conveniently located to the town of Logan and local ski resorts!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely place! Definitely would recommend!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely fits the description of it being cozy!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy & Aubree's basement apartment is a great, centrally located space in Logan. Beautifully decorated and well equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Walking distance to all the necessities and a short drive to the mountains and hiking trails. Aubree was very welcoming and accommodating with recommendations and offers to help with store runs. Very reliable internet and hot water also!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy & Aubree's place was lovely and spacious. Communication was super friendly and quick - and they checked in to see if we needed anything else after we checked in, which was much appreciated. The bed is big and comfy and the electric fire place in the living room is perfect for a chilled evening after going for a hike (we went to second dam which was a short drive away and had great trails and views)."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed at Troy & Aubree‚Äôs place and it‚Äôs been great both times! Very clean and lots of space for our 1 year old to run around. Check in and communication were great. This is by far our favorite place to stay in Logan!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute basement apartment with cozy touches! We loved the fireplace! Hostess is so kind and friendly!
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was perfect for our stay. Great location, close to usu and downtown logan. All good! Thanks"
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay for one or two people. It was a little confusing on how to get in. It is appropriately priced for what you get.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very Nice
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with easy access to everything in Logan. Autumn leaves were changing and the neigjbirhood‚Äôs big trees were gorgeous. Hosts were wonderful.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay! We'll be back!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Not for people much over 6' though.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay in the heart of Logan! Large, comfortable space and close to downtown. Very friendly hosts and a great place to stay!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would let others know about your place
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Aubree was a wonderful host and made sure to respond quickly and offered to give us local tips and places to eat. Her home was sparkling clean and inviting. Very spacious and lots of amenities. The kitchen was super roomy and allowed us to have a few friends over for dinner and have a movie night.
The home is perfect for a small family and allows lots of privacy and space. I highly appreciate and value how clean it was kept and I would highly recommend it.
There was a bit of noise from kids upstairs running around, but Aubree kept them quiet during quiet hours and I appreciate that.
The location is ideal and very close to shopping, dining and everything else. Ideal location and plenty of parking.
We feel safe, secure and comfortable during our stay."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A cozy and quiet place as advertised. The location is close to shopping and restaurants. The kitchen is spacious. There is a lot of light for a downstairs unit.
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place has all you need for simple night of rest if you‚Äôre just passing through. If you‚Äôre planning to stay a few nights as we did, then there were a few key things missing: no paper towels or kitchen towels, no Kleenex/tissue, no dish soap, and only 2 full size plates. And I realize it‚Äôs during Covid and the owners are upstairs, but the noise level was really disruptive, especially in the morning and early evening. At times it sounded like kids or pets just running throughout the house plus piano practice, which was no great since I was working during the day while there. The WiFi was really great though and the noise level always was quite at night for sleeping. So again great if just passing through, which I imagine most are."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place with all the things you need!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trou and Aubree were very responsive when I had a couple of questions, and the space was adorable! Perfect for what I needed. They even had a pack and play I could use. They were very helpful and great hosts! Such a clean and conveniently located spot!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place so I could drive to Bear Lake for several marathons. It was much cheaper than getting something on the lake. Anyways, the place is bigger than I expected with your own room, dressers, bathroom, living room area, and a kitchen with all the amenities you need. I was a little concerned about the heat but the rooms stayed cool for the most part. They even have a couple AC units in case it did get a little too warm.
Their backyard is big with a couple places you can sit and relax. It would definitely make a good place to have conversation with friends in the evening.
Aubree gave me some tips early on regarding local restaurants they like to visit. I didn't realize how close these local restaurants were to them.
Overall, I was very happy with my stay and had 0 issues."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Decent place if you're out and about in Logan! The beds were comfy and the spacious kitchen was very convenient.
Troy and Aubree were gracious, communicative hosts."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, relaxing space for an amazing price!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Small bathroom not great for a big person
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A nice cozy place, a great central location, and a great value. Aubree & Troy were great. We stayed with them 11 days and all went well well. Plus Aubree even gave me a thread and needle to replace a button and Troy gave me some lubricant to help repair my hiking poles. Jan and I had a wonderful stay with them and hiking a different amazing trail every day. Thank you"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice and comfortable place! Location is very convenient, near shops & restaurants. Aubree was very helpful and friendly, she‚Äôs a super host!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Troy and Aubree‚Äôs place is a super cute, clean place to stay that is close to town.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts are amazing, very helpful and the apartment is adorable. Super spacious and clean"
2020-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cute little apartment, fairly new paint and flooring, well decorated. Helpful hosts. Expect some noise overhead. Nice soft king-size bed, though sinking a little in the middle. If you are tall, just know that the ceilings are quite low."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great family! A nice place to stay for a short time. The place is great for a couple or a single person.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place, well located, and exactly as described in the description. I was particularly surprised at the size of the kitchen which was bigger that I had imagined.
Troy and Aubree were especially responsive and checked to see if there was anything we needed which I thought was particularly thoughtful."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was clean, a good location and value. The kitchen had all we needed and nice decorating touches throughout. It was clean and our hosts were quick to reply to any questions. Felt it a safe neighborhood too. The bed was very comfortable as well."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aubree and Troy‚Äôs place is great! The apartment is large, with a king size bed and still plenty of room. The kitchen is quite spacious as well and has everything you would need to cook a nice meal including a large fridge. The apartment is very clean and freshly painted with new floors. The apartment was quiet and pretty close to basic shopping needs and local restaurants. The apartment is worth every penny, you can‚Äôt stay at a hotel for the cost of this entire apartment! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in a very central location in Logan, UT. Cute little space, but very loud first thing in the morning. You can hear literally every noise above you, so do not expect to sleep in. Unfortunately, quiet and sleeping in was a big part of what I was looking for, but if that is not part of what you are looking for, you will LOVE this space."
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, loved the fire on a cold winter night! Not many places have a king bed, so that was a plus. Bathroom just a little on the small side for my really tall husband!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was so nice! Aubree and Troy were very responsive and the place is clean, cozy, and cute. It‚Äôs in a great location close pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. It was a great stay and they provided everything we needed."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed in this apartment for a couple of weeks over Christmas. Our home had sold and we were moving out of state at the end of the year.
Aubrey and Troy were amazing! This apartment was very tastefully decorated, had a spacious kitchen and one of the most comfortable beds we‚Äôve ever slept in!
Troy and Aubrey went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was wonderful! We‚Äôll always look back fondly on the Christmas we spent here!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy and Aubree have done an amazing job with this property, it was clean, spacious and exceptional quiet. The location was also fantastic. Just a short drive or bike ride to USU and walking distance to the best restaurants and shops."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great space that has everything you need for a cozy trip to Logan.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable. More than willing to help with information about the area. Great place to stay in Logan! Close to everything!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Troy & Aubree's place was my first Airbnb experience, and I won't be able to recommend them or their place highly enough for a quick review. They are attentive, thoughtful, and genuinely curious about their guests without being nosy. The place is just as advertised and well furnished and very clean. It is so awesome to have on-site parking in Logan, off street for those dates within the snowplow restricitons so the driveway was a big hit for me. Very easy access to the rooms, and was able to come and go freely without feeling intrusive or intruded upon. I really enjoyed my stay here and intend on booking with them again as often as my travels to Logan permit! Great value, good people, and a cozy, quiet, clean space to safely rest. It was perfect for my needs."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you expect and more.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy & Aubree have an amazing place! It was bigger than we expected, private, comfy bed, and a very great stay for us. We will book here again in the future."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best things about this place were its roominess, the fireplace, the good location, the easy check-in procedure, the comfortable bed in the bedroom, and Netflix."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great clean place with everything you need for your stay. Awesome location right by what you need. This place made for a fun easy baseball weekend in Logan. My kids have asked that we stay there next year!!!
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts are great communicators and welcoming, the location is convenient (a few blocks off Main Street and various stores and restaurants). It is a basement apartment, so there is less light and you can hear people walking upstairs. That said, the bed is very comfortable and since we didn't spend much time indoors, this worked out fine for us."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our first AriBnB experience and we're sold. I certainly get why this place was rated so positively. We were very comfortable, and it was a great little apartment.
Thank you Troy and Aubree!"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Basement apartment has a full kitchen, a living room with hide-a-bed sofa, large screen TV and an electric fireplace. The bathroom is small but has all the essentials. Shower is small but worked fine for us. The bedroom is quite large and has a king sized bed, dresser, end tables and a chair. There is also a small closet.
Both the living room and the bedroom have window air conditioning units that worked fine. We needed a place with a full kitchen that this place fit the bill perfectly."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. This spacious rental was ideal for our stay. My husband could take early morning conference calls in the kitchen while I slept in or used the bathroom without any disturbance with his calls. Also, what a great value!!! It is a basement conversion so the ceilings were a bit comically low. Needs updating but you can't beet the price or the location and was clean. Our host had even turned the a/c on for our arrival. Very lovely family. I would happily stay her again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Troy and Aubree's place is fantastic. It comes with a full kitchen and has all amenities you will need. It's close to local grocery store, and just next to the main road. Yet the environment is quiet.
Aubree is a very warm and considerate host. Recommended."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and cozy! The bed was so big and super comfortable, and everything in the apartment was very convenient! Location was perfect for anywhere in town you would like to visit ‚ù§üëç"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Troy and Aubree were very friendly and helpful. The home is clean, bright and cozy and it's very close to shopping, restaurants and USU. The king size bed is very comfortable. We loved the large TV and the comfy leather sofa. The sofa bed is firm but comfortable (the first time I've ever been able to tolerate sleeping on a sofa bed). It's an older house but that's part of its charm."
2019-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"I feel that the price for this listing is a good value for the size and location, however I feel that the place needs to be cleaned a little more throughly. It was very dusty and caused my allergies to flare up and it also needs to be sprayed because there were a great deal of spiders in the apartment."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They were very friendly people and very good to work with. We enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend it for anyone!
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Perfect for small group. Your place was clean and inviting. Would stay again.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED this place. It was spacious, private and comfortable. The hosts couldn't be kinder or more responsive. We felt like guests, not paying customers. It was a pleasure and I don't plan to stay anywhere else when in Logan. Ever. It was wonderful"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even though it‚Äôs a small apartment, it had everything we needed. The hosts were great to communicate with, and available to get us more supplies if need be!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was short as we needed an overnight for an event. It was clean and as described- just what we needed! Too bad we did not have time to enjoy the eggs from the backyard chickens!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an awesome little airbnb! The place was super clean and instantly felt very comfortable. Super cute decor. It was small but spacious if that makes sense. They have a blow up mattress which was super helpful! They even had fresh eggs from their chickens and cereal left out for breakfast. So cool and the eggs were so good!
Overall it was a very nice, affordable and comfortable stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time here. The basement apartment was very clean/tidy, spacious and functional. We felt it was easy to make ourselves at home and relax. My wife worked during the day at the house and she found it very comfortable to set up a place to work on the table. The internet was fast and stable so she experienced no problems taking video calls for work. I worked at the university so the location was very convenient for me to walk to and from the labs. Overall, this was a great find and we would recommend this place to anyone."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex‚Äôs place was the perfect spot for my husband and I to stay in Logan. It‚Äôs close to the university, shops, restaurants, & beautiful hiking trails. His place was just as described with a few extra unexpected treats provided such as fresh eggs from his chickens, chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. He was extremely accommodating - helping us with some last minute requests that we had. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the Alex‚Äôs Airbnb when I was in between housing in Logan. It was a great location and a comfortable stay.
Very thoughtful hosts that provided a couple of breakfast options. I will definitely recommend this spot in the future when I have friends coming to Logan to visit."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love this little Airbnb. Such a cool use of the space and so nicely done. Really easy to access love that I had its own little parking spot.

Alex was an amazing host to accommodated a bizarre little request we made and we really appreciated him making our day especially welcoming. Really made us feel like he wanted us there. Would love to have us back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I came to Utah to see family and Ski, and stayed at Alex‚Äòs place for three nights.
It was ideal with our two kids, and less than five minute drive to restaurants, and 45 minute drive to the best ski resort ever. Beaver Mountain .
Very clear instructions. Very clean.
Alex lives upstairs and is a perfect host‚Ä¶
Nice quiet neighborhood.
They‚Äôre nice big backyard got used by our kids having snowball fights,.
Since we don‚Äôt live near snow, they were very excited.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming, clean and convenient. Sallianne was very nice!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sallianne was great and very responsive!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love it!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great stop on our trip north. We wish we stayed a bit longer as the downtown looked charming. The house was very easy to get into and nicely set up. The beds were very comfortable.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is really beautiful. The area isn‚Äôt the best, but the house is updated, clean, though it could be cleaner. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was nice. We were unaware someone lived in the basement and found the door leading downstairs. It was unlocked and when we went down is when we discovered lights on in a room and music playing. We messaged Sallianne about it and I appreciated her answering. She said the description says it is a shared space, but only in mentioning the laundry, otherwise it says whole house, so we thought it was the empty. The door to the basement should have a deadbolt for safety, never mind that it wasn‚Äôt even locked when we were there. If that is resolved it is a good place to stay and a good price. Not too many checkout instructions and cute decor."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place! The entire house is super clean and organized. It's in a nice area in the center of town so you have easy access to everything. I don't have a single complaint about this place!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect home for my family while we visited relatives in Cache Valley. The home was clean, organized and cozy. Walking distance to grocery store and restaurants and short drive (longer walk) to bars, art gallery, coffee shop, Federal Ave shops and typical suburban stores (Walgreens, Walmart) and chain/fast food restaurants. The home was well equipped with extra blankets and pillows, plenty of kitchen supplies (including drip coffee maker), and laundry in the basement. Living room and master bedroom TVs had Roku and wifi was reliable. I enjoyed my coffee on the porch every morning. We will stay here again when visiting Cache Valley."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôll first say the space is very nice, was very clean, and it is in great location. However, we had the scariest experience we‚Äôve ever had in a short term rental here. While the stay is listed as ‚Äúentire home,‚Äù we discovered it‚Äôs actually a shared space. When we arrived we found laundry in the washer so we contacted the host who didn‚Äôt respond. A few minutes later, we were scared to death when we suddenly heard voices in the laundry room. I yelled out to ask who was there and it turned out to be the people living in the basement. Needless to say, we were shocked to discover they had access to the area we were staying in. I immediately contacted the host and they responded with a screen shot regarding the guest access description. I pointed out that that does not negate the fact that it‚Äôs clearly listed as ‚Äúentire home.‚Äù There is a lock on the basement door, but it‚Äôs an interior lock and keyed so that it could actually be opened on the basement side, which gave us no peace of mind."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely and comfortable stay at the Abode on Main. The home was nicely updated and was a very nice space to be in. The beds were very comfortable as were the sofas. We enjoyed spending time in the living room with our family. The kitchen was well stocked. The bathroom towels were clean and cozy. Shower water pressure was great. We will definitely look to rebook for future visits to Logan.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and felt right at home! About 1.4 miles to USU and very walkable. Was nice to have access to a washer and dryer as well. Kitchen had all the necessities for an enjoyable stay!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was very comfortable and quite clean. I wasn't expecting that there would be tenants living in the basement, but they have a completely separate entry from this Airbnb. You do share the laundry room with the tenants, though.

There were so many grasshoppers as we would walk up to the home. The yard was bad. It would be nice to have a back patio to sit out on for breakfast but it looked like junk.

We only stayed one night so we didn‚Äôt need all the accommodations in the kitchen which included plenty of flatware, dishes, coffee maker, blender, and waffle maker.
We enjoyed the complimentary bottled water, chocolates, and Roku TV. The couches were cozy and there were a lots of soft blankets to snuggle under.
There were lots of towels in the bathroom and had plenty of hot water for a few people to shower.
The beds were all comfortable and very clean.
Checkin was easy and they let us know as soon as they were finished cleaning so we could get in as soon as possible.
The house is just off of Main Street, close to Angies, McDonands, and many, many other places.
My only recommendation would be to set tissue boxes around the house.
Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Josh were both very good at response times when I needed it.
I had a little trouble getting in the second time but wisely they had a backup.
The rooms were large and as pictured, except I thought the bathroom picture showed a walk in shower, which was a selling point for my disabled mom. It is NOT a walk-in shower. Needs a little more upkeep or update, but good enough for the time we spent."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was terrific. Much more space than I needed but it was great to feel like I was ‚Äòhome‚Äô for a week rather than stuck in a hotel. Rooms were well decorated without being cluttered. I loved the little ‚Äòoffice room‚Äô.

Nice cabin feel to the decor."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We were just there for a quick overnight stay. The beds were comfortable. The house was warm and that made all the ladies happy. It is an older home but it was clean and it has some cool craftsmanship and charm from the past.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was a fabulous host and very responsive and helpful. The on-site property manager in the back apartment was also very kind and helpful. Unfortunately the property itself had more deferred maintenance than we expected. Amenities such as bathroom soap, shampoo and kitchen supplies were more limited or non-existent than we expected. Overall, we had a wonderful visit and the location was very convenient for us."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and an easy morning walk for a breakfast burrito
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"place was a bit dusty, but overall good experience."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Met our expectations and very walkable to grocery store and restaurants. We enjoyed the porch often and appreciated the chairs and table. The neighbor‚Äôs sweet cat was kind enough to visit and hangout too.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place just as described. I was just sad we couldn't stay longer!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location right in the middle of Logan. All I needed was a place to stay the night before a big event on Saturday and this was perfect for that. Everything was clean and nice but definitely outdated and old. As long as you're not expecting anything more, this is a good place for you."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Fit our needs well. Would stay there again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very responsive host. Perfect location convenient to town. Will definitely go back again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice older home very spacious and clean. Has everything you need. Host was very accommodating on our arrival time which we booked on short notice.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we really enjoyed our stay. it was comfortable, very spacious and clean.
we had a little trouble opening the lock but figured it out.
Owners very accommodating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With a 5 star rating, I would highly recommend this Air B&B. It was a very clean older home. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was just like home with microwave, dishwasher and a full size fridge. There was internet access. The caretaker was quick to respond when we asked about the porch light. He was resourceful and had set up a light so when we came home late one evening, the porch had light. Lisa was friendly and quick to respond to a few questions we had. This home was in a very quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you for sharing this home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a wonderful deal for the price. Being an older house, it has character, quirks, and oddities.
We were there to rest and clean up after the car show {Cache Valley Cruise In} so we didn't need to travel anywhere but the fairgrounds.
Make sure you read the instructions when you get there. I mistakenly parked in front of the tenants garage and had to zip out and move my hooptie before he got home.
Great place and would reccomend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was exactly what i wanted.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,everything when good exepte the fact that it was kind hard to get inside the house it was clean

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay with basic amenities.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lisa's place was great for our Little Red Riding Hood stay. Close to everything. Clean cozy and quiet.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was open and upfront from the beginning about repairs in progress and being an older home. It was private and in a very quiet neighborhood. Close to many restaurants and shopping. It was a nice place to stay and relax for a couple of days.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the location was very good.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the the porch. Was very quiet. Just what we were looking for.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lisa was very friendly and helpful with any questions. I was very grateful to find such a nice private place at such a low price. Don't expect glamour, but it is a comfortable and well-located home, with all the amenities for an extended stay. Definitely worth the price."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy and peaceful‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is very spacious and heats easily. Very weak Wi-Fi and cell signal. Water is hard so my skin was dry dry dry. Allows use of laundry facilities which was a great added bonus. Back apartment appears to have access to the home with no lock out option from the inside. Didn‚Äôt like that as a single female traveling alone. Bring your own soap, shampoo & conditioner."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"As Lisa states in the listing, the home is older and does need a few repairs. However, it was very clean. Worked great for our overnight stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great Place!!
I had a wonderful time, I‚Äôd like to come back, Lisa is amazing"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Homey spot. Loved cooking on the gas range.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, exactly as described. Great location."
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,A decent place to put your head down. Not a great place if you need speedy internet.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! Lots of room and every amenity we needed. Two bedrooms, laundry facilities, and a full kitchen with off street parking, wow! Will be looking for this place on return trips to the area."
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely neighborhood and we always appreciate the historical aspects of similar stays. The parking could be better lit especially for those with deficits and in winter when it‚Äôs darker out and more likely to be slick. The interior was much better than the more aged appearance outside and more welcoming and lived up to the write up. The gas stove was a pleasure to cook on but the tools were a little lacking for those who really cook. The bathroom was lovely clean and modern but while there was great hot water at the sink the shower couldn‚Äôt warm up to even tepid. The beds were good and ensured a great nights sleep. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice accommodations. Highly recommend if you're in Logan Utah.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is in a great location and is a good choice if you‚Äôre looking for value. It‚Äôs very roomy and comfortable. The place was very clean. Hosts were great with communication.
The house is just as described. It suited our travel needs very well.
Take coffee with you if you‚Äôre a coffee drinker.
We had a great stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place is wonderful! We were amazed that the kitchen had everything we needed to make cookies together, watch movies together on the couch, and the beds are comfy! Everything is super cute, well labled, easy to find, check-in and out is easy, and Lisa responds to questions lightning quick! We loved being so close to USU since we were visiting our daughter who is a student there. We loved being so close to stores and Logan Canyon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very helpful and accessible
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is a fantastic host. She was very prompt to respond to our communications. Her Cache Cottage was pristine and in a very quiet neighborhood. We loved our stay and would highly recommend Lisa. She is a fabulous host
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an extraordinary stay with nothing but positive things to say things to say about the team approach that was utilized to make sure that our comfort and needs were addressed.
This house is never going to be mistaken for The Ritz Carlton, But if you want to feel home like you're in the home that you grew up in, this is your place.
In relative short timing we needed to find a place for 4 days as my son's studies started before his apartment was ready.
What we ended up having happen was we located the place that we will consider home whenever it's available during the tenure of our son's time at USU.
To give the team kudos is not enough for it's not enough for their collective approach in making our comfort a priority.
I can't express enough platitudes regarding our experience."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for large rooms. Good location. Responsive host.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little house. The kitchen was perfect for our needs and the table was big enough for all the games we played. Very central to all of Logan. Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this was a great stay for myself and my family. Lisa and Josh was very attentive. We will definitely recommend this location
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Double check with host if there is anything in the listing - like use of the yard or number of available rooms - that is important to you. Listing may not be up to date.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great stay! Hosts were friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect; house and neighborhood were quiet and safe. Charming, spacious."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Responsive host and great location!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great place! Primely located just two streets away from Main Street, it‚Äôs a great place a car ride away from just about all the stores you need. The kitchen works great and is very functional. You definitely get a lot for what you pay. I‚Äôd recommend this place to just about anyone!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Airbnb was close to Main street and easy access to USU. Great value and great location. Lisa was awesome to work with.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, close to stores!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location! Three blocks off Main Street. We walked every day and always found something new. My favorite thing in the house is the fireplace in the master bedroom. The house is roomy and the neighborhood is quiet. Highly recommend Cozy in Cache!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great host. Great home. Great location.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mindy‚Äòs place was quiet and very clean. Had everything you needed. Bathrooms are a little small, but not a dealbreaker. The side lamps in every room are phone chargers. That was probably the coolest thing that we have ever seen at an Airbnb. Mindy‚Äòs place is located in a great location, close to town and close to the university."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, close to lots of things to do. Great host and quick response. Mindi sends messages and asks questions to make sure stay is going well."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Mindi was always so fast to answer any questions we had.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderfully cozy spot both with location and the house itself. Mindi provided great local recommendations and all the amenities one could want in a home away from home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious, clean, warm and welcoming.
Will certainly love to stay here again next time I‚Äôm in town."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My son and I enjoyed our stay at Jed‚Äôs place. Very clean and we felt right at home as soon as we entered the guest suite. Host was friendly and responsive to our needs.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute and stylish place with everything you need at your fingertips. However, no way is the bed a queen as advertised and be ready for activity upstairs. I was surprised that no one mentioned these two items before. Of course you expect some upstairs noise when staying in a basement apt. but it looked like there was a birthday party going on. I am sure he has had them fixed by now but while we were there, 3 stepping stones were loose upturned making the walk to the apt a little more difficult to navigate, especailly at night. He did apologize for the loose stones and his delayed response, but that doesn't ""fix"" things. We also have an AirBnB and so I try discuss any issues privately, but when it took 24h to let us know where there was extra TP for our 3 day stay (more than the 1 roll that was left for us-but there was no more to be found anywhere) I was done. All that being said, we loved the location, decor and the full stocked kitchen."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I enjoyed staying for 2 months a Jed's place while working on a work assignment in North Logan. His family does make noise in the living space upstairs, but I found that comforting and kept me from getting lonely. Very convenient to Green Canyon and North Logan. My only nit was advertised Netflix and Amazon Prime which wasn't available, but I listened to XM Radio most of the time, their WIFI works good. I did use their DIsney subscriptiion a few times. I liked the back patio, rode my bicycle to work and up Green Canyon. Enjoyed soaking in the bathtub."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jed‚Äôs place was perfect for us! Very cute!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay here! Super cute place, comfy bed and everything was SUPER clean! Jed was super responsive. Will stay here again whenever I‚Äôm up skiing at Beaver."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cozy but uncluttered space, loved the big kitchen counter! Easy to get in and back from town. Quiet cul-de-sac area.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Beautiful space! Loved our stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy and beautiful place to stay in the winter. The apartment was plenty warm and had a little Christmas tree set up for us. The two twin roll out beds were perfect for our small family. Jed was friendly too. I will be booking again soon.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jed‚Äôs place was very clean and matched the pictures and description. The place was a little hard to find since all of the surrounding street names are just numbers and GPS took us in the wrong direction, but the host gave clear instructions and we found it even in the dark. Nice neighborhood, very private. Would stay here again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Loved the location as it was so close to USU campus and the mountains!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jed and Annie were super nice ! Got to meet their beautiful doggie sally. Place was super clean and stocked with tons of stuff. Highly recommend staying here if you come visit.
This was my first time to Utah and I‚Äôll definitely be coming back and hopefully stay at Jed‚Äôs place again. Thank you again for allowing me to stay in your beautiful home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space, beautiful and quiet area. Our second stay here. We'll be back next year! Thanks!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! They were very friendly and made the whole time very seamless. The reason for the 4 instead of the 5 star was because the AC turned to heat on us in the middle of the night and that made and it really hard to sleep that night. But that‚Äôs not really on Jed. They really did a great job!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and cozy!! Loved the decor and full kitchen. Also close to many shops and restaurants. If traveling in the area again, we would definitely stay here without a doubt! Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We make trips to Logan often to visit kids. We have usually stayed in a hotel but wanted to try an air BNB this time. I‚Äôm so glad we did. This place is lovely. We are grateful to have found it and we will definitely be back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Jed‚Äôs was great. The place was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. Jed allowed us to check in early after a very early flight and that was greatly appreciated.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This isn‚Äôt my first time at this place and it won‚Äôt be my last! I come to Logan for work throughout the year and this is hands down my favorite place to come due to the quiet neighborhood, the beautiful, clean space, the modern style of the AirBnB itself, and the safety I feel."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, safe area"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space! Spacious with everything you could need. Kitchen and bathroom were spotless. Bed was comfy with nice linens. Super close to USU, which was perfect for our stay (our son‚Äôs graduation). Will definitely stay again when we come to Logan again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for the great accommodation. This was our second visit and we loved it!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Jed‚Äôs space was beautiful and clean. The home is in a very quiet neighborhood. Everything we needed for a two week stay. Very responsive when we had questions. Will definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jed‚Äôs place is great! Very trendy, up to date and functional. I felt comfortable and at home there. We had our three month old with us and Jed offered a pack n play. There was plenty of space for the travel crib and all of our things. The noise from the main house can definitely be heard but only during the day, not during sleeping hours so it didn‚Äôt bother us. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Once we found the home it was fantastic. I think the address in the site has the north and east of the address backwards. We copied it right out of the app and ended up somewhere else ‚Ä¶ ironically at the end of a culdesac. Fortunately we were able to figure it out
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jed was very responsive and his place is very nicely decorated, close to campus and downtown Logan. We had only a short stay, booked last minute, but it was easy to find and he was quick to offer his assistance if we needed it. I would definitely book again when in town. The bed was very comfortable and they thought of all amenities for their guests. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Great bang for your buck. Excellent and kind host!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was pretty great! It had a little bit of a funny smell inside, but we got used to it. Everything was as described. We stayed in the winter so it felt a tiny bit precarious to walk through the yard and down the steps. Some of the pavers moved when you stepped, and there were sleds and scooters on the path cleared to the entrance. Also the bed was a little uncomfortable, we both rolled toward the middle both nights and got pretty hot. The family upstairs was loud, which we read in other reviews, but it was a lot louder than we anticipated. We totally understand having a family above (we also have noisy kids), but we could hear pretty clearly everything above us. Luckily we weren't there during the day very much. I don't think there was any sound insulation between the floors. The couch and TV set up were great! We watched a few movies during our stay and relaxed on the couch. I also appreciated the provided hair dryer so I didn't have to bring my own."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great apartment, felt very comfortable and modern in a spacious one bedroom. The bathroom was squeaky clean and i barely noticed anyone else in the home"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Jed's place! My husband and I arrived in Logan from New Zealand in the very early hours of the morning and found our accommodation to be wonderful, warm and inviting. Easy to find and very easy access. There was a space for us to park our rental car which was great.
We loved staying here so much I have already booked another stay!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was perfect for me and two High School seniors who were in Logan checking out USU campus. It was very clean and the bed and pillows in the bedroom were very comfortable (I can‚Äôt speak to the comfort of the rollaway twin beds). The decor is super cute and they even provide disposable toothbrushes if you forget yours. The post let‚Äôs potential guests know they might hear noise from their family in the main house but the noise was very minimal - quieter than a hotel for sure. Good vibes here. Would stay again.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay in Logan. Close to USU campus, kitchen is well stocked with spices & basics needed to make meals if you choose. It was my birthday weekend & I walked in to find a balloon tied to chocolates. So kind! Thank you."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying here and everything was great! It was a little noisy from someone running around upstairs around midnight, but we brought a fan for white noise and that helped. Sadly, the price this time was about double what it was when we came in May, but I guess the rates go up for the 4th of July. I loved the velvety blanket on the bed so much, I tracked it down to buy my own. Jed was very kind and accommodating. We really like staying here, and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back again!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was just as advertised. Very modern and very well stocked! The most herbs and spices I‚Äôve ever had at an Airbnb, and I love cooking when we stay anywhere. The ad is correct about kid sounds, but we weren‚Äôt bothered. They provided sleep masks and earplugs for those who want a little more distance from normal family sounds. My husband loved the comforter and said it was the best night‚Äôs sleep in a long time."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very clean place with a nice bed. Everything you need in the kitchen.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and super nice and helpful owners :)
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was gorgeous and such a great place to stay.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice basement apartment with an a very well stocked kitchen and laundry, which I appreciated during my stay. Jed was great at communicating and the place is well laid out. However, to get to the apartment you have to walk across the house‚Äôs main lawn and during my stay there were several dog, um, ‚Äúdeposits‚Äù left on the lawn that I had to avoid whenever I came and left. I unfortunately stepped in one at one point, which was pretty unpleasant. The upstairs noise mentioned in the other reviews is also definitely a factor. The owners have children and I don‚Äôt mind hearing them play, but this not a place for a light sleeper or someone who needs to work in silence (though hosts do provide ear plugs for this). I ended up having the same hours as the family, since I woke up to that every morning. It was a bit frustrating but kids will be kids so I made do and I don‚Äôt blame them. Overall, I found my stay pleasant enough, with a few things that could have been a bit better."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, comfortable and relaxing apartment. Great location for Logan and USU campus. Comfy bed, couch, laundry facilities and cooking space with everything you need for an extended stay. Lovely private outdoor space too. We shall return again."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Black House guest suite was private, clean, and simple with modern rustic d√©cor located in a great neighborhood. It had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. We mostly ate in and watched throw back Disney movies on the complementary Disney+ account and played card games which were also provided. We also enjoyed mountain biking in the beautiful Green Canyon which was a very short drive away. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with a variety of spices and basic cooking supplies (flour, oil, sugar). You can hear people walking around upstairs and faint sounds of children especially during mealtimes, but it did not bother us at all. We would definitely stay here again!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and beautiful. Definitely would stay there again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, private, great design, very clean and ‚Äúmountain modern‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt get to meet the hosts but the neighborhood was nice and new and quiet and up near the foothills of the mtns. Gorgeous scenery. Great communication. If you have time drive or bike a mile or two up the road to ‚Äúgreens canyon‚Äù (I think was the name) it was beautiful. Would definitely stay here again.
The house design was really special if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing. I loved the landscaping too. It felt like a mountain property even though you were on the edge of the suburbs. The pavers driveway and walkway was one of the many design highlights. Will definitely stay here again next time I‚Äôm in Logan."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay! My wife and I loved it and would definitely book again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Black House was everything we hoped for. Jed and his wife were extremely accommodating to my husband, 2 year old, infant and myself. 5 starts all the way. I would recommend 100%."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely space to call home for a nearly a week while visiting Logan, UT. I was visiting my son who attend USU and the location was perfect, making it easy for him to stop by. The apartment was exactly as shared in photos and description. The attention to detail and quality was noticed -- from the kitchen to the throw blanket, to the linens and toiletries and soft water. The hosts were attentive, kind and helpful. I am already looking forward to another visit."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jed and Annie‚Äôs place was beautiful and the most stylish Airbnb we have stayed at. Their family was so sweet and they were such warm & friendly hosts. We got to talk with them multiple times throughout our month stay and they were always so kind and helpful! The other reviews were right about hearing the kid‚Äôs footsteps when they‚Äôre running above you but, it was louder in the bedroom so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you‚Äôre not hanging out in there most of the day. The kitchen was probably the most well-stocked we‚Äôve seen in an Airbnb which was so nice. The entire place was so cozy and had everything we wanted."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautiful inside and out. Definitely would recommend this place. However, on day 2 of our stay, there was what appeared to be a young adult male living out of his truck. He was parked right on front of the unit and was using an extension cord to charge something in his truck. He connected the extension cord to the outlet just outside of our door. He had taken a lot of his belongings our from his truck and placed it in the area in front of the unit causing blockage to the unit. He stayed there for about 1 hour and left. Not sure if this is a common thing as we were only there for the weekend. Just be vigilant if you see something like him again."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space and Peggy was excellent to work with. The space was PERFECT for our party of 8 as well! The only complaint was from my hubby, who found the master bed very uncomfortable. It was rather firm but the sheets were buttery soft so I slept well. Hubby didn't the two nights we were there, unfortunately. He felt a ridge in the middle of the mattress and thought it was as hard as a rock. Kids and the other couple didn't have any complaints though. Would have appreciated a hair dryer in the unit. I forgot mine. üò¨"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a comfortable stay overall. The condo is smaller than expected based off of the photos but that was likely due to my own interpretation.

Even though it was a basement of a home, it was very light and spacious. I did not feel like I was in a basement. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the rest of the appliances/furniture were higherend. I loved the location. It was not in the city but within a few minutes (like 5-7 minutes) of Logan proper. The views of mountains were lovely. When I come to Logan again, hope this place is availalbe!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with everything you need! The hosts were terrific. We will definitely be staying here the next time we're in Cache Valley!

I give this 5 stars and it is a great value. Nathan & Paige have an Awesome place.
there was pitter patter of small feet which brought smiles to our faces. The place is very quiet and pleasant. thank you Nathan."

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,very clean and close to town
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's basement apartment was the perfect space for our weekend trip to Logan. This purpose built space is fresh, modern, and had everything we needed. We'll be back the next time we're in Logan!"

I‚Äôd stay here again without a question."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was a great experience! Everything was so clean, just like the pictures, and very comfortable. They even went above and beyond with a cute welcome basket! At one point the code to the room wasn't working (because of a storm, not because of them) and they responded so quick and helped us out almost immediately. We are very pleased with our experience and would recommend you stay here if you need a place in Logan!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The beds were comfortable, kitchen was awesome, and the bathroom was really nice. They were helpful and understanding when we had issued, the only feedback I can think of for myself was I would have liked to sign a guest book. And my husband said an awning above the entry might be useful especially when it rains to help keep the floors from getting too messy. But we appreciate Nathan and Paige very much! It was an amazing experience."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Maria is great. She been absolutely amazing and friendly. I had great stay, the place is really clean and well maintained. There are kayak and other rentals available and in cheap cost. Definitely recommend the Airbnb"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The shared space had a good set of furniture for relaxing, and the kitchen had the basics for reheating or preparing simple things. The room I got had plenty of room for my bags without feeling too cramped, and the bed was comfortable and clean. I can usually tell when the bed hasn't been cleaned somewhere even if it looks and smells good since I have dust mite allergies that let me know when hosts just spray down their pillows with fabreeze or something instead of washing them. I didn't have any issues here, so I can say confidently that the space was clean!"

Free Netflix and WiFi was the best
Bed was comfy"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic place! I wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommended!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and cozy place. Very comfortable bed. Nice and lovely decor and touches. But the issues I encountered is you can hear people outside of your room (in the basement) very clearly. It was noisy at times when other guests were talking, or playing something on their phone. The other issue is the bad ventilation. You can smell whatever people cook/heat in that space, and it enters your room. I wouldn't book this airbnb again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maria's place was super cute! It was easy to navigate (like getting in and parking). It was quiet even though there were other people staying there as well. I enjoyed my night there and would book again.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Maria‚Äôs place is good for those who looks for a budget friendly and clean place. It is not far from central Logan. It is a basement room and you may see other Airbnb people staying in other rooms while you are there.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We‚Äôve stayed here twice now! Great, comfortable place and very reasonably priced!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria was kind enough to let me book this last minute as I went up for a funeral. I did have a little trouble getting in as the door was accidentally locked but she communicated right away and she got me in as soon as she could so I am thankful for that. Very clean and pristine. Kitchen has what you need and the common area is nice. It appears there are four bedrooms to stay in and I was lucky enough to have the whole area by myself as I was the only one occupying one of the four rooms. There are also a few things you can rent: a scooter, four wheeler, and I believe a kayak and the prices are very reasonable. The bed was comfortable and tv worked great. This place is a great deal and I‚Äôd gladly stay here again!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We found this very affordable room for Lotoja Bike Race that was fairly close to start Logan and was quiet.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love staying at Maria‚Äôs place! It‚Äôs always clean, is in a convenient location, and is easily accessible. She‚Äôs super communicative and very responsive; but I think our favorite thing about the place is the kitchen area. It‚Äôs really great to be able to keep our stuff cold during overnight trips! 10/10 would recommend, and the ‚Äúrain‚Äù shower is amazing! This is my preferred place to stay when I‚Äôm in the Logan area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another absolutely delightful and rejuvenating stay. Maria is so kind and has gone above and beyond to make sure that I am comfortable and feel welcome.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cute little Airbnb. Love that it‚Äôs almost Hostel style in terms that there are multiple rooms for guests, and a shared area, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt have a hostel feel. Quite homey actually.
Was a bit difficult to find in the dark, one maps app brought me on the other side of the cemetery but once I used apple maps that seemed to find the location more accurately (not sure why)
Wish I could have stayed longer!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maria is a fabulous host! The aesthetics of the Airbnb were beautiful! Maria is quick to respond to questions and was helpful in accommodating me. It was a sweet stay at a great value!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great stay! The cleanliness is amazing and nothing was skimped on. Common areas had clear, manageable expectations. The decor was rad and very cohesive! Some cereal/snacks available for guests. Maria also allowed us to have a late check out due to some circumstances, which was awesome. Exceeded expectations in every way!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great! It was clean, super private, easy check in and fantastic price! It looked exactly like the pictures and was a perfect place to stay. It did take us a minute to find the location, as the road it is on cuts through the cemetery and begins on the other side. Once we reloaded it into maps it took us to the right place. Definitely would recommend this location and would plan to stay here again if needed!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super easy to find and good location.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is cute, and perfect for the short stay we had during a family reunion. The communication was great there was no confusion on any of the check in process."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication. Easy check in.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the cool basement apartment to sleep.. There was a welcome board that had my name in it with a mint and water which made me feel welcomed . There did seem to be some noise upstairs between 11:30 PM to 12:15 AM each night. Luckily, I I was reading a book.
My personal garbage in my room was full of water bottles indicating another guest have been there previously.
It was a great place to sleep each night ."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a night or two when in town. Maria Jose had excellent communication throughout stay and space was as depicted.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It‚Äôs a really nice place to stay everything was really beautiful.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had to stay in Logan for 5 weeks for work and stayed in a bunch of different airbnbs. Maria Jose's place was the nicest place I stayed.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a very nice stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Somehow, I inadvertently overlooked that I would be sharing the space with other renters. When I first arrived and discovered that, I was a little disappointed (in myself, for not noticing that ahead of time). I have so very little time to myself and desperately needed one night of peaceful sleep. Aside from being one of the most beautiful, clean and impressive Airbnbs I have ever stayed in, I was amazed at how quiet it was. I'm not sure when I have had a better night's sleep. The bed was so incredibly comfortable, the pillows were the perfect firmness, the room was cool (exactly as I like it for sleep), the air smelled of relaxing essential oils (the owner seriously thought of EVERYTHING), the home owner was quiet above me and the other renters were also so respectful and quiet. I crashed almost immediately (which never happens for me) and slept so soundly. Although it was just an overnighter for me, it did me a WORLD of good. The only negative, was not being able to stay another night. Five stars and highest recommendations for this beautiful sanctuary away from home."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the rainfall shower is awesome be aware there is not a full kitchen. Just a hotplate microwave and apartment size fridge with a single small sink and no dishwasher but the price is good and all the amenities are nice. I would definitely stay again
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and quiet, highly recommended."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Was very clean, Maria responds very quickly, the communication was great. I definitely would not be opposed to staying there again if I am traveling that way."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My room at Maria Jose‚Äôs was great. I appreciated the detailed information in each room, the lighting, and the decor."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room is clean and very well maintained. The hosts make the stay very pleasant with all of their personal touches and thoughtful additions to the experience. If I‚Äôm ever in Utah again I‚Äôll definitely stay here!üëçüëç
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mar√≠a Jos√© has a nice place, comfy and really good for the price. If you have a big group there are three bedrooms that would make a good stay for the entire family"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good place to stay, quiet location, well-equipped kitchen, dining area and living room
1 bathroom for 3 rooms: was hassle-free in the 2 days we were there.
But if someone (experienced in Sugar City) is occupied for 40 minutes !! the bathroom, then .....
The only weak point: it was a bit too cold. Central air conditioning control, although you can close the air outlet, then there will be a little less (-10%) air whistles for it.
Overall good value for money."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, exactly as described, great atmosphere"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy stay, perfect for our needs."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria Jose‚Äôs place is really clean and well organized. She gave very clear instructions and the area used to guests was separate from the rest of the house and had a fridge and a hot plate and cool common room. It‚Äôs close to the Wind Caves, which was a cool hike."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria's place was super clean, cute, and cozy. Highly recommend and will probably be back in the future!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a nice space, like a little suburban hostel. Common space has a fridge, one electric burner, a microwave, and coffee pot to use. Very affordable and a nice bedroom."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciate the clean and well decorated room. The entire unit was wonderful and welcoming, the bed comfortable and I slept peacefully. When I next return to visit my daughter, I will look for availability of this property first. Take Care."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. This is the perfect place for a new Airbnb user, it‚Äôs a good way to get a feel for how shared spaces work. The only reason why this did not get a five would be that the bed was a little too firm but other than that I would give everything else a 5 star"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maria was quick to respond and gave easy directions on where to park and how to get into the rooms with no problems. The aesthetic of the room I stayed in was absolutely adorable. Would definitely stay again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet and easy. We accidentally stopped at the place just before, being dusk and couldn‚Äôt read the house number, but it was all good. The neighbor was amused and pointed the way.
Easy access through the garage. Surprisingly pleasant basement accommodation with everything you need and super-duper tidy. Very pleased."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Downstairs apartment, is listed room by room, but also the whole thing can be reserved on a separate listing. If you don't want any roommates. We were gone most of the day, so we had very little interaction with any of the other people. The ones we did see were friendly. The rooms are all kept clean and with nice thoughtful touches to make your stay relaxing. Also a very good value for the accommodations. With many different experiences within only an hour or two drive. Host response is very quick and reliable."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mindi's home is amazingly perfect. I enjoyed my stay and will be staying again. This is by far the best home in Logan UT. If only i could give more than 5 stars. :) Thank you Mindi
,,,"I don‚Äôt recommend this unit for those with children or a need for a quiet space. The unit is nice but is placed directly beneath the house where there is never ending running back and forth of loud footsteps. The hosts have every right to be as loud as they want in their home but it was hard to relax and enjoy our stay.
I love the city of Logan and we enjoyed the location of the unit as it was really close to everything we needed.
Thank you"
,,,You can not make any dishes or something good to eat because kitchen accessories are not fully available.
,,,"I will not leave a negative feedback to Maria but I would suggest that you do better than I in finding her home. It may have been my fault, but I could find her place and ended up staying in my car for the evening."
