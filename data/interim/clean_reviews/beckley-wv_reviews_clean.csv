2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a weekend while visiting family in Beaver. Very cozy and clean. The host even left coffee pods, creamer and a couple of snacks! Loved it and will definitely try to stay again on our next trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our favourite place to stay on our travels to see family in the south! Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay for our one night stay passing through the area. Tracy pays attention to the details. We didn’t cook due to short stay but snacks, tea (and honey!!) , coffee and creamers available during our stay was appreciated. The bed was comfortable, the step in shower perfect for my husband w/ mobility challenges and the soaps smelled amazingly calming. We did not have neighbors during our stay in this duplex so unsure how that would have affected our stay. We saw bunnies out the kitchen window and loved the peacefulness we got to experience during our stay. Tracy was responsive and kind. We plan on passing through Beckley annually going forward and would stay here again."

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"I don’t like leaving negative reviews, but immediately on check in I had a guy using a weed wacker to cut grass right next to my truck; luckily no damage. The apartment’s bedroom was ice cold during check in and the remote to control the AC unit didn’t work. I reached out asking if there was something special that needed to be done to use it, and I got little help; I ended up using the front room’s remote and freezing for the first night. The apartment’s walls are VERY thin, and you will hear everything next door. Finally, the WiFi doesn’t hardly reach into the bedroom, so my phone would go in and out of WiFi. I ended up just turning WiFi off of my phone because it was so irritating. All in all, not the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for a short stop during my travels. The instructions for parking and check-in were very clear and easy to follow.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This little gem served our needs well. Beautiful inside as pictured. Sits in a normal residential area that is within 10 minutes of the bulk of Beckley shopping and dine in restaurants. Pricier than a hotel room but felt like a pampered getaway.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfy bed, great communication from host on how to find the home, it would be tricky if not. My only issue was being able to hear the neighbors, however they were not noisy, just thin walls/floors. Would stay here again."

The duplex does share a wall and has an apartment a above so you can hear other guests if they are around but it didn’t bother us. Definitely good for two people, three might be a little tight. Exactly as described plus it’s a great location for getting to the New River Gorge state park either the northern section with the famous bridge or to the south to Grandview area."

Small homey things are included to make our stay nicer which was great (olive oil, basic seasonings, pots and pans, shower gels, etc.) My only complaints would be the neighbors upstairs.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely love the cabin and pond. We caught a total of 30 fish while there for two nights. Everything you need for the stay is included, even down to a playpen for your little one."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfy. Beautiful views and hosts were super nice. Reba and Butter, the two horses were a hoot!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful two nights at the adorable and roomy cabin. The cabin came well equipped and Jill was kind enough to provide a couple of extra items that we requested. The view is lovely, overlooking a cool pond. We were on the move a lot while we were there so we did not have the opportunity to take advantage of the trails and all there is to do on the property but I would encourage anyone who stays there to allocate some time to explore and hike some of the abundant trails and do some fishing if that is to your liking."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough good things about our trip and cabin stay! We will definitely be back! Thanks to Jill and cliff for making us feel comfortable and welcoming!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jill and Cliff were amazing hosts! The cabin, and property, were just what we were looking for on our long weekend trip. We loved the comforts of the cabin, the privacy and our daughter loved the fishing ponds and horses. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was easily the best Airbnb we have stayed at. Cliff and Jill were amazing hosts and the cabin was perfect for our weekend. We will definitely be returning to spend more time in the future.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here to go snowboarding at winterplace, and might I just say this was one of the most peaceful and beautiful place I’ve stayed at on Airbnb. I would recommend to anyone!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful I felt so at peace and so relaxed this was such a breath of freash air! Jill was so kind hearted and easy to talk too no matter what we needed they were there within minutes!

We loved fishing & checking out the ponds, while the kiddos loved to pet the horses. Had great photo opportunities all over the place too! Enjoyed a bonfire & night fishing also. Loved being up in the secluded hollows of WV! Beautiful property - we’ll definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Almost Heaven: There are no better words to describe this place. Absolutely beautiful. So peaceful and relaxing.
The hosts could not have been nicer, true southern hospitality. If you are looking for the perfect getaway? This is it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want peace and quiet in an absolutely beautiful setting, you need to stay in Jill's cabin. We roamed all over the farm, fished a bit (didn't catch anything, but it was still fun), saw deer and a flock of wild turkeys! The bedrooms are a bit small, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to stay inside for long, with all the space to play outside. We didn't have small children, but it would be perfect for the entire family. The cabin is cozy and has a swing and two rocking chairs on the porch, which we certainly took advantage of. Jill and Cliff are perfect hosts, making us feel so welcome. Can't wait to go back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My wife and two children wanted a nice weekend that was off the beaten path (but not too far) where we could disconnect from every day life for a couple days. This was the perfect place. My son and I have recently gotten into fishing. This cabin sits right on a big catfish pay lake ( which is free if you're staying there) and also has 4 other ponds to fish other species that you can hike to and enjoy. Jill and Cliff were wonderful hosts. Made us feel comfortable and welcomed. We will be back!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Completely enjoyed our stay even with the crazy weather elements! Jill and cliff are the sweetest people, eager to invite you to enjoy their beautiful homestead. Absolutely gorgeous not to mention fishing was a blast. We will definitely be returning with some family. They lit up when they realized what they missed! My grown kids won’t make that mistake again!! Hahaha cabin is simply adorable and feels like home away from home! Y’all might wanna consider more cabins in the future, maybe 1 or 2 more. U build everyone will come! With 8 kids we could fill them all!! Hahaha"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Husband and I could never express enough gratitude for the kindness we were show by Jill & Cliff. The Cabin was so very quaint, the porch swing was so enchanting as I set there and looked over the beautiful lake and hillside scenery. I felt like I was inside a picture, just enjoying the ride. My husband enjoyed fishing and Cliff gave him a golf cart to trolley around this huge property. It is very unique to meet such truly kind, and caring people today, But we were very blessed to have been the guest of Jill & Cliff. Thank you for all your kindness"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a relaxing weekend at this place! Jill is a fantastic host! Loved watching the night fishing. Nothing bad say about the cabin, the host, or the stay. Looking forward to back there soon."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved this location. Fishing a plenty (catfish 10# to 34# witnessed), wildlife galore (deer, turkey, rabbits, and 2 horses), and quiet. You can spend your time in town or you can spend your time at the house relaxing."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, very clean and well organized. We have already booked you can't go wring with this cabin!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing, very quite, cell coverage can be spotty, could only get LTE. Since that was kind of the point of going to this location that was great."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our anniversary weekend! So beautiful, clean, quiet and serene! Jill is so accommodating. We literally wanted for Nothing! And please… have the bbq sandwich too!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful time on this property. Jill and Cliff are the nicest people you will ever meet. The cabin was perfect, clean, well appointed right in front of the largest pond on their vast property with many ponds.. The cabin was clean and had everything you needed to spend a long weekend. My husband, son and his friend fished until the wee hours of the evening and caught several fish. We used the fire pit and the boys had s’mores and great conversation around the fire. I throughly enjoyed relaxing in the rocking chairs on the porch.. So peaceful. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute cabin with beautiful scenery surrounded by nature. We enjoyed watching deer run around the lake, a cute goose with her babies, feeding the horses, and of coarse the fishing! It was a perfect getaway for our 20 year anniversary 💗"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the perfect country retreat! It is so peaceful and relaxing. Sitting on the porch listening to the birds was one of my favorite things. The cabin is super cozy and comfortable, it has all the necessities to make it feel like home. We can’t wait to go back again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun fishing, relaxing stay, and nice hosts who live next door. Highly recommend for a peaceful country getaway."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cabin on a beautiful property. Communication with host excellent. The connectivity is not great is that is an issue for you. It is about 40 minutes to the New River Gorge visitor centers. Great value.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly lovely and peaceful place to stay, and coffee on the front porch in the morning is the best treat. Jill and Cliff are thoughtful and attentive hosts!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice quote remote location, very beautiful with snow on the ground and without it got to experience both! The horses are amazing and fun to feed. Jill and her husband are amazing people thank you for an amazing stay!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin is a great getaway from the city life. Jill's extra directions help you easily find the place and it's a nice area.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is very nice and as described. We enjoyed the comfort of it. Many reviewers commented on the Bess being comfortable, and I think that is subjective depending on how firm or soft you like the beds. To my family they were not as comfortable as others described. They are firm mattresses and we do not care for firm. Other than that, it was great!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jill's place is great! It looks like a nice rustic cabin on the outside, but inside its very clean and modern. The shower is great and the HVAC works wonders! The rental sits on their actual property and they also run a pay lake, so if you're a person who loves fishing then this rental is the place for you! Be careful as this rental is some ways down a single land road but in any weather besides a winter storm ( which my group and I had the pleasure of experiencing), you won't have any difficulty navigating."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place. …Beautiful atmosphere. The owner was very nice and always there when needed. Comfortable beds and the place was very cozy.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location beautiful and loving hosts. You feel like you are staying at a friend’s place. Jill and her husband are Amazing. Being with the horses was a dream come true for my children. Thank you Jill for everything. For all the time the tour, the amazing treats for kids and horses. Thank you"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time staying at the cabins. Jill is an extremely great host. We had super fun feeding the horses and my toddler enjoyed that the most. You made his day by sharing the toys and books. The time we came to WV was the perfect time for seeing fall colors and this property is so scenic and serene. We would love to come back and stay at this cabin again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful! We had a great time.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin and area!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a piece of paradise. Jill and Cliff are great people. I’m so happy they share their beautiful property with the other people. We will definitely be back.
Jill and Cliff, thank you for your great hospitality 👍"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Absolutely perfect for our family of 4, my only regret is that we couldn't stay longer! It is definitely not in town, but that's a good thing. Cabin was clean and had everything we could possibly need. We even cought a few fish!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We could not be happier with our experience. The place is clean and the location is stunning. You can't ask for better hosts either. We will be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very nice place to stay. Clean and cozy. You will enjoy your stay no question
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect cabin with great hosts and proximate to all things Wild and Wonderful about West Virginia.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved the cabin! Cliff and Jill are very friendly and personable. Meeting the horses was a highlight. The property is beautiful and secluded. It was very peaceful. Only bad aspect, yellow jackets by the porch. Thank you for the stay!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We've stayed at Cliff and Jill's cabin numerous times. Always the best hospitality of any AirBNB hosts we have encountered. Such a peaceful and relaxing time, scenery is beautiful, and we LOVE fishing!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay here at Cliff and Jill’s cabin! If you are looking for a peaceful getaway, this is the place to go!
The cabin was clean, comfortable temperature, plenty of fans, and had towels and washcloths and extra blankets.
The kitchen was equipped to cook full meals. A cute little 4-5 cup coffee make with built in filter, toaster, pots/pans, microwave and large fridge/freezer with ice maker .
The view from the front porch was amazing. We grilled with provided tools.
Jill encouraged us to walk around their 160 acre fenced-in property , we walked through the pasture and met their 2 beautiful horses. We saw deer all around. Such a gorgeous property, so peaceful!
Friday and Saturday night they host a local fishing tournament and the fishermen are not sitting in front of the cabin and respect your privacy and they hardly made any noise. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed watching them catch huge catfish and seeing the lighted bobbers on the pond!
Things to keep in mind for this place: bring what you need to cook starting from essentials like olive oil/butter, foil, storage baggies/containers for leftovers too.
There is no WiFi and phone service was not available, which was actually a much needed reminder to stay off of electronics for the weekend!
Bring your own shampoo, and other bathroom needs.
Local grocery store, gas station and DQ only 8 minutes down the road.
We definitely would stay here again! Thank you Jill and Cliff for your kindness and hospitality!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don’t miss your chance for such an amazing opportunity as staying at Cliff and Jill’s cabin!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome cabin ! Super cute, clean, great location & wonderful hosts. Thank you Jill and Cliff!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The perfect little place to unplug and get back to nature. Be sure you have a vehicle that can handle a single lane winding road! A sports car that's low to the ground would not be ideal. The place is absolutely beautiful.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first stay at the property with me and my three teens. The hosts, Jill and Cliff, are amazing, incredibly nice and helpful. The cabin is very nice and completely updated inside and had everything we needed for a great stay. Their property is amazing and has great fishing ponds full of catfish, bass, sunfish and more and we spent most of our time fishing when not out enjoying some local activities. We went whitewater rafting and hiking in the New River Gorge both of which were within 30 minutes of the cabin. They have a fully stocked bait store along with rod and reel rentals to make it easy to fish. This is the only cabin on their property so we were the only people there besides Jill and Cliff who have their house on the property - very private and quiet. We would definitely come back and I highly recommend this property."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"45 minutes to the National Park. Perfect, private base camp for our adventures. My son enjoyed the horses, wild turkey, and deer!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The area which this cabin is situated on is beautiful. They have a huge property, ponds to fish in, horses, and it’s just a relaxing environment. Jill and her husband were so kind and just wonderful people, so welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Would recommend staying here and hope to be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Serene place, can easily spend a day at the cabin. Close proximity to many adventure sports."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely an amazing place and so peaceful wonderful hostess. We will most definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin exceeded our expectations. Not only was it clean, comfortable, and beautifully situated....but the hosts were amazing and the fishing a great added bonus of fun. The cabin is near many great attractions in the area, including the National Park and Ace. There is also a very nice lake right near it, where you can relax for family fun. The highlight was the great and gracious hosts who shared wonderful enthusiasm for fishing with the kids and husband. We would love to return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cliff and Jill's Cabin stay was an experience to remember for our family. We have stayed in several Airbnb's but Cliff and Jill's hospitality was beyond comparison. Our 3 year old had a blast petting & feeding the horses, watching the fishing tournament and big fishes getting caught. Highly recommend this stay to everyone who wants to relax in a cabin with amazing view from the porch and away from all the city hustle.
We had more fun than what we had anticipated for, thank you Cliff and Jill !"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay! So peaceful and pretty! Very relaxing .
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cliff and Jill were great hosts! They answered all our questions and helped guide us around the area since we were from out of town. We caught a bunch of catfish and our 10 and 8 year old boys each caught a 34 pounder!!! This is definitely a trip they will never forget. We also enjoyed the swimming beach at lake Stephens which had an inflatable jump park on the lake which the boys loved!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time the two nights we spent at the cabin. I wish we had more time there to fish and relax. Jill and Cliff were wonderful hosts.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You won't regret booking this cabin. From the beautiful lake to the most hospitable hosts you'll find on AirBNB, this place is perfect! Don't worry about planning other things to do while staying here because you won't want to leave!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property is tucked away in West Virginia and it is delightful! I didn’t want to leave! The cabin is by a pond and it was so lovely waking up and drinking my coffee on the front porch and looking at the view.
Jill is the nicest host I have ever met. She was so friendly and inviting. She even ended up giving my cousin some shorts!
I’d definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"3rd stay at the cabin for us. We LOVE it! We love the peacefulness, the scenery, and especially catfishing!! Jill and Cliff's hospitality can't be beat. Always upgrading to make the stay even better. Can't wait til our next stay."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet rural location, away from it all. We enjoyed the pond atmosphere. Our family of 3 adults was there on a weekend, and on Saturday and Sunday woke up to fishing enthusiasts - individuals and families - scattered all around the pond. All very quiet. The cabin is comfortable, kitchen well-equipped, nice front porch to sit on to enjoy the sunrise and the early morning fishing activities."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A private get away great for couples and kids. An amazing view of the pond and horse pastures to relax to. Hospitality is 5 star and location is too. We will be booking again soon.
2021-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Came to Jill’s place for a weekend ski trip. It’s about an hour away from Winterplace and suited our daily needs. Plenty of pots and pans to be used. Everything was clean upon arrival.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the cabin. We had the most gracious hosts. If you want a cozy and quiet place to stay where you can fish or have access to the surrounding areas, this is a great location. We will be sure to book again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The cutest little cabin!! Very nice and there was plenty of room for 6 people to sleep comfortably!!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A nice and beautiful location love the views
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can expect not just a place to sleep but a whole destination at your disposal: fishing, hiking, horses, lakes. The cabin is cute and has everything you need except the dishwasher and the washing machine. Be prepared for poor internet and cell connection. No wifi. But a gorgeous setting for a memorable getaway!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Most calming place we ever stayed!!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jill is one of the most amazing host we ever had. Location of the cabin is picture perfect. Cabin is little small for two families but location, hospitality of the host make up for it. Jilll even let us feed her horses on the property and let us go anywhere on the property. She even gave home grown vegetables & treats to our kids. The place is highly recommended for those who are looking for a break from city hustle. We also did camp fire and wood was provided. Grand view, Babcock and New river gorge are 1 hour drive from this place. Overall we had lovely time at this beautiful place."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and great stay!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a peaceful place. We enjoyed the cabin and the fishing. Once we got there we didn't leave until our check out day. If you are looking for an awesome get away... This is the place!

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place. If you love fishing and wilderness this is the place for you. The host are great people and we loved the horses.
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hospitality is great and the hosts are very nice people. They gave us a warm welcome and ingredients for smores, however.... The physical cabin was a bit small and compact.
We were a group of 4 (2 couples and an infant) and did not have much space inside that cabin.
It is a peaceful place except on Fri and Saturday nights, they have a fishing tournament with 70-80 ppl directly outside your cabin on the lake. If you are into fishing, this place would be amazing I imagine. We are not abd wanted a bit more privacy so it wasn't what we were expecting from that aspect. In addition, one if the reasons we booked a cabin in the woods was to be a bit secluded while seeing friends and one of our guests is high risk for Covid so that played a roll in being taken back a bit by the tournament.
Overall, great people and cozy place. I would reccomend for a couple orvsnall group (2-3) ppl max who love to fish!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful host! Cabin was perfect! Even the beds were comfy which normally aren’t at other places. I would highly recommend. My sons had a great time fishing the lake and even entered the fishing tournament. I had a headache when I arrived and mentioned it in passing and Jill went out of her way to bring me Tylenol. They are great people who make you feel welcome and have a lot of southern hospitality.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Superb hospitality, goes above and beyond expectations. Great view of lake. Cottage clean and well equipped."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,April’s house was conveniently located to New River Gorge which we were visiting with our adult kids. It was easy to find and had everything we needed for a 3 night stay! The beds were very comfortable!

2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were happy with the location of April’s home with relation to the New River Gorge NP. We chose to parallel park our RV in the rear of the home. Parked our car in the front. It was a bit stressful for my husband to back down the steep dead end street with our CLASS A. The home was comfy, but not conducive to cooking meals. We chose to eat salads and microwaved dinners. The SMART TV’s worked well. Thank you April for your kindness."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very responsive and flexible host. Cute house exactly as described in pictures. Perfect for the 5 of us. Conveniently located, however very close to 19, so the road noise can be loud, especially in the morning. Despite that we would stay again if in the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"April was incredibly responsive and her place is very clean, updated and comfortable. It had everything we needed to layover for a night on a long trip home from the beach. Beds were comfy, shower was great, and lots of details to make it feel like home.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would stay again! Very clean, comfy home. The description accurately describes the noise due to the main road but a sound machine is provided. Quick access to everything. We had a great time!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,House is right off the main road so really easy to get to. A little noisy but this is included in the description and a noise machine is offered which helps! We were looking for a place with a full kitchen that was in the middle of the park attractions and this was perfect.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful little home for a couple trying to get away.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We only stayed one night but we stayed comfortably. The airbnb is cute. We drove in during a snow storm and stayed nice and cozy with our baby and fur baby. Just note that there isn't any fenced area or dedicated area to let a pup run around. April was very kind and let us check out a little late.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,No outlets near the head portion of the bed to connect a cpap machine.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This Air Bnb will make you feel right at home. It’s comfy & stylish. It’s also pet friendly. April is kind & her response time is quick. We enjoyed the boho oasis & we will be returning. :)
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place for a short trip with my fiance and our doggo. Close to everything we needed. We stayed here while in town skiing at winterplace. No issues with anything.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Rental was very clean - spotless even. Prior comments about road noise is accurate. Ear plugs would make all the difference. Convenient location to WVA Turnpike.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Was clean and met all our needs and expectations. Worth the price for us. Will definitely stay here again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,April was a wonderful host -- quick to respond and extremely kind. The house is very conveniently located to all the amenities in Beckley and all the access points of New River Gorge.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great close to highway location for what I needed. Only negative was it is literally ON the highway so tricky to get in and out and although I was worried about traffic noise I slept like the dead thanks to the noise machine provided. I loved that it had fridge, microwave etc to make it feel like home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice and right off the highway. sound machine and fan definitely helped road noise. very responsive hosts and allowed later checkout. would suggest upgrading to king size bed for couples. very cozy. nicely decorated.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,April was amazing! She was the most responsive host we’ve ever had! She was kind and extremely informative about things to do in the area. We recently got engaged and I asked if they had wax paper to press a wildflower my fiancé had picked for me- they did not but she said she would deliver some to the house before we arrived and there was wax paper sitting on the kitchen counter when we got there. That was beyond awesome customer service. The house was so clean and lots of linens were provided. Great location close to lots of things!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place !
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute and clean place with everything we needed for our short stay. The traffic was a little noisier than expected but it was a great stay over all.
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Appeared to be like the photos.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was amazing! Thanks so much to April for letting us stay. She was attentive to any questions I had. We even got into the place an hour later and she let us stay an hour past check out.
👏🏻🙌🏻"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the best time at this perfect little cottage! We only stayed one night on our way home from a very long drive, and it really was the perfect place to settle down for the night. All of the animals were so calm and friendly, especially the cats! They left us fresh zucchini bread in the kitchen and it was AMAZING!!! The owners really thought of every single detail and clearly put a lot of work into making this such a cozy spot with everything you could need. The beautiful pond in the back was the cherry on top to such a lovely stay. 10/10!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Quirky place in a great quiet setting
Jill and her husband Guy are so friendly!!
Loved all the cats and kittens"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Storybook Cottage was more than we could have hoped for, so relaxing and comfortable! The cottage itself was so whimsical and the animals made the stay extra special. Thank you for everything!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay within the past month. Jill's husband, Guy pulled in right behind us as we arrived, and we had a good conversation. There was an addition of two kittens since our last stay and they spent most of their time hanging around on the front porch of the cottage. As with our previous stay, the cottage was cozy and comfortable. Zucchini bread was again there to welcome us. My only complaint is that upon leaving our previous stay we had informed Jill of a few minor plumbing issues in the bathroom, and we were disappointed that none of them had been fixed when we returned 3 weeks later. The worse was a leaking toilet flapper valve that resulted in a whoosh every 10-20 minutes all night long as the tank refilled. As others have noted, this cottage is rustic and that is part of the charm, but I would encourage Jill to get on top of the maintenance. That being said, this is a great stopping point for us, and we will likely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a unique Airbnb to say the least! The room itself is comfortable, with a beautiful view of the pond. A new deck is there, with the roof still to be built. The cats friended me quickly but the roosters appear to run the show. I had a nice conversation with Jill’s husband, they are some busy folks!
I enjoyed the stay and would visit again to see the progress of this property. Thanks Jill🙂"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I visited with my sisters, and it was an AMAZING stay. The cottage is everything a cottage should be—with eclectic, vintage details and an almost fairytale feel. It was so nice being able to freely roam around the yard by the pond and use the boats/fishing supplies. The house was incredibly comfortable, so it was easy to relax and feel right at home. I especially loved the large wall of windows leading out to the porch. It made the small house feel open and bright. The animals nearby were friendly, and my sisters especially enjoyed the kittens. It was a restful and fun experience!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyable stay in an old fashioned tiny cottage on a pond, complete with kitties and chickens. A throwback to my Grandma’s time."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great experience. Jill and her husband are friendly, responsive hosts. Beautiful view from the back deck!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a fun stay at Jill’s Crooked House. The house is small, but it has everything you need. We cooked dinner on the retro toaster oven/ coffee pot/ griddle combination. Perfect appliance for a small place. The highlights were the view of the pond from the bedroom and deck and the zucchini bread. If you like cats, you will love Jill’s place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved my stay…it was just what I needed after a long day’s drive…peaceful, quiet, and so relaxing. Wish I’d had more than the one night, but I hope to return on future trips. Perfect location for me…and the back deck overlooking the water was such a treat to unwind and enjoy my hot chocolate, which is provided by the lovely hosts. Also, you are in for a real treat with Jill’s delicious prize winning zucchini bread. I highly recommend this charming abode.
P.S. Jill’s books are fabulous…I’ll be ordering both."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place has real character. It's not the most elegant or spacious or modern, but it makes up for it in charm and detail. This tiny home is very comfortable, and the sun rises over the pond in a grand view you can take in through big windows or out on the little deck. We were a little surprised to find the place is just steps away from the main house, but once inside, you are looking out at trees and across the pond out back, so it feels very private."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Jill’s place for one night as we travelled down from up North. We liked the idea of staying in a small space reminiscent of a cottage. The space has a lot of vintage details so if you are into that, you will appreciate it. The plumbing fixtures are also vintage so they have wear and tear and while they do go with the theme, just be prepared to do without the same level of comfort as if you were staying in your home. The cottage theme is cute but in keeping with the theme, a lot of the linens and things in the house look a little worn and overused. They are perfectly clean and they have thought about their guests a lot, even baking some of the best zucchini bread we have ever had. The outside, however, really makes this place shine. They have a deck overlooking a pond and it is beautiful! We saw a family of deer, beavers, geese, cats and chickens ! There’s clutter on the outside of the property since they’re still building but the back is nice. Great place for glamping!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have fallen in love with their Storybook Cottage and Castle home since my first visit 3 years ago.
Staying at their farm is exactly what I need to disconnect.
I come ready for the quiet and peace; prepared to enjoy life, relax and maybe even create a bit of art.
During the days; there are many trails locally to be hiked, caverns explored, waterfalls to behold!
Their land is magical and will offer many opportunities to capture its beauty; the sun rises on the back porch and sets on the front (which is my favorite time to sit across the pond in the back for sunset viewing).
Nature will interact with you and you with them; be it kitties, deer, birds, chickens, and others; such a treat!
Jill's homemade bread is amazing and a perfect treat for morning or night.
Their farm offers you so many ways to interact with nature and just relax, disconnect a bit.
Thank you Jill and Guy for offering this magical little dwelling to those of us seeking!
Can't wait to see you again soon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day of travel, Jill's place met our needs perfectly. It was cozy and comfortable. It was raining hard when we arrived, so we didn't get to enjoy the property. Later, the rain stopped, and we did sit on the back deck and enjoyed the view over the pond and hilly pasture behind it. One of the cats came by during our stay and introduced itself. A rooster did begin crowing at 4:00 am, but it was muted, and I rolled over and let it put me back to sleep. We have kept poultry in the past and enjoyed the sounds from the chickens. They do provide rooster ear plugs, but we didn't need them. Checking out is super easy. You just leave. No chores."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill has done a great job providing a magical, fairy tale feel to the cottage. We were very comfortable, and she provided amenities that helped make our stay even more enjoyable. These included toothbrush, because I realized I forgot mine! Also, delicious zucchini bread, fresh coffee creamer and more.
The cottage is decorated with a lot of fun items. Antique kitchen sink, vintage table and chairs and a wonderful rocker that I would love to have in my home.
Jill includes games and books to help pass the time if you are so inclined. We enjoyed the back deck, the friendly kittens, as well as observing the roosters, chickens, geese and fresh air while relaxing on the back deck, which provided a perfect view of the sunrise with our morning coffee.
We will definitely stay at Jill’s cottage in the future, if our travels bring us this way.
Oh, the cottage welcome book is filled with fun facts and a great summary of things to do in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a very cozy, well decorated cabin with a comfortable bed. I didn’t get to use the bath because I didn’t have enough time, so I can’t speak to that. She had left coffee, tea and snacks, which was sweet. The view out back is beautiful. My only complaint is that the pictures made the cabin look much further from the house (which is a construction site at present, and I am sure will be part of the allure someday), a garage, and further off the road. But once you get inside, it feels very cozy and inviting, and the back yard’s solitude makes up for the front yard’s lack. Almost all the windows face the back of the cabin where there is a broad deck and a lovely pond surrounded by forest."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay at the cottage. This truly was a storybook experience. The tiny house has a beautiful, comfortable bed and provided me with a well-needed great night sleep. The zucchini bread that Jill baked that morning was still warm when I sampled it upon my arrival. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jill's little cottage was a wonderful one night stay on our small family trip. She even put out some toys for my son to play with which he enjoyed. I enjoyed sitting on the deck and watching the birds, squirrels, and deer in the back yard overlooking the pond. Very nice and peaceful place to stay on our road trip."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a lovely adventure. My granddaughter, Alyonna Kate now has the BEST memory staying in your little whimsical storybook cottage and hope to visit again someday when the weather is warm💕"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the cottage, and the host accommodated us very quickly even tho our request was last minute. She had a lovely surprise waiting for us when we got there and she made us feel very comfortable and taken care of. we had plenty of privacy and everything whe.t smoothly. Thanks Jill!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The area is beautiful, the cottage is cozy. Gorgeous new deck on the back of the cottage overlooking a pond. I enjoyed watching the chickens and rooster free ranging the property. The zuccini bread was fabulous. The hosts are kind and thoughtful and responsive to any questions or concerns I had. I was glad I had asked about and learned more about their sweet dog instead of assuming. The cats that kept me company are adorable and loving. The place appeared as clean as it could be, though it is rustic. If you camp this would be a very comfortable stay for you. It was chilly and rainy outside when I stayed here, but it was toasty warm inside and I could control the temperature myself if I wanted to. The bathtub and sinks are rustic. Would I stay here again? Yes, I would."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I stayed overnight on our trip through WV. We are so glad we chose this unique little house. It would have been fun to explore the pond and gardens, but there wasn't time. The zucchini bread was awesome and I loved the books Jill wrote. What a great property to raise a family!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So worried about the weather, drove through fog and rain on the mountains, no visibility, but the directions were perfect because I saw the castle rising out of the mist. This place is like stumbling upon a magical cottage that you know from childhood, except it’s got everything an adult weary traveler dreams of! A big loaf of warm zucchini bread and butter wait for you, and also fruit and snacks and water, which all meant that I didn’t have to go out again into the cold! Hosts had left the heaters and the lights on for me, and I immediately felt at home. A huge bathtub with bubble bath and a tea in the plush and cozy rocking chair snaps the cold right out of you! I spent the evening reading and gazing over the gorgeous pond. Even though the bed had the most comfortable mattress in the known universe, I didn’t want to go to sleep because I didn’t want to waste one moment of my time here. Jill was always super helpful and responsive. I wish I could stay longer; I hated to leave."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute little cottage! Straight out of a storybook! Jill was EXCEPTIONALLY responsive and the stay was flawless! Would certainly recommend staying here if this is something you’re considering. It is exactly as described, a small, quaint, comfy & cozy cottage. Had a very restful sleep and no issues with noise or otherwise. Definitely recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing zucchini bread! Such a cute and sweet gem filled with whimsy laughter and love. Their animals are adorable and very friendly
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were SO nice and gave us a whole run down of everything. The cabin had brochures and an info manual with a ton of great spots to see. The place was beautiful and a total fairy tail come true. And the zucchini was the best thing ive ever eaten. Perfect experience, illl be recommending to all my friends <3"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time and we can say it is the best Airbnb we have stayed at thus far. The cottage and the animals are a fairy tale come true and the hosts Jill and Guy exactly the sweet and accommodating hosts you would expect for such a magical place. They go above and beyond to make your stay there warm and to leave you with great memories.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cool place. excellent people.
Killer zucchini bread.
how do I get more?????"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very storybook and charming. Enjoyed the ￼ delicious zucchini bread as well. Will be back again 😊
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place to get away. We had hoped to get some skiing in but weather did nor cooperate so we settled for amazing views at The New River Gorge and fishing in the backyard. The host was amazing informative and sweet. The pond was full of bluegills and bass in the backyard. It was nice to get away from the city for 2 days. Thank you so much!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a fairytale come true .....
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill’s place is a “go to” overnight stop for my frequent trips from Eastern Va to Indiana. It is unique, charming, convenient, relaxing, very well priced…and Jill is a perfect host."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jill’s place was very cozy with all we needed for a place away from home. It was very quiet with lots of lovable animals that would welcome you as you were coming and going. It was very close to Winter Place that made it easy to come and go during the day for lunch and dinner breaks and then back to the slopes. The zucchini bread with a nice + for our stay. I can’t wait to head that way for our trip to Winter Place.😀
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for Winterplace skiiing!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy! Perfect place to crash while we skied for a few days. Great local recommendations of a restaurant that was so good we ate there twice!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite air b and b ever
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful find for a ski trip to Winterplace! Literally one minute up the road from the ski resort, this cottage was cozy, cute, and convenient. Lots of fun animal friends around - cats, a dog, chickens, ducks, and we even saw a possum!
The cottage was warm and had plenty of amenities. Jill's dedication to providing quality sustainable and reusable items was really appreciated.
10/10, I'll definitely stay here again if we're back up near Winterplace!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jill was a great host. She got the room ready early for us since we got there early.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little place - all we needed and clean! Would stay there again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was beautiful, the host was very helpful and responded quickly, she even allowed us to extend our check out so we could sleep in. The view was beautiful and the home made zucchini bread was to die for."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to Winterplace ski resort and the cabin was cozy and pretty well stocked. We have a small camper we usually travel in and this cabin had more space than our camper. It was pretty private with a back deck overlooking a pond. This is not luxury accommodations but suited our needs well for our ski trip.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful little cabin in a sweet ski town! The cabin was so nice! Clean, had everything and more that you could need! With the added bonus of her AMAZING zucchini bread as a welcome token! Also it’s hard not to fall in love with all the furbabies on the farm. 10/10 recommend and hope to stay again the next time I’m in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay at the cottage!! We’ll have to come back and see it in the summer ! But the cottage was our perfect home away from home !
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed for one night to take my daughter skiing for the first time. It was a magical little cottage to stay in. Right up our alley! We even got homemade zucchini bread, water, butter and cream upon arrival. The cottage was stocked with coffee, tea, toiletries, linens…we only needed to bring ourselves. AND there was a children’s book written by Jill. We bought it when we got home. We had a wonderful stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a childhood story come true! The grounds were peaceful and beautiful, including all the critters that walked across the porch and played in the yard. The hosts were super friendly and responsive. The zucchini bread is TO DIE FOR. Best bread I have ever tasted. The inside was cute and quaint. It had all the essentials to make that cottage a home for a weekend. Old farm sink, claw foot tub and rustic decorations really can make a guest feel like they are living in a fairy tale. The bed was SUPER COMFY. Even though the cottage was tiny, it was free of clutter and it did not feel small at all. The hosts even had a picnic set up for us to use if we wanted to walk around the grounds and explore with a snack. A perfect dream get away in beautiful West Virginia! I will be telling everyone about this place and I hope to return soon!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage, very close to ski resort."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stayed! Close to winter place and very cozy.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our brief stay at the cottage! Beautiful, cozy, and well-equipped.
Was so fun getting to interact with the friendly cats, chickens, and dog on the property. And Jill's zucchini bread was delicious.
Hope to make it back someday when the weather is nice and the orchard/garden is in production!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay with Jill. I made fast friends with 3 tabby cats. They were adorable. We had been at the slopes all day, it had been a cold snowy day and the house was so warm toasty and inviting when we arrived. The house is very whimsical and cozy. We would definitely return."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved it
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very homey and inviting with homemade breakfast bread and other amenities. And it was very close to the Winterplace Ski Resort.

She met us when we pulled up and let us know about the property. We also loved the cats that played with us and was so sweet. Hopefully they approved of us! We will be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I LOOOOVED the storybook cottage. I wish i could have stayed longer, one night just wasn’t enough. Considering I love close to Ghent, I will be coming back. Jill was an amazing host and the property was absolutely gorgeous."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny home is very cute and charming. The pictures show it as it is. The view from the back deck was lovely. The bed is up super high, but a nice little step stool is provided for those of us on the shorter side. It was very clean and the zucchini bread was a lovely touch. The house had a lot of charm. The bed was on the very firm side so take that into account if you have back issues. The only thing we felt odd about is that the house is just a few yards from the host house. You have to walk into the shared gated yard. The hosts were very lovely people though and the animals were adorable. Be sure to close the doors quick, whether your car door or the house door, or a kitten might just sneak in. Lol. Overall, it was a nice stay and worth the price. It was nice that there was not a long list of things to do before leaving, but I felt like we should have done something besides just walk out."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jill was a wonderful host and her guest house was exactly what I needed while in town for work. Private,peaceful, and fun animals"

We loved everything about our time at the cottage and in West virginia. If you’re looking for a peaceful weekend full of kind people, sweet animals and good food you’ve found the place!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a solo traveler on a National Park road trip, Jill’s cottage was such a magical and welcome reprieve from being on the road and hiking around all day. I felt right at home, and so welcomed- by humans and animals alike! It’s a beautiful property, a beautiful home, and Jill was so detail oriented it was such a great experience. The little touches like having the lights left on for my arrival and having award winning fresh baked zucchini bread on the kitchen table put everything over the top for me. Thank you for having me!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill has a genuine hospitality. You can tell her cottage is a labor of love and attention. She greeted us upon our arrival, and we instantly felt welcomed. She had delicious homemade zucchini bread, fruit, and milk waiting for us in the cottage. Lots of adorable cats, chickens, a dog, and a turkey to entertain us. The view out the back of the cottage is of their pond, and it is very pretty and relaxing from inside the cottage and on the deck."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cutest cottage ever. Love love love the cats! I will be back for sure!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jill is an Amazing host! she made my wife and I feel right at home. We have stayed at many Airbnbs but this definitely has been one of our most positive experiences yet! The cats outside were super friendly and the zucchini bread was an awesome way to start the morning the next day when we were checking out. I highly recommend Jill's place and am looking forward to returning again in the future.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfect little gem of a place! Found this listing while last-minute planning for a road trip stop, and boy do I feel lucky I found it. We arrived very late & were still happily greeted by the farm welcoming committee of kitties & the sweetest turkey roosting on the cottage porch. SO very peaceful & perfectly charming, I wished we were staying for more than just a sleep. What a great place for a little taste of farm life, and the delicious zucchini bread was a fantastic way to start our morning before hittin' the road again. Jill had everything we needed & the place was nice and cozy when we arrived. If you're looking for a homey place to rest your head, feel inspired, or escape a busy life for a bit, LOOK NO FURTHER!!! Book now. I hope to come back someday."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space is perfect for one or two people. Its exactly as pictured. The animals are fun to watch, the pond was beautiful and had lots of birds. If you are a morning person, the sunrise is spectacular. Guy and Jill were helpful in recommending restaurants and they went beyond to help me out today. I appreicate them so much.
If ever in Ghent this is where i will stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We are so happy we found this little gem for a quick stay! Jill was lovely and the space was exactly what we needed. We had such a fun time with all the animals and would totally return!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This truly is a ""Storybook"" stay, provided by a fairy tale family! I'm in awe of what this family has created, as their unique little cottage is well-worth the stay if you're interested in that ""home away from home"" feeling. The hospitality provided by the Holliday Family isn't something commercial hospitality can even begin to compete with. From the animal-style welcoming committee, to the freshly baked zucchini bread (award winning by the way, don't let Jill be modest!) there's not a quality about this property where you can't find some sort of innocent joy and amazement, and really -- that's what life's all about.
Even though you're warmly welcomed, you're never ""bothered"" by this large loving family in any way. In fact, you're made sure to feel that you're well taken care of, but free to come and go as you very well please.
I'm hopeful to visit again one day very soon! Thank you again, Holliday Family, for the experience you provide and sharing your ""story"" with us all!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the cutest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in!! Jill was incredibly friendly, the zucchini bread she made was delicious, and I enjoyed walking around the property despite the freezing temps!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jills place was unexpectedly great! The storybook cottage was quaint and cozy and Jills zucchini bread was amazing!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place had so much charm to it; from the animals to the decor, the architecture to the beautiful surrounding mountains! Jill made it so easy for me to check in and out with helpful instructions. She even left delicious zucchini bread for breakfast! Cannot recommend enough!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the storybook cottage. We spent most of the day exploring the surrounding areas, and Jill's place was a really nice place to crash in the evenings. It had everything you'd need (coffee + delicious zucchini bread) and the view of the pond in the back with the sunrise was incredible. Thank you for hosting us, we would return."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill's Storybook Cottage provided exactly what we needed on our road trip--a safe, clean and comfortable place to spend the night. Jill and her husband were friendly and provided great tips for where to eat and get gas. We enjoyed the orientation they provided to their place and all the animals. Jill's zucchini bread was also a delicious bonus!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our very short stay here! Unfortunately, we were only passing through and arrived late so we didn't get to spend very much time in this cozy nook of a home. But on our arrival, we were greeted by kittens who led us to our front porch just like in a fairy tale. We played a couple rounds of Bingo (found under the bench in the entryway) as we decompressed from the drive. The bed was comfortable and the room was warm. The tap was hot and the view in the morning was beautiful! We sipped our coffee and snacked on our (absolutely delicious) zucchini bread provided by the host on the back deck overlooking the pond in the crisp morning air. After we packed up our car, we took a stroll around the property to take in all of the autumn leaves and peaceful sights (also, accompanied by kittens along the way) before we continued on our journey. We'd love to come back again to truly unwind for a couple of days in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This sweet little cottage was the dessert (cherry on top), to my beautiful vacation in Folly Beach, South Carolina.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The CUTEST place! Jill was so friendly and helpful and the place was so clean! The scenery is so cute and the animals on the property were all so friendly. The turkey and a few kittens jumped into our car on the way out lol. Wanted to take one of the kittens for ourselves. One of my favorite Airbnb experiences, definitely worth the stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about Jill’s place was perfect and magical. One day was not enough and we already miss all of the kitties, goofy Merlin and sweet Molly. This was an experience we will never forget. Cannot wait to visit again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a unique spot to stop! Loved all the kittens that greeted us and followed us around as we toured the property.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stopped here just for one night on a road trip to Savannah, but I wish I’d had more time. The cottage and property was beautiful and so peaceful. Jill was very friendly and responsive. She also l made some delicious zucchini bread for my stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem! It was worth the short ride off of 64. It met all the expectations of the posted reviews! Spectacular views, comfy bed, delicious zucchini bread and we had the pleasure of a turkey standing outside the kitchen door. We were only there for 12 hours, but wish we could have stayed longer! It’s no wonder Jill’s storybook cottage is constantly booked!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying at the cottage. It really just seems to be better and better. Got to hang out with cats and Merlin. Beautiful area, the pond is gorgeous, the cottage is pristine… looking forward to the next excuse I get to stay in Ghent."

Thanks so much for a comfortable and whimsical stay. ❤️"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a good time staying at the Storybook Cottage tiny house. Jill and her husband are great hosts - very welcoming and friendly.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute place and friendly host!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for something other than a hotel room and found this place on Airbnb. After looking at the site and reading reviews, it was a no brainer for us. It was very peaceful and beautiful. We were planning to only be there in the nights, but did spend a few hours with our 2 grandson on afternoon and it turned out to be a wonderful experience for the boys and us exploring the grounds, fishing, petting to abundance of cats and kittens, along with the young turkey. We were able to some grapes that were ripening. The nights were very quiet and relaxing. There was a loaf of zucchini bread waiting in the kitchen and Guy gave us a jar of homemade dandelion jam to try. We enjoyed the rusted charm that the Storybook Cottage offered."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely adored my stay at the storybook cottage. Very peaceful and quiet. I loved being greeted by all of the animals and host was very communicative. This place is darling and I’ll absolutely stay again.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique place. It definitely has a storybook feel. Loved sitting on the back deck with wine for sunset and coffee in the morning. The view from the bedroom is lovely. I would only note that there are many many cats and kittens on the property. They would join us for a cuddle anytime we were on the porch. This was delightful for us, but could be a problemfor a non cat lover or someone with allergies."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jill was so sweet and helpful and accommodating :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The storybook cottage was everything I hoped for. The place was cozy, quaint, and wonderful. I loved sitting out on the porch watching rain drops in the pond.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unique Airbnb, beautiful surroundings!
Jill was a great host, responsive and gave us local recommendations. We had everything we needed, plus some extras … yum! We enjoyed a walk around the pond with an entourage of friendly animals, saw a beautiful starry sky at night and then enjoyed coffee on the deck while the sun rose over the pond the next morning. Definitely a place we look forward to returning when we come back to explore more of Wonderful WV, with its close proximity of state parks!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A charming little place and lots of critters. Lovely pond view. Jill was very accommodating and she makes the BEST zucchini bread!! It was warm when she brought it. Yum. A cozy night of rest on the road!

Jill and Guy were the most gracious, helpful, and friendly hosts. The property is incredible and most relaxing. The grounds are full of edible foods in the gardens and trees. The animals love to visit! I cannot wait to stay here again. I will definitely be back throughout the year and only hope they're not always booked! My new favorite place and people. Delicious zucchini bread and dandelion jam!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A cozy spot with a nice little deck and a view of the pond and the sunrise. Loved all the sweet curious animals all around. The cottage is right near their house but still felt private and it had everything for my needs. I would stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"100/5.I was hiking in newriver gorge park, had a medical emergency,had to call 911&ended up going to hospital. By the time they dischrged me it was past 10pm with my car still in the park, i was a solo traveler,everything had shutdown &I had no way to get to my car or even to a hotel close tohospital. Jill was super responsive through chats and Guy graciously drove 45 mins from their home in the middle of the night to come get me, we went got my car& i followed him back home. I cannot say thankyou enough. I have no doubts they are real life fairies among us. The home itself is beautiful, serene, with phenominal surroundings. The home is tiny only in the name, the bed room & bathroom are spacious, with all the supplies one needs, and the pond view is simply spectacular. Equally superb is Jill's zucchini bread, one can travel just for the bread alone. The animals add to the charm. I am already planning my next trip. Please just book this place already everyone, it is soo worth it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place! We loved the pond, critters, and vibe. The little rustic cabin was great, too! We wished we had more time to explore. I will say the rustic cabin had both of our allergies going, but that’s because it’s a rustic cabin lol. Should have brought allergy meds. Overall, really great experience!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy space with everything you need. I felt right at home. Definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! I intended to linger and enjoy the view, but my plans changed and I ended up spending far less time here than I would have liked. Wonderful location for a crash pad or a more relaxed stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great stay at the cottage!!! It was so peaceful to sit out on the back porch overlooking the pond and watching the various wildlife. All of the cats and kittens were so fun to interact with! The zucchini bread provided was absolutely delicious and everything within the cottage was as described! There are lots of recommendations within the cottage. Guy spoke with us a few times to check in and provide recommendations tailored to what we desired to experience. Overall great experience!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a wonderful retreat off the beaten path
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was easy to find this location, as the castle they are turning their house into, is easily spotted from a distance, so no need for complicated instructions.
We were warmly welcomed by Guy, and he talked a bit about the area and other things. You will never run out of conversation with him, I think. I love this, as airbnb travel for me, is to get to know the area as well as some of the people living there.
The tiny house is not too tiny, and very comfortable. We had fun exploring its nooks and crannies, and also the extensive grounds that surround it. What a beautiful and peaceful spot.
If I have to name one negative side, it was the bullfrog that kept us awake at night, until we got used to the sound :)
There are some lovely hikes in the area and some good restaurants too.
If we're ever in the region again, we'll definately consider staying here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was honestly magical. The cottage was picture perfect and the whole atmosphere felt welcoming. We stayed at the Storybook Cottage for four nights and we wish we could have stayed there longer. It felt like stepping into the past. The cottage was decorated so nicely and the animals were very friendly. The cats were especially playful! Guy was so kind to give us a tour of the property and he even let us try out his antique tools! The pond view from the bedroom is really phenomenal. We were out at the New River Gorge every day and we looked forward to coming back to the cottage every night. Jill’s zucchini bread is simply to die for. It was so good that we almost finished the loaf in one sitting! We felt so welcomed and at home. If we are ever in West Virginia again, we would definitely come back, and it is a 10/10 recommended place to stay in our book. Jill, thank you so much for the wonderful experience! We hope your castle gets finished soon! - Pam & Mario"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our second stay just as much as our first!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our “fairy tale” airbnb stay was lovely and peaceful. Jill is an amazing host and her breakfast bread treat was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is so cool walking up to the front of the Storybook Cottage! The kittens meeting you at the driveway to say welcome to our little house. Finding the antique keys to the awesome antique dish drain sink to the claw foot tub! It is the most unique, fun place we have ever stayed at! The view off the back porch is picturesque! The sun was setting and I hope I will be able to share a photo I took.
Will be back! Went to the best Italian restaurant in of places a strip mall! Padrinos! 5 stars 🌟
We were also pulling a boat and they had great parking and even helped unhook the boat so we could go to dinner! Took a walk around the pond and saw a cute little bridge and a very old looking little log cabin!
So peaceful! Saw three deers this morning when we woke up out in the field behind the pond. Great place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jill's little cottage was perfect and adorable! The view of the pond off the deck was amazing.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My son and I were driving back from the beach. We needed a place to stay that was about halfway, but all I could find were expensive hotels that didn’t look that nice. I lucked into finding this place! The hosts, Jill and Guy, could not have been any nicer. They went out of their way to have toys and snacks on hand for my toddler. And the zucchini bread was as good as advertised!
While we were only there for a total of 12 hours or so, I’m very glad we stayed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cottage was a welcome oasis after a day of driving. The interior was so cute and the pond view could not be beat. The hosts provided a lot of information and thought through so many gorgeous details. The friendly dog and bevy of cats was a definite plus! We look forward to staying again on our drive back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a fantastic little getaway at this adorable, storybook cottage! Jill was amazing and very friendly.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Storybook cottage is so adorable! It has many interesting antique items. It's like stepping back in time only you get an air conditioner, wifi and a full bathroom! After a long day of hiking and driving it was absolutely wonderful to take a bubble bath in a big deep claw foot bathtub and drink fresh lemon balm tea. We were serenaded by frogs as we fell asleep in a comfy bed! The property is filled to the brim with interesting things. There are two small museums, fruit trees everywhere, a grapevine canopy for sitting under and cooling off, friendly cats that follow you as you walk around the pond. The host gave amazing advice about what to see and do. One of the highlights of our vaca was hiking a water fall at Brush Creek that the host suggested. He was a wealth of knowledge and we really appreciate all his input. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a delightful one night stay at Jill’s place. Enjoyed the beautiful calm surroundings in nature. Loved the view looking out the windows.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed here for a night because of our schedule - but we wish we had had more time to enjoy the place. Jill's place would make a perfect getaway if you'd like to just relax, forget about the real world, and enjoy nature for a while. The complementary banana nut cake also makes a very good reason for us to come here again!
Also, get ready for the cats - they are overwhelmingly sweet and welcoming!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay at Jill's. I love the little cottage and the land surrounding it. I always have a very relaxing and peaceful time here. I love the whimsical nature of their homes and property, rather magical with the animals, flowers, pond, etc. Jill and Guy are wonderful & caring people and I love their vision! Looking forward to my next visit!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cottage was very cozy and relaxing. Cats were very friendly. Didn’t get the opportunity to explore the property because it rained the 3 days we were there. I plan on returning again in the future. Jill was very pleasant and welcoming. Loved our visit.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an awesome surprise! I love love love this little cottage, everything I could want was here (including zucchini bread still hot from the oven!). The atmosphere was perfect, and falling asleep to the sound of bullfrogs and light rain was so nice.
A very friendly kitty tried to hitch a ride on my way out, so do watch doors left open and check your car before you drive away!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolute gem of a place! Jill and Guy are friendly and the surroundings are beautiful. This is a must-stay if you are in the new river gorge area and love a unique air bnb. We are already planning to return. :)
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Storybook Cottage is a dream stay. Guy and Jill are such nice and inviting people and make sure you feel as welcome as possible with homemade, fresh baked, delicious zucchini bread. Guy was really cool to talk to and told us about how many interesting people he’s gotten to meet over the years staying there. It was really inspiring personally to see how the space they have to with with has been cultivated over the years and only continues to steadily grow. The whole place is enchanting and an amazing testament to what honest, hard working people can accomplish with their own hands. It’s a true work of art and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a dose of real magic in their travels. The location is a peaceful spot in the country, with a beautiful private pond out back of the cottage. Very cozy, very cool."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and really nice host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a perfect stay for me and my boyfriend! We wished we had stayed longer! Super cute and quaint, clean and AMAZING zucchini bread. Jill was even nice enough to bring us a case of water when we ran out lol. The hosts were so kind and welcoming."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, quiet location, Main house is indeed, in the construction process of being turned into a castle. Easy parking. Cottage is cozy & easily accessible. I was greeted by several friendly, curious cats. Host was not home when I arrived, but was responsive and friendly when messaged. I did not walk down to the large, pond in the back, or observe any ducks, or other birds, but could hear an abundance of wildlife from the area. Instructions about TV, internet, etc. were clear. Dog lovers, however, will not approve of how the Leonberger (Leonberger mix?), is kept: outside apparently all the time (holes dug, fur rings in the grass) on a Clothesline Dog runner. Although a small structure is nearby, it is empty, devoid of dog bed, straw, etc. She (dog) is a good example of the breed: Gentle, friendly, social."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very cute, quirky, one of a kind cottage. The pond view from the bedroom is beautiful."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The view from the balcony during sun rise and sun set is second to none. Jill and Guy greeted us when we got there and then gave us our privacy the rest of the stay. Cannot wait to come back to walk the property and do some fishing. Absolutely unbeatable for the price!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place. It was super charming and the decor matched the cozy vibe.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy cottage in a serene setting - perfect for two road weary travelers from Louisiana on a long trip to eastern Canada. Before our trip, Jill was very responsive to a few kitchen questions. She is a wonderful host & makes a mean, nut-free zucchini bread & jam; the fresh fruit, cream & bottled water was also a nice surprise. We had everything we needed for our stay. We loved how most everything in the cottage was repurposed for logical use."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One day is not enough because there is much to enjoy. Quiet, quirky little place. The warm zucchini bread and dandelion jam were wonderful. Such an interesting stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jill went out of her way to dream and provide a place that was filled with thoughtfulness.
They left us our space. The kitchen was so much fun with retro appliances. The bathtub (for me-a bath person) was amazing did not run out of hot water. Plus she provided bath bubbles💥
Grateful for my time to visit!
Thank you Jill and family!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Chickens are very friendly and even visited me on the back porch. Not a lot in the immediate area but was peaceful and private and worked for our needs. Great view!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying here. I felt right at home and loved all of the thought that went into the place. Would love to come back one day and highly recommend for anyone who wants a relaxing and peaceful getaway!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed here 2 nights and we are already dreaming of coming back. We never did see Jill, but Guy did a great job of substitute Inn Keeper. He asked us what we were wanting to do, we told him, and he loaded us up with plenty of great recommendations. We are lucky to have spent a little time in the daydream Guy and Jill are creating. And there’s a bunch of sweet cats roaming the property, if you’re into that. We named the all-black female Stinky (or Stevie, if you want to be a little kinder) and fell absolutely in love with her. So if you see stinky, tell her we miss her and give her a bunch of head scratches and cuddles."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful place to stay. The theme was really neat.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We arrived after dark so we were pleasantly surprised when we opened to curtains to the beautiful pond setting. The cottage was the perfect size and the zucchini bread was the best I have ever tasted!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This might be our favorite place we’ve ever stayed. The cottage was adorable and so comfy, perfectly decorated and I LOVED the claw foot tub. Jill was so nice and helpful, she even had freshly baked zucchini bread for us. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful view out the bedroom window. Nice touches like fresh fruits and bubble bath. Just as described. Easy to find with well marked mailbox and tiny houses on the road. Very close to the highway Kitchen well stocked. Not many restaurants near by so bring food to cook or rewarm.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best experience I have had at an Airbnb! Jill and Guy were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to welcome us and make us feel at home.

We will absolutely be returning if we're ever in the area again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time the storybook cottage was very cool. I can't wait to come back in the summer/fall when everything is growing.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jill's place feels like a fairytale! The cottage is curated down to the smallest detail. We woke up to a small layer of snow both mornings we stayed and it made the view feel very magical and in West Virginia fashion a little cold. All the animals on the property are very friendly. Magical and fairytale like truly!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is a wonderful space. Cozy and comfortable, it is a unique and delightful twist on the tiny home concept. The mini farm makes an excellent setting for a quiet stay but with plenty to do within a short driving distance. Jill and her husband we extremely pleasant and helpful
Oh! And the zucchini bread which apparently is provided to all her guest was absolutely amazing"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill is a wonderful host! The lights & heaters were left on for me as I had a late arrival.

I definitely recommend staying here!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We both enjoyed our stay very much here and will definitely stay again as it is so close to I77.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Storybook Cottage is exactly as described. And the large Zucchini bread is delicious. But what is most delightful about staying there is meeting people who are living their dream, sharing it with others, and cherishing their experiences with visitors."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jill’s place was very cozy. Comfortable fit for two, but maybe not for any more. She provided lots of entertainment and it’s right down the road from a ski resort! The view in the morning is beautiful and Jill made a wonderful zucchini bread for breakfast. Would definitely recommend!
My wife wanted me to include additional emphasis that the zucchini bread was “really really good”."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have picked a better spot for a winter getaway! A dusting of snow covering the house and surrounding trees made the fairytale come to life. Nothing could be more peaceful than waking up to the sun rising over a frozen pond, especially while mock-fireplace space heaters warm the small space! Jill and Guy were excellent hosts. Great recommendations, great zucchini bread, great amenities all around! We loved all the whimsical details inside (especially the claw foot tub) and walking around the property felt like an adventure. If you’ve ever fantasized about staying in an old-timey inn (and who hasn’t?), I would highly recommend this place whether you’re passing through or as a destination itself!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so charming and has tons of character. The space had everything we needed and each detail contributed to a wonderful experience. The house matched the description - tiny and of course, older - but everything was functioning and met our expectations. Great deal for the price."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We brought a few students in our youth group to go skiing. It took about 25 minutes to get to Winterplace resort, yet still close to stores and restaurants. Thank you for sharing, we enjoyed our stay."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Jennifer’s place in order to attend a memorial service. Despite the sad occasion, we appreciated having such a pleasant place to stay with family in this quiet and attractive neighborhood. We loved the open floor-plan, modern and pristine furniture, and well equipped kitchen. The beds were very comfortable. The fact that all rooms were on a single floor worked out well for us as we were accompanied by my elderly mother-in-law. And although there were several steps to the front door, we found that she could avoid the steps by entering at the sliding door in the dining room which was accessible via a gently graded paved walkway from the driveway. This situation worked out perfectly for us. The bedrooms in the house were well situated for privacy, as were the two full baths. Everyone found the beds very comfortable and the linens were impeccable. The house was close to a fine restaurant, Char, which we recommend! We also recommend Tudor Biscuit House for breakfast."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations exceeded our expectations. Very peaceful and private, clean and well appointed, and very reasonably priced."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Within 25-30 minutes of multiple entrances to The Park. Restaurants, grocery, pharmacy, gas within a few minutes of the house. Ended up being a great home base and comfortable enough to hang around in."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Thanks for hosting.
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home with lots of parking. Very clean and spacious.
The beds were a little soft for our taste and the bedroom with queen bed was a little small.
The amount of toilet paper was insufficient for our stay, the rolls of the 2 bathrooms were practically empty when we arrived and the host skipped my comments about it.
The same goes for the dishwasher soap, insuring for the number of nights booked."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, exactly as described and pictured. Very clean and welcoming!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were four of us, my sister, two cousins and myself! We have family in the area and love visiting the beautiful state parks. The best part of our trip, however, was staying in Jennifer’s home. It exceeded all expectations by far! It’s so very pretty, exceptionally clean with comfy beds and a great patio area that we enjoyed morning and night. She responded quickly to any questions and her restaurant recommendations were great. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect home for a family or 2 couples. Great open floor plan in the kitchen, dining & living room area. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.

We would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Choose this house since Beckley was a great central location to visit New River Gorge National Park. The house location was near the restaurants on Harper Road and the neighborhood the house the located on was very safe since it had ton's of families. We enjoyed the Netflix the house had since we don't have the service ourselves.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Two couples used this home for our base to explore New River Gorge NP. The house was found to be exactly as presented. Very clean and comfortable.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and the home was pristine. Very clean and exactly as the pictures and description described it to be. We ate at a wonderful restaurant called Char. It was just about 10 minutes away. You are only about 30 minutes away from the Gorge in Fayetteville. Great location! We will be returning. The neighborhood is quiet and centrally located.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here two nights while passing through on a road trip. The plan was to stretch our legs for a day; visit ACE Outdoor Adventure park and do some hiking. Location was solid for this.
House was clean and area felt pretty safe. AC was not working upon arrival in the evening, host was responsive right away and got a tech out the following day to repair."

2022-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Came to explore NRG National Park. This house is a great base if you want to be centrally located. Quiet neighborhood. Super clean. Well appointed. Furnishings were new and comfortable for 6 adults to hang out. Water pressure was a slight issue, but that was the most lacking thing in the house. Would recommend."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was a super host and deserves that title. We had an issue that was out of her control and she bent over backwards to ensure that it was resolved.

The house sits in a nice quiet neighborhood and we saw plenty of fireflies at night! An absolute treat for the little ones :)
Will definitely book Jennifer's place again, if we come back to visit the area!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic place to stay if you plan on spending time at the New River Gorge rock climbing! Plenty of climbing within a 30-45 min drive.
Great location as you are 10-15 mins drive away from anything you might need for food or amenities.
House was newly renovated and was perfect for our family. Very clean and the beds were very comfortable.
It is a nice quiet and safe neighborhood. We would recommend it 100%!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer’s place is SO cute!!
Inviting atmosphere and comfortable - a Home away from home feeling. Jennifer was super responsive and accommodating to my family and I. We were traveling to West Virginia from Kentucky to visit some family and she accepted our request last minute and rather quickly. My husband and I have a 7 month old, so hotels just aren’t ideal for us at this point in our lives. We are very thankful to Jennifer for opening up her home and for the hospitality she showed! The house was perfect for us.
Easy access to get in and we loved the pathway to the back door from the driveway! A super cute back yard /patio area, and there’s a rabbit that will make an appearance in the mornings. Everything about the house was well thought out. Great showers, fluffy towels, comfortable beds. She did a really great job!
Whenever we’re in the area again, we plan to book and stay with her again! I most definitely recommend her Airbnb to anyone in the area!"

We will definitely stay here again, if we make it back to the area!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay on our visit to the New River Gorge. It was clean, uncluttered, well decorated and a very nice floor plan. We were traveling with another couple and we each had our own room and bath at either end of the house which gave us privacy when we wanted it. The common areas were great too for sharing meals and relaxing. We would definitely check it out if we return and would highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing Airbnb! Nice big open kitchen with modern appliances if you want to cook. Very nice amenities and everything inside was modern and well renovated. You will definitely enjoy your stay here and is worth every penny
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer’s place is amazing. Very clean, all appliances and cookware available and newer, very nice open concept kitchen and living room, two full bathrooms, king bed super comfy, queen bed more stiff for those who prefer that, bunk beds are both full size on the top and bottom, and space in general was great for 4 adults and 4 kids. We went to ACE Adventure Park and checked in after. It wasn’t very far to get to and the neighborhood was quiet. There is a movie theater close by and an indoor rock climbing place called “Outside In” that’s not far either. We will most definitely be looking to come back and stay here in the future."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a well appointed, clean and roomy space, do not hesitate to book this home! We were very pleased with the decor and cleanliness. Very close to restaurants, shopping and highways. Thank you Jennifer!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 8 stayed here to go White Water Rafting, which was 30 minutes away. This recently renovated home was perfect. It's in a quiet neighborhood close to groceries and restaurants. The amenities were great if you want to cook or grill at home. This was a better option so we could all be together instead of in different hotel rooms. The host was responsive and everything was easy. I would stay here again if we were to plan another trip in the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,In all my travels this was my very first VRBO. A friend of mine suggested a VRBO vs sterile hotel room. He was right. I googled VRBO in Beckley WV and Christines site came up immediately. It was very cozy cottage and met my expectations. We talked a few times and she was right there to assist. I would recommend her properties to someone looking to stay in a warm cozy apartment.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable little house in a convenient location. Perfectly neat and clean and nice for my short stay. Definitely will stay here again when I’m passing through.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christines place was just what we needed and because we had to put our dog down which delayed our drive she was so understanding about a middle of the night arrival! Clean, tastefully cared for and a great bed to rest in!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine’s place was absolutely perfect for me! Having spent a chilly, rainy day at the New River Gorge National Park, the Airbnb was just what I wanted…easy to find, cozy, comfortable and very quiet! I liked it so much, I spent another night on my way back home later in the week. I would definitely stay with Christine again if I’m in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine is such a wonderful person. at the last mi ute my plans changed and I had to bring my dog. Christine advised me it was fine a d there was a minimal pet fee. her home is clean and cozy. on our return trip i had a late morning work meeting added to my schedule with short notice. Christine allowed the flexibility of a late check out so i wouldnt have to be travelling while trying to actively participate in that meeting.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine was a great host—she even helped me carry my luggage from the car to the house :-) The unit was clean, there was ice in the freezer, (important to me), and the bed was really comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine was ultra kind, helpful and accommodating as our original Airbnb got cancelled because of a power outage.

The home was wonderful and spotless."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"it was nice. awkward gaining access to the apartment. The description said there is a keypad. there is not. I was driving and wasn't able to read her entire message. I wasn't expecting to tell me the apartment was unlocked and the key was inside. other than that bumpy start, it went great."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great apartment in downtown Beckley with local food and bars within a few minutes. Winterplace Mountain was an easy 20 minute drive.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We were very grateful to stay with Christine. She was very responsive and helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute and clean unit. Easy to find and easy parking. Neighbors have cute but quite noisy dogs. Location was nice and located right by a public library so the people walking around outside were a pleasant crowd, which we appreciated. Nice assortment of maps and pamphlets for local attractions and nice selection of books as well. Perfect kitchen for a short stay and the coffee was a nice highlight. The bed was super comfy and clean. Everything in the bathroom worked perfect and it was very clean. We would definitely stay again if we ever had the need!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was short & sweet. This location was well equipped for what I needed and I felt right at home with the place. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Beckley, especially if you have a college student you need to visit. Christine was responsive to any messages I had sent to her, so I felt well taken care of with choosing this location."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christine called me about 5 hours prior to us arriving to let us know that the power was out at the property and she didn’t know when it would be back on but she was VERY accommodating and said that we can stay at another one of her properties that was just a few houses down. I can’t review the property we originally booked because we didn’t stay there and I can’t review the property we did stay at because it’s not associated with this listing BUT I will say that Christine was helpful and VERY communicative. So as a host she was 10/10. Since we were just a few houses down, I can say that the location wasn’t too bad, parking seemed limited but there was parking at the property we stayed at. There was also food/stores near by. There seemed to be a LOT of dogs around the neighborhood because we heard a lot of barking almost all night. Check in and check out was easy"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described, Christine was great. 😊 Home was neat & clean. There was a lot of neighborhood dog barking."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We would love to stay again! It was perfect for a quick stay. It had everything we needed to make us feel comfortable. Christine was helpful giving us local suggestions for dinner around the corner.
Thank you for hosting us!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay. Christine was close by and communicative, so anything we had a question about she was right there to help."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it was quaint and more than sufficient. Bed was comfy.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We liked the location, with the library right across the street. It was quiet at night, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The kitchen is small, but it was adequate for our needs since we were only staying for one night. The only thing that was not mentioned on the site info was that the kitchen sink only had cold water available. My wife insists on hot water."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Christine's! The place was clean, spacious and very comfortable. We would definitely book this place again!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, quiet clean place.
Some of the house rules were annoying (take off shoes, no eating anywhere but the table, etc.) that is why my review was good and not great.
The couch and bed were extremely uncomfortable as well.
But other than that, it was a nice place to sleep for a night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We’ve driven past Beckley many times, but this was the first opportunity we had to stop and explore the area (specifically, New River Gorge National Park).

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience for a quick night stop. Enjoyed the location and amenities!
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"No wifi. We thought we had seen it under amenities, but that it had been switched out after we booked; we belatedly saw a previous review reporting the same behavior in Jan 2023.
We ultimately ended up not staying here because my partners allergies started acting up immediately after we arrived. They found black mold in the AC unit and we took pictures immediately. The host tried to tell us it was dust, then pivoted to say all places in WV had mold because of recent rain. We weren't comfortable staying due to health concerns, disagreed, and left. We reached out to Airbnb with the pictures to get a full refund. Additionally, the space overall smelled like mold/mildew/cat pee.
Christine was responsive and came over quickly after we first reported the mold so she could wipe the AC down; because my partners allergies are severe, we still opted to stay elsewhere. Overall we thought she was polite, given the strained situation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine is an awesome host. She made an exception to accommodate our special request and communicated regularly as we traveled to our destination. She greeted us when we arrived and is very friendly and gracious. We felt as though we had known her for years. We would recommend staying at her Airbnb to anyone traveling through West Virginia.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely adorable apartment! We felt right at home and didn't want to leave. neighborhood cats were very friendly and came by to visit. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is near downtown but its tucked away on a back street so it winds up being much more private than you would expect. The place was clean and quiet.
I went with my husband (and 2 schnauzers) and we found that house rules were easy to comply with. Christine was responsive to our questions and always willing to point us to any local food or attractions when asked. She was polite and very easy to interract with."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Christine‘s place was a perfect spot for my son and I to rest on a two drive. Great communication, exactly as described, and the bed and pillows were super comfy. Highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you Christine for a very clean and comfortable stay!! We used this as a quick overnight stop on our long road trip.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely stay. Christine was a great host. Place was very clean! Was passing through on a road trip and this was a perfect spot to crash for a night.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying here. It reminded us of our own home with its 1920s originality and charm. I was glad to see that the original woodwork was still on display, including the nice hardwood floors in the main living area. Host was friendly and was very responsive. The home also had everything we needed, and was very clean. Would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great find! The apartment (actually, half a house) was a perfect space for two. The bedroom, living and dining area were ample size for us and our 'stuff'. The kitchen was pretty small and at first glance, I was a bit nervous as we like to make a lot of our own meals. But I have to say, I loved that this small kitchen had every thing 2 people would need to cook...and the pots, pans, utensils were in better shape than most other places we have stayed. Christine was also one of the most attentive hosts - and very friendly. It was obvious that she took pride in the experience she was providing. She went above and beyond to accommodate the tandem bicycle I had so that I didn't have to break it down and store it in my vehicle. I gave the location 4 stars only because I ""had"" to rate it in the survey. In reality, we were there to hike/bike in the surrounding park system and didn't do anything in town. For our purposes, the locale was fantastic. You're situation may vary ;-)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so thankful to find Christine’s place later in the evening, rather than finding a hotel.
She was so sweet and accommodating, and met us at the house not 10 minutes after accepting our reservation! She checked the temperature of the house for us and gave us suggestions on places to go for dinner since it was Easter Sunday and a lot of places were closed.
Highly recommend booking from Christine, she’s an excellent host!
Would give her and the home 10 stars if I could!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christine’s place in Beckley, WV was perfect for us. It was very comfortable and cozy with lots of charm and character. Would definitely stay again."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good 2 days stay here. Very clean! They do their own cleaning it seems which is always good!
Comfortable couch and bed. The bed was VERY high and I had trouble getting in and out as I’m only 5’2”. I actually could have used a small child’s step up or something. There was also no microwave, which I failed to notice in the description and pictures. Thankfully Christine was there at check in and I noticed there wasnt one there. She did bring one over. We needed it for our food prep and eating the entire time. All in all it was a good stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christine's hospitality is awesome! Appreciated ALL the extra communication from check-in to check-out to make sure my stay was the best! Super cozy and perfect location. Hope my work brings me back soon!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,After a long day of travel it was wonderful to land at an airbnb that was everything it was described as.

Bed was very comfortable and the area is safe and quiet. Was everything we needed, and coffee in the am. Highly recommend 🤩."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend Christine’s place! My son and I were visiting the local ski resort and location was perfect! I also discovered a local children’s museum in walking distance! Christine was more then accommodating. The pictures do not do the space justice. I felt so well rested, after a night on the high quality mattress and linens. Christine’s beautiful vintage cast iron tub was the perfect remedy to long nights drive and kicked off a beautiful relaxing weekend for this busy mama. Thank you so much Christine! We loved your place and are already looking forward to a second stay!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, perfectly clean and quiet. I felt that I was taken care of."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Christine’s place on a road trip to Florida. She was very accommodating with our plans. The space has a private entrance and everything was neat and today, just as pictured. We would stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Christine's place was just perfect for the two of us and our pup. Christine gave us some restaurant ideas and was pleased to find one that was walkable. Very close to the pretty downtown area. The cottage was very cute inside and out with charm galore. Nice comfortable furnishings! The bed and bedding so comfy! Christine even had the fire place (electric) but in an original brick fireplace going for us upon our arrival. It was all very homey! A+.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christine is a wonderful host, very accommodating and super friendly. The apartment was super clean with so much character. We had a wonderful time and would recommend this gem to anyone!
Thank you for a wonderful stay Christine!!
We will surely book again!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely apartment. Very clean. All the amenities are available but Wifi. You can go to library across the road to use wifi though. Very homely experience.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location to stay at.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really loved staying at Christine's place as did my sister who was visiting Beckley with me. I didn't grow up in the area, but I have dozens of relatives in Beckley and have stayed at both their homes and many hotels around and this was a much better experience than either of those. No great aunt nagging in my ear the whole time, no 20 year old questionably stained hotel linens, relatively close to some good local dining options! Christine recommended Campastre on Harper Rd, but was awesome and had STRONG drinks. Great rec! 👍🏻 And great trip overall, largely in part to such a pleasant stay! I'm sure we'll be back soon!"
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"House did not have wifi, however, it was listed twice in the listing. When we asked the host about it once we got there she lied stating that she had made a note that said the wifi was no longer an included amenity, but she added it during our conversation. The host was rude and unprofessional during these conversations over text about the wifi and stated that if it was that important to us then we should have brought our own wifi. After talking with Airbnb Support, they confirmed that the host was in violation and the listing had been changed that night. When we decided to leave early due to not being able to use wifi for our school work, the host was very rude. She then proceeded to send a text at 12:30 am stating “ Hey thanks! Just got rebooked for 4 nights at $155 a night” and a thumbs up emoji. The house was very chilly throughout the night and only had two small, old floorboard heaters and two very small electric heaters. Overall not a great stay & an unprofessional host"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay. will definitely book with her again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved staying here. Had everything I needed and would definitely stay here again. Christine is an excellent host!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine’s place was a warm, cozy, four-room apartment, the front half of what was formerly a single-family dwelling which has been completely renovated into two apartments. It was perfect for a short stay such as mine or for a longer stay for up to two people. It was spotlessly clean and attractively furnished. The bed was quite comfortable with great pillows, bed linens, and comforter, and the old-fashioned tub in the bathroom added charm. Christine stopped by shortly after I arrived to welcome me and see if there was anything I needed. She is a very friendly and experienced host, and I would definitely stay in one of her properties again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a night while traveling through town with our dogs. It was quiet, convenient, and perfect for the 2 of us. Christine was super helpful and very friendly! Highly recommend"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at one of Christine’s Airbnb’s and both times have been great. The space is super classy. She greeted us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. We were only passing through town, but it seemed like a great place to spend a longer vacation."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is an absolute gem. Will stay here again. Very nicely decorated, good quality furniture, towels, kitchenware and very comfy bed. Extremely clean. It was also very cozy and the electric fireplace is a great touch. I really felt at home and can tell a lot of hard work was put into this unit. Communication with Christine was easy, as was parking and finding the house."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate in booking any of Christine’s rentals. She is an amazing host, our rental was very clean and the bed and couch was very, very comfy! Also was a very convenient location and she was just as sweet to my pup too! Thank you Christine!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stop during a long car trip. Convenient location near highways, gas stations, and amenities, but far enough away to have some peace and quiet."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay at Christine’s place. Comfortable and spacious with all needed amenities. Would definitely stay again when in the area.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in Beckley!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christine is truly a Superhost! She was gracious, responsive, knowledgeable and generous throughout. She answered all of my questions and made me feel completely at home right away.
The apartment was exactly what I needed for a home base for visiting New River Gorge. It was squeaky clean, and very nicely outfitted. The bed was super comfortable! Staying at Christine’s made a great vacation even better!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has an old town-home feel to it that is really charming. The door frames, trim, and furniture are all a very nice dark hardwood, there's an old-fashioned bathtub with a wrap-around curtain, and there are high ceilings and a pretty brick fireplace. I think the fireplace just uses an electric insert (we didn't use it as it was late summer) but still, the unit just had a lot of character! Cozy but not too small and a nice hillside location too. Great spot if you're looking to explore the New River Gorge trails and such."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice clean comfortable place. Will definitely stay again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Would highly recommend.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine is an excellent host. the place is very clean and nice.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying with Christine and we had a very pleasant stay, yet again. The location is convenient for the Beckley & the New River Gorge area. As well as many other attractions in WV, if you’re willing to drive an hour or so. We had about a week’s stay in this one bedroom unit and had a parking spot available every night. We took advantage of the kitchen and utensils she has available and we were able to cook dinner in the oven twice. The oven takes a bit longer than most to heat up but everything was great in the end. There’s also a Kroger about 5 minutes away if you need anything. Some items available are a toaster, coffee maker, pots/pans, silverware, drying rack & soap to wash dishes. The unit provides board games and magazines for you to browse and a television with most available channels. We enjoyed the comfortable furniture and decretive bathroom. The bathroom has a vintage style tub, very tall, but a unique experience. Our stay felt very easy and relaxing, especially after all the hiking opportunities nearby. Overall, we had another wonderful stay with Christine. She is very kind, responsive and helpful. We can’t wait to come back and try another one of her Air Bnb’s available."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was ABSOLUTELY shocked at the high level of place this is. I did not expect such a high level of quality in Christine's rental I brought my own towel and bathroom supplies but she had it all and then some. Christine also has a ready to use kitchen. This Airbnb is unbelievable. I cant believe how nice it was and the effort Christine puts into her rental. If you need to be anywhere near Beckley or just going to the park STAY HERE!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute apartment - exactly what we were looking for! The apartment was clean, had everything we needed and Christine was so helpful - even helped us find the perfect spot for dinner! We will definitely be booking with her again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Christine was an awesome host! We stayed the night as a halfway stop while relocating from Michigan to South Carolina.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine's rental is beautiful, and absolutely squeeky clean. All the furnishings are comfortble, attractive and easy to use. The bed has wonderful soft sheets and blankets, and was as good as my own bed so anyone should sleep well. It's in a good location and very nice for the price."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, comfortable and dog friendly! What more could you possibly need!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was nice. Walking distance to restaurants and bars. We would have preferred an 11:00 check out but couldn't find any places other than this one. There are a few quirky rules such as no shoes in the house and no suitcases on the bed, but I'm sure there's a reason for this, from past experience. Our only complaint would be that we would prefer the window a/c to be in the bedroom rather than the living room, as we got a little warm during the night. But, overall a nice place."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute craftsman close to New River National Park.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This flat was better than expected: well-appointed and immaculate. Helpful information about the local area was provided.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place really is a gem! Great location in town, very comfortable, EXTREMELY clean, and a really good value! Christine is super friendly and helpful. She greeted us on our arrival and provided a spot-on recommendation for a great Mexican restaurant in town! Although our travel plans only brought us to Beckley for one day, we wish we could have stayed in that cute apartment longer and will definitely stay in Christine's place again if we return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christine's place is exceptional! We had the hope it would be, based on the photos, description, and reviews, and our hope was justified! Christine has really paid attention to many details of her listing that truly make it a comfortable and relaxing place to stay. It happened to be exactly at the halfway point of our trip from Indiana to North Carolina and we could not have chosen a better place for our overnight stop. She met us when we checked in and provided lots of helpful information about the local area and places to eat and we really appreciated that, and we had a great takeout meal from the nearby Italian restaurant thanks to her recommendations. You cannot go wrong choosing Christine's place!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great flat with an even greater host! Clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, dog-friendly, and just a short stroll into downtown. My canine companion and I are looking forward to future stays!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great space that we truly enjoyed! Very nice accommodations inside, as well as a peaceful and private porch outside to relax and enjoy the evening and/or morning coffee. Fenced in yard where my dog was free to roam as we got settled. There was an unfortunate misunderstanding that occurred in that the space was only specifically dog friendly, despite the ""pet friendly"" description. As we were unaware and traveling with both a dog and a cat, this led to an allergic reaction suffered by the cleaning person. Unfortunate that an otherwise great stay was marred by a regrettable misunderstanding!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Decoration is pretty, house is very well kept. Just keep in mind check-out is at 10am!"

This apartment is clean, comfortable and cozy. The bed was super comfortable with the comforts of home and quality sheets. I appreciated the quality towels also. The bathroom has a big white ceramic tub with shower head and curtains.
The price is a super value with great hospitality and communication from a Superhost. It has convenient parking located next to library. You should consider staying here and enjoy the beautiful West VA mountains."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived at Emerson and Wayne just after a bad thunderstorm had hit the entire area. The cabin had no power but Catrina and Jack ran the generator for us so we had everything we needed. The power was eventually restored thank goodness!
The cabin was beautiful, there were fresh flowers with a personal note and a treat basket including some amazing cookies to welcome us to our new home for a few days! The fresh farm eggs in the fridge were an added bonus!
The cabin was immaculate and the kitchen was well equipped.
The location was awesome, so quiet and peaceful, we slept great. With a short drive we were close to so many hikes and great places to eat. We loved our stay and we plan on going back. Hopefully the next time we will have time to enjoy the hot tub and fire pit, we just have to stay longer!
Catrina and Jack are great hosts, they always responded quickly and they were so helpful. Emerson and Wayne is definitely a hidden gem!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Emerson and Wayne, cozy cabin is AMAZING and a wonderful place to stay! Catrina and Jack have provided a spectacular vacation destination. The cabin interior is luxurious, plus the outdoor living spaces are surrounded by the beauty and tranquil sounds of nature!
Catrina, goes the extra mile as a host 100%. When we arrived there was a hand written welcome note, meats and cheeses for a charcuterie board, farm fresh eggs, fresh flowers and treats for our dog. The small added touches speak volumes and we greatly appreciate it!
Thank you for everything and being a top notch host,
Kamon, Beth Ann and Mildred"

The hot tub was wonderful after our 6 mile rim to rim run. The heated bathroom floor and towel warmer felt amazing! Just all around a great place to stay. My only complaint is that the hot water in the shower doesn't last very long so if you take long showers, you're probably going to run out of hot water by the end of it.
I would 100% stay here again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Spent three days hiking in the area. This was our homebase for a few nights. Enjoyed a nightly fires, soaks in the hot tub, and the beauty of nature all around.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed at many airbnb’s over the years and this one tops all of them!! This home came with everything you could possibly need, which was super convenient when traveling. The host was super responsive and even left up the cutest welcome basket for my fiancé, pup, and I. Also, this place was super clean and the linens smelled amazing. We HIGHLY recommend this airbnb and definitely will be coming back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I agreed that this was the best Airbnb either of us have ever stayed in. It looked exactly like the pictures! Absolutely beautiful and homey. Our favorite parts were the screened-in porch, towel warmer, hot tub, and loft bed. Our stay was in April, and though it was rainy and cooler, we had the screened-in porch and hot tub that allowed us to still enjoy our time there. We loved making tea and hot chocolate and sitting under the cute lights on the porch to read. Catrina is a friendly, communicative, and generous host! The welcome gift basket was such a sweet surprise. We both will likely be back someday!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a really great place with all the details clearly well thought out. We would definitely stay here in the future.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a perfect place for a getaway while exploring the nearby parks. The peaceful setting (and hot tub) were just what we were looking for after a day of hiking.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow!
I think that I can fairly say that this was one of the best airbnb's that I have stayed in.
The interior smelled of wood and amber.
The outdoors was like stepping into an aromatherapy shop.
Watching the wildlife was incredible.. from seeing deer, wild turkeys and hearing owls hooting at each other the first night I arrived. I believe them to be great horned owls. The fact that the airbnb was pet friendly was also nice. She offered things from pet beds to pet blankets. Food bowls, etc. The welcome basket was very nice as well and a thoughtful touch in the case you don't bring any snacks. I had my first biscotti here! I also loved the hottub... after a day of hiking.
Thank you Catrina. If my travels bring me back here, I will definitely be a returning customer :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at Catrina's adorable cabin was the perfect location for my husband and I to spend our anniversary! And because we were able to bring our two pups with us it made our stay that much more special. Catrina was amazing at communicating with us and even left us a basket of goodies with an anniversary card. We'd highly recommended staying at her place especially if you want to bring your extended fur-family with you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Catrina's cabin for my 60th birthday and couldn't have been more thrilled with the experience! The cabin was immaculate and was stocked with everything we could possibly need. It was so peaceful and a perfect nature getaway. Catrina was an exceptional host, extremely responsive to messages. She even left a me a birthday card, fresh flowers, and lots of snacks and goodies! So thoughtful! Sadly it was cloudy the night we were there, so couldn't see the stars from the bed at night. But we enjoyed listening to the stream as we slept!
I would 100% recommend staying at this beautiful cabin."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my weekend at Emerson & Wayne, an immaculately curated cabin along a beautiful little creek. The basket of treats including cookies from a local bakery was a delightful surprise. The cabin was very cozy and charmingly decorated indoors and outdoors. Everything was spotless when we arrived. Hiking during the day and getting to enjoy the hot tub in the evening was a delight. I would love to come back in the summer to make more use of the sun porch, deck, and firepit areas."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful cabin for a long weekend stay! Couldn’t have been happier with property. Catrina was a wonderful host who responded quickly to any messages. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it to others!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with everything you could possibly need - Catrina truly thought of everything. Loved using the hot tub after hiking!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,E&W provided a serene and peaceful atmosphere for us to relax after long days of hiking. Catrina went above and beyond with thoughtful little details around the cabin for both our husband and I and our pups. The place smells amazing and welcoming and the design and layout are perfect.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Catrina's place is exactly how it was described and 100% like the pictures. The place is adorable and so comfortable. Not to mention how spotless it was. Close to hiking trails, restaurants, New River and Gauley River. It was the perfect weekend get-a-way.
Will definitely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow I can’t say enough good things about our stay here! Catrina was so responsive and just a fantastic host. The cabin was so clean and beautiful and welcoming! 100% we will be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Emerson and Wayne was everything we hoped it would be. The cabin was just as described. The welcome basket was a sweet surprise! I loved listening to the sound of the creek from the screened porch and the firepit area. So relaxing! Thank you for such a lovely place to celebrate our 26th anniversary ❤️
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived on an unseasonably warm 75deg early March day. We were immediately struck by the beautiful cabin, enhanced by the thoughtful touch of fresh flowers. The cabin's small amenities, such as farm-fresh eggs and locally sourced cookies, added warmth and local flavor to our experience. We came to New River for our “baby moon”; a short getaway before the birth of our second child. We had several wonderful meals, particularly The 304, which not only was excellent but it had affordable prices. We enjoyed breakfast at Wood Iron Eatery, which powered our hike at Long Point, which we recommend for both tranquility and breathtaking views.
Our time at Emerson & Wayne was filled with moments of peace, culinary delights, and the welcoming embrace of nature. Thank you for providing such a splendid backdrop to our special getaway."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our 6th anniversary here! It was such a peaceful and relaxing weekend. The place is so cozy and clean. Would love to come back!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I came to the area to relax and do some hiking. It was such a beautiful space and Catrina was very easy to work with in booking. We would like to come back in warmer weather so we can sit in the screened in porch. One of the nicest places we have ever stayed! Thank you so much for everything!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the value we got compared to staying at Ace and other places in the area. I loved the welcome basket with goodies and all the amenities available to us making us feel right at home. This property is a piece of Appalachian luxury I will be sure to return to! We were also able to check in early free of charge, which was super convenient!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time here! A quiet cabin getaway with state of the art comfort. I wish I could rate it 6 stars just for the snacks alone! Fully stocked kitchen for cooking -or- Just 15 minutes away from Fayetteville if you wanna grab a bite. Thanks for hosting us!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Flawless. Might not be the best for a toddler. Too many things to break and the stairs made us nervous. Otherwise it was perfect!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was so clean and had everything right at our fingertips. I
The hot tub was amazing. Our stay was so relaxing, and the location was convenient to nice restaurants and grocery stores. We will definitely keep this on our list for a repeat trip!! Thank you so much for being the best host!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Catrinas place. Very nice, new and cute cabin. Absolutely loved the screened porch and deck, which made the place feel even bigger.
Nice bonus are the heated bathroom floors and towel warmer. Those floors are wonderful on a cold morning! The shower was also fantastic. Good water pressure and nice overhead shower heads.
The bed was very comfortable, and the appliances all worked well.
The place has basically everything you would need and we appreciated the aluminum foil and spices left out as well as the extras in the welcome basket. I had looked for a whisk with no luck, but that's getting pretty picky.
All in all it's a great little cabin that's perfect for a getaway and vacation.
Most importantly, we would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been using Air bnb since 2016 and can say that this was simply the best place I've ever stayed. It's a beautiful cabin in a beautiful area, every amenity you could think of is available, there was amazing attention to detail, and let's not forget the HEATED BATHROOM TILE. The gift basket upon arrival was so thoughtful and started our amazing stay in such a wonderful way. Great hosts and we will be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,absolutely beautiful! i had such a great time and Cat is such an amazing host! there are so many hiking locations with a great soak in the hot tub after! such a quiet and lovely cabin. the place is more beautiful than the pictures :) i can’t recommend this place enough :))
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was perfect! It was a great weekend get away! Plenty to do at the cabin and in the area!
The cabin was cozy and decorated so cute!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was amazingly nicer than I imagined. Everything was spotless. Catrina was excellent at answering any questions I had…and got back to me almost immediately. I will definitely be coming back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best AirBnB we have ever visited! The pictures were synonymous with reality. This cabin had everything we needed- from parchment paper, to basic cooking spices, lots of blankets, plenty towels, all the glasses and plates, a Bluetooth speaker, reliable wifi/tv, and more! Our host left us a sweet little basket with a welcome note and snacks. We really enjoyed watching deer while we were sitting in the hot tub. This was exactly what we have been needing. We enjoyed every minute we spent here and will be back for our next trip to NRG!
PS if you are coming from an Urban area: Keep in mind that you are going to a rural area- the roads are curvy leading to the cabin. We have been in this area before and it doesn’t bother us at all that it is out in the woods! Travel in the light hours if you are not experienced in driving on back roads."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at Catrina's house! Very well appointed with beautiful decor and sooo cozy! We especially loved the hot tub & peaceful setting. Catrina was very responsive and made check-in/out super easy!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Catrina’s place was exactly as described and even exceeded our expectations. It was private, cozy and very welcoming. Catrina left goodies for us and our dogs to enjoy during our stay. The place was super clean upon arrival and everything was perfect. Catrina was also extremely responsive with her communication. Great place in a great location."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was beautiful and very homey. We visited for my girlfriend and I’s anniversary. We’re from Baltimore so it was nice to sit outside on the porch and look at the beautiful surroundings. Thank you for a peaceful get away and the gift basket! Highly recommend spending some time here to anyone.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING place to stay! We were celebrating our anniversary & Catrina was incredibly thoughtful & surprised us with roses, chocolates & sparkling cider to celebrate! She also provided a snack basket that included local goodies that were delicious! Extremely clean, inviting & cozy space, friendly host, well stocked kitchen, quiet & relaxing spot to unwind. Highly recommend! ❤️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfection! There is nothing else to say! Our family of four and our fur baby stayed at Catrina’s for 4 nights! The cabin is amazing! It has everything you need and more! There was a goodie basket for our family and items for our dog! My kids loved the s’mores fixings, the hot cocoa, and the color additive for the fire pit! The cabin is central to everything we did from NRGNP, Babcock SP, Hawks Nest SP, and other attractions. The hot tub was a great way to end our daily hikes and the bathroom is a dream! This was a perfect fall break getaway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Grab your food and clothes, anything else you'll need for a pleasant stay is already there! Catrina goes above and beyond.
She had a goodie basket not only for us but our furry friends as well. I highly recommend this rental. We hope to be able to reserve this cabin again for our next visit to Fayetteville.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"E&W has definitely been our favorite airBNB to date! You can tell Catrina put a lot of love into this super cute and comfy cabin. When we arrived there was a welcome basket for ourselves and even one for our dog! We instantly felt right at home. Location is perfect for New River Gorge National Park- which is why we were visiting the area. Catrina was also nice enough to send us local eateries and “to dos”- we checked out Pies & Pints from her recommendation and absolutely LOVED it! Absolutely recommend this beautiful cabin!! (If you’re like me, you’ll want to put in a double shower head and heated bathroom floors after your stay.. literal heaven)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Such a cool cabin, with all the comforts of home, nestled in the woods with a stream in the back yard."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Catrina went the extra mile to make our stay amazing. She had fresh flowers and a goodie basket for our dogs as well as for us.
She supplied coffee and she thought of everything we’d need. You can tell extreme care and thoughtfulness went into every detail.
There is a cute little stream outside and she supplied firewood for us. Catrina is definitely the best airbnb host we’ve ever had.
When we asked for a more private place to walk the dogs she sent a detailed description of where we could go.
We were off the beaten path but also close to Fayetteville which has everything you’d need. The area is breathtakingly beautiful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little gem is an absolute treasure in the woods! Very quiet, serene setting, back in the mountains. The cabin was so clean and the decor was perfect. Catrina and Jack were very kind and responsive to all of my questions! Amenities were perfect! 10/10 recommend and would certainly stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect, lovely, serene location! A ln immaculate cabin with a wonderful personal touch! Amenities were thoughtful and personalized! Host qas extremely responsive and kind! Can't say enough kind things or recommend it enough!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for a few days, we loved Catrina’s place. We recommend 100% this lovely home, it is warm, very cozy and peaceful. It was worth it definitely a big deal. A convenient location, there are very fun activities around."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay while exploring the New River Gorge National Park!! The cabin is so well put together and the awesome hosts make it the perfect place to vacation to. We can’t say enough great things about our trip and will recommend it to everyone! Thanks again and can’t wait to return!! 😊
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! This cabin is cozy, inviting, romantic. My husband is a contractor and kept tapping on walls and saying wow they didn’t spare any expense. We were in town for a Spartan race, and cooked almost every meal here. We had everything we needed and more- you could literally just show up with groceries and stay put. I’m face we seriously considered skipping the race and doing just that! But coming back to the hot tub was worth it. Speaking as a picky city girl, I was so comfortable.
There is a road next to the cabin that leads to a dead end so the only traffic is local. We were a little surprised how many cars drove by, maybe a few an hour, but otherwise it was quiet and peaceful, and private."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Epic little getaway down in the hollar. Super comfortable, private and well equipped."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great cute little place for a getaway close to home and perfect if ya need room for a special guest aka granddaughter to spend a day with

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed staying here. It was convenient to family and just a beautiful setting with the brook and train tracks!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was cute, very clean, and a perfect size for two couples. Shelving and TVs were located in each bedroom and were greatly appreciated. We enjoyed the fire pit (although previous tenants had left it full of plastic that we had to dig out) and the outdoor space a lot. WiFi was spotty on occasion but that is expected for this area. Light sleepers may struggle here, but the sound machines were very nice!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful place. Very well put together. With some history with all the modern conveniences
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home was very clean and easy check-in. The traffic was loud in the front rooms but they had sound machines to help. The house is older and a bit drafty but the heat warmed it well. It had everything we needed and was very comfortable. Would stay here again if back in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely stay here again in the future !
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If I find myself back in the area, we will be staying again! The home was everything we needed and had so much charm."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location for why we were visiting. Comfortable beds and all the necessities you would need.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tony is a great host. House was in a good area with a good views. I would stay here again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Tony was fast to respond. House was comfortable. Would stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean space. Looked exactly like the pictures. Responsive host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice stay.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Tony was very quick to respond and GREAT at allowing me to arrive a little early since I was driving in from out of state with my dog.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had no air conditioning, but stated he was getting it installed soon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very close to the riding park. Very clean and well kept. Would stay again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tony’s place was a fantastic and cute place to stop during our family trip! Loved the quaint location and coziness of the house. Pet friendly, and looking forward to booking with Tony again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adventure House was absolutely wonderful! The home itself is very cute, decorated beautifully, and comfortable. The area is easy to navigate and close enough to Beckley proper to be convenient, but far enough out to enjoy the quiet and peace of the country. Tony is a fantastic host who is very responsive and friendly! Definitely a 5-star experience across the board and highly recommend to anyone visiting the Beckley area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Make sure you have the correct address!! Air BNB is wrong. the correct address is 231 Central Street, Lester, WV!! Beckley is not correct and not even in the right direction. That was the biggest issue we had, but simple fix. Overall was a cute little place to stay! Super clean and had plenty of kitchen items! Would stay again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I with our baby stayed at Tony's overnight as we were traveling. Cozy home, very comfortable and clean, easy to find. I liked that they put up pictures of what they had in the kitchen, it makes it easier to plan if we were staying longer. Tony messaged and was available if we had questions. There are train tracks in the pictures behind the house but we didn't hear any go by. My only complaint is the street traffic noise, which there isn't anything you can do about that. When you stay here if you have a sound machine that will help with any noise. Our baby slept just fine in the back room with a sound machine. My husband and I heard some cars going by in the night in the front room but I don't think we lost any sleep over it. The beds and furniture were all very comfortable. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and comfy place. Felt right at home!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A storm had blown in and taken out all the power but Renee was helpful. we ended up not staying because of the power outage and she gave us a full refund even though she wasn't responsible for the storm. She was quick to help and very understanding. we thought the place was so cute and wished we could have stayed. We'll definitely keep her inind for another time.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this place because it looked like a home I could live in, and I was not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful. If I could've plucked the cottage up and put it in my backyard, I would have!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Renee's Country Cozy Cabin has a very unique charm. It's very welcoming and unlike any other places I've seen. A lot of care and considerations must have went into it.
Renee was perfect. She was understanding of my travel situation and accommodated my needs. Communication with Renee was perfect. Location of home was private. I will say Google Map took me past the house I had to turn around and go back luckily it was easy to spot since the photos were up to date.
I give this place a 10 out of 10, I do recommend and I will stay again.
Thank you Renee for having such a beautiful welcoming home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very nice and exactly as the listing shows. Renee was extremely nice in helping us whenever we had issues. Far above and beyond anyone else we’ve had previously. Would definitely stay again.

The cottage is an easy drive to different points in the park, as well as to small towns with restaurants and shops, such as Beckley and Fayette, while still feeling like you are tucked away on a country road. The cottage was comfortable and peaceful and had just about everything we needed for our stay. I would highly recommend, and the host was very kind and available by phone/text."

Renee was incredibly friendly and very responsive, and it was absolutely pristine inside.
I would gladly stay there again"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Renee was super responsive & a great host. Thank you so much.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Renee's place was perfect for our family. It was exactly like described and on pictures. The cottage had everything we needed and had a lot of space for the 3 of us. We didn't cook, but had we have the need - everything was provided. It was SPOTLESS and this is single, most important thing for me when staying anywhere. We loved every minute of our stay! It is close to all the adventures of New River Gorge. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This a great location to explore NRGNP you are literally an easy drive to everything. If you are a light sleeper you may notice noise from the road. Renee is a super responsive host. Very comfortable space
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a girl's weekend, and to visit New River Gorge NP and Preserve. Renee's place is convenient because the park is large and has 4 visitor's centers, with this Airbnb located close to the middle of them.
The cottage is adorable, beds are comfortable, and it felt like a private respite.
Would recommend for 4 guests due to the fact that there is one bathroom, four kitchen chairs, and the extra bed is the pull-out couch in the living room. But it certainly could work for 6, as long as you are aware.
Renee was super responsive and a pleasure to deal with.
Would book Renee's cottage again if in the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little place for an anniversary weekend away, would definitely stay here again. Very clean!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Renee’s air bnb for a weekend getaway to New River Gorge National Park to celebrate ten years together! The home was clean and cozy, and stocked with anything you could need! We enjoyed the privacy it offered while still being close to everything near by, and loved having s’mores by the fire. Loved our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thanks for being a great host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was our first time to stay in an Airbnb home and was not sure in the beginning, but when we entered Renee's cottage everything looked just like in the pictures. It looks like a simple cottage from the outside, but the inside is cozy and warm atmosphere. Everything is clean and the details are well thought. The only thing I suggest for future guests, if you have sensitive respiratory and allergic to perfumy cleaning spray, you might want to make arrangements for alternative with Renee, she is very accommodative. I understand somehow preventing bugs coming in. As overall, I rated this place as A+."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a wonderful stay and having the cottage as a home base was just right!! We will definitely stay there again if we visit West Virginia again!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay in the West Virginia hills. I love the privacy that this space provided while also being close to activities. Renee is as sweet as sugar, very responsive and friendly. I would highly recommend staying here."

Also, it's close to Babcock State Park and Hawks Nest. We are very thankful for this visit and would certainly come back again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside was bigger than expected and nicely decorated. There are blinds on all windows and nice dishes and cups to use. Only 20 mins to Fayetteville where we ate at majority of the trip. The owner was quick to respond and was proactive when needed. The cabin was close to everything we wanted to do (New River Gorge National Park, Hawks Nest State Park, Babcock State Park, Cathedral Falls, and Ace for white water rafting)."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and close to a lot of local attractions. We really liked how it was rural, but not too far out of town. It is just a short drive away from great hiking trails and great food. The place was very clean and cozy."

Thank you again for everything!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and yard
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an adorable house! We stayed in the summer and it was great but I’d love to come back in the winter and cozy up to the wood stove with a book! Renee was amazing. Communication was quick and she was willing to go above and beyond to make our stay perfect. The house was immaculate and just so cute! We didn’t get to enjoy the fire pit due to rain but I did sit on the front porch one night and it was so quiet and peaceful. We would definitely return.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a top notch home.
We very much enjoyed our stay at Renee and Tim’s bnb.
From the personalized hand written greeting to the excellent communication and cozy feel, it was definitely a memorable stay.
We will be staying here for every visit to the area.
They’ve created wonderful kitchen to cook in or you can grill out back on the patio.
They have some seating out back as well for some relaxing after a long day of activity.
Try it, you won’t be dissatisfied."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Everything we needed was right there. It is truly a cabin that is cozy, clean, and pleasant. Renee was quite prompt and engaged in all communications. We also discovered that the location is fairly central to various points in the New River Gorge park.
After a busy day we enjoyed the quiet outdoors in front and back of the cabin. Deer did too as they came grazing by. Thanks for a relaxing stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming and cozy getaway! This was our second time visiting the area. My wife and I are coming up on our first anniversary and this was our first trip together with her parents (who haven’t been on a vacation in a while, along with it also being Father’s Day weekend). So it was important to have all the things about our trip leave a great impression.
This cozy cottage did exactly that and more for the entire three nights we stayed. To start, my in-laws were overjoyed the second we walked in; This was their first bnb stay, as they are used to staying in hotels. In addition, my wife and mother-in-law were blown away with the attention to detail the host Renee put into all the decor to make the cottage feel like a true home - from the wall frames, to the decorative pillows, signs, flower arrangements, comforters, etc. It was so charming! We all were impressed by the outdoor space with plenty of room for everyone to hang. We loved spending our last night grilling out, dining outdoors, and sitting by the fire pit until the sun went down. The hosts already had dried wood ready for our use along with a wheelbarrow full of extra logs to use if needed and the lighter. The kitchen was stocked with all the typical necessities of a normal kitchen at home, which we loved since we cooked half of our meals there. I am a huge fan of coffee and was excited the host Renee had a nice setup with ground coffee and the maker. The whole cottage was the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. The living room and kitchen were very spacious. Wi-Fi was fast working, which was perfect for watching shows on streaming services if needed. The bathroom was great! My wife and mother-in-law loved the heater option to turn on because they are cold natured lol. The bedrooms were beautiful and a nice setup. The mattresses were soft (which we aren’t used to at most bnbs) and perfect to sleep on after a long day of hiking, rafting, and zip lining. Every room was exceptionally clean as well.
Renee was such a wonderful and intentional host! Before we even got there, she made sure to contact us to keep us updated about storms in the area; She checked in on us after we were settled in; and was very quick to respond to any messages or questions we had during the stay. She and her cottage were the perfect home away from home to make for a great family trip! Five stars and more for this stay! The New River Gorge never seems to disappoint and it’s a comfortable, relaxing, and feeling of home like this place that tie it all together- where you start the day, make more memories, laugh, relive adventures, and end the day peacefully. Definitely would stay here again if we come visit the area for a third time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great 3 night stay. Nice quiet area. Spacious inside. My 14 year old schnauzer LOVED the big fenced in yard and would have spent all day out there if we let her. Dollar General at the end of the road is super convenient for anything you need/forgot.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a great place to stop on the way home from Myrtle Beach. The home was clean and comfortable. We would stay there again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The yard was bigger than I expected, my fur baby loved it! Home was very comfortable, clean, and cozy. Forrest was kind, responsive, and cared that our stay was comfortable. Thank you Forrest!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved Forrest’s house! We needed a place to stay as a halfway point during our long road-trip from Canada and this was perfect. The house was super clean and had everything we needed. The large fenced in yard is an added bonus for those traveling with pets. Way better than a hotel! 10/10 recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Forrest’s place was a great stopping point with our dog as we were driving from NC to Montana. Great communication, really nice, clean house and big fenced-in yard for a dog are just a few of the great things about this location. We’d definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Forrest’s place was a great place for our family over Easter weekend. My daughter accidentally left a stuffed animal at the house and Forrest was kind enough to let us know and even dropped it off locally to a relative for us. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Forrest was great and very understanding. He was the light during a rough situation and we greatly appreciate his accommodations!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is perfect and Forest is a great host. Very communicative and fast responding. He was very prompt at answering any questions we had.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Forrest’s place is updated and clean and very convenient to the interstate. We stayed one night on our travels north.
His communication was great and his place is as described. Check in was easy.
We brought our dog, but unfortunately didn't stay long enough to take advantage of the fenced in yard."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forest and his wife were absolutely amazing. In fact, Albert Tab by the house it’s beautiful"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really enjoyed this place!👌 it was very nice and the beds were amazing! And the view is amazing!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place was great for our family vacation to New River Gorge
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We used this place as a jumping point for exploring red river gorge - it was a great option. We loved the yard to let our kids run around outside and used the campfire. It is small town West Virginia - so if you're hoping for a luxury feel in the neighborhood, you're looking in the wrong place. We loved the space and views and the quiet of having our own house vs a hotel."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good experience and friendly host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I reached out the the host a few times and she responded right away. She welcomed feedback and was extremely kind and understanding.
The pictures matched the description and we loved the fenced in area for our dog, the large kitchen, the soft beds, and the lovely outdoor seating areas.
Everyone in WV was so nice. We visited the national park and three state parks. Gorgeous area with a rich history.
Thank you for letting us stay at your well appointment home!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful views, great yard for dog, and friendly and communicative hosts!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"wow what a view! I really enjoyed staying at the Stonewall Cottage. The home and back yard are spacious. The beds are soft and comfortable and the views are epic. perfect for adventurers and cozy seekers alike! We visited in Feb and it snowed! Even though it was cold the showers were hot and the heaters kept us all warm. As new puppy owners, we appreciated the pet friendly atmosphere. I truely felt at hone and I can't wait to visit again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cottage with a gorgeous view of the gorge. My husband and I stayed here with our dog while we went skiing at Winterplace and explored NRG NP. There is a small binder full of recommendations to local places that we fully took advantage of! The cottage was perfect for our needs and the large fenced in back yard was a great addition. After a long day, our Great Pyrenees just relaxed out in the back yard. There are places in the bottom of the fence that a small dog could easily escape, so be mindful of that. Also be mindful that this is a three bedroom home that can sleep 6 but only has one bathroom. We were slightly concerned driving in with our FWD crossover but were thankful that it’s paved roads all the way to the cottage and the roads were well taken care of in the winter without concerns for ice. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Nice home and beautiful views of the WV mountains!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay while visiting our family for the holidays. Perfect for families with kids and dogs. We really loved the huge fenced yard! The view was spectacular. Hope to return in the summer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed with my husband and dog. The home was comfortable (a home away from home), and our dog loved the yard. The views were beautiful, and the location was quiet. It's a nice getaway. We also did some hiking at New River Gorge National Park. It was a good location to check out the park."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Beautiful view.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was perfect for our stay in New river gorge
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely perfect place to stay! Close to the new National park, great hiking, beautiful views! Blaine & Justin thought of it all! Cute and cozy home! Enjoyed the weekend hiking & white water rafting while sitting by the fire after a long day of adventure! Would love to come back again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Wonderful access to the whole park and you cannot beat the view from the backyard. The dogs and kids loved it.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was a great home base for our adventures in the New River Gorge National Park. Clean, well-equipped and spacious, we had everything we (including dogs) needed. A fantastic view off the back deck was icing on the cake. Blaine is a fantastic hostess!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely, quiet place off the beaten path but close to the national park and activities. Wonderful, large fenced in yard. We had a dog. Nice deck with a view to eat outside. Fire pit was a great way to unwind after a day of activities. Great amenities. Hosts responsive to questions. Ping pong table in the shed a fun touch! We were only 4 but could sleep six comfortably. I’m a fan of fall and leaf peeping and this place will be brimming with color in a few weeks!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here! It is incredibly dog friendly and had everything we needed to be comfortable. The view was beautiful. We spent most of our time out exploring, but this was a great place to crash in the evenings!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay here. Stunning views from the deck/back yard. The yard was nice size for our dogs to play in. The house felt very warm and welcoming, we felt right at home. There is so much to do in that area. We spent much of our time exploring the New River Gorge National Park. We really enjoyed the town Fayetteville WV. It is very pedestrian friendly with a few local brewery's and shops. We would 100% stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! beautiful views. Very clean and peaceful. nlNeighbors were friendly. I'd stay again and I do recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved the cottage. It was perfect for our stay. We love that it is dog friendly and has a fenced in yard. The location is perfect for enjoying the New River Gorge park.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our family. Kitchen was stocked well for our needs. Downtown Beckley was very close for grocery shopping. The view was amazing. Unfortunately we were not able to use the firepit or the ping pong table. We stayed for just the week-end and it was very humid and there were some storms that came through in the evening. Location is very close to all the National Park has to offer. We walked some trails and did rafting and ziplining at Adventures on the Gorge. The house was well stocked with info on the trails and things to do in the area. Overall the house was very cute, welcoming and tastefully decorated. We would love to come back to the area for a longer period of time and would definitely stay again. Blaine was great with communication."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The view was so gorgeous, and I loved having a big fenced-in yard for my dog to run around it. Also one of the best stocked kitchens I have ever seen at an Airbnb. The house was closer to neighbors than I expected, but it was a fairly quiet neighborhood. Overall a clean and peaceful experience! Would definitely stay again if I come back to New River Gorge."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location neat New River Gorge National Park. The house was very inviting, clean and comfy. We appreciated clear and proactive communication from our hosts!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could describe this place in one word, it would be COMFORTABLE.
The beds are great and the bedrooms themselves are spacious. The kitchen is wide open, you are not knocking into each other when cooking. The couches recline on the one side. The bathroom is a good size and does not feel like a sauna when you exit the shower because the fan does its job and there is also a window in there. The outdoor areas are just phenomenal. You'll always find somewhere to sit, the view is amazing. Huge fan of the Hammock! You don't really even notice the neighbors because it's super quiet and peaceful. If I ever decide to explore the New River Gorge again, I'll be staying here, where it's ""Almost Heaven"" as the West Virginia folks say. 🥰 Thanks for the experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blaine and Justin’s place is a great place if you’re in the area. Beautiful view, peaceful and close to New River Valley Gorge trails. It was clean, and it was helpful how responsive and helpful they were. I would recommend and happily stay again if I’m back in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Extremely comfortable stay. Clean, with everything you need. Beds are extremely comfy. AC was magical after being out in the heat. The view out back is lovely. To say there is a lot to do at the New River Gorge & surrounding areas is an understatement. Found a gorgeous drive up place to swim near the campground at Glades Creek which is pretty close to the house (FYI) for anyone looking for a place to swim near by. Babcock State Park was lovely too with a water too to cool off."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay at Blaine’s place! It was a peaceful retreat after our hiking in the Gorge. We had a 2 year old with us who loved running around the yard & using the play set. The beds were unbelievably comfortable! Will definitely stay again if back in this area.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view at the top of a mountain. Very nice deck and under porch swing for enjoying coffee or an evening drink with a view. Nestled within a neighborhood so not a lot of “privacy”. About 15-30 minutes away from grocery store or upscale dining. It was a great stay to enjoy our honeymoon together.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Beautiful mountain view and great location near state parks and New River Gorge.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The home was adorable, comfortable, had everything we needed (and more!) and had a beautiful view. Blaine’s communication was thorough and check in was a piece of cake. We loved being so close to rafting, hiking, etc. There was a lot to do in the area! Plus we tried a couple local restaurants that didn’t disappoint. If you’re looking for a place close to New River Gorge National Park, don’t pass this one by!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous views and the coziest home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The beds were very comfortable, everyone slept great. The yard was perfect entertainment for our whole family. Great location for exploring the new river gorge. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Blain was very responsive and attentive to us during our stay. The house accommodated 5 people comfortably,
Especially with one large bathroom. All the necessities were available. I don’t know the costs of other Airbnbs in the area, but I feel like this place was more affordable than AirBnbs closer into Fayetteville. We were able to drive to hiking/biking/walking trails within 30 minutes from the house each day. I had never traveled to the area before, but really enjoyed my weekend there and cannot wait to get back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was clean and roomy. We had plenty of room for my family and parents while we were in town for the weekend celebrating a friends college graduation. The home was beautifully updated and tucked away in the mountains. The directions to the home were great and the lock to the home was the easiest of any Air bnb I have ever stayed! (Thank you!) Clean linens were provided and plenty of kitchen items if you wished to cook. The home allows pets, but did not smell at all like animals had been there. The home was not far from town and we were able to take a break from graduation festivities to grab a little siesta before heading out for the evening. A nap on the hammock was my absolute favorite!! The VIEW!! This was definitely a lovely home and perfect get away for the weekend! We would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a relaxing getaway in Blaine & Justin’s house. Amazing view of foggy mountains from the deck and backyard!Clean and cozy place with everything we needed for a weekend.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful retreat adjacent to New River Gorge! My family of 5 (3 kids: 12, 10, 8) + 1 dog really enjoyed this home. The listing was very accurate and the surroundings were more beautiful than imagined. My kids enjoyed the cozy furniture and ping pong table. My dog enjoyed the yard and my wife and I enjoyed all the wonderful amenities of home plus the view!
The location is excellent: tucked away in a small neighborhood, next to a cliff side and overlooking one of the tributaries into the Gorge. It’s about 30 minutes to all 3 NRG visitor centers and 15 minutes to Beckley and restaurants.
The hosts were very responsive and great at communicating. The house was incredibly clean and had all of the amenities we wanted. This was a wonderful getaway into the NRG, which is exactly what I was looking for. My family made a lot of great memories and we want to return!
Note this is in a neighborhood with kids so please drive slowly and carefully on the narrow roads."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful house that was spotless and welcoming. the house has plenty of beds to sleep 6. the house is big enough for everyone but still feels very welcoming. the area is about 10-15 mins from Beckley. the area is very quiet. it was too cold be outside but the view of the stars at night was beautiful.
the house was a great location to visit multiple areas of NRG. the hosts were quick to answer any questions and helpful before we even arrived. great opportunity to rent and bring your pets (we did not on this trip). the house was clean and smelled great. couches extremely comfortable and kitchen well stocked. we look forward to returning in the future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This felt just like home and was exactly what we needed. This was a very special weekend for us and we very much so look forward for anniversaries being shared here but also making it a family affair. Gorgeous view and game room! All in all this is a great place and we had a blast!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Justin & Blaine were excellent hosts. Great view from the deck. Would visit again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Blaine was amazing to work with. We were meeting our son, his wife and baby in Beckley, half way for both of us for Christmas. As it happened it was in the middle of the frigid storm with ice. Blaine reached out to make sure we knew that our safety was her biggest concern and even if we couldn't come she wanted us safe. She kept in touch as we figured out the weather. As it happened we did go and brought enough food for the whole stay. When we arrived she had a sweet little Christmas tree. We cooked every meal and sat 5 adults and one baby at the table for every meal. We definitely were able to enjoy being together for the holiday. Though we didn't get to spend time outside, we still had a great time. With the Roku we were able to get all our subscriptions and had football, games and food. The kitchen was large enough and roomy enough to accommodate cooking all the meals. The bedrooms are simple and comfortable. Master bedroom was very warm. Would stay again - great host!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Blaine was a thoughtful and kind host, even calling ahead of bad weather to explain the road conditions and offer flexibility and even a refund if we determined the roads were not safe to travel. We ended up making the trip and are so glad we did. The kitchen had everything we needed and the extra touches (Christmas tree and blankets, games) made us feel very welcome and at home. We happened to stay during inclement weather so could not enjoy the view as much as we'd hoped and the house was a bit farther off the main road than expected, which proved a little challenging after the snow, but that could not be helped. We really enjoyed hiking around New River Gorge and the proximity to trails (and local personally curated guidebooks) were probably the features we appreciated the most. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing view! 100% would rent again!

However, that wasn’t the case this time! The space was spotless, spacious, and met every need. The yard and views were the best part for our group. Many recommendations were provided and Blaine ensured we had everything we needed. When visiting family again, we will certainly stay here going forward!"

The kitchen was stocked with everything from pots/pans/dishes to s’mores skewers & plastic baggies. Such a comfy house & tastefully decorated with all the information we needed to fully enjoy everything the area has to offer. The truly special part of this property, however, is the yard & the view. We brought our dog, Penny, and she was so happy!!! When I asked my kids what their favorite part of the weekend was, they said the evening we hung out at the house, making s’mores & playing ping pong. Thank you for helping us to make wonderful family memories!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Thank you, Blaine & Justin! Our stay was amazing!!! Very clean & cozy cabin and easy to get to on a dead end so no traffic. From the attention to detail to having everything we needed, was beyond our expectations. The mountain view in the back was so incredibly awesome!! It was the best sleep ever after venturing out and enjoying either a hike in New River Gorge NP, exploring historical sites such as the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, or enjoying a play in the cute and fun town of Lewisburg.
Blaine & Justin were gracious & polite hosts making sure that all of our needs were satisfied. Would definitely recommend to someone who is looking for a nice getaway. You won't be disappointed!"

We enjoyed walking the hilly neighborhood to view the fall foliage. We would have relaxed on the deck in the mornings to drink our coffee if hadn't been such a soggy weekend.
The large kitchen was well equipped with spices, coffee, and tea. The refrigerator was stocked with bottled water (a nice touch). The living room was cheerful and inviting. TV had roku for streaming; internet/wi-fi provided. The bed, linens, and towels were comfy.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I may hail from the the city of brotherly love, but Sue is the queen of Southern Hospitality. I recently started a job here in Beckley, and my apartment wasn't going to be ready for two weeks, so I stayed at Sue's place until it was time to move in. She was the most thoughtful host I could have asked for. She was always ready for a conversation on her porch, asking if there was anything she could do to make me feel more comfortable. When I arrived late on day 1, she made sure everything was prepared ahead of my arrival so I could just go to bed. The apartment was warm, the outside light was on, and there was a bowl of Halloween candy waiting there (I arrived Oct. 31). If I hadn't already secured an apartment, I would have asked to rent the place indefinitely. Definitely suggesting her place to friends and family that come to visit."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sue and her husband were very gracious hosts. They left a bowl of candy for us-such a ""sweet"" touch at Halloween time. My husband worked from there and had no problem with their fast internet (at times when both of us were working, it still was fast). There is a big washer and dryer, a kitchen with everything you need, a microwave, fridge, stove, oven, a computer station etc. You do have about 10 or more steps to climb to get to the place so you need to be able to climb them, it is not easy for a wheelchair to go up. The New River Bridge is only 25 minutes away, The Tamarack Gallery about 5 minutes away, Grandview State Park is about 20 minutes away and about 40 minutes to Babcock State Park-all of which I would highly recommend. Thanks again Sue, all the best to you and your family!"

It is conveniently located right off the main highway that took us into Fayetteville to get to the bridge (25 minutes). It felt a million times better to return back to our own clean, spacious apartment after a long day, rather than a dingy hotel room for the same price. There are also plenty of great restaurants in Beckley for us to have dinner. As a hostess, Sue was amazing and extremely accommodating- she truly went above and beyond! We will definitely be returning to Sue’s place again in the future! Thank you so much!!"

,,,"BEWARE!!!!! While the description of this property does mention closeness to highway and noise, what is fails to mention is there is NO SEPARATION at all between the front door and steps away from the main road. This rental is pet friendly and if you have a dog I would not stay here under any circumstances. Animals can be unpredictable especially in a new environment. My 6 pound fur-baby got out the front door and within seconds was in the middle of the main road with cars coming at her. This was so traumatizing we immediately packed up and drove another 10 hours back home. The owner was notified immediately and not only would not refund the money for a stay we didn't have, but only offered a $50 pet fee back which to me was a slap in the face because I almost lost my pet due to lack of information. Furthermore, this property is on site with 3 other houses at least of which was another rental sharing the same driveway. This is also NOT A HOUSE! It appears to be a converted shed."
