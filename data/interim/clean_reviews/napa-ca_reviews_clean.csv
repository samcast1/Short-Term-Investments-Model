Robert was responsive, giving lots of lovely recommendations. We felt comfortable knowing he was one text away. Robert also set us up with goat cheese, crackers, and a lovey bottle of wine which was a fantastic touch!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in this lovely bungalow in Napa! It’s a cute, 2-bedroom / 1 bath cottage with a ton of character. It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel room. We had our own rooms and could watch movies in the cozy living room. The beds were comfortable with enough pillows and there were plenty of pristine white towels. Robert left us a bag of freshly ground coffee and a welcome bottle of wine (+cheese and crackers). Easy to access the site and all the equipment was charming (antique stove, armoires that match the decor, etc.). My only recommendation is to add a microwave. We brought home leftovers from some of our fine dining and would have loved to just microwave vs warm up in an oven or cooktop. All in all - would definitely recommend this bungalow and would love to come back again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert was a wonderful host. This quaint cottage was in the perfect location to act as “headquarters” for our visit to see family. Close to downtown, and in a quiet neighborhood, we had an amazing stay."

He recommended a bunch of places and left wine and cheese for us to enjoy. My girlfriend and I had a friendly visitor every morning and night. A cat named Clyde I believe.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A charming cottage with shabby chic decor throughout. Clean with great facilities and as described (washer and dryer came in handy as this was the final destination for our stay in California!) Private backyard out back and lovely porch in front complete with rocking chairs. Quiet and safe neighbourhood.
Easy parking on the street outside the property. 15 min walk to first street/main street so perfect location for dinner and wine tastings locally. Also walkable to cycle hire and the Oxbow public market.

He was very eager to make sure our first trip to the area was amazing. Even wishing my daughter a happy 21st birthday. The cottage was very quaint and intimate. Even though it was just my daughter and i, i could see this being a perfect place for families and couples alike. There were a ton of games to choose from, a very well stocked kitchen and a cozy back yard to sit and take in the end of your day. I would absolutely choose this cottage again the next time i am in town- which i hope is very soon. Thank you so much for an amazing first visit to Napa."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic Napa cottage. It is not hyperbole to say that it is probably the most charming, and clean Air BnB property I have ever stayed in. It really is only a 15 minute walk to downtown Napa restaurants and tasting rooms. Robert was very communicative about check-in and check-out procedures as well as an excellent source of local recommendations. I stayed for a single weekend getaway, but I think it would be the perfect location to base a longer Napa vacation from.

2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Guests are advised to be very careful - the bath tub is ancient and sloping down words , the hot water is operated by two levers instead of knobs or dials , the stove is permanently hot due to internal gas - our party was worried about falling in the bathtub, or getting scalded with hot water or fingers on the stove - we didn’t use any of the above and some of us did not take showers
Other items which are inconvenient include - rickety bedroom drawers, no microwave oven . One closed room inside the house . Room
Heaters are unreliable and internet is Tempramental . Our party had issues with all of the above at various times during the stay
I would not repeat my stay at this place , definitely not worth the price on top of the issues"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for walking into downtown Napa. Never did any cooking but there was a nice size kitchen to prep meals in. No microwave to heat up leftovers though. Bathroom is as stated in description very small so anyone over 5’8” will struggle using it. Was nice to have a washer and dryer for this section of my travels to get caught up on my laundry. Would stay again for sure. It’s a cute lil cottage with a very friendly neighborhood cat.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vintage Cottage is totally charming. Robert has stocked it with a heap of maps and local info guides.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked Robert’s place based on all the positive reviews and they pretty much sum everything up. Thank you!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place had all the things we needed for a short 2-night stay. I was in town because I was attending a Women in Sales Summit, and I brought along my husband, so it was important he could comfortably work from the Airbnb and have a strong internet connection. While I had issues connecting to the Wi-Fi (my company's IT department has more strict guidelines on what networks we can connect to), my husband had no issues connecting and working from Robert's place.
The only issue was the next door neighbor came home late of the nights during our stay, and they were super loud. But that's not Robert's fault at all. Other than those neighbors on that night, the neighborhood is quiet and safe. If we're ever in Napa again for more than a day trip, we'd love to stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and house. Robert was so helpful, hospitable, and communicative. I will definitely be recommending this to anyone coming to Napa!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for our two night stay in Napa! It’s walking distance (10-15 minutes) to all of the downtown restaurants and nightlife which was fantastic after a day at wineries. Robert was helpful every step of the way - from having parking ready for us at an earlier than expected check in time to recommending places for us to go - during the Napa part of our trip and beyond. The best part is Clyde - the friendly cat that greets guests at the cottage! The cottage is an older, somewhat rustic home - but it has charm and is a very convenient spot for a Napa stay."

We owned a 100 yr old house for a few years and it reminded us of home. We had a wonderful time. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen had all you need to cook a good meal.

We happily found that Robert left us a bottle of wine, delicious cheese and crackers in the fridge. What a treat. Each morning we hung out at the front porch drinking coffee he left for us to make and visited with the beautiful neighborhood cat Senor Mayor❤️ These little touches made our stay more enjoyable. During our visit we walked Into town where we explored different restaurants for breakfast or dinner or maybe just a glass of wine. But everything we needed was a quick walk while enjoying the different Victorian style homes on the way. This house made our stay a happy trip. Thank you Robert."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Robert’s cottage for 4 nights and it was perfect for us. As mentioned in the other reviews, Robert is kind enough to block off a parking space in front of the house for his guests which is extremely helpful. Beds are comfortable, location is great (easily walkable to town) and coffee/wine/cheese are provided. We loved the backyard and were happy when the mayor stopped by to say hi. That’s Mayor Clyde the Cat! We would happily stay at the cottage again."

This location was also easy access to various other attractions including a wedding we attended in St. Helena.
We loved having a shelf in the refrigerator dedicated to us for snacks, water, and left overs.
Be sure to check out the Uptown Theatre nearby for evening entertainment. We stumbled upon it and went to a great event there. And again, it is walkable!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I usually opt for a whole house AirBnB, but that's difficult to find in Napa without paying a high price.

We also had the pleasure of working with his brother Steve, who was as equally responsive as John was for any questions. As we did on our last visit, we used their designated driver services, which allowed us to visit wineries without worry. Their knowledge of the area as Napa natives was an added bonus. We are already looking forward to our next trip to Napa and would most definitely stay at their property again."

There has also shared living, and bedroom with a shower is private. We highly recommend it for a short stay in Napa."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed there three days and two nights with my boyfriend for his milestone birthday. The place was great and John was super nice.

They were so very accommodating in their awesome shared space. We were able to come and go easily and had plenty of privacy. The bed was so very comfortable and the room had lots of beautiful natural light (remember pack your sleep masks!)

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for our trip to Napa. John was a great host, even providing things such as face wipes and floss picks in the room. The room and rest of the house were very clean, with a comfortable electric king bed for us to sleep in. The only drawback was the bathroom in the room is quite small. If you want to just relax and lounge around, there is a great shared space in the living room with the sofa, tv and games. John was also great in opening up the kitchen to us for things like water, coffee, etc.
The best thing about this Airbnb was the location, it’s a nice, short walk to downtown and also quick to get back on the highway to other towns/cities in Napa. We would definitely consider booking this Airbnb again on our next visit to Napa."

His recommendations were wonderful!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the layout of this house. It felt surprisingly roomy for a two-bedroom one-bath home and was very comfortable. (Linen sheets were much appreciated!). It is located in a lovely neighborhood, so just walking around was fun. And it is close enough to downtown Napa to walk there. Extremely convenient location: restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, gas stations were all just 3 or 4 minutes away by car.

day long wine tasting tours. The place was perfect t to lounge in our PJs. The living room is cozy and feels like home. Close to restaurants and stores. Wish there was a TV in the living room though. We 3 had to curl up into one of the beds to watch a movie. Great place overall."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and had the basics. Its 1930s charm included period rugs, chairs, and flooring as well as some updates (e.g., a dishwasher). The beds were comfy and the kitchen had most of what we needed, although not much more. The living room had charm from years past and a great leather chair; however, if you're thinking you can gather around a TV with family members or friends, you'll have to do so in one of the bedrooms.
The house is located on a street that's well used, which made for some street noise. For light sleepers, this could be an issue. Downtown is conveniently close, about a 10-minute walk away, with some great restaurants.
We enjoyed our stay and would return again when we want to spend a few days in Wine Country."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful older home close to downtown Napa and a few blocks off the highway. This is an older home but was remarkably clean and well furnished.

The furniture is comfortable, the floor plan is totally workable, the art work/pieces make you feel like you are living the good life in 1930! The home is cozy and the beds are super comfy . . . and pure 100% linen sheets? I mean who does that anymore? The back yard is VERY spacious and there is NO musty smell in the house.
Jason was VERY responsive to my queries . . . even the odd ones! Thank you Jason!
The house is located on 1st street which is a main arterial to downtown Napa. The bedrooms are in the back of the house at the backyard area. This is good if you are street noise sensitive.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Beautiful home with a lot of character in walking distance of all the downtown shops and restaurants. We loved having an afternoon glass of wine in the peaceful backyard oasis.
Some things to note - the dryer took about 3 cycles to dry a small load. We were traveling with a baby so laundry is a must. There was also no coffee, this is on me for making the assumption that would be included in cooking essentials - in my experience it generally is for an Air BnB at this price point. I should have clarified with the host beforehand. Overall, I highly recommend and would stay here again!"

The only thing that would have made the visit more enjoyable would be new sofas - extremely uncomfortable and impossible to sit without cushions sliding onto the floors, and occasionally us as well - as a result we spent our time as a group inside at the dining table and avoided the living room. Otherwise, completely charming. We would definitely return. Thanks for being such great hosts."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two bedroom, two full bath, full kitchen, dining room, living room as advertised. Total space is about 1,650 square feet with an outside deck and hot tub which was hot, but we never got around to it. 15 minute leisurely walk to downtown was perfect for us. Lots of restaurants, bars and tasting rooms on easily navigable streets which felt very safe.
The house has everything that you would need. Full size fridge and dishwasher as well as HVAC and is fully stocked with small wares.
If there was a downside, I would say that one bedroom is like a 5 star hotel. The second one less so. It was a noticeable difference.
We had a great time in a great house."

Plenty of dinnerware and glasses and utensils and cooking tools. Nice modern marble dining room table that can seat 8 comfortably.

The primary bedroom has a king size bed - very comfortable with nice linens. The en-suite bathroom has a jetted tub. The second bedroom, located at the front of the home has a full or queen size bed that was also very comfortable and also has nice linens. The en-suite bathroom has a nice shower in it. Both bathrooms were outfitted with nice plush towels, nice soaps and hairdryers. It’s located within walking distance to downtown Napa so it was easy to get to the restaurants, bakeries and all the shops downtown without having to drive and find parking. Overall, it’s a great place to stay and the hosts were very helpful and easily accessible."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really not much to say except that the property alone is worth a trip to Napa. Without a doubt the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful stay here! The location was conveniently close for our needs and felt very safe; most restaurants were only a few minutes drive or a short walk away. The house is spacious and well decorated with lots of bright, natural light from the windows and sunroofs. The appliances are all modern, so we felt comfortable using them. Temperature control was easy using the nest, dishwashing and laundry was very intuitive, and the gas stove and refrigerator both seem industrial-grade. The bathtub in the master bathroom was larger than I expected, and the jets on it were enjoyable too. Towels were abundant, clean, and fluffy; even the Charmin toilet paper was noticeably great quality! The hosts were also very responsive for any questions that came to mind. We couldn't have asked for more on our Napa getaway."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home & kitchen. The master is lovely and the place is thoughtfully designed. Walking distance to downtown!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for what we needed. It offered a relaxing getaway, was so close to a spa, restaurants, and wine tasting. We cooked a fair amount in the house and it had everything we needed. The master suite is so luxurious and we absolutely loved our stay. Hot tub in the back was the icing on the cake. We will definitely be back, we loved exploring Napa and walking everywhere from the house!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"La Casita Rosita is a superb base for exploring Napa Valley. The bungalow is fantastic: upgraded, open, excellent light, functional & high end kitchen, and overall filled with subtle design touches that show a real desire by the owners to create a superior guest experience. And as nice as the website photos are, the property shows even better in person. Communication with the Francesca and Mark was excellent, the check-in process seamless, and, finally, we were happy to see that even the little details were accounted for, e.g., plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, etc. that are often overlooked by other hosts. We will definitely plan to stay again for our next trip the Valley."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic! The pictures don’t do this home justice. It looks like a restoration hardware catalog. The chef’s kitchen was perfect for our 3 nights. We decided to cook all of our meals in to take advantage of the house. The beds were comfortable, the back yard is large and private, and the layout is great for 2 couples. Only a few blocks from downtown, we walked down every morning for a cup of coffee and shopping. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone in the Napa area! We will definitely be back!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed the opportunity to enjoy my weekend at this beautiful home. I also loved that the house was exactly how the pictures were.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, relaxing, quiet home in downtown Napa."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was great. Spacious living areas. Comfortable all around. Second bedroom is slightly small, but it worked fine for us. Hot tub was a nice touch. The house had everything we needed, including a washer and dryer. Easy to find. Even though it was chilly, we were able to walk downtown to restaurants and shops. Would absolutely stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is absolutely fantastic!
The location was just about as good as the house itself. The drive to most wineries was 10-15 minutes and the house could not have been cleaner.
Highly recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a relaxing property! Just what we needed.
My husband booked this home for my birthday getaway (last minute plan) and Francesca & Mark were very responsive to all of his questions. They are excellent hosts and made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable in their home.
We were absolutely blown away by the house; stylish, modern and more gorgeous in person than the pictures posted here.
The home was CLEAN, spotless clean including the table, chairs and hot tub that was outdoor. Documentation was spot on with all information in a single binder which made our stay effortless. The instructions were clear for entry, wifi, hot tub operation, jacuzzi, grill operation etc.
Amenities were plentiful and the home had natural light in the day. Pictures posted are accurate. Master bed is very comfortable, the bath tub is amazing!
The kitchen was stocked; coffee, spices, plates, silverware, bowls, mugs, pots, pans and different glasses for wine, cocktails, etc. It had everything we needed to cook our meals.
My husband also hired a private chef to cook us a birthday lunch and he did a wonderful job as the kitchen was adequate for him to prepare a four course meal. He also set up a wine tasting experience for us at the bar counter.
We will always remember our stay and will love to come back in the future.
Definitely recommend this property :)"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was, without a doubt, the most amazing Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The pictures are beautiful and they don't do the home justice.

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Francesca & Mark's home in Napa is a beautiful place for a weekend getaway. We spent most of our time at the house since the restaurants and wineries in the area were only open for take-out due to COVID-19. It is a very short walk to downtown Napa. We loved the open floorplan and beautifully decorated interior of the home. Francesca & Mark were very responsive to our questions. Hosts are inflexible with assistance animals (ESA) in the home even if documentation is provided.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was amazing and the location was awesome!
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a great location! We would have given 5 stars if the furniture was more comfortable. The two couches in the living room are too low and broken down to be comfy and the master bed is so high I had big trouble climbing (jumping) in. The bed was comfy once I got in so maybe providing a stepping stool or somehow lowering the bed frame would be great! Francesca and Mark were very easy to work with and very fast with communication - they get 5 stars! If they upgrade the couches we’ll be back!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so lovely and romantic! The design detail throughout the house makes it feel so luxurious. The location is also perfect.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We truly loved the home. This was our first ever Air BnB stay — and i’m scared to try any other places for fear that they won’t be able to compare. So awesome. Loved every part of the property!!! And the proximity to downtown was just perfect.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Francesca and Mark’s Napa home is one of a kind. Beautiful in every way.

She notified me early in the day that the room was available for early check-in if I was interested in an early check-in which I did take advantage of. It was very nice to have the room accessible since I was already in the area. The room was quaint, clean, and very comfortable with all amenities provided and well stocked. Due to Lesley's great emphasis on providing a relaxing stay she does not assign check-out chores which I appreciated greatly. Lesley even went the extra mile to mail belongings that my daughter left behind in the room. We could not have asked for a more helpful, kind, and accommodating hostess."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Napa for a fun girls trip, and Lesley’s place was perfect! Her place is conveniently located by downtown Napa and the highway. From check in, to welcome drinks and a happy hour beverage, Lesley was accommodating and kind.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our one night stay at Lesley's was lovely! We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! Since our visit was so short, I can't really comment on the location in terms of walkability to nearby shops/restaurants, but it's certainly well situated to enjoy wine country by car.
Lesley was great to communicate with and gave us lots of suggestions ahead of our trip. The room is well appointed, and clean, and the bed is very comfy.
My only issue is the Napa hotel tax; I would have preferred that it be included in the total charge up front rather than as a ""surprise"" payment closer to our arrival date. Because of the exchange rate, it was about $50 Canadian.
Thank you, Lesley, for your hospitality! We hope to be back soon!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at Kristas place for a weekend in Napa and we absolutely loved it. The overall neighborhood is peaceful and very clean - and that carried over into the living space as well. As soon as we stepped inside we were impressed by the design and furniture. The place was spacious for the two of us and looked just like the pictures. Everything was clean and there were nice amenities like two bath robes and plush blankets. It made our weekend so much better having a nice place like this to come back to. Overall, we would love to come stay again."

The instructions to find the property were excellent, and Krista was so fast on responding. We were very happy with our stay and would recommend this place for everyone! It is very close to all the wineries and to downtown Napa. A few minutes from it there are stores to buy groceries and it makes it very convenient for all guests.
There's a book with recommendations which we really appreciated.
If you are going to the wineries to enjoy, definitely stay here."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, my one year old, and I enjoyed a two night getaway in Krista’s condo. It was very clean, beautifully decorated, and well appointed. Krista was a stand out communicator, always responsive and super helpful. A bottle of wine and chocolates even welcomed us when we arrived, which was a special touch. The kitchen had what we needed and the space was very comfortable. The grounds surrounding the condo at Silverado are also beautiful to walk around and enjoy. It is conveniently located, with oxbow market, downtown Napa, and (our favorite) Yountville all a close drive away. We would love to come back someday soon."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly the best! Came to Napa for my mother’s birthday and this was truly a dream. Krista is incredibly helpful, kind, responsive, and friendly.
The condo is top notch and has all the items you need during your stay. All items are new, modern, chic, and practical. Not to even mention the beds and sheets… To die for!!! Even the sofa-bed felt incredibly comfortable and orthopedic, and better than most beds I’ve experienced in hotels.
I will definitely be returning!
-Regine"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying with Krista. She is a fantastic host! She makes it a breeze to check in and out and even allowed us to check in early when our flight times changed. The space is always clean and well stocked, as well as beautifully decorated and filled with recommendations on local attractions. Staying on the Silverado property is a pleasure with it having so many great amenities and the proximity to both downtown Napa and Wine Country. I highly recommend staying with Krista!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend Krista’s Airbnb! It is adorable and decorated so well. The whole Silverado property is gorgeous and the location is perfect/very central to everything. We loved our trip we will be back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was perfect down to the last detail.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I really lucked with Krista’s place. It is in a great location with lots of great amenities including the pool. Plus we were greeted with a lovely bottle of wine and chocolates! What a nice surprise as welcome gifts seem to be a thing of Airbnb past. The condo is beautifully appointed with really nice decor and high quality bed linens and towels. Krista was also super responsive. 5-star quality all the way. I just hope it’s available the next time I’m in Napa.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Krista's place had everything we needed to be comfortable for a long weekend stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, kitchen was well stocked and very clean. We will be coming back to stay here again for our next Napa visit!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is exactly as advertised - very comfortable space for our family of 3 (including 1 toddler). Really thoughtful amenities - fully stocked kitchen, bathroom with toiletries, smart tv. Krista was very professional and hospitable, which is not always the case for airbnbs. A beautiful place to call ""home base"" while you explore the area!
The walls in the resort are definitely thin, so you will hear an occasional neighbor passing by or walking around upstairs, but quiet hours were truly quiet and we had no issues even with a toddler, just something to be aware of.
The resort itself is a little removed and requires a short 10 min drive to get into town. There is an on-site marketplace that has sufficient sundries and breakfast/lunch... but I'd plan on a car to venture out and get the most out of your experience.
Would not hesitate to stay here again next time we are in the area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time at Krista’s! The airbnb was so cute and well stocked and Krista always checked in on me and my group and was a fast responder/great communicator. Would definitely recommend!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I rented Krista’s place for our 10 year anniversary trip to Napa. And I can honestly say it exceeded our expectations. The back porch was perfect for early morning coffee drinking, it was very clean with the cutest decor, and it was perfectly located between wineries and downtown Napa! Krista, our host, was so easy to get in touch with and even checked in during our stay to make sure everything was going well. If we ever return to wine country we will definitely be renting here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful unit. Clean spacious. All amenities needed Very comfortable great location easy check in and check out. Highly recommend
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was absolutely perfect! Walking into the unit feels like you're walking into a design magazine. It's gorgeous! The condo is comfortable, clean and spacious. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. There is a Keurig coffee maker, dishwasher, toaster, and all the cooking equipment that you could want.
My husband and I also enjoyed sitting in the private patio that is just outside the bedroom. I thought the bed was very comfy and the bathroom was nice and spacious. The shower and toilet are in a separate room from the sink which is great. The closet is very spacious as well.
I thought the location was perfect. It's a short walk to the Silverado market, laundry facilities, and the pool. By the way, you don't need coins to use the on-site laundry...there is an app that you can use.
Krista was very communicative and her responses to my questions were fast. She is very experienced and makes you feel at home.
Overall, my husband and I loved our stay. We will be back for sure!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just super comfy and adorable. Krista was an excellent host.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Krista was a phenomenal host and this is a great place to stay. We enjoyed a week here for our honeymoon and Krista added so many special touches and was very attentive to our requests and any needs that came up. Beautiful location in Napa and we were central to everything we wanted to enjoy. Only issue is that the upstairs unit is quite noisy, even with the provided sound machine. There were a series of tenants coming through the upstairs unit throughout our stay and some were especially noisy in the early morning."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came to Napa to celebrate my birthday. This place exceeded all of our expectations, it was super clean beautifully decorated, and fully equipped. The location was perfect no matter what activities you’re into. On top of the place being awesome so is the host, Krista. She responded quickly with any issues we had and is so sweet. Whenever we do revisit Napa I would love to stay with Krista again and would highly recommend to anyone coming to Napa."

Very comfortable bed, clean, beautiful bathroom etc. Wishing we had done some food shopping because it was fully stocked with appliances and cooking tools. The grounds of the Silverado resort were beautiful to walk around as well (and the small general store on the property definitely came in handy several times). Will be back soon!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Most peoples Airbnb descriptions over promise and underdeliver. Krista’s place is the exact opposite. She literally thought of everything that a person would need when they select an Airbnb and are staying for an extended period of time.
The decor was great too! You can tell it wasn’t items that were just hand me downs. Everything was thoughtfully selected and picked out for the theme she was going for.
The location was out of town but easy enough to get to Napa downtown (10 min) and all the wineries in neighboring towns.
Her communication was great too. It was great being able to respond to someone courtesy, respectful and informative. Krista really made it feel like I was staying at a family members home.
Thank you so much!"

Conveniently located for visiting all the wineries in downtown Napa, and Yountsville! Check in/out was easy. Please note that you will not be able to make tennis or golf reservations staying here despite it being on the Silverado property (this is mentioned in the description of the condo but the Silverado enforces this strictly). We would definitely stay here again and appreciate how helpful and friendly Krista was!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Newly renovated and convenient
To restaurants and vineyard"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Modern, clean and professional. We will definitely come back."
,,,"We arrived late at the accommodation, which was situated on a poorly lit street. It was tough to find the house number. Next-door, people with a large black dog were making noise on the steps. Despite asking twice, they couldn't help us locate the address. Ironically, the lodging was next door. The place was clean but had an old, antique interior. The room & kitchen & bathroom lack of window blinds compromised privacy, and the small bed wasn't suitable for two. I had to sleep on the living room sofa. The bathroom was tiny, with no blinds and a shower curtain around the tub. Two of us had to skip showering. We ended up staying just one night of our two-night reservation due to these issues. The host, Robert, was kind, but the lack of privacy and inconvenient bathroom were significant problems."
,,,"The day before our trip, we learned of an extreme storm in Napa (high winds, flooding, road washouts, felled trees, power outages, businesses closed, etc). We asked the host if the house was ok (power? flooding?). They said they would check & reply; but after many hours (& previously fast replies) they did not answer (very stressful when trying to make time-sensitive decisions). A state of emergency was then declared in Napa, so we asked the host if coming was safe/made sense & if we need to cancel, if they would be willing to provide a refund. Host didn't answer re safety; just said we could cancel under their standard cancellation policy (refund of less than 50%). We asked to book a different weekend so as not to lose all the money; again, no response. If the host wants to stick it to guests and force payment in extenuating circumstances - fine. But it was unprofessional to refuse to answer questions about safety. If you value communication, don't book any of these hosts' properties."
