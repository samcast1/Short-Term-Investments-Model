2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mitch was very responsive whenever we had questions about the place. We had a few times we had to ask to turn down the AC and were answered within minutes every time. You can tell the hosts put a lot of work into making the bnb a nice place to stay. We didn't realize until after we booked that there was another bnb upstairs which was a little inconvenient for the fact that we have a dog that gets protective of us when she hears unrecognized voices and sounds. The highway access was convenient but a little loud at times since it's right next to the house. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would book with Mitch again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! Was in town for a tournament. The apartment is located in a finished basement. The bedrooms have daylight windows but no windows in either living space or kitchen. There is an AirB&B upstairs too - they didnt know anyone was downstairs and were having a family get together but the family upstairs quieted down when we asked later at night (they were super nice about it!). Mitch was very responsive and apologetic. It all worked out, we had a great stay. Everything was super clean and cute. Fully stocked kitchen and extra blankets etc. We had everything we needed, the hot tub was fun too! It was snowing and beautiful. The house is at the end of a dead end so a lot of privacy outside and easy parking. Would recommend."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here after another location was not accommodating us, and am so glad we made the switch! It was a downstairs location, but there was never any noise or cross over with anyone from the upstairs apartment. Felt completely private."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Affordable launch pad for anyone looking to explore the surrounding areas and national parks while enjoying the benefits of Idaho Falls. The hosts are pros who are proactive in their communication and respond almost immediately to inquiries. I was greeted with a personalized welcome sign upon checking in which was a nice touch. The fridge was stocked with water and condiments. The Wi-Fi was blazing fast as I like to play video games and had no issues. My pup LOVED the neighborhood, especially Central Park. I enjoyed food delivery from several nearby restaurants, and especially liked MOD Pizza, New Hong Kong, and Hokkaido Ramen. More than anything else, I appreciate the hosts affording me privacy to simply relax."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute cozy place. Clean and well kept up.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was better than I expected. Mitch was very thoughtful, hospitable and the unit was literally ideal for my needs at the time. Toward the beginning of the stay, he took the initiative to refund $15 due to him and his family working in the backyard (which created a tiny bit of extra sound). Incredibly kind gesture that I'll never forget. Even though the sounds didn't bother me whatsoever, his thoughtfulness in that instance shined a light on his good character. I was in the middle of moving and spent a great deal of time inside the unit figuring out the next steps. The super-fast WiFi was amazing! The bed was extremely comfortable and got good sleep each night. Lots of climate control options which helped a ton, especially at night. If you're ever in Idaho Falls, I HIGHLY recommend staying there.
Mitch, thanks again for such a refreshing stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot , in a quiet neighborhood. Perfect for our few days in Idaho falls. Mitch is always beyond helpful and kind."

I had a question, sent a message and received an immediate reply. I would stay here again and recommend to others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Mitchs home was great. Had everything as advertised. It is in a basement setting. Master bedroom is in the living room and a pull out couch. For taller people, the bathroom is narrow, but still usable. The 2nd bedroom is also a narrow room. Otherwise a lovely, safe place to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place truly embodies the feeling of a relaxing retreat. The location is prime because it is in an adorable, quiet neighborhood and still has proximity to the heart of Idaho Falls. Not to mention, the space is so well curated and cute as a button!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place in a pinch to take care of some business in the area - not reading the description. I had no idea I had an absolute treat to relax in waiting for me. I can only describe this suite as easy and comforting to sink into, effortlessly washing away the tension of a day.
Everything worked: the location was spacious, entry was easy, parking was convenient, and the bed was comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with small amenities, and the bathroom was chock-full of everything I forgot to bring after my 14-hour drive.
The house manual answered all my questions, so I only had to ask Mitch a question once. They were helpful and kind. I felt welcome here."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to spend a night or two on a roadtrip. Neighborhood is a quiet, suburban area. Apartment is clean and enough space for 2 people, it does have a murphy bed but I think it would start to feel cramped with more people. I loved the sauna touch, that was really enjoyable."

Queen size bed is in the front room, and there's a fold down single bed in the back room that we didn't use. We used the sauna every day! Host was immediately responsive upon booking, and I never needed anything else. Location was great for downtown activities, great restaurants, and access to freeways to Yellowstone. I would stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mitch and Mandy‚Äôs place was awesome. My girlfriend and I were bummed we could only stay one night as we were just passing through on our move to Northern Idaho. They thought of everything. Everything to cook, bake, and relax after a day on the town or the outdoors. I would highly recommend staying here. We will definitely stay again should we decide to explore southern Idaho."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a must-stay for anyone traveling through the area! Super cute and private guest suite and the sauna is amazing! Mitch and Mandy were awesome hosts and very responsive, even over the holiday!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in the area for 5 days exploring around Idaho & Yellowstone. It is a great space, lots offered in a small footprint. A little loud around the neighborhood a few nights, but it settled down around dark or a little after. There was one car that was loud at all hours, very proud of their exhaust.
The sofa bed was comfortable, the kitchen had all I needed and the sauna was a nice treat to enjoy during a rest day before departing for a long drive back home. While I was gone during most of the daytime hours, one is able to hear the activity from upstairs so if a light sleeper it may be worth some ear plugs or turning on the extra fan found in the guest nook across from the bathroom to minimize that disruption.
It's very near all the activity of Downtown Idaho Falls, about a 5 min drive or a 1-2 miles away, but in a neighborhood where you are away from it all. Overall, they did a great job with this space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone!!! üíØ
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing sauna extremely satisfied thank you guys!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gem of an Air BnB. This was the perfect stay for us with our 5 year old and 18 month old. We really felt right at home and the sauna was such a treat for mom and dad to relax! Cutest, cleanest, homiest place! Way better than any hotels you could stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 9 month old, and I stayed here while visiting friends. The place was cozy and lovely for all three of us. We felt right at home. The bed was comfortable, kitchen was well stocked, and the sauna was such a unique and relaxing touch. I loved getting in there every night after a long day!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is great !!! It‚Äôs centrally located on a beautiful and quiet tree lined street. The unit itself is very comfortable and the bed was surprisingly amazing ! I guess pullouts can have outstanding mattresses. The sauna is an AMAZING amenity and the robes that were provided were plush and soft. Stay here!!! It‚Äôs a gem.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mitch and Mandy‚Äôs downstairs unit is very cozy and clean. The sauna was a nice bonus. I will definitely be staying again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place. Neat and clean. Great location and full amenities loved it
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mitch and Mandy were friendly hosts who helped us feel right at home. The sauna was a nice addition as well. We were not at the apartment much because we were trying to do as much exploration as possible of the surrounding areas.
If you are staying here to go to Yellowstone be aware it‚Äôs still almost a few hours from door step to Old Faithful. We left at 5:40am on a Sunday got through the West Entrance at about 7:50 and then to Old Faithful about 9.
One thing to be aware of is that it is an old downstairs apartment and while the front room with the fold-out bed has an air purifier in it the back room with the twin Murphy bed seemed to be more stuffy. If you are around more than us you can open the main door and get some fresh air circulation. The one chance we had to try this it seemed helpful.
Overall a great place to stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mitch and Mandy‚Äôs home is meticulously clean and lovingly appointed with many thoughtful touches. Our favorite thing was the gorgeous hand ‚Äì built sauna. We expected a small premade kit sauna, but this one is deluxe. It was a great treat and so relaxing after our 11-hour drive that day! The neighborhood is very quiet with lots of big shady trees, and we enjoyed walking around it."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was great. However there was no coffee maker apparently due to an insufficient electrical design in the kitchen. Water pressure in kitchen sink was down to a trickle. Extra Murphy bedroom is very small and wound not accommodate anyone over 5‚Äô10‚Äù.

We didn‚Äôt end up using the sauna as it was too hot outside for us to want to get hot on purpose lol but the fact that it‚Äôs even there and available for use by guests is amazing. This place was PERFECT for us and our pup. We really enjoyed our stay at Mitch and Mandy‚Äôs and would absolutely be back if we ever are in need of a place to stay in that area again."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts, great location, great place to stay. I wouldnt say its baby proof which isnt expected because why would you baby proof a home that doesnt often have babies haha but if you do stay here with little ones, just know that the oven, heaters, and back bed were the biggest things we had an issue with as far as keeping our toddler from touching. The back bed was less tein size, more toddler sized so we were very squished, and my toddlers feet kept getting stuck between the wood and the mattress. The biggest issue overall was how hot it was down there. Even with the air filter fan running, we were sweaty all night. The back room outles dont work so you couldnt plug the fan in that they had in a closet, so we just sweat a lot even though it seemed like the vents were putting out air conditioning, it just wasnt enough at all.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place is a lovely loft apartment above their garage. The location is easy to find but you do need to navigate the one way system to get to the driveway. The kitchen has all you need and the neighborhood has lots of lovely period properties. We used the location as an halfway between Yellowstone and Grand Tetons, as the roads are still not open in Yellowstone, and it worked really well.
We had a great walk along the river past the Hydro plant and the falls. A great stopover and recovery spot after visiting the parks. Rachel communicated well and we had a really nice stay. Thank you"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing I appreciated is the thoughtfulness Rachel put into making me ( a stranger and visitor) feel like a valuable and welcome guest in every way! I spend way more time than most people on researching properties before I book. I am a sensitive, picky person and that requires that I understand what expectations are fair to place on the host. This is, IMO, one of the most beautiful and unique restored homes in the historical district. A meticulously manicured garden and easy to find corner lot. Check-in process was clear and easy. It was private and I felt very safe. The space was beautiful! Exceeded my expectations and I felt like I was home. It was clean, peaceful, welcoming. I loved the skylights, and wood molding on every window (that can be opened) and doorway. It had all of the makings of a studio apartment with a separate bathroom, closet, entry, and airy open space with upscale furniture, linens, retro-farmstyle FULLY stocked kitchen , 55"" TV, quality bedding.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is everything you see in the pictures and more. It was spotless, smelled lovely, wifi was fast and reliable.
The bed was the highlight for us, after covering 3000 miles in 4 days on our road trip, it was just the comfort we needed to get a good rest before our next adventure.
Strongly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home in a great neighborhood. The city is spread out, so everything was a short drive away."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When we arrived at about midnight, the front door lock would not unlock!! I started to call Breanna's contact info available to us. it was very cold out and very late . I expressed that in my texts and emails. Breanna responded quickly for how late it was. door would not open, she gave us code to garage door, we got in that way. ( Breanna came first thing in the morning to change out the dead battery in the entry lock, problem solved) When we walked in the place, We were very pleased and the home was even nicer than the pictures. our two grandkids traveled with us on this trip 6 and 8 years old. they even commented on how nice the place was!!! Every time we travel to visit our family in Idaho Falls, We will try our best to stay in this same place!! Hopefully it will be available for our next trip? The whole experience was 100% amazing!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place for families to stay and, as if, you never left home"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Breanna was easy to work with, and very responsive. The house was comfortable and great for families."

The neighborhood is very quiet, the location was very convenient for us, and we plan on staying here again if the property is available duringour next trip!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate place that made my mom, my husband, my toddler and I feel like we were in a place better than a hotel cause it was so clean and up to date! I appreciate that shoes are not allowed inside the house which means my toddler can roll on the floor and so I can feel comfortable being on the carpet. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. Breanna was very thoughtful in that they shoveled the driveway and walkway for us when we arrived when it snowed. Would stay here again!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It worked for us
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"After cancelling a different booking because of cleanliness issues, Breanna was immediately accommodating. Our stay here was wonderful.
The home smells sweet and is VERY clean. No hidden grime. The backyard is fully fenced and has a good amount of grass which our kids loved playing on.
We realized early on that the fridge/freezer was not working. We used our cooler to pack with fresh ice each day as a repairman was not available. Breanna reimbursed us for the ice and food that spoiled. She did all she could in this unpredictable situation.
Note: We noticed the crib looks to be a 'drop down' crib, which were recalled & banned in the US. Just a heads up for parents who feel more comfortable bringing their own pack n play instead. Hopefully it will be replaced with one of current standards to ensure the safety of the littlest of guests.
Check out was simple and starting laundry/dishes is something we do at all rentals anyway. All in all, a favorite for us, we'd stay again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pros: Great location. Comfortable. Nice kitchen with pantry and nice appliances. We loved the Easter decorations and fresh flowers. Parking near front door to unload bags and groceries. The house was well stocked with everything we needed.
Cons: Extra set of rules that aren't on their listing, i.e. If you are staying Sunday night take the outside garbage to the street and bring back up to the garage on Monday after pickup. Also, no eating in any areas except for dinning room or kitchen. (So movie and popcorn night for the family is out). When we booked this place we agreed to all the rules. These rules were not stated."

It was also very well decorated and it made the space so welcoming. Breanna clearly spent the time to think about and anticipate every need. There were so many extras and small touches that helped in our stay. The kitchen was fully stocked with every thing you could need. We didn't need to run to the store every time we needed something. Several times that we thought we needed to go purchase something we ended up finding it (ie. - plastic wrap). All in all we felt like we were home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Was a beautiful house. Felt like home. Everything you need is there waiting on you so you don‚Äôt have to rush out because you forgot something. 11 out of 10 hands down!!

I love the little personal touches too, like the hallway wall decor. I also have to mention, the air freshener used was lovely! It was a great location for us. It was an easy 8 min drive to both hockey rinks as we were there for a hockey tournament. Everything else such as shopping was an easy 10 min drive. The beds were comfortable too. Absolutely lovely home with a quick response host. We will definitely check it out again for our next hockey or baseball tournament in IF."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"5 stars. My husband and I stayed here for five weeks, and we had a lovely stay! Breanna, Melanie and Mandy are awesome hosts - friendly, very helpful and super responsive. The internet was perfect for both of us to work remotely and be on zoom calls during the week. The house is super cute, well-decorated, comfy and was sparkling clean upon our arrival. The kitchen is open, spacious and well-stocked for cooking lots of meals. The location is great for short weekend trips! We drove a few hours on the weekends to ski at Big Sky and Jackson Hole. The neighborhood was nice, quiet and safe. I enjoyed going on walks around the neighborhood for exercise in the evenings. We look forward to staying here again next time we are in the area, and we highly recommend for others!

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Breanna, Mandy, and Melanie, were excellent hosts. We spent 2 weeks cleaning out my mother's house to get it ready for sale (she moved into a local retirement home) and their home was the perfect place for us to stay. We enjoyed coming back to the house and recharge every for 2 weeks after working at Mom's house. It was very comfortable, clean, and quiet (it is a wonderful neighborhood). We also like that the house was stocked up with little items that can be very useful during a trip, especially items in the kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry room. It shows that the hosts understand what travelers want and need!
We would like to come back to this house if it's available in our future trips to Idaho Falls to visit Mom."

I‚Äôm not certain ‚Äúnew‚Äù in profile, is still relevant, as certainly some carpet wear, stains, and general finishes wear was noticeable. Still, offered all that expected in overall value.
Great location, quiet at night (house currently being built next door) did give some daytime noise but not bad.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our 2nd stay in this Airbnb. Our first was in 2020 & even 3 years later the home was still just as clean and well kept as it was then. Weston is a great host and always super responsive. If you‚Äôre extra picky about bathroom cleanliness and comfy beds this is definitely the Airbnb for you. I am ridiculously picky about bathroom cleanliness and where I‚Äôm comfortable showering in someone else‚Äôs home. The showers, kitchen, all
of it‚Ä¶ every detail is immaculate.
The beds are very comfortable with nice bedding. Attention to detail here does not go unnoticed.
Also, the smell of this home is sweet & clean. It was the same 3 years ago and something that stood out to me.
The only improvement I would make on this property would be chairs to sit in outside. It‚Äôs a beautiful well kept yard and we would‚Äôve loved to have our bottle of wine under the stars.
Great home! Thank you again, Weston. I‚Äôm sure we will be back!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place in a nice neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"5 women out for Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. The house will sleep 8 easily. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. The house is fairly new, all rooms on one level. The beds were ok the pillows were awful. Bring your own pillow if you can. The house is really clean and big but the furniture is sparse, a hair dryer & a shower chair or bench in bathroom would be nice & a chair & night stand in bedrooms, definitely needs more sitting in front room (maybe a sofa bed and some overstuffed chairs). The kitchen has everything you need. Nice coffee setup, (should add tea bags)The yard is really nice there‚Äôs a bbq in the garage, a patio set would be good. You can park in the garage ‚ù§Ô∏è(loved that) The cleaning fee is too high at a $100 for 2-3 nights. You‚Äôre asked to strip beds, start laundry, squigy showers, keep things as clean as possible. We‚Äôre clean people to begin with , I don‚Äôt think I should be asked to do house work when I have to pay a cleaning fee. Would stay here again for a longer stay"

2024-06-01,3.0,Group trip,"All and all the stay wasn‚Äôt horrible we felt comfortable sleeping in the beds but there were some dirty dishes put away in the clean cupboard, hairs in the bathroom and the sink in the kitchen looked like it had been through war with a dirty old sponge accompanying it through battle. Though I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about what was happening in the kitchen the host (Karly) was super kind and attentive and when I told her about the dirty cups she offered to come drop off new disposable cups for us to use which was super helpful. With a little bit more TLC this place could be a great spot to stay but it just needs a bit more attention to really make it special!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a very cozy home for my kids and myself. It was such a beautiful home, karly had a good communication it was not hard to get ahold of."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Karly made everything easy for us! She communicated very well with everything we needed prior to check in. Once inside, we saw the house matched the pictures online. The house is cozy, beautiful, and in a great neighborhood!
As well, on the website, she lists the amenities available to guests. There are no surprises. Karly provides information for her guests, such as the best restaurants, activites, coffee, etc. nearby. We were there for the weekend for a family wedding and the house was 2 miles from the venue. We are hoping to come to Idaho Falls at least once a year to visit family who are in Ririe and we've already decided this is where we want to stay again in the future!
Thank you for everything, Karly!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Although it was a little older than I think the pictures lead you to believe, it‚Äôs a cute home. The floors are VERY squeaky and the doors make a lot of noise when opening and closing. The projector kept turning off randomly while we were trying to use it which was a huge reason we picked this place so that was a big bummer. The host was very responsive when we reached out about it. Overall, it definitely worked for what we needed and it was a decent place to stay. Karly was very kind, I would look for another place she hosted if visiting again."

We enjoyed the theater popcorn maker. It was so handy to have it downstairs in the theater room. The fire place downstairs made it so cozy. Everything was organized and easy to find. The bathrooms and kitchen were very clean and tidy. The bedrooms have large closets and lots of storage and plenty of floor space. The beds were very comfy. The furniture in both the downstairs living room and upstairs living room was clean and comfortable. The garage had an automatic opener which was very handy. The home is in the middle of everything.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second year we‚Äôve stayed here for a weekend trip. We have an annual girls trip and each of us like having our own room. This works for us! The beds are comfortable and one of us stays in the room with twin beds, which we don‚Äôt mind. The downstairs has a fireplace and comfy couches with a large screen to watch movies and a popcorn machine. We‚Äôve never taken advantage of that, but it‚Äôs a nice feature. The only complaint we had was the lack of water pressure in the hot water tap in the kitchen sink. Also, the ice bucket in the freezer needed to be cleaned. All in all, it‚Äôs a great place to stay and Karly responds quickly. We had a great stay!"

Also, 2 bedrooms upstairs and 2 downstairs so that you could spread out if you need privacy. The entire house was clean and it was nice to have a laundry room if you need it!!! The beds were VERY comfortable which matters when you travel. What really set this place apart was Karly- our arrival date was our daughter‚Äôs 18th bday and I had asked Karly to get some balloons, bday banner & I would pay her back so we could make our arrival fun! She not only decorated but did it with no charge which was incredibly kind and generous. Our daughter was so excited! Karly was also very helpful when we needed some local help with a Ford dealership - nothing like vehicle issues in a place you aren‚Äôt familiar. We would rent again when we return to the area for sure!!!"

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean and cute. Ashley was prompt, helpful, and responsive. However, it's not located in a very nice neighborhood. Also, be aware that the advertised nightly fee will be almost tripled by the time you pay the taxes, service, and cleaning fees. You will also be asked to do extra chores, including starting a load of laundry and the dishwasher. I'm usually more than happy to do those things if I'm not already paying a $98 cleaning fee."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect for us while watching a 3 day tournament at Skyline HS. We had 6 people, aged 13-79 the first night and used the pull out couch, but then the older two kiddos went back to work and then we all had our own rooms. Kitchen had all we needed and there were plenty of linens. Used the washer and dryer everyday to clean uniforms and loved having dryer sheets (I forgot ours). Will definitely stay again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We contacted Ashley on short notice, passing through and didn‚Äôt want a gross, overpriced hotel room, so I started searching for Airbnbs. She replied back to our request in less than hour. This townhouse is easy to find, in a quiet neighborhood and quite spacious for a townhouse. It‚Äôs clean, comfortable and homey enough to feel relaxed. We stayed there basically to sleep & all slept well. Ashley has coffee & hot cocoa, all the usual amenities. This would be a comfortable place to stay for several days."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was very sudden due to a death in the family, so I was relieved to find a vacancy on such short notice. The response was very prompt and courteous. The check-in was a piece of cake. The Townhouse is lovely - beautifully decorated and furnished, with all the amenities you could wish for (except a toaster :)). The unit was very clean overall, even with our short notice booking! The unit is in a fairly central part of town, but not really within walking distance of places to visit or eat, but a very short drive away from the green belt next to the river. It was quiet, friendly, and the perfect stay for our not so happy trip. Thanks Ashley!!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Nice place at a good rate. Great location. Host was very accommodating and attended to problem of getting locked out before checkout. Quiet neighborhood. It would have been a tight fit for more than 5 people with the living room being small and only 1 1/2 baths. Kitchen table would only sit four people comfortably. We did have a good stay and made it work.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ashley‚Äôs Airbnb was superb! Beautifully decorated and just nice all the way around. She also thought of everything which makes a stay so enjoyable.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay if you are visiting Idaho Falls. We were there for a soccer tournament and it was very close to the park (1.5 miles). It isn‚Äôt in walking distance of much, other than a mini mart and a fast food Mexican place, but the location felt safe. The condo was well equipped and worked very good for our group. The living room is a bit on the cozy side, but the kitchen area is spacious. We will definitely book again if we are in IF."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was exactly what my family needed for our trip to Idaho Falls. I loved that there was plenty of parking & Walmart was right down the street to buy groceries.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place is very clean and just as described! We had a lovely time and the location is great to downtown. My only comment would be that it is very bright at night from all the street lights so some curtains would be nice, but that might not be an issue to other people. The Kuerig coffee machine was great!!"

2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures are exactly what you get! We loved the kids play corner under the stairs, it was really fun for our kids to have that space. The only problem is there was blood on the pillow cases, and we found dog hair all over our clothes when we left. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay! Ashley was quick to respond, and helpful."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great townhome for long term stays. Very clean, everything is new and super comfortable. Everything functions above expectations: dishwasher, w/d, heater, hot water, wifi speeds. The location is convenient to everything, close to downtown and the falls. Parking is first come, first serve but spots are available and also plenty of side street parking. Street lights made walking my dog at night feel very safe. The neighboring townhomes are very close to each other so get used to keeping the shades down and curtains drawn for privacy."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend at Ashley's! The beds were very comfortable and we had everything we needed!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Ashley was a great, communicative, and accommodating host; probably the best I‚Äôve ever dealt with through AirBNB. If and when we come back to the area, we will be sure to stay here again!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was beyond amazing it was extremely clean and the decorations were very thought out. The little playroom for the grandson was just perfect. I loved having a washer and dryer so that we can do our laundry while we were on vacation. I would recommend this place again and again
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very meticulous and conscientious Host. It's one thing when you get all the basics and the place is as-advertised and stay smooth and comfortable, but it makes everything that much nicer when you see little, unexpected things that tell you the Host is going above and beyond: full ice bin, coffee cartridges well stocked, ample variety of snacks, appliances (like a blender) that not all Hosts provide...and checking in during the stay to ensure all is going well.
Bonus bennie: the location is perfect if you want close proximity to the Falls & River Walk. About a 2-3 mile round trip stroll, up and around, and back to the Snake River--kudos to Idaho Falls for nailing that whole area. Very cool.
Hidden gem restaurant rec: Teton House, about 25 minutes away in the tiny little town of Menan. Outstanding burgers in a great rustic but well kept setting. And, this is a bit random trust me...best homemade Bleu Cheese dressing EVAH!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and pictures are accurate. It's the end unit of a triplex but we never heard the adjoining unit. If I had one suggestion it would be putting in some room darkening curtains in the bedroom. Definitely would stay again.

Anything you need it‚Äôs there Ashley thought of everything! The beds are super comfortable and omg, the water pressure is amazing! After a busy day outside it was a great surprise!

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to spend a few days in Idaho Falls. It‚Äôs conveniently located and beautifully decorated. It‚Äôs clear a lot of thought went into the amenities including coloring pages for kids (and adults).

,,,"Beware that this Airbnb is misleading about location. Yes it's a corner lot, but next to a busy, loud main road (which they conveniently left out of the pictures). And yes, it's a ""walkable"" neighborhood, but again very loud and crowded. I'm really not sure why they listed the backyard as a ""perk"" of this Airbnb, because I would never sit outside to listen to the noises of traffic. Maybe other people find that relaxing, but I don't. As such, I found it way overpriced. To each their own, but I'm being honest that for people who enjoy quiet, this is absolutely not the spot.
Otherwise, it was clean and comfortable. Very small, especially the shower. But no other problems!"
