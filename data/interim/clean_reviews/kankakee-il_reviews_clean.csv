2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great rental in a nice, peaceful neighborhood. It was so well decorated and stocked with all we needed. It was so nice to be steps away from a walking path alongside the river."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 had a wonderful stay there while we were in town to meet our new grandbaby. The first floor of the house perfectly met our needs. It's also very close to a bike trail along the river, which was enjoyed by several of our family members. We ate several meals there. The kitchen had everything we needed. It was a wonderful price for the space!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely Home, clean and nicely finished. Hollie was great communicating before and during our stay letting us know what to expect and checking in with us. Great place to stay!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and clean place to stay. Lovely kitchen, felt nice and cozy. Hot water never seemed to run out, basic seasonings as well as filtered water pitcher were extremely appreciated. Hollie was a pleasure to work with, very responsive and proactive to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The home also felt very secure which allowed for good sleep.
The only cons that we had is the flooring was incredibly squeaky everywhere, including the apartment above us, and the water pressure in the showers felt a bit weak but that could entirely just be personal preference.
TLDR: Would 100% stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was an absolute pleasure staying at Hollie's place. It was very clean and well stocked with all your needs. Hollie is a very responsive host, and very accommodating. I will absolutely stay again whenever I'm in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Place to stay highly recommended
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hollie's place was comfortable with great beds and dark curtains as well as blinds, which in our opinion, should be mandatory at all Air bnb's! The place had all that we needed--the kitchen was a good size for the space, and had all that we needed to cook a large meal. The only downside (which was not Hollie's fault), was that the upstairs neighbors were not super considerate--loud music/voices/stomping around late at night. But the fans in the bedrooms did help mask some of the noise. Overall, a comfortable place to stay with much more room than a hotel! (And it only took us 5 minutes to get to ONU, which is what we were interested in). Good value and location. Thanks Hollie!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,‚ù§Ô∏è
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home. Very responsive host. Had a wonderful visit.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hollie‚Äôs place goes above and beyond for guests! The house was gorgeous, clean, and great decor! She makes sure her guests feel right at home. There are chargers at every table and nightstand to accommodate every phone type! The coffee nook in the kitchen has every option. This place is all around perfect! I would highly recommend and will definitely stay again!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved it differently felt like home away from home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lynn‚Äôs place was perfect for our family. We came into town for a quick weekend and the house was just what we needed. Plenty of room for our 6 and the amenities were just as listed. The house was sanitized and clean and Lynn was super responsive with any requests that we had.
We look forward to booking again when we come again‚Ä¶"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family (5) stayed at Lynn‚Äôs place while in town for a funeral. The temperatures were freezing. When we arrived last at night the outside lights were on and we were able to pull into the garage and unload the car. When we went inside the house was welcoming warm and cozy. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed, it was enough space for everyone and the beds were very comfy. I had to contact Lynn twice and she responded quickly and extremely professional on each matter.
Everyone said they had a great time at Lynn‚Äôs and she provided us with a safe, cozy and clean place for our family that lives so far apart to come together again and enjoy each other. I recommend Lynn‚Äôs place to anyone in town looking for a great place to stay!"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I would have loved to have given Lynn's place a higher rating, but a couple of things prevented me from doing so. The house was beautifully decorated, in a great location, and we loved being able to park in the garage. It was raining while we were there, but even so, there was a dehumidifier in the kitchen that was very loud, that ran constantly, and needed to be emptied twice a day. All of our things smelled very musty when we got home. Also, the second full bathroom faced out to the kitchen, with only a sliding barn door, and no way to latch it shut. It was practically unusable, with a 2 year old running around. One of the main reasons we chose this place was because it had two full bathrooms."
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"This is our second time staying at Lynn's home. She is a kind and reasonable hostess. We love many things about this home, but two of our favorite things are that it is bright (lots of light) and clean! Thank you, Lynn!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,What an AMAZING experience to stay at Lynn‚Äôs place!! We were so thankful for the excellent responsiveness and super thoroughly furnished place. She was flexible with our needs and that was a blessing to our whole family. It‚Äôs very close to ONU which is where we were for our daughter‚Äôs pinning ceremony for nursing school!! It‚Äôs a definite 5 STAR rating!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lynn's home was great for my family of 4. The home was cozy, clean, and in a great location. There was an air fryer available in the kitchen for use (was not noted in the pictures, or in amenities). Would love to stay there again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect home away from home! In a great neighborhood, close to everything you could need. A beautiful home, extremely clean and well maintained, with up to date amenities, and services right on point. Walking distance to a nice park for great fall pictures. Ms. Lynn is great to work and communicate with. Easy instructions for checking in and out. Very helpful and accommodating. My family and I had a great Thanksgiving weekend. We highly recommend booking your stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lynn was great to work with! She allowed us to check in early and was always available with any questions. We really enjoyed the comfort and safety of her home. We would absolutely stay with Lynn again when we are in town to visit :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice home! Everything is as pictured or even better. The host is very kind and professional. Neighborhood is quiet and my family felt safe and comfortable in the home.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lynn is a great host that responded quickly to all of our questions. The house is in a great neighborhood and was clean and inviting, we instantly felt at home. We will definitely be staying here again and would highly recommend to anyone."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was excellent we felt at home .. we will definitely return .. Lynn is very nice thank you very much!!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Lynn‚Äôs house. The house was clean, and in a nice neighborhood. The rooms were a bit smaller than we expected , but the space worked for our family.
The kitchen was well stocked with all the cooking supplies we needed. üôÇ
Lynn responded timely to any questions we asked her. Generously, Lynn gave us extra time for checkout as we had a later flight home.
We were disappointed to find several spiders near the front door of the home, during our stay. We ended up avoiding using the front door as our 5 year old granddaughter, who does not like spiders, was on vacation with us. (Maybe it is a Fall problem-it was late September?)
Overall, we were satisfied with our stay in Bradley at Lynn‚Äôs Airbnb. Thank you, Lynn!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place! Plenty of living room seating and a large TV. Not suitable for people with physical disabilities because of tight space in the dining room and unsafe step in shower in the laundry room. Otherwise place is fine.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Home was clean and free of clutter. The host was proactive and very responsive during our stay. We had an incident with a door that was locked from the inside, and someone was sent over to resolve speedily. Instructions were laid out on the kitchen counter. Main bath tub caulk may need refreshing soon, but overall, it's a great find and my family had a great stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I enjoyed our stay! The house was very inviting. It had everything we needed and was very accessible. Lynn was easy to communicate with and would respond quickly. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely home, we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Me and my family loved everything about Lynn‚Äôs place. Anything we needed she was there at a drop of a dime. Also the beds are comfortable we did not want to get out of bed lol I completely recommend this lovely home for a family. We also bbq on the back with a nice backyard.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay! Everything as described and clean. We appreciated Lynn‚Äôs customer service, especially when one of the group forgot a phone at the residence. She was so lovely to us! We will be back if we have another family event in the area"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We were at Lynn‚Äôs place for my grandson‚Äôs wedding. From the moment we walked in we felt right at home. The house was perfect for our party of 6 and at one point 2 more family members visited and we never felt crowded! If we are ever in Kankakee we will definitely come back to Lynn‚Äôs!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a very peaceful and relaxing stay at this place. We were there for two days without any issues. Lynn was very responsive and helped us when we forgot the phone inside the house and locked the door and had no other way to get in. I recommend sharing the passcode with other guests with you.

Also, My granddaughter found the games in the cabinet, so great! We will definitely stay here again! Thank you, Lynn for making us feel at home!
Greg, Cindy C. & Family"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family really enjoyed our stay! The property was comfortable and cozy. Lynn was an amazing host who made sure we had what we needed and accommodated us fully.

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to say. Super communicative
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay home away from home. Host , Lynn , was great and very committed to making sure we were comfortable and was very professional and hospitable. We would highly recommend this stay to family and friends. This was our first time ever using a Airbnb. Because of this great host and the accommodation we will make it first choice. Thanks again Lynn"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lynn did a wonderful job of preparing the house for us. Had everything we needed, plus some. House was spotless, warm and beautiful when we arrived. Lynn was very responsive to us as well. House is central to so much."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet, cozy house that really feels like home! Ridiculously comfy beds, and everything you could think of that you might possibly need during your stay was provided. Lynn was lovely to work with, and I‚Äôd absolutely recommend this stay to anyone visiting the area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Lynn was a wonderful host! The home was everything it was advertised to be. We had a wonderful stay in a quiet neighborhood. Perfect location for all our activities. I highly recommend staying here for you and your family!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super clean, nicely furnished. Close to many things. The grill will cook a mean steak. It was perfect for our crew. For sure would stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lynn‚Äôs place is perfect! It is exactly like it looks in the pictures. Everything is new and very clean. The house is in a quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cozy home! We really enjoyed our stay. In a quite neighborhood near a nice playground. Lynn made sure our stay was great!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Lynn's listing for multiple months. It is a lovely,
well-updated house in a quiet neighborhood not too far by car from the many attractions of Chicagoland. Lynn herself is friendly, attentive, reasonable, and respectful of your privacy (which is proven by the fact that I unfortunately missed meeting her in person, as though she made herself available it just never quite worked out).
The space is clean and well-stocked, and Lynn is a genuine local (her face is even up around town) who is always in the area if you need her. (She even brought us a whole grill, though we never got around to using it, so it's completely new for future occupants.)
Overall I highly recommend this listing if you're looking for a true full house (and it is, every part of it entirely to yourself, no shenanigans) in a good neighborhood. Lynn will make sure you are taken care of."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The stay was amazing. Quiet family type neighborhood. Loved the amount of fans around the house and wonderful lighting. If you're looking for a place to stay where you can get work done but also have a good time. Highly recommend this place. Lynn the host is absolutely amazing. Very involved in the stay and makes sure you have everything you need.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very thoughtful. The chocolate on the night stand was great. Overall, highly satisfied. I‚Äôd definitely visit again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my third/fourth time staying with Hollie and it's amazing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and nice place

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as stated. Super comfortable bed (was perfectly firm and comfy). Very clean and soft sheets. Bathroom was clean and very well managed. Loved cooking in the kitchen and had all the supplies. Easy to check in and out and enter. Everything was clean. Well lit space. Just so cozy cute! Will stay again (here for business trip).
Check out Tiny Taps next door (gotta pay cash). Parking was simple."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Hollie was extremely helpful and friendly through the entire booking process. Also gave us clear instructions! The location had everything we needed! Please be advise there is no oven because it is a studio but there are other listings available that Hollie offers that does. We spent more time in Chicago which most attractions we visited are 1 hr away besides that we loved the location and it is worth the value. Loved the shower also! It is beautiful. Neighborhood was quiet at night there is train that comes through but in general it was very peaceful and quiet. Hope this helps!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this stay!
it was so cozy and I felt right at home.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our time here. Exceeded our expectations, as it was even more comfy and beautiful than portrayed. 10/10 would recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was exactly as pictured and we appreciated all the small touches which made it feel comfortable (enough towels, coffee/tea, utensils, extra pillows, makeup washcloths, fan, hangers, etc.). The walls are paper-thin. Luckily we had packed earplugs as we used them every night. Communication with the host was excellent, and we'd stay again if we ever find ourselves back in Kankakee. Be sure to check out Stefari cafe in the same block, lovely coffee and food."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway. Amazing time while i was there, wouldn't mind booking againüòÅ"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here to help my partner move ‚Äî perfect for a place to crash after a long day! Shower is excellent, hot beverages are lovely. Do be aware the walls are thin. Would stay again. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks Hollie!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay after a long commute from out of state. The place is clean spacious and I felt right at home. Great shower and water pressure. I enjoyed my stay. Highly recommend also added to my wishlist when I‚Äôm in the area again.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Hollie‚Äôs place was beautiful and clean exactly like the pictures displayed it. Unfortunately, the walls seemed paper thin and I was able to hear the tenants/renters in Unit 4 during my whole stay. I could hear their tv channel enough to know they were watching sports center. I could clearly hear the argument btwn 2 ppl at 0130. I could hear them snoring, and could also hear them ‚Äúmake up‚Äù after having an argument, and then another argument later that morning. The studio is also across the street from the train station, which also runs throughout the night. I don‚Äôt believe Hollie has any control over the structure of the building and she was a fabulous host!!! Just know that the location is noisy but beautiful, and clean."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely, cozy stay. Perfect layout and handy areas to work, snack or curl up and enjoy a book. The apartment was also set with everything you need for morning coffee and lots of pillows. There was Construction nearby which was a bit noisy but I‚Äôm very confident that‚Äôs a temporary thing and not the norm. Overall a delight"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing deal, great host, and super clean! Definitely coming back next time I‚Äôm in the area!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Really enjoyed my stay here. The apartment looks exactly like it does in the photos online, so there were no surprises. Clean, well-decorated, well-furnished space. All amenities and supplies needed for my stay were provided. The kitchen is well-stocked, the coffee nook with the Keurig machine was so cute and definitely something I used daily, the extra linens and bedding provided were warm and comfortable, and the shower was incredible. Hollie was very prompt to respond to any questions I had and made sure any request was accommodated. Overall great place, every detail was well-thought out and arranged, and I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, thanks Hollie!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the offering of a coffee station.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hollie's place was as described and had all of the new appointments you would expect. It is modern with exposed brick walls and brand new appliances. We have stayed at over two dozen AirBnBs and this one is in the top 5 for attractiveness, convenience and access to the downtown area. We did not have a car rather we walked along downtown and visited the French Heritage Museum, the Riverview Historic District and the Frank Lloyd Wright House. We found a cozy little wine bar to have dinner and unwind.
Hollie sent us a special code to unlock the doors about 45 minutes before our appointed check-in time. Once we were able to finally enter the building and the apartment it was an amazing find. Very chic and a lovely place in a completely renovated old factory building. The exposed brickwork and high ceilings made our little piece of heaven just perfect. There could have been a bit more acoustical privacy in the walls of adjoining units."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and peaceful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were pleasantly surprised to see the listing matched perfectly with what we got and even more! Hollie‚Äôs place felt like our home away from home for the week.
The bed and shower were great. We appreciated the added extras, such as hot cocoa, tea, coffee, makeup cloths and even a fan! Hollie has really given thought to all the details that provide comfort when you‚Äôre away from home. We will 100% stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very nice studio to get away from everything for a little bit. Highly recommend
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hollies place was beautiful, clean, and felt like home. She was responsive and gave me a great deal for a extra night because my flight came sooner then expected. I really enjoyed my stay and will stay again in the future."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was perfect for our retreat. It was incredibly spacious such that everyone could have their own space. The outdoor areas were really enjoyable - the fire pit &wonderful grill.
A few pro tips -
1) while the house has wonderful natural lighting - the lack of curtains meant a very early wake up for all non basement bedrooms.
2) request extra towels - it was really hard to find any extra things - although the owner is very responsive. The place is just so big you have no hope of finding it.
3) highly recommend still bringing paper plates/etc. if you plan to cook a bunch."

Too early in the year to eat of any fruits of the tree in the backyard, but I got my sun in. Low fencing around it doesn't provide for much privacy. Grill outside was not used, but if I ever stay here again- I will definitely use it! One note to host-please put more garbage bags for use.

2021-08-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home however very strict rules and owners like to assume things that are untrue. When it says no smoking apparently that means no where at all on property including outside. We advised that we would need the home to get ready for our wedding and after bridesmaids leaving their things at the house as we all walked out to go to the actual wedding I sent both of our mothers and my husband to collect the remaining items the next day, I was charged extra for to many cars leaving the home, 2 kegs that were never in the home or out of the back of a truck and had just come from the Charleston room from our reception the night before, cigarette butts on the ground outside. Cleaning the home completely including all counters and the inside of the fridge and following the rules including putting all bedding in the washer will not suffice and you will indeed incur additional charges for the owners sitting in the parking lot across the street from the home making assumptions as you are putting your things in the car. Cheaper to pay for a hotel and less likely to be stalked or charged extra for picking up cigarette butts or having your bridal party get dressed with you. I am beyond irritated to pay for a party I did not have nor any alcohol in the home as most people would do the night before but I will not allow anyone to say I owe anything. I was raised better than that. I would highly recommend not staying here if you are a smoker or intend on doing anything other than sitting on the couch watching tv. Thank goodness we did not attempt to use the bike in the garage. I can only imagine what the charge for that would have been."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy home. Great communication from host. Would definitely stay again!

While it's very close to the highway (I-57), the only vehicle noise was from Otto Road (and that was negligible).
Cathy said we could explore the garden. It was early in the growing season, but we did grab a couple of leeks. If you're staying with Cathy come Aug/Sep, you're in for a real big treat.
Everything inside the unit was clean. The bed was very comfortable (we're very picky about that). Firm mattress, plenty of pillows.
The air conditioning is very capable.
I have already recommended this to my friends.
Some helpful info:
The water comes from a well, so you may want to bring a supply of bottled water for drinking, making coffee, etc.
The bed is upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs.
This is a wonderful place to stay, and Cathy is a model hostess. She was out of town during our stay, but she responded quickly. She had her husband and a friend stop by to check on us.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a well-designed, well equipped and very comfortable place to stay if you are fine with a compact house. The loft is spacious with a very comfortable king bed. The downstairs is more limited in terms of space, and the collapsable sofa made for a good night's sleep for our son. The kitchen has excellent facilities: oven, stovetop and microwave, and has all the glassware, china and flatware we needed. We only stayed one night. The little farm loft is conveniently located near the interstate and is just a 10 minute drive from the center of Kankakee, which is a lovely town to visit. A short drive from the loft is a beautiful small river, and one can enjoy rich countryside at your doorstep. Cathy was a very responsive and helpful host, and we couldn't have been happier with our stay."

It was so cozy and warm and instantly felt like home when you walked in. It was very clean, full of amenities, great location and super close to all of the stores and restaurants you‚Äôd want to explore.

The only thing that we had a problem with was the bathroom. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and the sink hit me about mid thigh. It can‚Äôt be more than 3 feet tall. And if you are any taller, you‚Äôll have to really stoop in the shower. The shower head is a bit low for me, but it had great water pressure. The king beds are also really soft. If you like soft beds, then these will be good for you. The queen bed was perfect for me. Lots of support. I would stay again if I‚Äôm through this area.

We have to visit the area several times throughout the year and with the single stay at Morgan‚Äòs place. We have decided that this will be our home away from home when we‚Äôre in the area.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a pleasant stay at a nice place with a lot of charm. The only thing is that the BBQ grill provided was quite rusty which came as a little bit of a surprise.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in Kankakee for work. If I had known how nice this place was I would have booked a few more nights just to relax before I headed home. This was by far the best stay I‚Äôve had in Kankakee. Also was delighted to discover how well the kitchen was equipped.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be back to enjoy the inground pool and ping pong table some other time. Loved the house! I wish I could live there!
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cool aesthetic of the home. Lovely kitchen, unique rooms, and decor with an older style. There were a few nails sticking out of doors and floor boards that we got our shirts and socks caught on. It was troublesome to get ahold of the host for check-in as he was unavailable and we had to wait almost 2 hours after our check-in time to get the code to get into the home. The ping-pong/air hockey room was really fun to hang out in and we appreciated that there was a heater in that room since it is a three season room. The couches in the the pictures were different than the actual couches. The couches were extremely uncomfortable to sit or sleep on since there was plywood under the cushions. The beds in the bedrooms were also not comfortable and felt cheap. We appreciated the paper towels and a few other essentials being in the home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Robert was a great host ! Always responded and even helped extend my stay . the home was clean and beautiful I felt right at home will def be back

The host, Robert, was kind and very considerate of our needs, and was always available to chat or message. We look forward to our next visit."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family really enjoyed our stay. The house was spotless and neatly decorated with vintage pieces and well stocked with necessities. The pool looked clean (we did not use it), and the yard was neatly kept up with spaces to relax or eat. Robert was responsive and even dropped off extra blankets for us cold Texans. The house is of course old, and does make old house noises, as to be expected. The beds were a bit firmer for our tastes and I'd prefer some more pillow options. Overall, it was a great find and we would stay again if we were in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such an adorable and cozy home! This property made for an excellent extended weekend stay for my family of 4 (myself, my husband, and our 9-year old and teen daughters), our two dogs, and my 20-something sister. The fully-fenced backyard was beautifully landscaped, and the pool was wonderful! The house was equipped with everything we needed to feel at home, and had several grocery stores within a few minutes drive, making it easy to stock up on snacks and such. The enclosed sunroom off the garage had a ping pong table, TV, and plenty of seating, which was perfect for when the kids (and the dogs) wanted to get out of the pool for a bit, but still wanted to hang around outside. We felt like we truly lucked out finding such a great place in an unexpected area, and Rob was super friendly and in touch. Bonus points for letting our dogs go swimming with us!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time just relaxing by the pool! Beds were comfortable and we really enjoyed themselves. If you plan on making steak or anything bring your own knives cause I only found one but no big deal.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The fenced in yard was great for our pets. The patio was a great place to relax. It was close to several walking parks. Robert was great to work with and was available if we needed anything.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was absolutely beautiful and private! We loved that it was tucked away. The pool was nice and cold for the hot days. Inside had amazing windows with natural light and easy check-in with the smart lock. One thing we learned about the front windows though is there is a button to lift them up! Ours at home just pull up/down with no button so be careful! Robert was a great host and frequently checked in. Had everything we needed!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Robert, our host, was very responsive. The place was clean, very well maintained and accurately described. The pool was really nice and situated nicely in a private, fenced in and well manicured backyard. You can tell the owners put a lot of care and love into their home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Had a good view from poolside for the Kankakee 4th of July fireworks show. Home in a neighborhood, but felt secluded and peaceful. Very spacious inside the house. Had board games we used for rainy day we had during our stay. Would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the style of the house and furnishing.
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Loved this stay! The beds are a bit stiff and not the comfiest, but the pool made the stay all worth it!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,All in all a good place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is lovely, we especially enjoyed the beautiful sunroom! Plenty of seating areas for the 4 of us to play games, relax on couches, and eat great meals."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had some issues with the pool not being clean. However, Robert tried to take care of it while we were still staying there & when it could not be taken care of, he gave us a fair discount.
Overall, the house was nicely kept up. The landscaping was pretty and the house was clean. We enjoyed the sunroom by the pool with the ping pong table and a nice tv so we could listen to music while playing."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Robert was very friendly and responsive. He even came to clean the pool himself because the cleaners weren't available. The house was cozy and beautifully decorated. I will definitely be using Robert any time I come back to IL for a family event.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Robert was an amazing host! He was very kind and very helpful. He was accommodating to us, and he answered our questions quickly. The house was beautiful and had an Italian feel. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautifully designed with antique furniture, and the neighborhood was very quiet.
The weather was very nice, and we were able to spend time under the stars with an adorable pair of ducks that visited the backyard at dusk. With multiple grocery stores close by, our ""stay-cation"" was lovely!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is such a peaceful place. One of the beds, the room with the tv, is firm and I found out I sleep better on a firm bed. This house is gorgeous and was so peaceful and we felt right at home when our house was being remodeled. I would definitely recommend or stay here again if I ever needed to."
2023-01-01,3.0,Group trip,"My daughter was on leave from deployment overseas and we were looking for a fun get away that was nearby. We booked this place because according to the listing it has a pool table, ping pong table, 50 inch TV, fireplace, Keurig and enclosed patio. It is a beautiful home with fun, eclectic furniture, a great TV, beautiful fireplace; but there was no pool table, no access to the enclosed patio where the ping pong table was located, initially no Keurig coffee maker. Robert was very responsive to our concerns. A Keurig coffee maker was delivered the next morning. He said the pool table was in storage but that he would work on getting us access to the enclosed patio and ping pong table, but he also graciously gave us the option of being refunded for the rest of our stay. We chose to end our stay early. It was not what we expected, but Robert did what he could to accommodate us. This is a beautiful home that has great potential, probably more fun in the summer."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We truly enjoyed our stay in Robert‚Äôs home. The area was quiet and the home offered plenty of privacy. The home was had the space we required and was nice. Robert was very responsive and continually checked in with us during our stay.

Their home was beautiful, just like the pictures. Right next to our venue and was able to walk which was so wonderful with the perfect weather. We loved all the games, the coffee bar, and all he water bottles that were cold in the fridge. You will be impressed and right at home staying here any time"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,all around good exp.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute place! Hollie was great to work with. I felt very comfortable. The neighborhood felt safe. Having to go through two locked doors was a little clumsy. The stairs were pretty steep.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Enjoyed the stay so much booked it 2 more times :) Holly is a fantastic host.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was cozy and very clean. Hollie was quick to respond with questions and so very friendly. We would definitely book again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable space. Nice walking/running/biking path along the river near-by.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"The Good - well-appointed and clean, good amount of space (not quite as much light as the pictures - could be the time of year). The Bad: There are 12-15 stairs up to this 2nd floor apartment that are NOT pictured. I had a very difficult time as the stairs are higher than they are deep (handrail is really wobbly too) and couldn't get my suitcase up ... just wish it had been clearly disclosed. I let the host know right away - who was lovely except for this - offered to get someone to bring up my suitcase (good, but doesn't help with groceries, etc) who then became insulting and rude when I asked for a partial fund for the 4 days that I had to move because of this. I let her and Airbnb know with 4 days to go - and asked for less than 3 days refund. It was a bad experience, and I will go back to hotels and property management companies for my work travel. I've never left a bad review - usually love my hosts and they have appreciated how well I take care of their properties."

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hollie was a great and responsive host with clear expectations and instructions. A couple days before I checked in I was told the dishwasher was broken and wouldn‚Äôt be replaced until after I was gone, no big deal but was bigger when the kitchen sink also didn‚Äôt work. She was great and responsive and I am sure both of the issues will be fixed before anybody else stays there. Minor hiccups but great place and host"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great and so was the host. I assumed the couch was a fold out couch, it was not. That was 100% on me because the listing never mentioned having a fold out, just a couch. (Recommended upgrade. üòä) Host was very understanding and worked with us for a slightly late arrival. Unfortunately our code would not work immediately to let us in. I was worried because it was late, but Hollie responded and took care of it right away for us. (Thank you, Hollie!) The home was cozy and clean. The property was clean and well cared for. The home worked out well for what we needed. Thank you Hollie for taking such great care of us during our stay.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My first time staying in an airbnb did not disappoint. I felt like I was staying in a friends place. The apartment was cute and furnished well. There was body wash and shampoo provided as well as coffee, tea, cream, plates, pots and pans, and even spices for cooking! The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe there with my family. There were parks nearby for my grandchildren to go and a lot of restaurants within a mile of the house. The toaster stopped working and I let Hollie know, she had a new toaster there within a few hours! I definitely recommend the property and will return if I'm in the area again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay!! Only stayed a weekend but definitely wish I could have enjoyed it longer. Great Host, communication was the best, place was very clean, felt safe! The description was spot on and exceeded my expectations!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Can't say enough about this beautiful little Gem of a place. The pictures do not do it justice!! There is so much attention to the small details that make a home, from flavored coffee, to washcloths for makeup, to tiny mint chocolates on the side tables. We stayed one night one our journey from the Foothills of Canada to North Carolina and were completely blown away. Clean, charming, beautifully decorated and exactly what we needed after 29 hours of driving fairly constantly. Location is also excellent with ample parking and walking distance to one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been too 'Pa-Chan-Ga.
I can not reccomend this place enough. and the little roll out bed was perfect for our 15 year old daughter.
Best experience. üëå"

Thank you hollie !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay! We stayed one night just stopping over on a road trip and it was the best sleep I have gotten so far. The place is clean, quiet, and the bed was really comfy. It was also the biggest bed we‚Äôve ever slept in!
The washer and dryer were extremely helpful and there were pods out for us so we didn‚Äôt have to get detergent. The coffee was also perfect - we have stayed in so many bnbs that didn‚Äôt have cream and sugar, but Hollies did and had plenty of it! Would recommend!"

Couldn‚Äôt find a nice Airbnb on such short notice close to where I‚Äôm working so gave Hollie‚Äôs place a shot even though it‚Äôs a commute to where I am working.

We got there later in the evening, went to Chicago Pizza Dough Restaurant for dinner, (it is not far down the road from Hollie's place). It is very good food and such a great value!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I (and our two small dogs) felt right at home at ""Smitty's Place"", and if we come back to the area, we will check on the availability of this rental. The beds and couches were very comfortable, the kitchen was extremely clean and well stocked with things such as paper towels, napkins, and salt/pepper, the backyard was ideal for the dogs, and the bathroom had soap/shampoo, hand soap, and the faucets delivered superb water pressure.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy with our stay at Ami's place in Bourbonais. The house was located a few blocks from Olivet Nazarene University in a nice residential neighborhood. This was perfect because we were there visiting our son, who is a student. Ami's place was the perfect gathering spot to visit him for the first time in months. We loved it.
Aside from the perks of the location, the house was extremely clean and comfortable as well. We thought the beds were very comfortable, and we were able to get a good nights sleep there. The kitchen was clean and had everything we needed. We were also provided with towels, coffee, snacks, cold water, and it even had shampoo and body wash. Ami's place had everything covered.
Overall, I highly recommend Ami's place. When we go back, we will be reserving Ami's place without question. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very happy with our choice to stay at Ami's place. We were far more comfortable than we would have been at a hotel."

Communication was quick, the house was super clean (I had brought my cleaning by supplies just in case, but didn‚Äôt really need them!) and just cozy. Quiet neighborhood but still close to stores /restaurants. The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù (which wasn‚Äôt too awful) was the bedrooms were a bit cold at night even with the heat on pretty high. We safe sleep with our infant so he doesn‚Äôt use any blankets so we were worried he‚Äôd be too cold. Ami was quick to respond to my text and suggested we close vents throughout the rest of house, which we did at night and it worked out great!
We would definitely stay again and didn‚Äôt want to leave!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We will definately be renting from Ami again! She was extremely kind and helpful, always getting back to me within MINUTES of me sending her a message. I took my 2 young boys (6 and almost 2) to go visit my husband, their dad, who is working down there. We have always stayed in hotels in the past, but I wanted something a little more like ""home"", so hopefully our youngest would sleep (he doesnt sleep ANYWHERE but his crib). The house was very inviting, clean, comfortable, and felt like we were right at home! Our 2 year old slept thru the night, no issues! We will definately go through Ami again when he is back working down there! Ami really goes above and beyond to make this hiuse feel like home, right down to the little stuffed animals in the extra bedrooms (which my 6 year old cried over when it was time to leave, he didnt want to leave it behind). Thank you, again, Ami for a great, relaxing, comfortable weekend filled with family memories!"

Minutes from ONU, down the street from Perry Farm (with its brand new park) and a children's museum, close to Kankakee State Park, there is a lot to do in this area. The home was very clean with everything I might need during my stay (shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, etc.). The rooms are well decorated with comfortable beds and plenty of extra bedding if needed. I really appreciated having a king size bed - something I don't usually see in other Airbnbs. The living room was comfortably furnished. The kitchen had everything I needed for cooking at home. The basket filled with snacks was a nice touch. The home was spotless when I arrived. In addition to a lovely home in a nice area, Ami and Steve's hospitality was unmatched.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place and communication with hosts. My mom kept remarking how ideal and lovely the place is. We found the place right away, with a parking spot right in front of the front door walk up. Spacious kitchen. Comfortable beds, pillows, linens. Keurig coffee set up with all the fixings. Shower worked great. Our only ""areas for improvement"" would be 1. there were about 25 or so tiny, confused ants roaming around in the bathroom, which was otherwise very clean and welcoming, 2. the sheets and comforter were clean but the comforter on the king bed had a scuff mark and the sheets on that bed had some faint yellow stains, and 3. perhaps the outside light could be kept on in case of late arrival, which we were! Thank you so much for the lovely accommodations on the way to our 2024 Total Eclipse viewing in Indianapolis!"

I saw reviews about how guests mentioned how comfy the beds were. They were UNDER rated. The linens and bed was awesome. Slept like babies. Being an apartment, you might expect some noise but not true. Not a peep. This was so convenient to where we were visiting and welcomed not having the hours drive home.

Just a heads up for any prospective guests with sensitivities to that."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lyles place was exactly like pictured and perfect for our stay! Easy to use the tv and the kitchen had everything we needed. The apartment was much more comfortable (the pillows were amazing!) than a hotel room would have been!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"At first when we pulled up we were skeptical because the area did not seem as great as it was. We saw duplex style apartments, we were worried about possible noise but not once did we hear anything from anyone else! They allowed us to check in early and we were blown away by how nice this place was, definitely so when we compared the price. I would 100% recommend this place for anyone who needs a quiet, quaint place to stay. We couldn‚Äôt have found a better reservation, and the host(s) could not have been more supportive and helpful to a mistake that was made by us. If we ever come back to the area this will be where we stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice one-night stay here after the Chicago part of our trip! It's very accessible: all ground level, with parking immediately in front.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was so clean and easy early for me and my family.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Nice host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older apartment, but is clean and comfy. The beds and pillows were outstanding!

Will be happy to stay there again on future visits to the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Space was perfect for a weekend stay and had just what we needed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you need to stay in the Bourbonnais area, this is a great choice. For about the price (maybe a little less) of local area, decent motels, you can stay here and have more privacy, comfort, and spread out. Beds are comfortable. Well appointed kitchen for cooking. Washer and dryer are a godsend for extended stays. We were able to walk right in and get started. Will definitely stay again when we‚Äôre back in the area. Many thanks, Lyle!"

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here one night while we were in town for a college visit to ONU. Great location if visiting the college or visiting someone who goes there. Host communicated clearly and quickly. Carpet in each bedroom was soft and seemed newer. Comfortable beds and pillows.
A honest note: This apartment could use a deep clean. Loads of dust behind the toilet on the baseboards, dust collected in fan on the bathroom ceiling and dirty kitchen floor. Lots of chipped paint on door frames and scuff marks on walls. One smoke detector wasn‚Äôt on the wall where it was supposed to be (I think it fell off and was never put back, because I saw it laying on top of the fridge)
Also, very ‚Äòdirty‚Äô, stale food smell when we arrived at the apartment. I am guessing it was from someone else in the complex cooking, but you never want that to be your first impression when you arrive.
We have stayed in many AirB&Bs; and I have come to expect a sparkling clean experience. Disappointed this wasn‚Äôt like that."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,great stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and comfortable! Neighborhood was a little tricky to navigate in the dark but check in directions were clear and helpful.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was so welcoming I will gladly stay again when I come back and recommend it to anyone. Some of the things I especially like is the cold water waiting in the refrigerator, complimentary coffee, clean house, open and spacious and the sheets, pillows, towels quality were the best. To top it off Lyle responded to my issue about the internet, which we resolved. Was even willing to come over and ensure we were able to enjoy cable. Thank you Lyle for everything. My stay was Short, but sweet.üëçthanks again üòä"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed here for a two day Valentines get away and we had a great time! Perfect size for a couple or small family, awesome hospitality and the house is loaded with cool amenities like pillows with customizable softness. 10/10 would recommend."

Lyle and Taylor are indeed SUPER HOSTS and I highly recommend them to you."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place clean and tidy in the main and ideal for our short stopover

Lyle and Taylor are wonderful and super accommodating! Place was set up with everything we needed to feel relaxed and at home. Magnificent beds and pillows for great sleeping too. Well stocked kitchen. I would go back for sure!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bourbonnais is not a huge town and this rental is situated well in the middle of it to get to all the places. We were there for move-in at Olivet for 4 nights and the property was perfect for our needs. Super nice is that Kroger is just a few blocks away - walkable if you just want to pick up a few things. Plenty of dishes for a few meals, nicely appointed rooms with multiple pillows available. The property is older which means only one bathroom to share, but Lyle has done a great job of updating the inside. Perhaps the best amenity of this property is the lightening fast communication of Taylor - if you need anything, a quick message is sure to get a response. Over the next four years of college for our son, we wouldn't hesitate renting again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, we didn't want to leave."

,,,"Our recent Airbnb experience was nothing short of a nightmare. After a grueling 10-hour drive, we arrived at the apartment only to find that there were already people living there. This was a clear indication that the host had not changed the lock after the previous guest, raising serious concerns about security and privacy. We also doubt whether the apartment had even been properly cleaned between guests.
To make matters worse, we were left stranded outside the apartment for over an hour, desperately waiting for a resolution. With no alternative, we were forced to find another stay in the middle of the night, adding unnecessary stress to an already exhausting journey.
We strongly advise against choosing this Airbnb. It was a highly disappointing and frustrating experience that left us feeling inconvenienced and deeply let down."
,,,"Nice, quiet little stay for the most part! Check in was a little bit of trouble but didn‚Äôt take long to get figured out. Not far from the city of Chicago which was great! Only problem we really had was after we checked out. We got a request to pay $500 for a smoking charge, NO smoking was done inside the house. Only smoking done was outside on the back patio. If you are a cannabis smoker and plan on staying here I suggest leaving your personal smoking belongings in your vehicle as the aroma can be quite strong."
,,,Frightening host. Negative experience.
