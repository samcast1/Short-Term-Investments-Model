2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful hosts. The house is situated in a nice neighborhood. Lovely balcony off the kitchen to chill on. Hugh dining room table to accommodate my laptops or a kid or two. Upstairs library is awesome. I wasn’t there long enough to throughly enjoy. They were kind to let me park my car in the back off the street. Which meant a lot to me. Very accommodating.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jeff was really friendly and the apartment was great! I enjoyed walking around Gloversville and seeing all the beautiful Victorian architecture !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff’s place was a nice spot to rest on our way to Buffalo. As described and shown in the photos. The attic is very cool and such a cute unique touch. So much to look at. Jeff was flexible with our arrival time and left the light on for us to find at night. This felt like staying at a friend’s home. Nothing too fancy! (I really appreciate the apple juice, as someone who has low blood sugar in the morning… 😊)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff's place is well situated as jumping off spot for adk adventures- fire towers, lake, trails, and mountain biking networks are all close by. Stores and shops are walkable. While the place is on the older side, it is HUGE and clean. Would definitely come back with some friends to make use of the space in the warmer months."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff was an excellent host, he was very polite and respectful very reasonable and reliable having many conversations throughout the mornings, and afternoon I got a chance to meet some new people who were very welcoming and my children best of all were more than satisfied with the space and peaceful setting Jeff’s place made them feel he provided information about the city and where we might find a Walmart his wife even offered a camp fire for my children to join in and roast marshmallows I would definitely recommend this place to anyone I would definitely stay again"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Felt right at home. Bed in the front room is super comfortable. Owner had a small starter meal selection and cookware available I was able to make several dishes while I was there. Owners are super nice and accommodating. The location is great and close to local businesses/ restaurants. Definitely will visit again
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jeff was a great host would recommend anybody to stay with him very accommodating will be back soon
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff’s place was very spacious and had everything we needed for our week long stay. It has four bedrooms with a very large master bedroom. Plenty of room for our family of four plus our big dogs. The kitchen has everything you need to stay in and make dinner. They even had snacks, drinks, different little dry and canned foods, pancake mix and syrup. They brought up extra supplies if we needed them as well. We have two large dogs and two silly kids and I was afraid we were constantly being loud since it was on the second floor, but they never complained and were always friendly. Jeff even offered for us to get together one evening, but we were so busy we didn’t have time. I’ve never had such a friendly host. We would definitely stay there again, and would recommend for a quick trip or a longer stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff and Theresa were very responsive and made it easy to stay with them! The house itself is old and a little worn and dirty in some spots, but it has plenty of space, a well-equipped kitchen, and a convenient location for us. We will stay with them again next time we are in town!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had my employees staying there for a project Jeff was a great host to them. I would recommend staying with Jeff we will be back.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,was great
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Large spacious apartment perfect location from the Fonda speedway. It was great to bring our family pet. We will definitely book again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was relaxing to just be able to kick back and stretch our legs. As truck drivers, we rarely get the chance so it was definitely appropriated. They were very attentive hosts and had everything we could need with no complaints. Would absolutely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best AirBnB stays I've had! Self check-in/check-out was a breeze. My friends and I were a little worried we would block the other cars in the driveway, but thankfully it was wide enough to fit our car and still allow other cars to back out. The place was spacious and homey, and with a bedroom for each of us, we definitely felt like we were getting more than our money's worth. Teresa and Jeff were gracious with the amenities, including paper plates and plastic silverware (which made clean up easier since we had fewer dishes to wash), hand and bath towels, coffee, and snacks. The master bedroom even has a cute baby playpen in case you bring a little one. We love the bookstore in the attic, too. Wish our trip was longer so we could have enjoyed the space more!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay if your visiting Gloversville, NY area"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jeff and Theresa were super helpful in a pinch when our other reservation fell through. It was a quaint apartment conveniently close to the downtown area. The apartment had everything we needed.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff is a Great host. Property is as described,and Jeff is always there if you need anything. We missed not seeing Teresa this time! Look forward to the next stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay..handy stop off on way to Saratoga. great value. very comfortable..spacious place..lots of nice small touches
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family stayed here with our dog and it worked out great! The space was the perfect size for all of us and we were grateful to be right on the street/sidewalk access to walk our dog around. We also appreciated having the bookstore upstairs from us - a unique perk for our stay! We definitely recommend Jeff and Theresa's place and would gladly come back for another visit :)
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spacious apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Access was easy. Breakfast snacks and fresh fruit were great. It wasn‘t an issue for us but be aware that it is in the second floor with moderately steep steps.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,large living room. coffee pods and some snacks are provided which is nice
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is huge, well equipped. We only stayed for one night but it was great. There were many treats for guests, fruits and snacks."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"A large, comfortable space with great hosts. It met our needs wonderfully."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"very nice place with lots of space and personal touches. the hosts were very responsive and the library was pretty neat. I do recommend this place, but it is listed with no a/c and you should keep that in mind when booking in the summer months."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It is very nice and comfortable place. However, there was no AC and it was very hot and unpleasant to be in the apartment"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Airbnb was lovely. It was very spacious and nicely located. It was well stocked. My family of 4 enjoyed our two night stay. Jeff was even so kind as to let us borrow 2 chairs to bring with us to an outdoor concert. We would definitely return. They have an attic filled with books that we made a purchase from. They have an adorable dog named Buster that was not a bother at all. The only improvement we could make would be adding A/C but there were plenty of fans to help cool things down. Overall a fabulous stay.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This place is ok, but it’s a work in progress. Very nice hosts. air conditioning would be my first upgrade to the property, and it could be cleaner."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff and Theresa's place is a very large, light, clean second floor apartment in a great walking neighborhood, near to ""down town"" where we stumbled upon FoodTruck Friday at the Main Street park - good live music and great food options; Gloversville has a few interesting shops, a food co-op and galleries."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very large unit, in a lovely village. The deck of the kitchen is a nice spot for a cup of tea or a morning coffee. We were 4 women traveling from a concert in Saratoga Springs and this was the perfect rest up before we continued our road trip back home. Highly recommend this very large space!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Tons of space! The free breakfast (oatmeal, juice boxes, pastries) was great! This unique older home has everything we needed and the host answered my many questions promptly. Thanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here and it’s just as good as the first time. Place is very clean and huge. Very quick response time by host and smooth easy check in. Would highly recommend
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jeff and Theresa thank you guys for hosting me and my family. I would come back again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very spacious and beautiful place. Location is perfect giving its close to town. Very clean and very attentive communication with Jeff as host! I highly recommend this place!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easily accessible. The apartment was very clean, well stocked with everything we could possibly need, snacks too! The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of fans to deal with the unseasonable warm temperatures we were experiencing in the Northeast. Jeff was a very accommodating host and I would definitely stay at his place again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful old home. Loved everything about it and the dogs enjoyed the little porch to sit and watch people go by. Super easy to check in and out. We will 100% be back to stay again. Also go and check out the bookstore upstairs you won’t be disappointed- I know I wasn’t!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. The place is huge! Very clean, very comfy bed with cosy duvet, full kitchen-- really everything you need. I thought the listing said 2 bedrooms, but there were THREE and even a baby crib if you need that.
Very quiet night and day, safe neighbourhood, about 4 blocks from a park for walking your dog (but also of course many lovely trails in the area). Easy parking right in front. Also-- wonderfully-- included is private access to a little honour-system used bookshop in the attic above! Would stay again for sure."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay has an awesome bookstore dealt with my crazy noisy family will definitely be back
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is an extraordinary home. Spacious home with a great secret attic space for a whole family to enjoy. We will be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent service. Very comfortable, clean, clean, accessible. The treatment of Jeff and his wife, excellent, very attentive. We are grateful. We are planning to return soon."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice host

2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for the price, very charming & spacious"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"A simple, spacious, budget option on your way to Adirondacks adventures. No frills but cozy. All the frying pans are old scratched teflon ones. Advised the host to throw them out. In general, would stay again."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,everything was as expected. Truly recommend.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"A spacious, comfortable place to spend the night. We love old victorian houses, and many thoughtful touches helped us feel at home. The little bookstore and reading space in the loft was very intriguing. I'm sorry I didn't have time to explore further."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a very nice one-week visit. It is a convenient location with lots of room to make a nice home away from home. Jeff was very accommodating and provided everything we needed.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Good location for Lapland Lake, easy communication. Will come again."
2022-01-01,4,Group trip,Great place to stay we just stopped for the night but it was exactly what we wanted!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, welcoming and very family friendly. Lots of sweet touches and amenities that made the stay extra special. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 spent Christmas there to visit family and it was perfect for us. Very spacious, decorated for Christmas, and great responsiveness and communication with the owners downstairs. The only draw back for us was the steep flight of stairs to get to the unit but only because we have small children to navigate it and require a lot of “stuff” for a 5 day stay. Overall it was awesome!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jeff and Theresa are amazing hosts. They have thought of every little detail to make your stay a stress free and wonderful experience. We stayed during the holiday season and they had the apartment decorated for Christmas. Was so nice talking to Jeff. Definitely visit his bookstore in the attic of the house!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely home in a quiet town. Great to rest for the night. Hosts thought of everything you could need.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot if the Gloversville area is where you need or want to be!!! It was an absolutely huge apartment and a great deal for the price! If you are not a fan of older homes, this may not be the place for you. However, I loved it! It reminded me of my family’s home(s) back in Maine.
With an old home comes old fixtures, doors and floors. Things may not be even and the bathroom door may not have locks but it’s a really cool older home! If you are looking for a rustic stay, this is a great choice. It had snowed the day we travelled to NY and I got a really neat picture of the neighborhood at night with snow. I wish I could share it with you all.
There is a fantastic dining room table and chairs that could easily seat 6-8 people. That was fantastic for us as my beau has a whole pack of children! 😀. We were able to bring Thanksgiving leftovers with us and have a nice dinner with the littles. Oh! And the fruit basket was such a nice touch! Thank you Jeff and Theresa!
Be sure to bring your own bath towels, wash cloths etc as I didn’t find any. Having had multiple Air B and B stays, I knew that could be a possibility so I had brought my own.
All of the beds have sheets, blankets and pillows but, if you are picky about your bedding, you may want to bring your own. The bedding here is/was just fine … just may not be what you are used to at your own home. I have been to Air B and Bs where it was required to bring your own bedding which is why I choose to review the bedding.
The kitchen had a small assortment of cooking utensils, as well as pots and pans. They had dishes and eating utensils, as well. The full sized stove with oven was a nice feature, as was the microwave and Keurig. These will be great when we return as eating out with a bunch of children can get expensive. The snacks, juice boxes and oatmeal were a neat touch, as well.
The host greeted us at the door and even assisted me in carrying my dog crate upstairs. Fantastic! We chatted a bit about our military service … yup … Veteran owned Air B and B, if that matters to any of you.
Unfortunately, this was just an overnight for us so I was unable to check out their bookstore upstairs but sure want to next time.
I don’t think you can go wrong with this property. I am looking forward to our next stay there!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay lots of room and the hosts provide everything you could possibly think of in an Airbnb. The home is conveniently located close to main st. in Gloversville. The home has an amazing book store located in the attic.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,a quiet place to rest
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place to crash for a night or two. The kitchen sink has seen better days and I hate that the bathroom doesn't have a lock on it. Otherwise, it was a great stay."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Spacious casual space.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,House is immaculate and HUGE . Host are AMAZING. Very close and Conveniently located.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, convenient to anything you need and the hosts are very nice and quick to communicate."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment is really spacious. It worked well for our needs which was a quick overnight. We arrived late and left early. It was hot upstairs but the provided fans seemed to be enough to keep us comfortable. The furniture and beds were comfortable and space was clean. Arrival and departure worked out without issue. We appreciated being able to make coffee before getting back on the road.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very spacious apartment upstairs in older home. Everything works fine, and is nothing fancy. The basics provided in the kitchen with snacks, too. My band was playing in town, so we appreciated each member having our own room. Lots of room to spread out."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was our favorite airbnb! Lovely older home with huge rooms. The host and hostess respond to any requests quickly and the creams were a thoughtful addition to the keurig coffee. We had a wonderful stay, definitely want to come again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very large, spacious place. Clean, comfortable, and worth it. Great communication from the host in advance."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I had an excellent, relaxing time during our one night day. With all the fans and windows, and a night evening rainstorm, we did fine without A/C. We used the Roku provided on the TV and enjoyed Hulu access. Parking was easy and the neighborhood was very calm and safe. It felt personally cozy, like a family vacation home."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Pros: spacious (4 bedrooms), great value, close to the mountains, super host, breakfast goodies
Cons: No a/c, which is fine most days but a few hot summer days could be uncomfortable"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! Four bedrooms, huge living room, huge kitchen, a nice little balcony, and it’s all very nice and comfortable. This is definitely a great place to relax. I highly recommend this AirBnB!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Stayed there with our family of 6. Plenty of space, and the fruit bowl and breakfast foods were a perfect touch! Great for our one night need."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic place to stay if you need quite a bit of room. There are four bedrooms total which was perfect for my husband and I, our three kids, and my mom. The living room is perfect for playing and hanging out, and the space is very nice. Our only struggle was the lack of air-conditioning. On cooler nights it was fine, but there were several very hot nights where it was extremely uncomfortable to be in the apartment. If do you need a good amount of space this will be a great option for you! As long as the weather forecast doesn’t look too hot. 😅"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly family that is very accomodating.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Jeff’s place was great! They were very responsive and accommodating. It was a large space at a great value.

2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Very spacious and clean! There is no AC but there are fans. Jeff znd Theresa were prompt with all communication met us upin arrival and provided us with fresh fruit and a grab and go breakfast! We enjoyed our brief stay!
2021-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Charmed a little apartment old fashioned wish it had more than one tv. This apartment is good to spend the night not a hang out apartment. The light going into the apartment (the steps) did not work, and the lights leading into the door to go in the place did not work. Overall you get what you pay for."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Not much to choose from in Gloversville and surrounding area. Four bedroom apartment. Good place for family. As of now fix, it needs air conditioner in some windows due to summer heat. The owners are great people. Willing to help when you have needs. Thanks for the “Blue Book. “"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jeff and Theresa are very welcoming and the apartment is HUGE with lots of charm. We especially appreciated the extra hospitable touches they left of snacks and toiletries. We will definitely stay with them again next time we are in Gloversville.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place and jeff was great host stay there again
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Jeff is really nice and considerate. He responded to my inquiries quickly. His place is located in a quiet and nice neighborhood, just 5 minutes walking to the downtown. This place is specious, my children and I enjoyed our stay. We all appreciated the fruit bowl and breakfast options provided! Highly recommended."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed in Jeff's and Theresa's house over the memorial day weekend. It was an old house in a quiet neighborhood. Everything was very clean and as expected. Jeff and Theresa were very nice and helpful. When I asked if they have large pots and large trays for the oven, they actually got them for me, which was very nice of them. Jeff also gave me some good tips where to go hiking in Adirondacks. We had a great time, the trip worked out quite well."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great guy and great place
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place is freshly painted and super clean. There is lots of space and this would be great for a family. there were three of and we enjoyed the spaciousness of the bedrooms, the living room and the dining room. the hosts, Jeff and Theresa, are very helpful and hospitable. There were lots of amenities in the bathroom and kitchen, a beautiful fruit bowl and nice breakfast options, Netflix and Hulu. The mattresses were super comfortable. Street parking in a safe neighborhood - we would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,wonderful spot! highly recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Williams’s place looks really nice and we enjoyed our stay. Would recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We didn’t stay long as it was a pit stop in our travels, but we had such a great experience that we’d use the place every time over a hotel. Plus, our dog loved the place, so that’s always a win!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is the perfect host with a lovely space. He communicates quickly to answer any questions or needs as they arise. The space was perfect for 4 adults to spend a couple days away, who had no interest or need to cook. The kitchenette was small, but just right for the 4 of us to sit together and enjoy our morning coffee. Our host even supplied some freshly ground coffee from beans that come from a local shop. My favorite part of the property and our visit was the gorgeous landscaping and koi pond with sitting area in the back yard. We sat each evening around the pond and enjoyed beverages and conversation. William also gave an amazing tour of the rest of the home, which is STUNNING, and gave the history of the house and it's family. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect location, host, and property for our needs! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William's place was phenomenal. The home and gardens are very beautiful. The accommodations are everything that you can ask for including very beautiful and comfortable bedrooms, interesting and well thought out decor, and elegant bathrooms. The area is very walkable and the neighborhood is wonderful. William and Wally were very kind and generous. I highly recommend their home and Johnstown."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A lovely home with friendly and accommodating hosts!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for hosting us, we had a wonderful stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved staying at William's property. The property itself is gorgeous, beautifully maintained and cared for. The accommodations were so comfortable and all the little details (such as the little satchels of lavender on the bed posts), really made this place special.
Highly recommended!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"William was great. We only stayed one night while passing through, but the place was lovely and William was very helpful. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great but the stairs to bedroom need to be in description and emphasized. Great place to stay and great hosts
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a sweet place with beautiful decor, super comfy beds and quality linens. Very kind and gracious hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"William’s place is just beautiful. The decorations and the ambience was like being in a different era, a real experience. The location is quiet and in a beautiful neighborhood. Bathrooms are beautiful, clean and spacious and William was quick to respond to any questions and incredibly polite."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"William’s place is a hidden gem. Immaculately cleaned and decorated, located in a relaxing rural neighborhood (we woke up to roosters), with Saratoga Springs just a 40 min drive away. Would highly recommend this property to family and friends (as long as they are okay with stairs as they are quite steep). Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Safe and inviting neighborhood to walk around day or night time.
Great recommendations for food, activities, and a perfect location and setting to relax and unwind.
Very friendly and attentive hosts who treated us like family.
We look forward on a return visit with high recommendations to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I highly recommend William's place. I would absolutely stay there again, or even look for a reason to come back so I could stay again. It was stocked with everything we could need and even a lot that we wouldn't expect. The hosts were friendly and helpful, and a delight to meet, and they welcomed our Beagle like she was family. It is a beautiful and very comfortable house and the furnishings were top notch. The bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on - some type of layered memory foam that was more comfortable than our Tempur-Pedic at home. There is a set of slightly steep wooden stairs to the bedrooms that might be limiting for people with issues with stairs, but that is the only possible negative. Highly recommended!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful home and very gracious hosts :) perfect for a last minute Xc ski getaway
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an excellent stay! The house is beautiful and easy to find. It's in a quiet neighborhood and made for an easy nights rest!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Very quaint space. Clean and well stocked. Great hosts! Would definitely return again.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great stay on short notice. Would recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Bill was an amazing host. He was very responsive and helpful with our questions. The house was small but we felt it was well worth the price!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really nice place the funny thing is we only live a half a mile away but was a great vac the only thing i would suggest is to bring like folding setting chairs (like lawn) i am a bigger person so the small card table type chairs were not comfortable to plat board games cards or puzzles even eating dinner but if you are small its all good there are tables outside but it was early mat and it rained they were wet so i guess you could bring in the outside ones there are 8 of them
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chantale is a superb host....the very best.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantelle’s pool house is so much fun. The water is blissfully warm and the house itself is adorable and exactly as described. Imagine being able to float around on a raft while watching cat videos on Youtube at midnight in the privacy of your very own pool house. If this sounds like your type of getaway then Chantelle’s pool house is perfect. The decks and grounds around her house are also lovely and peaceful. And if you’re lucky you’ll get to hang with pups Bronx and Belmont. Can’t wait to come back in the summer time and swim with all the sliding doors open and eat all my meals on the awesome deck. The only thing I would warn you about is the spiral staircase is quite steep and a tad scary coming down. The only bathroom is also downstairs so if you’re someone who is quite clumsy (or has toddlers) or tends to need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, this may not be the setup for you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was such a wonderful getaway! The pool is huge and the temperature was perfect. We had so much fun swimming! The place as a whole is very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Chantale was so kind and truly just wanted us to have a great time. One of the best things about this place was her sweet pups! An unexpected surprise was that if you wanted to, they can come into the space and hang out! Bronx was my cuddle buddy a couple mornings. He is so sweet! Overall we had an amazing time and made some great memories. My son says he definitely wants to come back and I agree!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was our second time staying at Chantale’s Air BNB and we had a fantastic time again! We can’t wait to go again! 😊 Chantale is welcoming in every aspect, she is a great host! The place of stay is amazing! We can’t wait to make more memories at this air bnb!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale and the Poolhouse’s are amazing! There is nothing else like this treasure. It’s the perfect family vacation for anyone who loves a warm water pool. The care and commitment by Chantale is simply outstanding. You will be treated like royalty.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was amazing. The pool house was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. Chantal’s explained everything clearly when we got there, plan for fifteen minutes with her when you arrive! We had some amazing food delivered and swam and relaxed the whole time. Beautiful rural surroundings, but easy to get to! Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful experience staying at Chantale's Airbnb. Her place was so cool - a feat of engineering and ingenuity! It was a top notch experience start to finish. Chantale was such a warm and welcoming host. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into providing a comfortable environment and a considerable amount of amenities for guests. Chantale was very responsive and readily available if assistance was need. As luck would have it, we stayed during the freak spring snow storm. (It was very memorable to get to swim inside while it snowed outside). Our hosts went above and beyond to accomodate us by ensuring that the walk and driveway were clear of snow in time for departure. We wouldn't hesitate to return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale was an amazing host. Every detail was taken care of. The space was beautiful and the pool was perfect. We had a great time and would love to come back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a truly amazing place to stay. I was worried that it might feel like the pool area in a YMCA, but Chantale has everything set up to take care of the humidity, and the air and temp were so pleasant. She had great communication about taking care of the pool house and making sure we were having a great time, but it never felt intrusive. Such a treat to be able to jump in the pool whenever we wanted! It was the perfect place. The pool was good exercise, so you're tired enough at night to get a good night's sleep. The king size bed was actually comfortable!! In other places we've stayed, it felt like someone might've put their old bed in the air bnb. Not here! It was better than my sleep number I have at home. :) I can't say enough good. If you're on the fence about staying here, just do it. You won't regret it! :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had the best time! Such a beautiful space with every last detail thought of.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful but fun family time! If you need time away from life this is the place!! You have everything you need and more! The pool was our main attraction, warm, clean, and packed with fun toys. Kids were overjoyed and we found the big TV was nice for relaxing at night too. Also watching basketball while in the pool! The space is clean for obvious but most importantly two reasons 1. Guests have respected the space and listened to her (simple) rules. 2. Chantale has the HVAC down to a science to keep you and your family safe and comfortable. I loved the kitchen, we ate in and got take out bc we didn’t want to leave the space! We went out bowling one day and to an aquarium 40 min away. Chantale, thanks for your kindness, it goes a long way!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With over 50 AirBnB stays, this is the ONLY one we've ever booked twice. Chantale's property is a true treat and she's one of the BEST Airbnb hosts I've had the privilege of meeting. The unique and incredibly relaxing pool, thoughtful touches and quiet surroundings make this a trip you won't forget. I'm a huge dog lover and getting to play with the pups will always be a highlight. So happy to also see Chantel's handmade wares also available to browse and purchase - she's so talented and we wanted it all! Can't wait to come again for a third time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale was absolutely amazing!! extremely friendly. She recommended places to eat and take the kids to have fun. Her pool house is extremely clean and tons of fun!! Oh and her dog Belmont and Bronx are absolutely amazing and very friendly. We will definitely be booking again!! Thank you so much Chantale for wonderful hospitality!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a perfect little getaway for my family before our newest addition arrives. The pool was fantastic and so warm. My kids said it was the best day ever everyday we were there and gave it a 10/10. We can’t wait to book again! Chantale was an amazing host and made us feel right at home.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm conflicted about writing this review as I want to rant and rave about it, but selfishly, I don't want to draw more people in, so I have more future possibilities to stay here! I stayed with my son and two of his friends to celebrate his 13th birthday, and it was beyond amazeballs! Chantale was super sweet and accommodating. She went over everything thoroughly and clearly when we got there, and then we got total privacy with the occasional text (which wasn't a problem for me). Covering and uncovering the pool was super easy once you got a hang of it and was so worth it to keep the water nice and warm! The only thing that wasn't there was the air fryer that was in the photos of the kitchen, but I'm sure if I asked Chantale about it, she would have brought one or accommodated the best way she could. She truly was that wonderful of a host, and I don't give that kind of praise lightly. I don't stay in airbnb's typically more than once, but this one will be the exception!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the pool house and it was amazing, as we knew it would be! Chantale is such a great host and we can’t get enough of the pool. We’ll be back again next winter ☺️"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an AMAZING time at the pool house! Everything was as described and the hospitality was wonderful. We will definitely be going back asap.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s hard to put such a MAGICAL, COZY, WHIMSY, EXCITING experience and accommodations into only 1,000 words.
If you are on the fence about booking..I highly recommend to just GO FOR IT! My family and I have stayed in an array of accommodations and this is by far our FAVORITE! This is seriously a gem of upstate New York. There wasn’t a single thing we needed that wasn’t there already. The host Chantale was SO UTTERLY AMAZING I secretly wanted her to just stay the night with us. Opening and closing the pool was easy and I tend to overthink everything when it’s easy! It was even a bonding experience for my husband and I. We stayed for our daughters 7th birthday. The personal touches Chantale put into making it memorable are beyond words!! If you get the pleasure of meeting Bronx (one of her fur babies) give him a hug for us! The shower, beds, kitchen and of course the POOL was beyond luxurious. Can’t wait to go back and if you get to stay here then you will feel the same way ✨"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale was an amazingly thorough, attentive, and flexible host. She keeps immaculate care of her pool house and helps makes you feel like it’s your own while you are there. It’s the most fun and relaxing getaway I’ve had in a while and my niece/nephew/sister and partner will all agree. Fun and suitable for all ages. Kitchen was also very well equipped with everything you need! Go there! I’ve already booked my next trip :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"She greeted us amazingly with a very inviting and pleasant manner. Very friendly and accommodating to your needs. We couldn’t have had a better host. Her property was very well cared for and maintained. Everything was a described and more. My family and I will absolutely be back again for sure. Words cannot describe how awesome and friendly Chantel treated me and my family. I would recommend her Airbnb to anyone. My family thanks you so much for making our stay pleasant and definitely memorable.
You were awesome and we appreciate you 100%.
If you have pups that you had to leave at home and miss, her dogs will be great fill in's, very gentle, friendly and loving. Overall a great experience 😊
My family thanks you Chantel."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved our stay, could barely get my two kids out of the amazing pool to eat or nap. Space was very clean, water warm and Chantale was very eager to ensure we had an amazing time! Looking forward to staying again next year!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"YOU HAVE TO BOOK THIS PLACE!!! The Pool House was absolutely perfect! It was actually bigger than the photos. The pool was warm and refreshing. And the bed and shower head were devine!! Chantale was amazing. She knew all of our names at arrival, which was so cool, and we became immediate friends. My girls 18, 15, and 3 thought it was the coolest place ever and want to make it a tradition. We enjoyed the pool volleyball, the games-like Taboo and Apples to Apples, and the sweet sound bar for a party-like feel without worrying who we would disrupt. It was the most private stay we've ever had. Cooking tacos and quesidilllas and in the perfectly stocked kitchen was a breeze, and I definitely noticed the top end stuff like appliances, pans, washer/dryer, couch, tv, and linens. Chinese food was also available for delivery, and so many pretty lakes and hikes were close by. Oh, and the pups we deemed hospitality hounds because they were the friendliest, chillest dogs. We can't wait to return!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another wonderful stay for us and we couldn’t be happier! My kids were asking if we had another trip booked next month after just one night. Thank you for being an amazing host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You are an incredible person.
Please do not change at all."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The most amazing place!! The pictures are amazing but the experience was beyond words!! My family and I enjoyed every minute and can’t wait to make this a new yearly tradition!! So grateful for Chantale sharing this space with us, and we couldn’t have asked for a better host!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The most welcoming and amazing host we have ever been to. Can’t wait to go back in February!!!!! See you soon
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay at Chantale's poolhouse was just as amazing as our first time. The kids have been looking forward to it the whole year! Chantale is the most exceptional host I've ever met and I've stayed at a lot of Air Bnbs. She again greeted us with her delicious brownies I had been craving, and she was so excited to see our family again. Chantale was extremely responsive to any requests, questions, concerns, prior to and throughout our stay.
The poolhouse was just as pristine as last time and equipped with everything you need. On this trip, we just lounged in the poolhouse the entire time and it was so relaxing and kids were entertained all day. And like last time, Chantale and Toni hung out with our kids, letting them play with the dogs, answering their many questions, and showing them around the property.
We have already booked our next trip back and are planning a second one for next year. It's such a unique Air Bnb experience, and Chantale has become a part of our family."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale’s place was absolute perfection!! It was SO unique, SO clean and SO much fun!! There was so much attention to detail and personal touches. Chantale is the definition of Superhost. She is so responsive, welcoming, easy to communicate with and truthfully makes you feel right at home! Not only is the place absolutely spotless and has the unique characteristic of an indoor pool but there is also a beautiful outdoor fire pit, a pristine kitchen and tv/sound system! I could go on for days with how great this place is! Highly, highly recommend this listing!! We seriously had the absolute best stay ever!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a relaxing time spent at the pool house! Beautiful scenery everywhere you look. Perfect getaway to unwind and forget about work for awhile! Chantale is super nice and a great host!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chantale was a great host! She was very responsive and helpful for anything we requested. We would love to come back and stay again!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are considering booking this place, just do it! You will not regret it! Our only complaint was we didn't get to spend enough time with Bronx & Belmont, Chantale's precious pups!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the pool house was amazing. Chantale is such a friendly and communicative host who makes your stay go smoothly! The space is beautiful. The pool is bigger than it looks in the photos and is the perfect temperature. There are also beautiful hikes and trails in the area. Highly recommend you plan a visit to this wonderful spot, I know we’ll be planning a second visit!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WHAT A GEM! I randomly stumbled upon this Airbnb, and beyond thankful that I did! The pool house is a little piece of heaven. We spent the days hiking and biking in the Adirondacks, and spent the evenings soothing our sore muscles in the heated pool, or relaxing by the fire. Couldn't have asked for a better experience!! 10 Stars!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale is an amazing host! She thought of everything with precise instructions, confirmed arrival time to meet and review the property. Verbal instructions along with pictures and helpful notes posted at the site as well. The property was exactly as pictured and described within the listing. My family loved the getaway and the heated pool. My friend said the pool felt “like a warm blanket” as she floated around. The kids loved the loft area, the pool, the pool toys, and other thoughtful items Chantale leaves for her guests. Great time overall."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Chantale's pool house was amazing and we loved supporting a veteran owned business! Everything was in pristine working order and super clean. I thought it might be humid or smell like pool chemicals, but Chantale has it all worked out with an industrial fan system and a chlorine-free pool. We loved every moment and look forward to another visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I don't often leave reviews. Maybe it's because I've never been impressed enough to leave a review. However, this visit was a different experience. After a long time, I finally managed to make a reservation and headed to my destination with high expectations. The pool was larger than expected and had everything the kids could enjoy. Chantale answered all questions quickly and faithfully, so there was no inconvenience at all during my stay. The local restaurant was also excellent in both taste and quantity. It was a time to rest well in a quiet and pleasant environment. Above all, I was surprised by how clean the whole house was. If I am lucky enough to book again during the school break, there is absolutely no reason not to come back. Chantale, thanks for everything."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time back and it certainly will not be my last. I love EVERYTHING about Chantale’s place. She seriously goes above and beyond for her guests and this time I brought my mom, sister, and niece & nephew and they had the time of their lives. Chantale joined us for s’mores at night and it seriously became one of their favorite part to have her join us and to get to pick Chantale’s brain. The patience she exhibits with them only added to an already exceptional experience and I cannot wait to be back again and to continue to create new memories that include Chantale! Thank you so so so so much Chantale! You are truly INCREDIBLE!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely love the pool house! Chantale is very welcoming and goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable. She goes over the guidelines clearly and they are super easy to follow. The kids loved the loft and there was more than enough room for 4 guests to be completely comfortable. Chantale is available if you have any issues but gives you total privacy. She went out of her way during our stay and brought us to a local place where they made homemade ice cream. We didn't have a car so she gave us a ride to a local goat farm experience also! She even made us a fire the last night and made smores with us! She is an amazing host and the poolhouse is a magical place. I already booked for the next 2 years. I will be making this my family's yearly vacation spot! I loved the pool house and Chantale. We made some incredible memories that my family will never forget. I am truly sad to leave but I cant wait to come back next year! Thank you so much Chantale!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale has thought of everything - pool floats, games, firepit, etc.! Her place was nice and secluded from other neighbors, which allowed for privacy. Its location is close to Schnectady where you can go to Animal Land and VIA aquarium for the kiddos. The pool was a lovely temperature. We also loved the personal touches (guest gratitude wall) and support for local businesses (vets and animals). Chantale was very kind and passionate. We'd definitely go again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a perfect getaway! Your house was beautiful and amazing and we were extremely lucky to find this hidden gem! Our host were so warm and welcoming and we instantly felt like they were friends 😁
Its easy to tell when a home is just maintained and when it is loved. These owners are definitely the latter. Me and my husband escaped for a private getaway from our crazy lives and this was the place to do this. No detail was looked over. We already miss the house! Cant wait to come back in the future! Give the dogs a hi for us!
Once again we couldn’t thank you enough! -Oriana and Chuck"
2023-07-01,2,Stayed with kids,The place itself was beautiful no privacy for bedroom space the lady met us upon arrival to go over all the rules and pool rules very uncomfortable with being watched every sec with cameras on u at all times the two ladies are right on premises constant sending pics to her to make sure the pool cover was on correctly if u left the pool for ten min u had to cover it very uncomfortable stay if ur looking for privacy this wasn’t the place would not rent there again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a great place to get away from the daily grind and disconnect. great location close to lake sacandaga and saratoga springs. the accommodations were comfortable and the pool was fantastic. cant wait to go back again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,100 percent recommend this beautiful private pool house. Chantel is an amazing host and she really does think of everything. I think the best part was the awesome sound system and watching jaws while we swam. Definitely a unique and memorable stay. Can't wait to return in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time at Chantale's place. She has really put in a lot of work to create a wonderful experience for guests as well as figure out logistics on how to keep the pool house in pristine condition. Once you are here you understand all the rave reviews! Also one of the kindest and most responsive Airbnb hosts out there. We can't wait to come back and make more family memories here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I booked the pool house a year and a half in advance..please believe me when I say IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! Chantale was extremely responsive to my questions before I even booked her property. While the listing description is absolutely explicit and transparent, it was the effort and time taken to thoroughly explain the pool house instructions to us with provided visuals that truly helped make everything smooth and easy. Chantale’s “customer service” is second to none and it was obvious our comfort and happiness were a top priority to her. We had the best time on her property and although she had an ENTIRE binder filled with brochures of things to do and menus of restaurants, we were so in love with the property that all we wanted to do was stay there and enjoy the amenities. We enjoyed relaxing, playing with the many provided games, grilling, making yummy s’mores, & of course playing with her pups. We loved our experience so much we’ll be back in the winter! THANK YOU!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the minute we got there until the moment we left, Chantale was on top of everything & then some. Everything was exactly as expected and/or pictured. This was my 1st AirBnb experience & if I could give her more than 5 stars, I would. She was knowledgeable, accommodating, helpful & informative without intruding on us or our stay. She is Everything you would want or need in a host.(and more). She evens goes above & beyond for her guests…. For example, on our first night we were heading out for a bit, but my car didn’t start, so instead of my calling AAA, she & Toni jumped my car & in minutes my mom & I were on our way to explore the area & do some shopping, dining & start our adventure. Btw, her recommendations are spot on. I felt so relaxed & at home. I would love to someday go back, but if I/we (my mom & I ) never make it back there, I know there is a little piece of my heart left on that property in Gloversville in the Adirondacks.
Thank you C & T !! Till we c u again. Karla"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect getaway whether you have young kids or older kids or no kids at all! The pool house is a one of a kind design with perfect decorative touches throughout! The pool is warm and relaxing! It’s great for family bonding.
Chantele is a great host always responsive to anything you might need! Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. She was out there to greet us when we arrived. Explained everything clearly. Very relaxing. Kids loved it
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience and a wonderful host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""Super Host"" is a total understatement when describing Chantale. She was AMAZING and honestly was a great addition to the cabin! Aside from her being so unbelievably accommodating, her hospitality is off the charts. The pool house is beautiful and perfectly secluded from the side of the road but a very short trip to get into town for any needs. She provided a binder with local restaurants and attractions (AND menus included!!!!) And the fact that there are even some places that DELIVER to the pool house made it that much more convenient. I cannot recommend this place enough. I can promise we will be back very soon!!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This place is exactly as explained and more! The host is friendly and more than accommodating. We had an amazing time and we can’t wait to return.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful house with a phenomenal pool. Clean, stocked and a kind and responsive host. The only downside is with the fact there is an indoor pool and changing humidity the host is in constant contact regarding opening/closing the pool and opening/closing windows. I felt a bit tied to my phone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"if I could give more than 5 stars about Chantales pool house, I would!!!!! This is our second time going to the Pool House, and I know it will not be our last. Chantal is a fantastic host who is super friendly and joyful. She remembered my kids and I and made it special with the fact that we were returning guests. Icannot wait to book with her again. Thank you for everything, Chantale, and I hope to see you soon!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Saying that Chantale is a superhost is an understatement. I officially call her the master because she has truly mastered the art of hosting and prioritizing the comfort of her guests! In addition to totally having the pool house down to a science! Chantale is a true professional, who is always a text message or call away. It is very easy to see why people continue to return to this oasis as even prior to meeting, Chantale curates excellent recommendations to meet your trip’s goals! She is an exceptional host and I cannot wait to make this a frequent tradition! Luckily, six months ago when I initially booked, I went ahead and double booked for August and I truly cannot wait to be back with the rest of my family so that they too can experience the wonders of Chantale’s pool house and her even more extraordinary personality! Exactly what my soul needed! The perfect reset! My recommendation to anyone who stumbles on this listing — If you see availability, snag it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chantale’s pool house is top notch. It was so clean and comfortable. She was so accommodating and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is the best it can be. Her pool house has everything you can possibly need. There’s no reason to ever leave it. The pool itself was phenomenal. We soaked up every minute that we could in it. We are already planning our next trip back. This was our favorite Airbnb we’ve stayed in to date. I can’t say enough about the pool house or Chantale.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED our stay! Everything was perfect! Chantale is an incredible host; so responsive, always available and making her guests feel as comfortable as possible. If you love to swim or are looking for a unique place to relax this is it! And if you have kids who love to swim they will be in heaven! Can’t wait to go back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would have given a higher rating on Chantale. From the moment we met i knew she was a great lady. Conversations were so easy she was beyond accommodating. The pool house was exactly what we were looking for and it checked off all of our boxes for our girls getaway. Very clean comfortable and you need nothing and i mean nothing besides food drinks and maybe a pool raft. Chantale has thought of everything !!! We will be keeping in touch and looking forward to another visit. You will not be disappointed if you book this place with Chantale 😃
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just completed our third annual trip to the pool house. Every year it seems to be better. Not only is it an amazing, perfect family trip, Chantale actively works every year to add additional features. Our prior two trips were in the winter, this was our first spring trip - I think we actually liked it more to have all the doors open while we swam (although spending the day in the pool mid-winter is tough to beat). We float, play, watch TV and just have the easiest getaway ever. Everything is incredibly clean and well labeled, Chantale is always available yet not overwhelming. Can't recommend this place enough (if you're lucky enough to be able to find a free spot in the schedule and book it)."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale was an amazing host! We loved our stay at the pool house with the loft that the kids thought was a tree house/fort. The kids swam the entire time and had a blast. Highly recommend for a private fun getaway!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"My girlfriends and I enjoyed Chantale’s place for a long weekend. She was so thoughtful and responsive; one of the best hosts I’ve ever had. She’s got the protocol down to a T for ensuring the pool house is comfortable and safe, and it’s easy to follow. The pool house is even more beautiful and peaceful than the photos do justice. We loved our time and you surely will too! Thank you, Chantale! We can’t wait to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale is the most gracious host. She really feels like family. This was our second, of what we hope to be many, visits to her pool house.
Beautiful home and surroundings. Private and quiet. All the amenities one would need.
Chantale goes above and beyond. She really wants her guests to have fun and enjoy themselves. A stay here will not be disappointing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Walmart and price chopper about a 10-15 minute drive.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd time coming to Chantelle's place. The pool house is an absolutely wonderful experience. Chantelle maintains this airbnb in pristine shape. Everything is immaculately clean and she is the warmest, most friendly and through host.
Her pups are adorable too and come over to visit if you let them in :-)!
I can not recommend Chantelle's place highly enough. We have completely enjoyed both our visits and hope to have many more."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriends and I made amazing memories here. The best host you can ask for, cannot wait to book another stay. Friendly, thought of everything, genuine and so cool. Very generous and such a beautiful/unique home. Seriously everything you need is there. Very comfy and love the pool!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale’s pool house is a true gem! She was an exceptional host and prioritized our needs from the beginning of our weekend stay through the end. The pool was luxuriously warm and such a treat during the cold winter months. Our girls had a blast and my husband and I also had a lovely time checking out of real life for a few days. Highly recommend checking out Chantale’s little oasis in the woods!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale was a wonderful host who went above and beyond to make our stay amazing!!!
The pool house is beautiful and has all the amenities of home! We had a blast swimming, relaxing and enjoying our time as a family. Can’t wait to go back!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Chantale has created an oasis to share with her guests. The pool house exceeded our expectations. It was spotless, cozy and warm, an incredible place to float in 90 degree water while watching the snowfall on the beautiful countryside, and comes with doggos too!..Chantale was extremely responsive and even dropped off treats for us. Amazing hosts ..amazing place. Was lucky enough to book another stay in a couple of months!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was so thankful to find an opening on my friends birthday! We had a wonderful time floating, chatting, watching tv and relaxing!! All the little touches make it so comfortable and welcoming."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale's pool house is AMAZING! There are literally no words to describe how magical our stay was. Chantale was so welcoming, and we felt totally at home in the pool house. She thought of every detail--from a TV that swivels so you can watch it from the pool or the couch, to a row of chargers, to photos reminding you of how to close up the pool. And her system for keeping the house comfortable is AMAZING, even with a foot of snow outside! My daughter asked when we were going back as we were leaving the house, and it was definitely a core memory for her when we watched The Little Mermaid WHILE we were swimming in the pool (pretending to be mermaids, of course)."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! I keep saying this was the best vacation I’ve had without hesitation! For this mom in need of some R & R, this was perfect! I came in and didn’t leave until checkout. My best description, I felt like I walked into my own little private paradise. Never heard a complaint from the kids (TEENAGERS!) of being bored or them asking to go “do something” and there were several hours of interacting with them rather than seeing their heads buried in their phones too! A miracle alone! The pool house was extremely clean and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay, even a comfy bathrobe for me to relax in! Chantale went above and beyond to ensure we had the most enjoyable stay. She puts so much thought and effort into making the pool house your most comfortable and enjoyable stay. It’s like she was meant to do this. She is just awesome! I will be back again, can’t wait to see Chantale and the pool house!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a blast at the pool house. It is exactly as described, even better. Chantale could not have been a nicer or more helpful host. She gives clear instruction on how to open and close the pool, and she takes care of the rest! We already have our next stay at the pool house booked and can’t wait to return. It’s such a great space, thanks again Chantale!!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful space! It was such a treat for the kids (and all of us) to swim in a beautiful warm pool in the dead of update NY winter. There's nothing Chantale hasn't thought of in terms of comfort, instructions, signage, from location of towel hooks to charging stations. You can tell she's learned a lot along the way, takes feedback seriously, and we've been the beneficiaries of a well- thought out and tested process. We'd love to come back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is amazing!!! The pool and pool house is so warm and cozy. When you’re in the pool, there are plenty of sliding glass doors and windows to view the beautiful tree lined property. My mother in law came with us and the pool was so warm it was very therapeutic for her. Everything you need for a great time is available including floaties and volleyball net! There’s a living room mere feet from the pool to lounge and watch a movie. We happened to be there through New Years, so we were able to watch the ball drop on tv from the pool. As amazing as the place is, Chantale couldn’t have been any more amazing. When you arrive you can feel the genuine warmth and care she has for you and your family. If there was a level above super host, I’m sure she would one of few. It was actually sad to have to leave. It felt like leaving a family member after a visit during the holidays. She treated us like family. We loved it there and plan on coming back. Thank you Chantale and Toni!!! <3"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the pool house and without a doubt we will be returning. This stay was just as wonderful has the first, very relaxing and Chantale was once again a wonderful host. One thing in particular that I think is worth mentioning is that the pool house does not smell or feel musty in any way. Chantale's done a very good job of adding fans and dehumidifiers that help to keep everything in balance. We were very impressed and we're already looking forward to our next stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids had the best time! I was a bit overwhelmed with things at first, but once we opened and closed the pool a couple times we had it figured out. My kids enjoyed the pool activities provided. My husband loved watching his sports on the big tv while we swam. Chantale took the time to listen to the kids questions and talk with them too. Great experience :)"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our third time coming to Chantale's pool house and it never disappoints!! Our visits have become one of our favorite family traditions. Chantale is the most incredible host and goes way above and beyond to make sure you have the absolute best time! There is nothing better than floating in a 94 degree pool when it's snowing outside, all while watching Christmas movies and listening to your children's laughter. This place is a treasure... a total gem! It's spotless, cozy, and has everything you need to relax and unwind. We are so thankful for the family time and memories we've made at the pool house and look forward to our next visit. Thank you Chantale!!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Chantale’s warm disposition really set the tone for the entire stay. It was an Unforgettable weekend and we’ll all be returning for years to come. One of the best Christmas memories my siblings and I have made.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If a pool that is nice and warm as well as clean is at all great sounding. This is the place to stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There are no words for what a fabulous person Chantale is!! She absolutely goes above and beyond for you. We had the best time. Relaxing, fun and being able to swim while watching the snow fall priceless. We had a blast!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun and unique getaway! The kids were in love and never wanted to leave. The place is great and chantale is a wonderful host!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale's listing is exactly as picture- only nicer, cleaner, and more fun than you are guessing! Can't recommend highly enough. A unique, easy, and fun place to stay and wonderful activities in the area as well."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect relaxing get away!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit, and it was wonderful. Chantale is such a gracious host, the pool house is SO CLEAN, and it's been a really great experience both times. The location is fantastic for us, feeling remote near lots of hiking but being so close to stores and restaurants. It's nice not to have to pack food with us, and to just order and pickup from the store after we arrive. The kitchen is amazingly well stocked, and of course the pool is incredible."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had such an AMAZING time at Chantale's pool house. The place itself was incredibly well designed and maintained, down to every last detail. You can tell that she put a lot of effort and thought into ensuring that each aspect of the pool house was guest friendly. The kitchen was great for people that enjoying cooking, was fully stocked with many new appliances and spices (even an air fryer!). The bed was large and incredibly comfortable, and the loft had a few fans so that you could regulate the temp to your desire. Plenty of games and movies to relax with as well. The pool was the perfect temperature and we went in several times a day! The removing and replacing of the pool cover only took a few minutes and was easy and not a bother at all!
Chantale was an incredibly kind, warm and friendly host. She greeted us when we got there an explained all the instructions for the pool house thoroughly. She also has pictures and written instructions incase you forget! She was so helpful throughout our stay and make some great recommendations that we're geared towards our interests. It was also my partner's birthday during the trip and she very kindly brought us some DELICIOUS cannoli's to eat. Her dogs are adorable and very friendly, so if you are a dog person, that is a huge plus! I will 100% be back here! Thank you for a wonderful trip :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful get away. We had an incredible time! Amazing host and amazing home
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Another wonderful stay in my home away from home. Can't say enough about how welcoming and accommodating Toni and Chantale are. I will definitely return to this oasis for another reset.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED our stay at Chantale’s pool house. She is a wonderful host and you won’t be disappointed by the space. We had such a fun time watching football games/tv while swimming and seeing the fall foliage outside while we swam in the warm pool. Her space is clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. We will definitely be returning!!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! This has been the third or fourth stay we've done at Chantale's pool house and we enjoy it every single time. Chantale is the most amazing host, and her pool house is a unique treasure. To sit and watch a movie in the dark while floating around. Pump music and swim with the kids. Just relax and enjoy the pool. It's such a treat to stay here! Cannot recommend it enough!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the pool house! Another wonderful stay in a beautiful place all thanks to amazing hosts!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences my family and I have ever had, and we have stayed at a lot of AirBnbs. The pool house is the most unique set up I have ever seen and there is nothing else like this out there. It has all the essentials that you need in a house with the addition of a pool in your living room! The place is incredibly clean, the furniture and equipment are all in great condition and well maintained. The temperature is so comfortable and there is no humidity, which is something I was concerned about. Chantale has developed a system to ensure that the humidity and moisture levels are at an appropriate level, and she does need our cooperation to ensure the pool house stays in good condition. You have to open and close the pool everytime you go in and out, text her, and turn on the fan. But it’s simple, pretty quick, not much of an ask, and absolutely necessary if you want to preserve this special place and be able to return for many years.
Chantale was the best Air Bnb host I’ve ever had, and I’ve stayed at many Airbnbs. Here are some of the ways she went above and beyond:
-She baked us the most delicious brownies that we devoured within 24 hours
-When I mentioned that my middle son loved horses, she arranged a visit to her friend’s farm. She cut up carrots and apples and put them into individual bags so we could feed the horses.
-When I said I wanted to roast s’mores, she made long sticks for the kids to roast marshmallows with, and got a fire going.
-She entertained the kids for hours, letting them play with her dogs, explore the grounds with her, and indulging there endless questions.
My kids and I had so much fun here. They loved being able to go into the pool anytime they wanted, and they just loved the space, the grounds, and the whole experience. They asked when we can come back again and asked if we could go for a full week next time instead of just 3 nights.
We have already booked our next stay and are on the waitlist in case of another opening before then. I’ve already referred several friends who are so eager to go. I would 1000% recommend booking or getting on the waitlist to experience this incredibly unique and special experience."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is difficult to sum up how much we loved our stay at the Pool House, and for how many reasons! The building itself is quite impressive, and fits perfectly in a setting of trees and sky.
The pool water is deliciously warm, while the pool house feels comfortable, and not humid for just hanging out or sleeping. The beds were very cozy, with nice linens and plenty of blankets. We even fell in love with the kitchen appliances, and the shower.
My new favorite way to watch movies is on the big screen TV while swimming.
They have created a very special and unique place to get away, and I can’t think of a single thing we wished we had while we were there…except for more time! Kisses and tail wags from Belmont and Bronx put the icing on the cake.
We highly recommend spending time at the Pool House, and hope to go back again ourselves!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing! The kids always have a blast and we can’t wait to go back next year! Chantale goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantell goes out of her way to make you as comfortable as possible. She is down to earth and so incredibly nice and totally understanding. The best host I have ever had the honor of meeting. So incredibly grateful that my family had the chance to soak in such an amazing place. It’s is so unique and has everything you could need to make your stay enjoyable!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely place - a house I’d call home being away from home + a heated and all ready pool.
Host Chantale provided all travel and house essentials I needed (towels, floats, washer/dryer, board games, garbage bag, paper towels…even some cooking spices). My favorite has to be the 7+TRESeeme brand shampoo and conditioner - even better than what I brought myself. (One of my biggest pet peeve is dryness in hair after swim so I was soooo happy Chantale cared for her guests and provided a quality set). Honestly, I couldn’t have asked for more. We felt we were at home. We truly enjoyed our 5-day stay here, not enough is all I can say.
I was amazed how good the pool house was crafted and maintained. Chantale pretty much designed and built it herself with very little help. I love all the decoration she put inside and around the house - so much detail and I could feel much love has been invested into the house. The only inconvenience I felt at the beginning is texting Chantale everytime we opened/closed the pool. It takes a little bit of getting used to but it is really not hard once i understand why she needs this information. It takes a lot to maintain this beautiful pool house and a small action from us as guest can help her tremendously. I think this will make pool house lasts longer and available for all of us to enjoy.
At first I was worried about what to do to keep my kids entertained, they can’t be in the pool for that many hours. To my surprise - they spent hours inside the pool and still not bored of it day after day. They said the best part they loved is floating on warm water watching movie (they had done it outside in cold water before and it wasn’t as fun).
Host Chantale is super friendly and she is always ready to offer tips and provide support. Light up camp fire 🔥 is not a must skill for a city mom - when I texted Chantale, she came right away and helped to lite up the fire and kids had blast roasting marshmallows. I am not a dog person but my kids loved to play with Bronx and Belmont. After we came back to real home - they kept asking for dog 🐶
There are giant supermarkets and many restaurants nearby, within 10-15 mins away. Yet where the pool house located is quite and peaceful. I felt it got both side of the world. An excellent place to break away from routine - both adults and kids were happy and relaxed.
This pool house is a gem and I am so glad I found it. I also added this pool house to my annual must vacation spots. See you around hopefully soon Chantale (Bronx and Belmont)!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing. We have visited twice now and are already counting down the days until we can go back again!
The property is phenomenal. Clean, well maintained, and it has everything (and more!) that you need. And where else can you find your own personal indoor heated pool?
Chantale is the perfect host. She's available and attentive without being intrusive. She goes above and beyond any expectations to make her guests feel welcome and at home.
And it's a beautiful location. Secluded and yet just minutes to town with a good variety of restaurants and shops. However you won't want to leave so just hit the grocery store and then order takeout as needed.
The only downside as far as I can tell is that we can't come more often!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale ,
Your property did not disappoint . This is not your ordinary Airbnb . This Pool house is just amazingly well kept beautiful and will exceed your expectations, and the owner Chantale and Tony went above and beyond making our stay simply amazing.
Belmont and Bronx the family dogs made it even more fun for my boys.
The pool house is stocked with everything from Netflix , towels , board games to keep your family busy, Everything you need is here no need to leave for anything .The warm heated pool that you can enjoy at all hours is BEAUTIFUL , a beautiful comfy king size bed. Just Wonderful details in this pool house it is so cozy you won’t want to leave. Walmart is very close .
This pool house is just amazing I can’t say it enough. Our family will surely return for more nights in the “ pool house “ we just love it ."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the pool house for 5 days. And we had a wonderful time in the pool. Movie nights in the pool is awesome!
Chantale is a great host. And The pool house is equipped everything we needed for our getaway. And we would totally recommend this Airbnb"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pool house is beyond amazing! Much more than I expected. And with the beautiful, quiet surroundings, and our lovely host Chantele, it was the perfect little getaway. Bring your bathing suit, some loungeware and your favorite foods to grill and you don't have to step foot off of the property.
The pool house was immaculate. The temperature of the pool was perfect. We watched movies and listened to music on the giant TV while floating in the pool! This experience was very unique, I can't say enough about it. So clean and comfortable, one of the most comfortable out of town stays I've ever had. We all slept like babies!
Chantele was such a great host. I had to do dialysis treatments while I was there and Chantele was so kind, caring and asked me if there was anything she could do to help or if there was anything additional I needed. She even bought all of us a pizza dinner-so thoughtful. I can really tell that she genuinely cared. She's a really good person and a kind soul. She cares about and take pride in her property.
If you have the chance to get away to this unique and gorgeous stay DO IT! DO NOT HESITATE!
I can't wait to go back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I really appreciated how thoughtful and attentive Chantale was. She made us brownies and gave us maple syrup ❤️ she made us feel like we were at home the entire visit. This was a wonderful getaway and I will be back for sure! This is not your regular AirBNB. It’s a home away from home
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best place ever.... must go!! Chantale is amazing and a wonderful host. Her property exceeded our expectations. Had no issues besides I did not want to leave. The setting is in a beautiful part of the Adirondacks. The pool is specular and could spend all day in it. I recommend booking this Airbnb, you will not be disappointed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is beautiful!!! It has a magical vibe. You feel calm and peaceful at all times. The house is equipped with everything you may need, before you arrive make sure you buy all your groceries/food because you will not want to leave at all. Chantale is an excellent host and will help you with everything you may need. The pool is great, perfect temperature, we use it at all times, but enjoying it at night in the dark while watching a movie is spectacular. The only thing we regretted was not staying longer. I hope to be able to return soon. Book it!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love love love! The pool house is fun, relaxing and just overall cozy. The host Chantale is very responsive. We had everything we needed in this gorgeous property. If you can catch an opening, I recommend you book for a chance to unwind, you will not be disappointed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here two different weeks on our honeymoon, and had an absolutely amazing time. Superb host experience, and beautiful, relaxing, comfortable place to stay. You won't regret it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Airbnb! Has all the comforts of home away from home. The big feature - the indoor heated pool - did not disappoint. Overall, an amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible! A place you will want to come back to again and again. Great host, beautiful location, and lovely accomodations and attention to detail and comfort. Clean and stunning pool house near many places to explore in the Adirondacks (if you ever want to even step out the door to go explore, which may be difficult 😉). Walmart isn't far away, which is great for groceries, and there's also great places to order food from in the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best and most amazing place you could stay. If you get a date- hurry- book and be thankful! Chantale is a special host and human. This is a place we will visit each year.
Clean and inviting. The house welcomes you as much as the host!
Thank you for the most magical week ever!!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to the Pool House, and our second visit was better than the first! Chantale is a host that cannot be surpassed! She is so kind, thoughtful, and accommodating! Her property is like no other!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t think it is possible to have a better bnb host or accommodation.
Chantale and the Poolhouse are fantastic!!!! You will not be disappointed if you stay here. Everything is top notch. The pool is an absolute delight and you would never know that it was an indoor pool based on the wonderful ventilation system. The air is as fresh as outdoors. No yucky pool smell at all. Chantale is great at communicating without being intrusive. She is always cheerful and is so effective in responding to your needs. Absolutely one of the best run establishments I’ve had the privilege of staying at."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our third time here. This place is amazing everytime!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful place to stay. I was with my daughter and three grandchildren and we all had a great time. The pool is great and everyone loved playing with the dogs. Chantale is a great host and even made my daughter a birthday cake. We would all like to go there again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Chantale’s and Toni’s Airbnb with my boyfriend, Corey, to celebrate my birthday. Our stay was very relaxing. Chantale met us on the first night and went over all of the pool instructions (which were super easy). Chantale’s communication during our whole stay was great. We felt very at ease and grateful. They made sure we felt welcomed and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We met Toni the next day, who was very nice and sweet. Toni set a fire for our last night which we thought was extremely thoughtful. They also made us brownies which made us smile since we didn’t tell them it was my bday. Chantale and Toni are the kind of hosts you can only wish to have whenever you make Airbnb reservations. We even had the pleasure of hanging out with Bronx in the pool house during the day. He was a lot of fun to have around since we were missing our mini goldendoodle. He was a very good boy. Belmont was also a delight, keeping guard of the property :).
All in all, the only complaint we have is I wish I would have booked our stay for longer. The experience was truly amazing and I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This gorgeous pool house was everything we thought it would be and more! My family & I had 2 tons of fun during our stay. The heated pool is the perfect temperature to relax and unwind while listening to music or watching tv. The full kitchen allowed us to spend more time together having fun and less time out trying to figure out what to eat. All the board games plus the 2 tv's kept us entertained during our time outside the pool. Our only regret is we didn't stay longer, but we will be back!! Chantele is an amazing host & we thank her for everything from the bottom of our hearts. See you soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All l can say is Wow! Wow! Wow! lf you have not gotten the opportunity to book a stay at this amazing property, it is definitely a must see and the experience is even better! l stumbled upon it looking for a more local place to hang out for a few days not wanting to be so far away from home. My husband and l stayed for three days and we loved every minute of it. Between being able to swim whenever we wanted, to just chilling out watching a movie, or hanging out by the fire pit, each moment was extra special.
Chantale is a wonderful host who maintains very good communication and is always available when needed but is also very mindful of your space and privacy and reason for being there. From greeting us when we arrived, to the personal welcome board with our names on it, to the step by step instructions on how to care for the pool was above and beyond expectation. Chantale's personable and pleasant nature also made for good conversation.
We found her instructions clear and concise and easy to follow. We now know why she is able to keep her property in such great condition! The care with which she maintains it through all the most up-to-date technology is truly amazing! lt really blew our minds!
My husband, who is not such a fan of Air bnb's, really loved Chantale's place and still talks about all the time since we left telling all of our friends and family about how cool it is and recommending they check it out! We definitely see now why this place is ALWAYS booked and why the reviews are so wonderful!
We are looking forward to finding another opening in the late fall when we can make our way back!
You're the best Chantale! And we are looking forward to staying at your pool house again and again!! That's a promise!! :-)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First off the pool house is wonderfull. Its a perfect place to take some time off and relax. Chantale keeps the place very neat and clean. Everything was Perfect. Exactly what my girlfriend and i needed, from a break from work. I would definitely recommend if you get a chance to visit go. You will not regret it!! Hope to be back soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate on this one, book it if you can. A modernized poolhouse in the woods with a full kitchen, living space, bathroom, and plenty of sleeping arrangements, how can you go wrong? You can play your favorite tunes while you swim, or watch a movie while you soak. Rain or shine, you will have a good time. Chantale is a fantastic host as well, she was very responsive and was kind enough to even bake us some brownies, which were delicious! And if you like furry friends, there are two loveable dogs that Chantale allows to hang out with you if you want some puppy love. By far my favorite stay I've been to. Thank you Chantale!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our visit to the Pool House was incredible. We surprised our 5 year old with this trip, and she was so stoked to be staying in ""a Lincoln Log home with a pool"". We relaxed for 3 solid days and spent hours on end in the pool. Beautiful space- very clean, extremely comfortable beds, sweet outdoor space for a fire and for dining too. We also got out for a few short runs while there; and especially liked the Willie Wildlife Marsh trail, just down the road.
Chantale went above and beyond to be responsive throughout our stay. She was also very compassionate and understanding when we had a potential snag in our plans prior to our arrival. She is an amazing host who really cares about her guests. We look forward to returning in the future."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was an absolutely perfect get away, truly a little piece of heaven. Everything about this place superseded our expectations, most of all Chantale. She was incredibly gracious and warm-hearted. I think she has thought of every possible detail to make the pool house beautiful and relaxing. If ever there were perfect accommodations, the pool house is it."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean place with everything you need for a weekend r&r. Chantale is the best host that goes above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and so helpful with everything we’d needed information with. 😊 the floaters in the pool allowed us to stay there until we pruned!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We can't say enough good things about this beautiful place and about our most gracious host. So relaxing and peaceful. Just what we needed. Chantale went above and beyond to make us feel at home and to ensure we had the most pleasant stay. Our family is looking forward to our next visit.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing place to connect as a family! Peaceful, no distractions, and a pool house full of activities for a family to enjoy together!
The pool house and its amenities are top notch! Everything you need for a fun filled or romantic vacation is there! Washer/dryer, an amazing shower head system with multiple sprayers, a grill, a bon fire ring for the burning season(begins mid May), a completely stocked kitchen with all the appliances, dishes, flatware etc that you'll need. A true home away from home!
Lastly, Chantelle went above beyond her role as a host as we had an issue with our vehicle battery and she not only had a great company to refer us to, but also took us there and back! This gracious act took so much of the stress out of having vehicle issues while traveling away for us, you're an angel. It poured buckets while we were packing up to leave so unfortunately that delayed our check out, a huge thank you to you both for your understanding!
This is definitely a place we'd travel to again, and you should visit as well! You won't regret it!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My grandchildren will remember this vacation forever! They loved the pool house. Great communication! Chantale welcomed us and even made us a cake.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale is wonderful, her pool house is simply amazing. We just visited for the second time and are already looking forward to next year's trip."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy pool house is very nice – secluded and yet still close enough to nearby cities. Chantale was an awesome host, she greeted us upon arrival and then demonstrated how to open/close the pool, explained the house rules, and answered all our questions. Chantale was wonderful to communicate with throughout our stay and was very accommodating. Her two well-behaved dogs (Bronx and Bellmont) added to our visit when we invited them into the pool house to play.
The beds and pillows were comfortable and located in the charming loft - which you climb a spiral staircase to enter. the pool house kitchen is very well furnished (dishes, cups, pots, pans, air fryer, microwave, Keurig).
There are multiple streaming channels (and strong Wi-Fi) to enjoy movies while swimming or sitting on the soft couch to watch them. There are also plenty of family games - we learned Backgammon and Cribbage while there.
The pool water was perfect, and we enjoyed the pool volleyball. Opening and closing the pool was a breeze so we were in and out of the pool multiple times each day.
We visited at the end of March so the ground was wet and muddy and was pretty cold outside, so we didn’t do any hiking or exploring around the area much, had a very relaxing break, and went out to a different local diner each day for one meal.
Highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys swimming and wants a quiet getaway."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, we really didn't think it was possible to have a better time after our first trip to the pool house but we were happy to find we were wrong, haha! The pool house speaks for itself, it's a giant indoor heated pool that's private and nestled in the Adirondacks- what more could you want?! To top it off Chantale is hands down the best host we have ever had, and we travel regularly so there's a solid basis for comparison! She's truly unparalleled. She goes above and beyond to prioritize your comfort and is just the most genuinely amazing human. The pool house is stocked with everything you could need, including through the kitchen, and if you ever find you need something she is more than accommodating! Everything is so cozy and so clean too!! The location is amazing as well, it's very private but not far to drive to shops, restaurants, and amazing hikes! The bed is incredibly comfortable, the shower has great water pressure (and multiple settings!!), there is a great washer/dryer for use... I could go on forever. You'll see that openings are hard to find and there is certainly a reason for that- this is a stay like no other and no words can really outline what the experience is truly like. I think we will be lifers on the ""cancellation list"" because life doesn't get much better than staying at Chantale's Pool House 🙌🏻"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale is the best host! We had an incredible stay at the pool house. Our family could not have been happier- it was the perfect weekend getaway. Magical to swim in a heated pool with snow falling outside! This is a very unique and special place- go! You will have a great time :) Thanks Chantale!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first trip to the pool house, but based on reviews and our friends' experience we had already booked a second trip for the fall. And now we've booked a third for 2023 (because let's get real... you have to think WAAAAAY ahead if you want to stay here!). Truly amazing how clean this property is and how well-maintained. Easy to cook and use the kitchen, nice bathroom with use of washer/dryer, rules are easy to follow. Chantale so easy to contact, helpful, hospitable, and generous. Love the dogs, property really is so close to everything but feels very private. Already looking forward to our future visits!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay with Chantale and we're so happy that we came back! She is a lovely host and has crafted a beautiful pool house with gorgeous rustic woodwork that provides a warm, welcoming atmosphere which feels like home away from home. It is a great privilege to be able to enjoy the attention and care she has put into the premises as seen with the many renovations and upgrades to the property since our last stay. My partner and I have shared wonderful memories staying with Chantale and we look forward to being able to share many more in the future! Five star experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a fun destination - a pool literally steps from where you sleep. You're minutes from the Adirondacks. Chantelle was a great host and made everything easy. Highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great communication
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 6th visit in the past 10 months to the pool house. There needs to be another category beyond super host to describe Chantale. She goes above and beyond to make our stay a special one. The pool house’s location provides numerous opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities. all year round. This trip we were focused on snowshoeing. We highly recommend Natural Stone Bridge and Caves Park in Pottersville. It’s a bit of a trek but we’ll worth it. Whether enjoying the outdoors or never leaving the pool house, this is a one of a kind Airbnb experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite place to stay!
Easy day trips to Lake George, Saratoga Springs, Woodstock, Southern Vermont and more. Great for anyone that loves the outdoors"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked the pool house a year in advance to give us something to look forward to after the holidays. We didn’t tell our kids where we were going so they were completely amazed when we walked in. Chantale greeted us upon arrival and went over everything we would need to know for our stay. She also texted with recommendations of things to do and to make sure everything was going okay. The entire pool house was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The pool tired our kids out so they slept extra well while we were there. I highly recommend booking a stay here at any time of year, but doing so during a snow storm, while the kids had cabin fever, made it extra fun! Thanks again, we can’t wait to come back! :)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at the pool house- an incredibly relaxing time in a perfect setting!
Chantale and Toni are fantastic hosts! We can't recommend this AirBnB enough!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our fifth visit to the pool house in the past 9 months and we are planning to come back for a sixth visit this weekend.
Every visit Chantal has added something new to this 5 star property…new couch, new bed, new kitchen table, new towels and more. A new washer/dryer is expected before our next visit.
The pool house is a magical and very special property. Toni and Chantal are stellar hosts and will make your stay a memorable one."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chantale's pool house is always a magical experience that is unlike any AirBnb I've ever been to!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent a lovely long weekend with our family at Chantale’s pool house. Chantale is a really thoughtful and kind host, who even brought the kids surprise pastries one morning! The house is spotless, well equipped and obviously the kids couldn’t have imagined a better set up, 94 degree pool & movies you can watch while you swim!? Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing! kids had so much fun! Such a beautiful experience.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had another amazing stay at Chantale's. We absolutely love it there. It's no wonder that the pool house was listed by Architectural Digest as #6 in its article, ""8 of the Best Airbnb Properties With Indoor Pools"" (12/28/21). Thank you for the cannolis, present and making our holidays magical. We are already counting the days to our next stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our vacation at Chantale’s gorgeous place. It was so relaxing and peaceful. Our children really enjoyed the perfect- temperatured pool. Thank you for being a great host!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our fourth stay this year at this one of a kind property. We are confirmed to return in January and February. This has become our home away from home and we hope to keep returning. Chantale and Toni are in a category of their own.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a truly beautiful stay and Chantel was an amazing host. The pool was absolutely perfect and the place was spotless. We have stayed at a few vacation rentals and this was by far the best. What can be better than watching the snow fall outside while you are enjoying a 93 degree pool with family, sipping wine and watching Christmas movies. If you are lucky enough to find an opening here don’t think twice!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"THESE ARE THE BEST HOSTS I'VE HAD IN AN AIRBNB EXPERIENCE. On our first night we had some car trouble and they were so awesome to find us some help so we could get to the pool house. Once we got settled in, Chantale went thru the rules for the pool & the fans and they really aren't hard to follow. Pool temp was perfect and we really enjoyed the water. The shower with all the different settings was awesome. The bed was super comfortable, we slept like babies. This was a perfect getaway my wife & I needed in the middle of a very busy time in our lives. We would absolutely stay with Chantale again in the future & would recommend others to do so as well."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the pool house and boy did it deliver. Simply put, this is a one of kind, incredibly special place that we are so incredibly thankful to be able to experience and enjoy. Chantale is an amazing host (I don't think you could find one better). She genuinely cares about you and your stay and goes above and beyond to make sure your time at her place is nothing short of amazing. The pool house is beautiful and has everything you could possibly need to unwind, relax and recharge. We love that this has become a birthday tradition for our daughter and cherish the memories we make year after year. Already looking forward to our next stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time, pool was great! Very cool, the kids loved it. Hope to go back there one day! Not too far from services, nice friendly town. Want to go back already!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect a wonderful experience. Over and beyond anything you are hoping for!!!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another perfect stay in a most magical place! Everything about our stay was wonderful and our every need was anticipated. Chantale is an incredible host who makes you feel at home from before you even arrive. We hated to leave and can't wait to come back! THANK YOU, CHANTALE!!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale goes above and beyond, she is truly an amazing host! It is a wonderful place for a weekend get away and time to just focus on family! We had so much fun relaxing and playing in the pool!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chantale's place definitely exceeds all expectations - the indoor heated pool is an oasis away from the stress and worries of the daily hustle and bustle. We booked this place earlier in the year and finally got to stay in November - and it was WELL worth the wait. This is definitely the most unique place I've stayed at through Airbnb. This is exactly what anyone would be looking for - a unique space that the host put together carefully with the intention of making your stay the best possible. Chantale was an amazing super host - she met us at check-in, rules were explained in the beginning and rulebooks were available for reference, and everything we needed was readily available - PLENTY of pool towels, fully-stocked kitchen supplies for home-cooked meals, and a rain-shower after a long day in the pool. Chantale was such a gracious host, even giving us a bottle of wine from her inventory on the day we left. We cannot wait to return soon!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale's Pool House is an absolute treasure. We were impressed from the moment we pulled up to the house. The house is comfortable, beautiful and sparkling clean. The pool is crystal clear and the perfect temperature. Chantale is the ultimate host, and thought of absolutely everything and then some. She went above and beyond to make our stay amazing, even leaving us cupcakes to help us celebrate a birthday. We will be back for sure."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"According to my kids: ""the best place ever"". Lots of thoughtful touches. The volleyball net in the pool was a huge hit."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW!!!! Chantale's pool house was an incredible place to stay. The pool was so relaxing. Watching movies or listening to music while floating was so fun. There were board games and a wonderful outdoor space for when you want a break from the pool.
Chantale communicated with us to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. She was fun and an amazing host! We can't wait to return for another stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chantale is the perfect hostess. The pool house is one of our favorite places! This was our 3rd stay and we will absolutely be coming back! Chantale goes above and beyond to make every stay a magical one. This place has it all! Book a stay- you won’t regret it. She even decorates for the holidays and leaves you special treats to enjoy!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our third visit to Chantal’s awesome pool house. We are scheduled to come back for two more visits and hopefully many more times as dates become available. Chantal is an amazing host. She is always thinking of ways to make her guests comfortable and feel at home. We have stayed at many rental properties and this ranks at the very top.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ideally located in a bucolic setting this property invokes a sense of utmost peace, blessed isolation and unending tranquility, and yet, it's not too far from convenience; only 10-15 minutes from local mom and pop and your typical big box stores.
The poolhouse was immaculately clean and quiet, though with acoustics to rival the world's best concert halls and a sound system emitting soul stirring frequencies I was duely encouraged to disturb the peace and fill the space with my spotify playlists, singing and dancing along to my favorite songs.
Even though the warmth of the pool kept me lazily idle when I should have been out cycling on the Rail and Cool River trails  just 10 minutes in either direction beyond the end of Old Peck Hill Road, I did manage to get a few laps in when I was not planted on the steps treating the pool as a giant hottub.
I spent 6 amazing days on the property and needless to say my stay was one of my most relaxing and rejuvenating.
Chantale was ever the accommodating and kind host. She ranks at the top of my list for Airbnb's most gracious, warm and welcoming hosts. Airbnb should definitely make Chantale teach master classes on being the consumate host. I will certainly return to the poolhouse as often as time permits."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time. Had to make some last minute changes and chantale was extremely helpful and understanding! Super unique place
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at this fabulous home. Everything was really perfect - very clean and well kept. Really enjoyed the private swimming pool and the host even brought us donuts one day!! Can’t wait to stay again soon.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place... what a treasure. Chantale is constantly improving this space making it better and better each time. Each time we stay, she has upgraded something outside or inside the pool house making our stay even better than the last. She puts a lot of time and energy into making sure her property is perfect and it really shows. A private indoor pool, a porch with views, a grill, and a fire pit, a loft with a spiral staircase, a spa-like shower, a great entertainment and sound system... this absolutely is the epitome of ""the perfect airbnb."" Our family loves Chantale and her pool house!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,EVERYTHING was absolutely amazing! We loved it so much I booked for next year. This was a perfect little family getaway. Chantal’s was an awesome host. She was there when needed but also gave us our space. She went above and beyond as a host.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had been looking forward to our stay at Chantale’s pool house for quite some time. This retreat did not disappoint! From the moment we pulled onto the property to the time it came for us to say goodbye the house, the pool, the amenities and the added touches throughout exceeded expectations. What put everything over the top was the kindness and communication of the host.
This is t your typical Airbnb. It’s a retreat to let the stress and worries of the hustle and bustle of everyday life just disappear. Chantale and her grounds crew Belmont and Bronx made us feel welcomed appreciated and like family.
We can’t wait to visit again next fall and also next winter.
Chantale - Penelope asks to see Bronx daily and asks when can we go back to Chantale’s pool house?! Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're wondering if this listing can possibly be as amazing as it seems- it really, REALLY is! This is your sign to do it!! Chantale is the sweetest soul, she's just so kind and caring and helpful from the moment you book and through your whole stay! We're so thankful to have met her!! (and her adorable dogs!) The pool house is a DREAM!! You can spend your days playing volleyball in the pool or relaxing while you float around and watch movies- or if you like being out you can try the best foods and see gorgeous sights while hiking the areas trails and mountains! Chantale's recommendations never disappoint! The whole place is so clean and well stocked with everything you could possibly need and she's always putting your comfort first! The location is perfect, there's nothing quite like the peace of being out in the woods mixed with the convenience of being a short drive from anything you could want to do or see! We hadn't even checked out and were already talking about when we can book our next visit! We spend our time traveling the country and can confidently say you will absolutely not find any other stay like this!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chantale is absolutely amazing! Super attentive and dedicated to this lovely property. We had an amazing stay. Very relaxing and cozy. Immediately comfortable walking in. Very Clean. I would absolutely visit again and would recommend to all ages! Thank you Chantale!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place. Definitely going back. Chantale was a great and friendly host with the best hospitality possible.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is place a must stay! We had the best time ! I cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience, we didn’t want to leave! We found our new vacation spot !"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a GEM! We loved this beautiful home that was opened to us so generously. It felt like I was given instructions on how to live in my forever home. Chantale and Toni were both amazing hosts who went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and attended to. The joy of waking up in the middle of an apple orchard with the fog laying low above the trees and the crickets chirping, enjoying my hot cup of coffee while I sit on the deck and breath the crisp September air, all before quietly wading into the luxuriously warm pool to start my day. I can't say enough good things about this whole experience. Book it now! Thank me later 🙃"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly magical. The location is wonderful, far enough away from things that you feel secluded, yet close enough to hop in the car and quickly pick up food. The building and pool were extremely clean and well maintained. Chantale was a lovely, caring host who both made us feel welcome and able to reach out if we needed anything, and allowed us our privacy. My kids are in love and can't stop talking about how amazing it was. It was so fantastic we didn't leave except to get dinner to bring back. The only problem was that I didn't book us a longer trip! We will definitely be back and are so looking forward to it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the pool house was absolutely fantastic! This is our 2nd time staying with Chantale and it never disappoints! The pool house is a one of a kind stay and our kids asked us when we could come back as soon. as we were pulling away. Chantale even dropped off some fresh local corn for our family and sent us off with some fresh baked brownies. She is a phenomenal host and the pool house is immaculate. So clean, well appointed, and everything you need for your stay. Don't wait - book this spot ASAP!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"1) Entire Pool house spotlessly clean including pool
2) Generosity of hosts who respected our privacy and were always available to help
3) Pool large enough to swim short laps, 6 strokes corner to corner
4) Feeling of complete safety and freedom-no locked doors or windows
5) Easy food shopping at Hannaford Food Market 10 mins away
6) Enjoyed hike in Willie Wildlife Marsh
7) Toni, (Chantale was on vacation) provided pleasant surprises throughout our 9 day
visit
8) Very nice ice cream parlor nearby"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our FOURTH time back and each time is better than the last. Dino, who is 5, thinks Chantale and Toni are family and wakes up in the morning saying things like, ""Mama, I miss the puppies"" and ""Probably we should go to the pool house instead of school today, right?"" We can't wait to go back again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a true gem in the Adirondacks. It is quiet, peaceful, and sooo much fun to have an indoor pool to use as you please. Swim at 2am if you want! As a first time Airbnb user, the process was so simple with such a wonderful host that took the time to assist. Don’t pass this one up, BOOK it."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pool house was very clean and kept very cool during the summer heat. The pool is fun and private and stocked with inflatables. I would definitely recommend this stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pool house was an amazing experience. Firstly , the house is surrounded by the most beautiful foliage and a private apple orchard awaits just steps off the porch. The wrap- around porch is exquisite and perfect for dinner or watching sunset. Then you enter the house and the pool is there ! Sparking clean , huge , with windows / patio doors surrounding to let in the days sunlight. The kitchen is fully stocked - a big container of ice was ready in the freezer for cold drinks for us. The loft sleeping area is comfortable and fun. The home is equipped with pool toys and floating devices and Chantale was generous enough to give us comfortable and safe life vests for our children. The home also has really family friendly touches - like the addition of a safety gate at the loft area , a kiddie size toilet seat attachment in the bathroom and a kiddie size floating tube. This home is a real treat - and I now understand why it is so difficult to find a reservation spot for many months. Chantale was amazing with communication starting from when I was trying to reserve, to which she was so accommodating, to our checkout time. She was always always available to answer questions and help if we needed her. We can not wait to return again and experience the pool house !"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chantale and Toni were consummate hosts and made us feel so welcome. The pool house is the coolest AirBnB experience we have had yet. My kids swam 8-10 hours a day and ended the weekend mercifully exhausted. The pool is really easy to open and close - my 8 year old and I managed it every day without issue. There were plenty of pool towels and kitchen amenities as needed. It rained basically nonstop for the three nights that we stayed, but with an indoor (heated!) pool - who cares? The sleeping loft was super comfy and I was thankful they provided a baby gate so I didn't have to sleep with one eye open worrying about my three year old tumbling down the stairs. We hope to be back - it was a delight."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a paradise all in one.
Everything was perfect from the time we showed up until the time we left.... I didn't want to leave, wish we could have stayed forever.... The pool house is very clean and cozy. The pool water is the perfect temperature & the scenery is absolutely beautiful. I loved how there was fresh pick flowers waiting for us in a few different spots & the entertainment of a big screen TV with perfect clear surround sound and you can turn the tv which ever direction you like whether your in the pool or on the couch, plus there is a sound bar to play music as well.. It was such a magical feeling to have an intire house with a heated pool all to ourselves. also there is a grill on a huge wrap around deck that goes pretty much around the whole house... (I love grilling🍔🍗🍡.) to top Everything off we had to leave our fur baby at home with family however there are 2 beautiful and friendly dogs🐺 Belmont🥰 & Bronx🥰 that had blessed us with their presence and made it a little easier to be separate from our own fur baby💖
The property is so peaceful and amazing with the sounds of nature (different bird chirping) all around outside and some deer sightings it was such a great experience.
Chantale & Toni are wonderful friendly people with great communication and very helpful with information if you need them or anything. (we needed help to start the fire pit a few nights on our stay. we roasted Marshmallows and made some samores. 😋 yummy) Both of them was so attentive to anything we may have needed or asked for & all at the same time they gave us complete privacy and was really respectful. I enjoyed talking with both of them and we will miss them all until we come back again & again 😁 we had the best time and I can't wait to go back...
Thanks Chantale,Toni, Bronx & Belmont ❣we appreciate y'all ❤"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the experience I was looking for……and more. We hope to be able to come back again soon.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another absolutely perfect weekend at Chantale’s. We celebrated the Fourth of July by blissfully floating in the pool, barbecuing, star-gazing, and just relaxing and enjoying ourselves immensely. We love the pool house so much that we planned our third trip from the pool before reluctantly heading home and back to reality. Chantale is absolutely delightful and clearly loves making people feel at home in her space. I can’t recommend staying here enough!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Simply awesome! Pool is Genuinely HEATED and place is clean and charming! The grounds are well kept and tailored for a wonderful stay!Chantale is a great host! We would return in a heartbeat! 😁
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second trip back to Chantale’s and I know it won’t be our last! Such an amazing place to stay! :) go ahead and book ! You won’t be disappointed! She goes above and beyond!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second visit to the pool house and it was another amazing experience.
The only thing better than the house itself are hosts Chantale and Toni.
We brought our 14 year old son with us this time and he had the time of his life. He wanted to sleep in his tent under the stars and Chantale made it magical asking him if he wanted to setup camp in the apple orchard.
The pool was perfect again. Temperature was spot on and the water is crystal clear.
House is as clean as can be, and comfortable during our hot weekend.
We can't wait to return. As this will be a little family tradition year in and out.
If you get the opportunity to experience the pool house, jump on it!!
Thanks again, Chantale and Toni. You're the best!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful space! The pool was amazing, it came with pool toys, and the water did not smell of chlorine or sting my eyes/nose like traditional pools. The temperature was always perfect. The kitchen was great, we made every meal of our 4 day stay there. Chantale was an amazing host and responded quickly to texts. We had to be mindful of helping to maintaining the space (pool and fans) but it was a miniscule price to pay for a private pool open 24/7. We were visited by the dogs, Belmont and Bronx, who were soooo sweet. Chantale even gave us gifts for my boyfriend's birthday. I hope we will get the chance to stay here again, I only managed to snag a reservation by wild coincidence. If you see an opening, you should definitely make that reservation!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had. Chantale is amazing she knows how to be helpful while also giving you privacy. The place is beautiful so clean and beautiful views around. Her dogs are amazing i am in love with them! If you have the chance to go you should you will not be disappointed everything was perfect 10/10 ! We not only loved our host but ended up making a friend, she is caring and super friendly. This was an amazing experience and i will be returning many times if possible !"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely one of our favorite Airbnb getaways. Chantale is an amazing host & goes above and beyond in every way.
Must sees: rail trail for biking, lots of hiking and lake sports"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"eat pool sleep repeat
was an awesome experience we would go back anytime"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a perfect getaway. The host always makes sure your needs are met. Whatever they may be. Perfect little getaway and we for sure will plan a return visit.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our second time back and it was just as amazing as the first! This place is always immaculate and Chantale is the BEST host!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying here was a wonderful experience. Chantelle was so attentive to all of our needs during our stay. I have already recommended this property to all of me family and friends!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the time we arrived, Chantale was nothing but amazing! She was so nice and always available for any questions that we had! The place was spotless and the pool was so warm! We also took her advice and ate at the nearest ice cream spot and lakeside restaurant which were so yummy! Our son had a blast and we can’t wait to go back ! Very much needed after being stuck at home for soo long! Stay here :) you won’t regret it !"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have been to many Airbnb and even own one myself. I have never felt so welcomed and had so much consideration for me and my family’s needs. The owners were polite and thoughtful about every detail to make sure our stay was enjoyable and stress free. The place was so clean and fresh we couldn’t help feel like it was a sanctuary. I recommend this place to anyone. We have already been trying to rebook another stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are lucky enough to book Chantale’s amazing Airbnb, congratulations! You are in for an unforgettable experience. I use the word “experience,” because that is truly what a stay at Chantale’s is. From the moment our booking went through until the moment we (sadly) pulled away from the property, every moment of the experience was beyond compare. Chantale is a legendary host. One who provides friendly, thoughtful, and exceptional communication, and who went out of her way to make our trip as perfect as possible. Once we arrived, she provided us with complete privacy, yet was always available if assistance was needed. The house was sparkling clean, and her instructions on pool maintenance were reasonable and simple to follow. The water, like the house, was immaculately clean and soothingly warm. It’s not every day you get to watch a movie while floating in a pool, but thanks to the adjustable TV and surround sound, that’s exactly what we did. There are plenty of food options nearby, and though the rain kept us from exploring the surrounding area, it afforded us an excuse to lounge in the water all day. This was the exact vacation our family needed after being mostly homebound since the pandemic began, and instantly became one of the most unique stays we have ever (or will ever) have. Obviously, my family and I could not recommend this Airbnb enough, and if you are fortunate enough to be able to stay, I’m certain you’ll feel the same."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chantale’s pool house is magical. She has lovingly built this truly unique property with her own hands. My husband and I kept pinching ourselves, feeling we were in a dream. Chantale provides everything guests could want or need to fully enjoy the experience. The property is located within easy access to every type of outdoor activity. We were ready to book again as soon as we arrived. Unfortunately, the property is so outstanding that it is booked out into 2022!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love the place. The host was top-notch. The kids love the pool. It was a nice little get away for the family.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at the pool house!!! The rental was immaculate and so perfectly designed. The pool was warm and we swam for hours at time while watching Netflix. There are several lower ADK hikes that are nearby. Planned on coming back next year!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I don't know how she does it but our stay this time was even better than the first. My 6-year old absolutely loves Chantale's. She even wrote a 5-star review of our stay for her school assignment. Thanks for everything! We can't wait to be back.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second stay for my husband and I. Once again an amazing time. Can't wait to do it again!!! Totally what you need when you just need a few days off to breathe. There's a reason it's booked out for a million years.... Seamless check-in, quick instructions, total privacy."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Chantale was extremely hospitable host and we appreciated the special touches she provided. Already looking forward to planning a future visit.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a true gem! It is one of the cleanest we have ever stayed in. Chantale is a wonderful host! She is friendly, knowledgeable, courteous, and willing to do whatever she can to make your stay perfect. It is obvious that she cares about her property and her guests! We hope to stay again sometime."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a fabulous time! Can’t wait to return.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an outstanding stay!!! This place is amazing. Our whole family was able to relax and enjoy ourselves at Chantale’s pool house. The beds were comfortable, the place was spotless, and there was everything you needed for a great stay. Pots, pans, utensils, and pool-safe dinnerware are all there for your “stay at home” needs. It was just awesome hanging out by the pool and relaxing.
Aside from the place itself, Chantale is an amazing host. Prior to our stay she reached out to make sure that we had all of our questions answered. When we arrived she was right there to welcome us and guide us through the pool house rules. Anytime we had a question it was answered within minutes. Simply stated, she’s a great host!!
We can’t wait to come back for for another great stay...but next time we’re staying longer!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun little getaway. Our kids had a blast swimming all day every day. Perfect way to start this cold and rainy spring break.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just lovely - three days of swimming, relaxing, and discovering the (ridiculous) joy of watching a movie while floating in a pool. I'm not sure we'll ever find another trip my eight year old enjoys more than this one."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Firefly lodge was absolutely magical! We spent the weekend fishing, kayaking, hiking and relaxing by the fire. The space was cozy and inviting and the lake was breathtaking! The nearby hikes were also incredible. Overall a wonderful way to start the summer! Thank you so much Linda and Steve."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is just a magical place! Opening your backdoor and taking a few steps down to the water looking out on the beautiful fall colors and filling your lungs with that fresh Adirondack air is rejuvenating. A kayak ride with the loons makes you hungry for a breakfast eaten on the dock. The cabin, especially with the taxidermy animals, gives an Adirondack Wilderness feel while having the comforts of home. Ending your nights overlooking the lake in front of your fire pit while looking up at an explosion of stars in the night sky is perfect."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful lakefront private location with a nice yard; and with having the use of kayaks and a canoe just steps from the front door it was wonderful for my daughter and I and our dog. The deck and dock on the crystal clear lake was really enjoyed. Linda and Steve were wonderful hosts located nearby and they were readily available if needed.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Firefly was such a pleasure to rent! We spent the majority of our time on the fantastic deck, which is right on the lake, watching the ducks, fish jumping, loon fishing, & a hawk and eagle flying overhead. Even spotted a beaver our last evening! We enjoyed exploring the lake with the canoe & kayaks which were easy to launch with a gradual stone walk in. We spent our evenings around the huge firepit making s'mores and looking at all the stars. The cabin has been nicely updated while keeping its Adirondack camp charm. (anyone opposed to taxidermy take note). Be sure to explore all the artwork and collections all over the cabin! Discovering new things as our time went on was one of my favorite parts of our 5 days. The kitchen had everthing we needed and more. Linda and Steve were wonderful, responsive hosts even going out of their way to deliver a lighter when we couldn't locate something to start a fire. Would definitely recommend this gem to our family and friends. Truly the on"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Firefly Cottage was the perfect family gathering location . Beautiful, on a private lake where neighbors are friendly and the fish are biting. We kayaked and canoed with the grand kiddo and fished thoughout the day and night. The high speed internet allowed our daughter in law to work at home. Gloversville is convenient for shopping, groceries and fishing bait! Linda and Steve are wonderful hosts and would highly recommend Firefly Cottage for your next gathering."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home on a peaceful, beautiful Lake! My family had a wonderful time fishing and kayaking when the weather permitted. When the weather wasn't so friendly we enjoyed our time hanging out in the Cabin playing games. Linda was great, she was quick in responding to any questions asked. We hope to return again next year!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Lovely dock.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Firefly Lodge is a great property on a beautiful lake. We enjoyed the easy access to the lake steps from the house, the fishing and swimming all available directly from the property. There were great outdoor amenities as described including kayaks, two well situated tables/seating and a fantastic firepit. Linda is very communicative and responsive. Both she and Steve take pride in their place."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location right on peaceful lake
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"It was a wonderful week and we had great weather. The house is super fun and the kayaking and walking are both beautiful and peaceful.
My only criticism for the whole experience was that coming from Colorado made it more complicated to bring linens and towels.
Would otherwise say the visit was flawless."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a beautiful week the camp had cathedral cealings which make rainy days zen like as you lounge in the unbelievable comfy bed in the master suite. The lake is small and magical , still and calm. Wonderful time fire pit by the lake is epic. Loved every second."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our family and our dog had a great time at Linda’s place! It was so convenient to have use of the kayaks and canoe. The lake is a very good fishing spot - my sons caught and released many fish - and there was an abundance of other wildlife. The lake is so peaceful and her home is in a great spot. Linda’s home is very comfortable and has everything you need. The bathrooms were sparkling clean! Linda was easy to communicate with, and showed great kindness to our family pet and we will be forever grateful."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Linda and Steve were just amazing hosts. The place was super clean, and really wonderful. The cabin feels like a museum and I can only imagine how excited kids would be staying in a place like this. The lake is just beautiful and clean. We kayaked and swam every day. There are multiple kayaks to use which was so great. The area is also super secluded and private. On top of it all, Linda and Steve were just amazing. They were flexible with check-in and check-out, and checked in on us through the app to see if we needed anything. They really made us feel at home! I highly recommend this spot if you want to relax and enjoy nature from the comfort of a beautiful cabin!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Linda’s place was beautiful with a private deck and great view. My friend’s and mostly importantly my pup had a great time sunbathing and chilling on the deck. Linda was very responsive with the questions I had and very accommodating when we requested a late check out. The night sky was gorgeous and star studded. Highly recommend Linda’s place.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful location. friendly and accommodating host
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Linda was great host.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Unbeatable location and view, with the beautiful lake right out back. Very charming art-deco cabin with tons of privacy. Linda was very communicative and helpful. I will be back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second stay at Mountain Lake. Originally we stayed at one of Linda's other properties. This was yet again another beautifully maintained home. The views on the lake are great. House is quite spacious inside as well. Would definitely recommend this property to others who are looking for a getaway at a beautiful house on a fantastic lake.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great space, Great Hosts - super friendly and helping! The house is right on the lake with super clean water - it was honestly a wonderful experience. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Setting was perfect – quiet, clear lake great for swimming and kayaking.
The house had all the charm of a vintage, rustic Adirondack lake cabin [beadboard paneling, original doors and hardware] with a little whimsy [sunglasses on the deer head mounted near the stairs] and touch of HGTV style [downstairs bathroom is downright elegant and the upstairs bathroom is very nice as well]. It is clear that the house has been totally renovated/updated without sacrificing the original character.
The host was great. All instructions were clear and communication leading up to and during our stay was great - very quick and responsive. For example, when we needed an additional life jacket, it was delivered right away – along with a treat for our dog.
All in all, a great place to unplug, relax and rejuvenate."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, good host, good times!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Firefly Lodge is a beautiful house in a wonderful setting. The house is modern, but you can feel its old bones that have been restored. The property is well located, with a pizza place 5 minutes away, Stewarts (for delicious ice cream!) 7 minutes, and Hannaford (groceries) about 10 minutes. We were also able to enjoy many hikes in the area. Most of all, we enjoyed the lake. It is clean, calm, and clear. We were able to fish, to swim, and to see nature. We even spotted a bald eagle flying over the lake several times. Linda does a great job making sure the house is set up perfectly for a relaxing vacation."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The lake house is perfect for a get away week. The lake is small and perfect for kayaking, paddle boarding, and floating. We also used a tent in the yard for the camp our experience. Linda was an excellent communicator and answered all our needs. The property was exactly and described. Great place for a camp fire and star gazing."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A delightful house, a delightful lake, delightful hosts. We spent a wonderful two weeks at Steve and Linda's cottage on the lake. Spending early morning having coffee in the sun room, or at the table on the pier was a pleasant way to great the day started. Linda decorated the house. Very nice, and you can see the person in the decorations. She did a great job. There is a claw foot soaking tub in the downstairs bathroom. A very large ceramic tile shower on the second floor. The kitchen is well supplied with pots and pans, cooking utensils, a very cool microwave, and something many Airb&Bs don't have, knives that are sharp. The gas grill is hot enough to sear a steak, and grill salmon. There is a canoe and two kayaks . There is a path along much of the lake. The neighbors we met a friendly. You can see fish break the surface of the lake. Birds sing.. In the evening you can hear the haunting song of an owl or perhaps it was a loon The are is chock full of hiking trails"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Firefly is a gem of a cabin on a lovely little lake!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful experience all around! We were a very happy family of four, and Linda was a fabulous host! Cant wait to return🌞🌞"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place right on the lake. Linda was extremely helpful and so fast to get back to us with any questions. Perfect spot for a quiet get-away!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Linda's place is located right on the lake with a private dock with kayaks available, which is great thing to watch a gorgeous sunset on the lake. The house is rustic by design, but has everything you need. It's pretty quiet with neighbours pretty far away. Linda is very helpful super quick to communicate. I will definitely recommend her place for a week of getaway from citys hustle."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,We were switched to their larger pllake house due to issues with the town on the other property. Even with switching days (Sun to Sun from Sat to Sat) it was a great experience. The late and property were great and we had access to both properties boats. Great privacy and communication. loved the trip and appreciated the accommodation to the nicer place. Two thumbs up.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved our stay on Mountain lake in Linda and Steve’s cottage. We ended up staying in their Dragonfly cottage, as opposed to Firefly, but both locations were lovely! The lake is a perfect size, nice and quiet, and tons of great fishing! Firefly cottage has a great dock, fire pit and patio, and the location of the cottage is almost on a little peninsula or corner in shoreline which makes it a unique spot. Dragonfly had an amazing hot tub and two docks. Both cottages would have been perfect for my family of 4- comfortable and roomy. Linda and Steve were lovely hosts and very quick to respond to any of our questions or needs. We would definitely stay at either of their cottages again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although our trip may not have been what we expected in the beginning due to a couple hiccups, the owners were very kind and extremely attentive! The home was lovely and the area was beautiful! We had awesome weather and enjoyed our stay! We will be sure to return next year!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place. Quiet lake with fun at the doorstep. Perfect get away for a retreat.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely a get away from the daily grind. We enjoyed the lake house, water, fishing and boating. The serenity of the small lake was relaxing, I had no problem letting my kids take the boats out on their own.
Steve and Linda were great hosts and quick to respond with answers to my questions."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mountain Lake was such a wonderful place to stay! There’s plenty of room for guests to sleep. We really enjoyed the outdoor space, especially the dock. It was a secluded and relaxing vacation!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This Adirondack lodge/house/ cabin is perfectly situated on Mountain Lake. While decorated like a Adirondack cabin, it has some special eclectic touches. It's very comfortable to lounge around inside or sit on the deck by the water. Maybe it was the time we were there but we saw very few bugs.
Linda was very conscientious about making sure all was well. Any questions I had were responded to very quickly.
There's a big fire pit that was great for the family and making s'mores!
What would I do next time? Although there is a canoe and a paddle boat I'd try to bring a couple of kayaks."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at the Firefly Lodge, and it was the perfect location right on the lake. We loved spending time on the dock and using the boats on the lake. The house was comfortable and the wifi was good, and we were able to use it to work from there. Linda was a great host and very responsive to our questions."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"My partner and I stayed at this Airbnb with our dog for a week in mid-June, and we had friends visit throughout our time there. This rental is located on a small, beautiful and serene lake just within the Adirondack Park. The view from the backyard and master bedroom was amazing and the setting felt very intimate. The direct lake access on the property was excellent and the new dock with patio set and umbrella, canoe, paddle boat, fire pit, and patio with picnic table and grill with gas line were wonderful, convenient amenities for our week. We brought our own tubes and speaker had a lot of fun floating in the water and listening to music, grilling, eating all of our meals on the dock or patio, and sitting by the campfire and watching the lake and stars at night. The property is located on the west side of the lake, so we imagine the sunrises to the east are beautiful and the sun was available on the lake by property until about 5 or 6pm. After that, it gets chilly so you might want to get out of the water and paddle or float to a sunny area.
There is a small community located around the edge of the lake. Overall, the neighbors were friendly and curious about us. There isn't a path to walk around the edge of lake, but you can paddle or float around. Around the right shore from the property you can paddle to a small and beautiful concrete dam area and have a picnic. We recommend bringing camping chairs for that and the firepit.
This is the type of place it makes sense to bring everything you need for the week and enjoy the lake. Stores are about 10 minutes away for anything forgotten or needed, and it seems like the hosts may be living nearby at times if you need them. On a rainy, cool, or cloudy day, other attractions are about an hour away. We really enjoyed visiting the restaurants and parks in Saratoga Springs, about a 50 minute drive.
The owners recently bought the property and restored it. We were the first to rent it. The outside is cute and quaint and the new electric, plumping, appliances, and fixtures work well. The interior is hunting cabin meets cottage meets under the sea meets nautical meets Atlantic City glam.
The owners have put a lot of energy, time, and other resources into restoring the property and are still working out the kinks, on finishing it, and keeping the listing up-to-date with changes. The lawn, landscaping, floors, and outdoor stairs were the main things that needed to be finished. They genuinely cared about us enjoying our stay and were very communicative and detail oriented before and during our stay. They were very receptive to our feedback of what went well and recommended improvements."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was exactly what we needed: clean, comfortable, and stocked for the essentials. It was great to hear the wildlife and see the greenery.
Note: The shower is a tight fit. I don't think there's much you can do, other than reconstruction. The red arrow is partially covered with ""255"", but it is noticeable, even when arriving in the dark."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ainsley house was spotless, and very easy to find. Comfortable surroundings and very quiet. He is such a sweetheart!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place peace and quiet 🤫
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,very clean place. the upstairs floor was a little nerve wracking. mouse poop in the kitchen drawers but I guess that comes with being a cabin in the middle of the woods. parking is a bit inconvenient. upgrades are beautiful though.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very helpful and prompt with getting back to me if I had any questions. Secluded location, peaceful and relaxing"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very clean. The bathroom and the shower were a bit small but very functional. The beds are a bit hard but nothing significant. Again, my wife really appreciated how clean the place was. It was a very comfortable place. Living room is comfortable, great kitchen, and nice location. Really enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Ainsley's cottage was exactly what I needed and more! Incredibly peaceful and the house is all newly renovated and even more beautiful than the pictures. Great for a retreat into nature and solitude, we loved our stay and would recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as described. Cozy and clean. Perfect for a family trip!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So thankful for the much needed mini vaca
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed the cozy little home 🥰
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,lovely getaway in the woods.. I enjoyed my stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful location, very quiet and good spot for a weekend getaway"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the space. The host was super nice and responsive. The surrounding area was beautiful and the privacy was nice. Would book again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2024-01-01,3,Stayed over a week,"utensils and selection of cooking pots and pans, etc look like they are from a garage salel. The couch is old and nasty. Can’t get any local news. 1 tv ,no washer, dryer, tiny shower. That is all good if you pay half. Again, he was attentive, maybe in summer it’s nice. It didn’t work for us. Did not feel like home. First time using Airbnb. Live and learn"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house was very beautiful my wife and I enjoyed our stay. Everything was super clean and warm
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice and clean.. fairly decent size for 4 people.. the area is a little questionable but overall is good if you don’t play on staying at the Airbnb a lot
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would love to stay here in the summer to hang out in the yard.
Ainsley has clear instructions for house entry and how to find the house. Very accommodating and responsive.
The house is clean and neat. Amenities were accurate and lots of coffee :)
Lots of hiking trails close by and Gloversville has all the stores you need.. best of both worlds!!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,Cute place in the Adirondacks. Was a bit difficult finding it in the dark. Overall stay was good.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, plenty of room and great host. We were very satisfied with our stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"His day was very exceptional, and a very good secluded neighborhood, very relaxing and serene, and I loved it"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was clean and worth the money paid. However, the area surrounding the cabin was very unkept; abandoned buildings. It was about 6 miles from Caroga Lake, which is all private deeded beaches where the public can not walk. A local person told us to go to Pine Lake, and that was absolutely beautiful.
Nick Stoner restaurant nearby was the highlight of our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Ainsley's place . A cozy modern cabin with privacy on a quiet road in the Adirondack Park. Super clean with all the modern ameninities including wifi , Smart TV and walk in shower. Nice size backyard and patio for a campfire if wanted. Comfortable beds , a loft and spacious easy in easy out parking. Ainsley is a great communicator and always available if anything is needed. We would highly recommend Ainsley's place for a quick stay or an extended one ."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay. The accommodation is cute and comfortable and only a short drive from the trails. The surroundings is beautiful.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The house was clean and had all amenities to meet our needs.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was amazing, clean and spacious. The pictures don’t do it justice! It’s a peaceful spot in the woods and I’d love to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Quiet and peaceful!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Was great very affordable and well kept
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute little place in the woods. Large loft with room for air mattresses if you have friends with you that share space but not beds. Nice firepit area, we were afraid we wouldn't be able to use it late but the neighbors were out using theirs so we felt super comfortable doing so. If you're planning to do this, pick up firewood in town on your way in. This was a wonderful place to stay after a show at SPSC."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our brief stay even though it was only for one night! Very quiet, crisp, cool evening with the windows open made for a great night’s sleep. Thank you."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, excellent host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A very beautiful and serene place to stay! The home was very clean and well kept.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cottage in a private setting . Ainsley the host did a fantastic job with the decor making it modern yet cozy and inviting. Always responsive and was gracious enough to allow a early check in. Awesome host and awesome accomodations. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"The first positive thing I can say is that the cottage is convenient to Gloversville.
The numbers on the mailbox are reflective, not illuminated. Reflective is fine, but it helps to know what you're looking for. The red arrow pointing down the driveway is no longer on a tree.
The step up to the front door is a non-standard height. The second positive thing I can say is that there is a motion-activated light over the front entrance.
The uneven floors are hazardous.
The lighting is harsh. Some lamps with softer lighting would provide a welcome alternative to the overhead lighting. One bedroom does not have a reading lamp beside the bed.
More positives: the cottage was very clean, and the bed I slept in was comfortable. The rate was very reasonable, and it can be rented for just one night."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cottage, everything you need is available. A bit remote, but I immediately introduced me to the neighbors. Jack in particular was very nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet cottage, nicely equipped."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,nice place - perfect for a quick one night stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A super location.
A very nice house in a beautiful environment. The house has everything you need. The garden is awesome and you can sit outside with enough privacy.
The house has everything you need.
A pity we had only two nights. We really would have liked to stay longer. Still much to discover."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at Ainsley’s place, it was very clean and had everything we needed for a nice getaway."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay that's for sure in the middle of nowhere but close enough for me to get to the things I needed too. Also would recommend a grill of some sort so we could spend more time outdoors. Brought grill able items and had to cook them in the kitchen with the smoke alarms going off. Other then the headache it was a perfect stay definitely would do it again that's for sure.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay in the area. Made it very easy to settle right in and begin our trip.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice lodging complete with 2 bedrooms and large loft area.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley's place was exactly what it said it would be: a peaceful cabin away from everything. The way in is clearly under development at the moment, but once you get inside and go out the back door, you stop thinking about all of that.
Great place for a weekday getaway."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely little house tucked away in the woods. Couldn't recommend it more.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Huge snow storms during our stay and whenever we had an issue getting out of the driveway, Ainsley would send someone out to snowblow - she was extremely responsive and helpful; the property was very clean and cozy, loved coming back to it every night!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley’s place was super cute and cozy, the drive up to the house was like a movie with snow coated trees it was truly amazing. Place had what we needed for the weekend and it was the perfect romantic get away."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,House is super clean with full of utensils that you can find in your home. It would be very nice if there was hair blower. It seem like it was heating or ac sound that stop briefly and make a small noise during whole night. I can't figure out actually what was it.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very affordable and nice play to stay
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall a nice place, very roomy, had everything we needed!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Mountain Lake. The space was clean and comfortable. Host was helpful and responsive. The location gave easy access to Gloversville and Johnstown as well as the spectacular Southern Adirondacks. The nature trains are amazing for snowshoeing, Royal Mountain is fun for alpine skiing, and Lapland Lake is fabulous for Nordic skiing."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,This place has good value for the price.
2022-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,what.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for a weekend getaway

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ainsley was super communicative and easy to book with. The cottage was so clean and stocked with everything needed! Beds were comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely book again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect accommodations for girls’ weekend escape to the woods. The cabin is modern and WiFi friendly, w/ great temperature control on a snowy weekend. Host Ainsley was quick to respond and provided a full kitchen w/ bonus coffee pods. We brought water so didn’t have any worries . The cabin was clean and had a great second floor for games , yoga or just as a second space to relax. Great spot to get some time in the woods and explore. We wish there were a couple of hand towels and at least one more bath towel for # of guests but otherwise , you have all you need here.for a great and relaxing stay. Even has all the streaming apps if you feel like cozying in . Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a solid little two bedroom space. I do wish there were more blankets available so if you want a couch blanket I recommend bringing one, but the heat did work well so wasn’t too cold at night, just while in the living room. The sulfur in the water was a big problem for me and my friend, but I did mention it to the host so hopefully it will be resolved soon. Check in was easy, communication was good, and overall it was a great little place for a weekend getaway."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ainsley's place is super clean and cozy for a few nights away from the city. Close to hiking plenty of hiking trails and lakes.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley was a great host, and her Cottage in the Woods was beautiful. Everything was exactly as described and the place was super clean."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Neat little place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicely updated airbnb with a kitchen stocked for basic cooking needs. Cozy living room, very small tv but not quite “iPad size” as a previous review mentioned. We didn’t use it but there’s a nice patio and fire pit out back, well lit area.
The surrounding abandoned houses and campers made us a little uneasy. Our stay was enjoyable though and I’d recommend checking it out if you’re looking for an affordable and comfortable place to stay. It’s perfectly nestled into the Adirondacks but still close enough to stores/restaurants/hiking areas."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,had everything we needed and more! was a great stay and would come back again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley’s place was PERFECT for our family. Cute and comfortable. Close enough to town for stores, restaurants and more, yet far out enough to be secluded!
Fire pit was great for s’mores with kids, my “gamer” kid said it has better Wi-Fi than we have in our city 😂, no worries on sulphuric water, no one in my party cared. We watched comedians on Netflix, walked the property and the road. Beautiful foliage and great nights sleep. I highly recommend Ainsley’s home for anyone needing to be in Gloversville or Johnstown for any reason. BTW coffee on the patio in the morning is magical this time of year. A tie dye of gorgeous leaves, birds singing (if you’re into that lol) and a mountain smell to die for. Thank you, Ainsley!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Suoer clean home. GREAT communication. Quiet, out of the way location. We appreciated having fire wood there so we didn't have to find somewhere to buy it. Check in was simple and directions were clear. The bed were very comfy."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin, very quiet area. Exactly as the description says. The tap water smelt a bit sulphuric…"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication with host.. accommodating and clean !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was a perfect place to setup a quick base camp to plan a couple days of adventure. The place was clean and the water was hot. I only stayed 1 night, but wish I had stayed more. Can't say much only being there for a short time, but it was worth it. Communication with the host was quick and easy."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice updated house in a central location of things to do. Communication with Ainsley was perfect.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A clean and affordable place to stay! Not much to do in Gloversville area, but close enough to enough of the Adirondacks that it might not be a bad base camp. However, the water does smell like sulfur so just be prepared! (Apparently that is the case for most homes in the area)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for a wedding of our friends!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice. The appliances where all new and the house stayed pretty cool once you got the A/C unit running. The hot water was a new experience due to the sulfur in the water, but I talked to some friends in the area that told me it's normal for that area and harmless. The cold water was filtered and didn't have any smell to it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute cabin in a lovely area, wish I could have stayed longer."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well equipped little house. Comfort surrounded by nature.
Very isolated, unfortunately the neighbor had to be abandoned the place.
Path with stones , be careful but feasible.
Close to Saratoga and lakes to enjoy the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Responsive host! Sulfur water caused us to eat out and not shower.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay off the beaten path!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Ainsley was very helpful if I had questions. Overall great stay and would recommend to people.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great quiet place, very clean and has a great kitchen. We had a very nice time (regardless of the heat wave that made the house a little warmer than we are used to). Take note that the water is sulfurous which might be an issue for some people. We very much enjoyed the backyard which is quiet and wooded and we had the chance to be visited twice by a deer and had a little frog/toad visit us while we were stargazing during our stay which we will remember for a long time ^^"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little cottage. Clean and well cared for. I was just passing through and it was perfect for a one night stop. My only complaint would be location, as the very close local neighbors left a bit to be desired."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean place out in the country. Beautiful woods surround the property and it is very quiet. Get place to stay if you are looking to be out in that area. Only had one issue with check-in as Ainsley gave me the wrong code to get in at first. The house has a great kitchen! One draw back is the water does have a strong sulfur smell to it. The rooms are very nice, the beds are on the smaller side(not queen size). It was a good place for me to stay and I would go back despite my few knocks about it."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ainsley’s cottage in the woods was exactly as it is described. We were further away than we wanted to be from Saratoga, but the accommodations were welcoming. The beds are full size and with not much to the mattress.. The only major issue we had was with the pungent sulfur smell when the water was used i.e showers, dishwasher, brushing teeth, etc…"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice cottage with updates.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Seriously awesome place and a great value! Beautiful area and the cottage has all the amenities you would want and more. Ainsley was very accommodating and even let me check in early. Highly recommended !
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a very relaxing place to unwind! The location is very quiet, back yard is amazing , all woods ! Went for a walk around the lake , it has everything you need for the stay !"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The house is newly renovated with a spacious kitchen. The area is extremely quiet and peaceful, with plenty of outdoor space. It's down a rocky dirt road, but is accessible with careful navigation (just be aware if you have a small car). Code-lock check in was convenient so we could arrive any time.
*Migraine trigger warning: note that all lighting is fluorescent."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very nice cabin and great communication all at a good price
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos are very accurate of the inside. Definitely watch out for ants etc in the kitchen but otherwise the place was as advertised. Fan was loud, as others have noted, but it’s like background white noise. Ainsley was quick to respond to all messages and very professional."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great small cottage!!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,super cozy and cute inside tv was a bit small but not bad house was stocked and clean the surrounding area wasn’t the best but it was very quiet and peaceful :)
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this relaxing and well-kept cabin! The area was quiet and the backyard patio offered a great view of the woods. A friendly host and overall worth-while experience. We found some local hiking trails to keep us busy during the day and plenty of places to dine out at night.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well equipped cabin. It was a quiet and very comfortable place to spend a few days.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks. We were happy in your Adirondack place. It is a nice little cabin in a lakeside community. The full size appliances were great. Water was not high sulfur, as I read. We were very comfortable with the beds, 27 inch tv, wifi, etc. Only issue was the driveway that really needs built- up due to the mountain rocks and run-off, but we knew how to drive such areas. It was close enough to our daughters place in Broadalbin. Thank you"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you really want to disconnect from things, this is a decent place to be. However, a few things before you book. The interior is very nice and well kept. The tv is the size of a tablet so that wasnt enjoyable. The water coming from the faucet smells pretty bad (sulfur). The town is very much a run down town. Lots of houses in bad shape, etc. Food in town is mediocre and costly for no reason. The surroundings of the rental is very ugly. You have a trailer home on one side in bad condition (eye sore) the so called ""pond"" in description is on another private drive across the way with another half way constructed structure. There are also 2 ""homes"" right across the front yard of rental in terrible conditions, possibly half way through a construction and stopped. Basically, all surroundings were awful. The rental is cozy and quiet. Besides that if youre looking to be active and do things i would do your research. There wasnt much to do here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely, at first we were a little nervous driving to get there because we didn't see much diversity. But it was so worth it very beautiful, quite literally everywhere even the stores . Just amazing"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place, perfect for a quick getaway"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house, beds are full sized which i didn’t realize but comfy."

2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay during the weekend
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Ainsley’s cabin for my birthday. The location was perfect for every thing we needed. The cabin itself was both cozy and stylish. Ainsley was responsive and quick to help. Would definitely stay here again! 😊
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay and very clean and modern and spacious quiet and relaxing enjoyed our stay very much
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and private. The mattresses were a little small but comfortable. Modern amenities. 20 minutes from the Adirondack mountains. Excellent value and I would gladly return.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was a great little getaway in the area! Great value for the rental!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Ainsley’s cottage is beautiful and in a great location. Perfect for unwinding. The cottage was clean and had everything I needed. Would definitely visit again!
2022-02-01,2,Stayed one night,The home was very quiet and a very clean upon arriving there was ice all over the entryway the home was cold when I first arrived being that it’s the dead of the winter the heat should be set at a minimum of 68 especially if somebody is renting upon entry I turned up the furnace and it made such a horrible noise it sounded like I was at an airport in jet engines were above my head in order to keep the home warm the furnace needed to stay on it made such a horrible noise the bedroom is right next to the furnace room it kept me up all night long so if you rent this place bring your earplugs
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great space to hang out and relax in between skiing/winter excursions!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous place for a retreat. Ainsley was communicative and the lockbox entry was a breeze. It's quiet, the kitchen has everything you need, and it's close to lots of outdoor recreation while not being too far from town. Loved it!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"You won’t regret staying here, a nice cozy cottage in the woods with modern appliances and adjustable ac/heat. The house comes equipped with anything you may need (board games, pots and pans, towels, chairs, etc.) and the couch and beds were comfy. The TV was a bit quiet and small but it worked and had access to any streaming service you wanted. Great communication with the host and I really want to come back already!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inside the Adirondack park, if you love nature or are looking for a quiet, private and scheduled place to stay this is your place. It’s still close to grocery stores and some restaurants. Ainsley was a great host and I really enjoyed my stay while working remotely. I recommend it!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and as described! Very clean cottage with a wonderful location. Ainsley is very responsive and a super host! The heater was a little loud/squeaky, and the TV volume sounded pretty bad, but otherwise - great stay! Highly recommend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and the scenery is beautiful. You won’t regret staying there and Ainsley as a host will make sure that your stay is comfortable and memorable.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, exactly as expected. Loved it, would stay again."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Ainsley place is really cute, provided the white Christmas experience for my kids.
The cottage is a definition of simplicity and style , very neat and clean.
My only regrets was not having any experience with snow
Ainsley communicates well and professional. i will definitely recommend this house.
."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice chalet beautifully renovated, equiped with top of the line appliance. Very private."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is a perfect little get-away. Everything was perfect and the photos provided in the Airbnb website are exactly what it was like in real-life. The whole cottage was very clean and orderly. Great value and great secluded location.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ainsley communication through our process was so professional. The cabin was clean and beautiful.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ainsley's cabin is in a great location. Secluded but easily accessible and not far from the main roads. The appliances and design of the cabin are surprisingly modern and well thought out, so if you're looking for something akin to a glamping experience this is the kind of place for you! It has great internet, very high tech kitchen appliances, a nice bathroom, all while being deep in the woods and surrounded by nature."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time visiting the area. Place is clean, secluded, cozy. Excellent view of the sky on a clear night. Would recommend."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Janet is an excellent communicator but this place will be great for smokers and definitely not those who don’t smoke
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, we'll definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Janet went above and beyond to accommodate our stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Janet was wonderful to work with!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot for some R & R!My daughter and I spent five days away from our daily work lives to decompress. So worth it. Peaceful and comfortable. Time spent enjoying the lake, wildlife-family of beavers 🦫 were daily entertainment as were two families of Canadian geese and their little goslings and one awesome rain storm. Too chilly to use the kayaks/rowboat but walked the area some. Wrapped up in some super soft blankets and enjoyed coffee & wine on the screened in back porch as much as possible. Lori & Mark stayed in communication with us when needed. Wouldn’t think twice in staying again should the opportunity arise. Wonderful hosts and place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I went here for our honeymoon and it was exactly what we were looking for. It was just far enough from the city to feel homey yet still close enough to get essentials. The lake is amazing and being able to use the row boat was a blast. Fishing was very good and relaxing, we didn't catch any monsters but you won't leave without a handful of fish pictures. The hosts were very understanding after a hiccup between myself and Airbnb. Although our stay was a day shorter than I had planned (not the host's fault) we still had an amazing time and again, the hosts are amazing. We will be recommending this to many friends and family!!! Also one last thing, the enclosed porch was perfect, and the loons are fun to listen to and watch."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had an amazing stay here. The pond was super serene and the house had everything we needed. We got to hear lots of wildlife and enjoyed a couple fires in the fire pit. We even booked a Goat Cuddle event a few towns away one of the days we were here which was a lot of fun! This was a great place to spend a long and relaxing trip away.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this place and our time there! The house was great and exactly as described. We loved the cabin on the lake furnishings and little touches. The bed we used was so comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets and throws for extra warmth.
The location on the pond was the best thing, though. It was quiet and peaceful, being the last house on the drive. I sat outside almost every night watching the moon rise and listening to the loons calling. We watched bald eagles, herons, and loons from the front porch. I hated to leave!
The Mountain Hut bar and restaurant is a must and so close!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori and Mark were amazing! We loved our little weekend getaway, and would 100% recommend this location to anyone looking for a break in the mountains"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at the Sleepy Loon--the property is gorgeous and well-equipped for a relaxing stay. The pond/lake is in particular a really great feature of the place and the cabin is cozy and well-decorated. Enjoyed a peaceful weekend of fishing, grilling, and enjoying the firepit! Lots of thoughtful touches to make the stay easier; this is a great property with great hosts. Looking forward to returning soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem!!! This is a hidden paradise. After hosting a wedding in Connecticut we wanted some relaxing and were not disappointed. We used the kayaks every day as there was a warm spell the first several days of October. The front screened in porch is so nice for morning coffee or evening happy hour. A single loon and her baby were still around to sérénade us.
The beds and linens were very comfortable. Having a washer and dryer was great. It’s only 15 minutes from a grocery store. We highly recommend this property for 2 couples or a small family. Lori and Mark respond very quickly if you need anything."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful cabin. Has everything you need and more. Lori and Mark are fantastic hosts. The location is very remote, private and beautiful. Cabin was very clean ."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the perfect time at this cottage. Serenity at its finest. The cottage is well stocked. We didn’t need anything. The dock, the front porch, the kayaks, the firepit, the loons, the view of the lake from our bedroom was all wonderful. I did not want to leave this lil bit of heaven on earth. Lori thought of everything and then some when equipping this cottage! We plan to return next year and I am already excited for our next trip!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a property, so peaceful and quiet."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our 2nd summer staying at The Sleepy Loon and we are already booking our 3rd summer! Our family loves this home and the owners are absolutely wonderful! I honestly feel like Lori & Mark are our friends at this point because they’re so friendly and communicative during our stays. As always, the cottage was stocked, clean, and full of amenities. There were even some new additions to the cottage this year! Thank you again for the best part of our summer and we’re literally counting the days until we get to come back!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came here last summer and this summer was as great as the last time! We just love the cute cottage, beautiful lake and how quiet it was. We had a wonderful time. Lori and Mark are very nice as well. Thank you for sharing your cottage! Will come again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Sleepy Loon was memorable and we can’t wait to return. Our family came to spend a few days mountain biking at Wheelerville nearby. The location was within about 20 minutes to our biking spot and it was super convenient. The Sleepy Loon surpassed our expectations with its quiet peaceful surroundings. When we weren’t biking, we were kayaking on the lake, fishing off the private dock or playing croquet in the yard. The kitchen had everything we needed and the layout with bedrooms was perfect. My personal favorite memory was enjoying my coffee each morning on the screened in porch listening to the loons and our s’mores each night by the camp fire. It was everything we could have hoped for! Thank you Mark and Lori for your hospitality and offering this spot for guests. 😁"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place was just the way it was described, the cottage was perfect for us, quiet surroundings, beautiful view of the lake, sunrise, and wild life. It was very relaxing. The screened in porch was the perfect place for mornings with our coffee, actually we hung on the porch most of the time because the view of the lake was perfect. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you again Lori for a wonderful stay.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the perfect lakeside country cottage! Impeccably maintained with every detail considered! Five stars isn’t sufficient.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Seepy Loon Cottage was wonderful and beat our expectations!
Lori and Mark were awesome hosts and their communication and desire to help was outstanding! I would give the cottage an A+ for having all the necessary amenities and then some, including washer and dryer, grill, fire pit, rowboat and kayaks and they even provide sheets and linens, which we’ve had to provide for previous location stays in the Adirondacks.
Great fishing lake, but we do want to hint to others that it is a weedy Lake, so swimming is not optimal, although there is a raft out in the middle of the lake you can access with a boat or raft for a better swimming experience.
Thank you Lori and Mark for an awesome getaway/vacation!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sleepy Loon Cottage is a hidden gem. Quiet. Peaceful. Beautiful setting. Great accommodations. If I could have, I would have taken that view and that screened porch home with me! The kitchen is very-well equipped. The place is cozy and inviting (the bed is super comfortable). There are kayaks to explore the lake with, which we really enjoyed. A dock for catching the view and the sunshine. And, Lori and Mark were so great to communicate with throughout the whole process. You really couldn't ask for more. The grocery store is a short 10 minute drive away and there is a linear trail through Gloversville and lots of trails to hike in the area, But, really, all we wanted to do was hang out at Sleepy Loon Cottage. We hope to go back - I'm sure it's even more beautiful in the fall."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This little place was a little slice of heaven. Very relaxing and quiet exactly what we were looking for. Hosts were very attentive and quick to respond and very informative. We loved the option to be able to use the boats on site that made the stay even better with how much we love to be on the water. Overall it was a great time.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori and Mark are super kind and communicative hosts. The cottage was perfect-- well-stocked, organized, surprisingly spacious. We spent most of our indoor time and ate all of our meals on the comfy screened-in porch overlooking the water.
The lake itself is magnificent. The sort of majestic quiet that you simply cannot find in the city and that we had sorely needed. Kayaking on the lake in the morning was heavenly and full of nature sightings!: we were lucky enough to see the loons (and their new baby), a family of Canadian geese (mom and three juveniles), a slightly oblivious beaver breakfasting on lily pads, and even a Great blue heron. This was our first Adirondack vacation and I don’t think we could have picked a better spot."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our accommodations were just what we were looking for quiet, peaceful, a beautiful lake to sit back and watch or you could spend many hours fishing. The floors were exceptionally clean as well as the whole cottage. Even the towels and bedding smelled fresh. We used the kayaks and had a lot of fun but we mostly used the boat and got around the whole lake fishing in the week we were there. We caught abundant bass, pickerel, and black crappies in many sizes and released them for someone else to have some fun. Two young ground hogs were outside the kitchen window each morning getting their first meal for the day and we were not sure how many beavers but did see one every night swimming somewhere. We never found the beaver den though. What an enjoyable vacation and hoping to come back in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a great , clean house with amazing blessed view , where it can be find everyting needed for a lovely stay!
We love very much the place and we took good care of it, leaving it clean and everything organized as we found it.
Thank you and we looking forward to come again!

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it was a great place for relaxing and beautiful views
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a peaceful lakeside cabin and that's exactly what we got at the Sleepy Loon. The setting was utterly breathtaking. The cabin itself was like a home away from home. It had everything you would need to cook, as well as bug face nets and bear spray. We love a blanket. Wifi was fast and the TV had plenty of channels incl all the streaming sites. There is no phone reception or 4G whatsoever once you get into the Adirondacks but there is in Gloversville. The nearest supermarket was only a 10 min drive away and is very well stocked and is open late.
Went kayaking around the lake every day and there are plenty of local hikes within 30 mins drive, bring plenty of bug spray. Saw plenty of wildlife including a bald eagle. Waking up to the sound of Loons is really special.
This is the perfect place to stay and Lori and Mark were really helpful and responsive, even sent us a video of a late-night bear visitor. I can't recommend this place and these hosts enough."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay and want to return again..nice place to unwind and fully relax and enjoy the birds and view! Peaceful lake setting!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sleepy Loon Cottage was better than we could have hoped. Clean and inviting, the space is used perfectly. Very easy to check in and out. Mark and Lori were very to reach if needed.
The screened in back porch is fantastic. We snuggled up on the couch and watched a movie on our computer, right on the porch, when it rained. And we LOVED hearing the sounds of loons singing.
The bedrooms were clean and functional. We used the back bedroom since you can see the lake from the bed if you open the blinds.
The kitchen is great for cooking too. We decided to stay in to cook steak and potatoes that we picked up and the nearby grocery store.
The bathroom was very clean, including the shower. Great shower head too.
There's a small dock with chairs to sit and watch nature. And there was 2, sit on top, kayaks and a row boat also available to us. We saw loons, geese, beavers, and what we are almost sure was a mink.
We'll definitely be back! Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow! What can we say, the cottage is simply awesome! It has everything you need and is super comfortable. The outside space is fantastic too. We saw loons, ducks, geese, eagles, woodpeckers, hummingbirds and most amazing of all, four beavers, Pork Chop and Posy of course plus two others which we have unofficially names as Cream Cheese and Bagel! Will always remember our morning coffee on the dock and kayak trips around the lake. This place is incredible and Lori and Mark are the perfect hosts. Have no doubts, just go!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing stay enjoyed kayaking on the lake and hiking local trails in the area. Also enjoyed our visit to the town Woodstock and the historical site in Bethel.
Thanks for sharing!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is phenomenal! Extremely clean, well kept with great access to amazing views!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori and Mark's place was great. It has an amazing view and the place is tidy and spacious (the TV is actually bigger than it looks in the picture). Lori and Mark were also extremely communicative. I didn't have any issues at all, but have no doubt that if I did, they would have responded right away. I would definitely stay at their place again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin on a lake, greatly enjoyed the firepit, gorgeous views and excellent accomodations. Our favorite getaway!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time. This cottage is very well maintained and stocked. The area is quiet and restful like I've never experienced. Lori and Mark were super responsive and communicative both before and during the stay. It feels as though they thought of everything.
Seeing the sun rise over the lake is fantastic. The surrounding area is also full of things to see and do for nature lovers. We'd highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sleepy Loon Cottage is a great spot to kick back and relax lake side. It is fully equipped with everything you would need. It has direct access to the lake and comes with two kayaks and a row boat. We enjoyed a peaceful Columbus weekend watching the sun rise. The beds were super comfy with plenty of bedding for a cool October weekend. The kitchen is fully stocked with pots and pans, coffee maker, keurig, grilling utensils. etc. It also has a nice screened in porch on the back overlooking the lake which would be awesome for a summer stay!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A classic, cozy, and thoughtfully renovated lakeside cabin in a great location that feels totally secluded, but is still convenient to grocery shopping and other necessities. Check-in and check-out were really simple and Lori and Mark were kind and responsive hosts.
My mom, who has some mobility issues, appreciated that the majority of the cottage, including one of the bedrooms, is on the same level. There's just one step up to get inside the front door. It might not be accessible to folks who use wheelchairs, but people who can navigate one or two steps as needed, including stepping into a combination shower-bath, should be all right staying here.
The beds were comfortable, thermostat worked well, and we never ran out of hot water even with three people showering in a row. The internet connection could handle streaming video without a problem. The stove is older, but it works perfectly.
Do be careful not to leave food lying around. It is a cabin in the woods, and four-legged neighbors might take advantage of any human snacks left out overnight."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lori was a great host and very communicative. Being a private lake it was very quiet and great way to escape. Close enough to few local restaurants and bars. Definitely recommend.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely getaway from the bustle of Boston to the woods! Cottage had everything I needed to feel comfortable for my stay. The peace and quiet was so rejuvenating! It was pretty rainy for most of my stay but that allowed for some beautiful rainbows, and getting to enjoy the yard, porch & dock while the rain dribbled down. I even took a nap during a storm on the porch, that was bliss! The fire starter sticks came in handy when I wanted to have a fire after a storm. Didn’t have any issues starting a fire with slightly damp wood & no kindling.
There was one small issue with the grill/propane tank, but Lori & Mark were fantastic with communication and getting me assistance to fix the issue. Really appreciate how attentive they were.
I saw other reviews mention the shed next door & neighbors, I didn’t see those neighbors, which could be due to my stay being mostly during the week. (Sunday - Thursday).
The lake is beautiful & clear. Lots of cool vegetation & water creatures to look for while out on the kayak.
Overall a really lovely experience, I really enjoyed my time at Sleepy Loon!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in town for a wedding. This was a very nice and quiet place to stay. Can’t beat the view! Very relaxing! Sitting on the dock was my favorite!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had an amazing and relaxing stay at Sleepy Loon. Lori and Mark are excellent hosts and are very responsive to any question before and during our stay. Sleepy Loon was everything we wanted - peace, beautiful area, clean, friendly. We plan to return next year."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely stay at the Sleepy Loon! The cottage came with everything we needed for our visit (having ice in the freezer was much appreciated). The beds were comfy and everything was well appointed. Everything we were looking for in a quiet ADK stay, can't wait to return again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, relaxing cottage! The silence was indeed golden! We spent most of our time on the screened porch watching the beaver, herons and a bold eagle. The photos capture this magical place exactly. Lori and Mark were communication gems!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is SUCH a cozy home! Loved relaxing here. We used the boats to paddle out to a raft in the middle of the pond. We parked the boat there and same off the raft. The water was a little deeper and less ""stuff"". Water right in front of home is a little grassy (may be just due to not a lot of water this season).
There are neighbors really close. Their home is technically across the street - but they have a shed and dock really close. They were there with a bunch of kids while we were so it was a little less ""in the mountains"" than we thought we'd feel. However, still extremely peaceful place to relax. Loved sipping coffee on the dock in the am and evening cocktail when the sun went down.
Great place for little kids too! We had a 14 month kiddo and he loved running through the grass. Nice dark curtains for rooms too. Suggest brining a gate for 1 stair case (we had one and was amazing!)
Beautiful wood features in home. The sit on top kayaks were SOO fun, really nice ones!
Great calm trip!
Mountain Hunt is a very short walk from house...fun little spot if you want to get out of the house for a meal."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! We had a wonderful vacation. Thank you!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,2nd year in a row we have brought the family here We will be back again Beautiful setting. Great communication by hosts.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for a few days to relax, unwind, and hang as a family- perfect location for this! Our host was very gracious, helpful, and provided a clean lovely home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second visit to Sleepy Loon! It was such a wonderful experience last year and did not disappoint this time. They even made improvements since our last visit. Lazy kayaking around this lovely lake was my favorite part. I suspect we will be back again next year for our annual connect-with-nature trip!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a perfect cozy place to enjoy a peaceful gorgeous lake. highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our first time booking with Air B&B and Mark & Lori definitely set the bar high! Our family had the best week at their gorgeous home! Pictures do not do this place justice - it is so beautiful and spacious. They thought of everything when they decorated and staged this cabin, literally everything you need is here!
The use of their boats (2 kayaks and a row boat) is incredibly generous and we had so much fun exploring the lake & fishing, which was excellent! We caught some monster large mouths & pickerel. The lake is so private and quiet - we enjoyed our morning drinking coffee on the dock, listening to the wildlife, and watching the steam roll off the water. There is plenty of perfectly seasoned firewood available.
The house is stocked with fluffy towels, pillows and linens. The couches and beds are so comfortable and there are views of the lake in every room. Our son (6) loved his little Harry Potter bedroom - so cute!
When they tell you Wemple & Edicks is a *must* for ice cream, trust them. It seriously is the most amazing homemade ice cream we’ve ever had!
There is no cell service (for AT&T at least) but the wifi was great. We downloaded and set up Google Voice to make calls over wifi and if you have iPhone then you can iMessage. We found random pockets in the middle of the lake with cell service 😆
Mark and Lori are always there to answer questions or check in. They are so sweet and kind - we feel like we made new friends! Already planning next summers trip back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Words can not express what a wonderful place the SleepyLoon is. The surroundings are beautiful and quiet. The beds were so comfortable it made us feel like we were melted butter! Everything you need for a wonderful stay comes with the cabin. Very relaxing. The SleepyLoon was the most relaxing best vacation we have ever had. Everything provided is high quality from the furniture, bedding, kitchen supplies to the firewood! I HIGHLY recommend the SleepyLoon. Mark and Lori are wonderful hosts and answer any and all questions in a very timely manner. The dock was great and we really enjoyed the rowboat for evening rows as well as fishing! Check in and out was super easy! We can not wait to visit again!!!!! We enjoyed the wildlife as well. The beaver strolled by in the evening, A woodchuck ate it’s breakfast in the yard every morning. An owl serenaded us in the evening by the fire and the beautiful sounds of the loons filled the air! Absolutely one of the most relaxing places on earth!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Host Lori and Mark were very helpful. The place was very nice. It had everything you would need. The view was beautiful. It was a great place to Kayak and fish. Loved sitting on the dock watching the beavers and seeing the loons. Very nice and quiet. The only thing was we couldn't swim, the lake was very low and it had weeds and algae."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sleepy Loon is a wonderful place to get away that isn’t too far away. You don’t need to pack much, this place has almost anything you will need. The lake is absolutely beautiful, with tons of birds. We loved the daily fly by of an eagle! Getting out on the lake in the kayaks is another way to see the wildlife. My son had a wonderful time fishing for bass. We had a wonderful time here at the Sleepy Loon."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and it was very hard to leave. The location was stunning and the cottage was very clean and homey. Lori and Mark were extremely responsive and very kind! The neighborhood beaver was also a lovely host and checked on us every night. We hope we can come back soon!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time! Was nice and cozy. A nice little getaway, will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Photos don’t do this place justice! Very clean, comfy furniture and beds, hosts are amazing! If you want peace and solitude this is the place to go, if you want restaurants they are a short 20min drive away. There were loons, ducks, geese with babies, woodchucks, beavers, good fishing, and a tiny glimpse of a bear through the woods. Fires by the lake and evening kayak paddles are the best! This is a place that deserves repeat visits!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is honestly one of the loveliest places I have ever stayed. Lori and Mark were very helpful and quick to respond to any questions I may have had. I would absolutely stay again and I'm hopeful I will be able to find the time this summer to return. If you're at all hesitant, I would encourage you to book. You won't be disappointed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place to unwind and spend quality time with the family. The pond was beautiful. We enjoyed morning coffee by the water, kayaked all day, and roasted s’mores by the campfire at night. Local restaurants were also surprisingly good. I would definitely recommend staying. Lori and Mark were wonderful hosts, super helpful and kind!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice place for a peaceful relaxing getaway! The chairs on the dock were my morning coffee and evening glass of wine spot! Comfortable and clean.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best spots I have ever been to on Airbnb! We were so sad to have to leave after our four day stay. We barely left the house and we still felt like we didn't have enough time to do everything we wanted to do there!
As many have said, the backyard is absolutely the best feature - we loved watching the thunderstorms go by in the screened in porch and having our morning coffee out there listening to the birds. We used the BBQ to make lunch and enjoy at the picnic table and taking the rowboat and kayaks out on the calm and quiet lake was so restorative and fun. Watching the sunsets on the dock was so nice - we even saw some beavers swimming around and deer grabbing a drink at the lake at dusk each day! We also enjoyed the firepit and made some s'mores.
The beds and couches were super cozy and we had plenty of towels and blankets to use. The kitchen also had all the basics including salt, pepper, olive oil, etc.
It was so nice to feel away from it all yet an easy drive to get anything we needed from town. You're less than an hour from Saratoga and we saw a show at SPAC one night and visited the trails there on the way home.
Thank you for sharing your home with us! We loved this place and can't wait to come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. Lori was very responsive, informative and accommodating.
The pictures do not do it justice. I would stay here again and again. The home and property are very well maintained and with just enough decorative touches to add charm inside and out!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing little oasis the sleepy loon cottage is. Designed beautifully, with a cozy rustic vibe that you immediately feel welcomed as you walk in. The cottage is so much more roomier than it appears from the outside.
It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway to unwind, relax, fish, and kayak. The screened in back porch offered great views of the lake and all the surrounding wildlife.
Lori and Mark are wonderfully kind hosts. Their communication and responsiveness went above and beyond that of an other Airbnb host.
We hope to book another stay at the sleepy loon cottage next summer."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am more than happy to write this positive review after our beautiful stay at the Sleepy Loon Cottage. Just arriving at this place was a treat as it was at the end of a quiet road so no through traffic to be concerned about. The check-in was simple and fast. We were impressed with how clean and neat everything was inside and out. Walking in the door and looking around, the theme felt very comfortable, clean and inviting, we really felt at home. The non-motorized Lake was a huge bonus so we could really listen to the wildlife instead of boats and jet skis. It's so peaceful at dusk as the day ends on the lake and all you can hear is the sounds of the crickets chirping and the wails of the Loons. Sitting on the dock, enjoying the view of the Lake and listening to nature was truly peaceful and decompressing. The screened-in porch overlooking the lake was such a bonus. Lori and Mark were great Hosts and communicated well with us. This is what we really needed to relax and decompress from the daily grind. Great Job Lori & Mark, Thank You!!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Out of all of the places I've stayed at through Airbnb, this is easily one of my favorites! Being able to wake up every morning and sit out on the back patio listening to the sounds of nature was so relaxing. The cabin has everything you need for a very comfortable stay, but it's really the backyard that makes this place magic. Highly recommend staying here if you're looking to disconnect from a busy life and reconnect with nature."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,beautiful place. not many nice places let you stay with dogs.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to unplug and unwind. I have a very busy, loud job, and was looking for an escape to peace and quiet. This place did not disappoint! I can tell from other reviewers that there are plenty of places to go and things to do if your are interested, but personally I never left. I just soaked in all the peace and quiet surrounded by nature. The sunrises are stunning if you are up that early, and the view of the lake any time of day is amazing! If you need a quiet to place to unwind and relax, this is definitely the place for you! I can't wait to go back again next year!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really excellent cabin directly on the lake--we were very comfortable and enjoyed the grill, waterside firepit, and rowboat! Place was very clean and hosts were communicative. Full kitchen setup with everything we could want--oven, range, toaster, microwave, full size fridge. Lovely place and a great stay!"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely quiet spot on the water. We were not there very much during The day, but it looks like an enjoyable place especially in summer. The television did not work upon arrival, and the host had ordered a new one which came during our stay. We did not have the tools to put the stand together and they did not have anyone to do it. No matter as we brought books to read. Might be a good idea to have a person available for things like this. We did appreciate that our dog was allowed and that the beds were comfortable. Thanks for sharing your spot."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little cottage in a very quiet area. Nice hiking around. Quiet and Serene. Place was clean and the kitchen was stocked with most anything you could need to cook for yourself. Laundry on site was convenient just remember your detergent. The outside enclosed porch was awesome and the lake view is really pretty. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful, relaxing weekend at this adorable lakeside cottage! It was clean, well stocked, and smelled of fresh pine. The views, of the lake and fall foliage were delightful! This place is a little slice of heaven!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have already writs one review but can’t help but write another! This cottage is the absolute BEST place to completely relax and unwind. It’s so peaceful. Tons of hikes nearby to do as well. Kane Mountain was awesome! The cottage has everything you need and Lori and Mark are fabulous to work with. We will be back again for sure!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and cabin. We had an amazing time. Quiet indeed and perfect to recharge in nature. We’ll be back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Sleepy Loon Cottage was wonderful. Color was just starting to appear in the woods and mountains surrounding us (late September visit). We really liked being on the end of the street with just a few cottages nearby. No through traffic. So quiet yet we didn’t feel secluded from the world. The cottage itself had all we needed for a relaxing stay…fun having lake front and for us such a bonus being able to use the John boat (all 3 of us fit in plus our little dog) and kayaks. Signed the waivers on line and off we went! 🤗. No motor boats on the lake was sweet. We rowed from one end of the lake to the other. Released the fish we caught but catching them was fun. Had a great time roasting hot dogs, and just sitting around, the fire pit. We even saw a beaver!! We read one review that suggested Wemple and Edicks country store in Sammonsville for their baked good and ice cream. Wow! Great suggestion. We ordered a home made apple pie. It was gone within a day🤗.
Mark and Lori, hats off to you for your warm communications, hospitality and generosity. The cottage was great…the boat and kayaks were icing on the cake."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori and Mark were phenomenal. So communicative and kind. Sunsets and sunrises at their place were breathtaking. It was fun to watch the beavers and listen to the coyotes and variety of birds in the area. I would highly recommend breakfast at Nanny and Pop's. The food was great and the staff was so nice. If you are looking for a true escape I highly recommend the Sleepy Loon. The kids and I were so happy and can't wait to go back.
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Lori and Mark were very good hosts the cottage was very cute and we enjoyed hanging out on the lake and had fun kayaking and going out in the row boat and at night we had a nice bomb fire and enjoyed looking at the stars thanks again for your hospitality
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Sleepy Loon Cottage was everything we’d hoped for and more; from the moment we pulled up, to the moment we drove away with sentimental attachment to the loons. The cottage itself was beautiful, and offered anything we might need. (I brought with me a bag of garden vegetables for making soup, and found everything I would need, from quality knives to pans, and gorgeous pottery bowls for eating! If you cook, you know that’s very cool).
Absolutely everything we sat on, slept on, or dried off with felt like quality comfort. What can I possibly say about waking up to a fresh gentle breeze, and a view of the water from your bed?
Much of our time was spent on the screened in front porch, staring at the water, enjoying the complete peace and serenity of the place, and a view like that of a Kincaid painting...and then we took the kayaks they had available, and paddled right into that painting. It was absolutely breathtaking.
We had a very positive experience, and are happy that we chose Sleepy Loon Cottage for our family vacation."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sleepy Loon is such a gem!
The cottage is comfortable and surprisingly spacious. My family of 5 was able to spread out on rainy days without feeling cramped.
The house includes everything you’ll need, keep these things in mind:
~Instacart delivers! No need to leave if you prefer to stay onsite.
~ Life jackets are included. Small adult life jackets fit my teeny 10 & 7 year olds, for younger kids bring your puddle jumpers.
~ If your dog tends to run away, bring a leash and stake. There’s no fencing.
~ If you prefer not to hand wash , bring disposable plates and utensils. The cottage does not include a dishwasher.
~ In the interior only the bathroom door locks. Nothing to bring except creativity, particularly if you have young children.
Internet is limited to the house and surrounding area. Once you hit the road, it takes a while for internet to pick back up. Plan accordingly if you need directions back to the house from a trail!
We did have limited water the first few days. Mike and Lori provided clear instructions for getting the water to flow. After a few days there were no hiccups and water flowed like normal.
Lori and Mike are incredibly responsive and a pleasure to talk with.
The cottage is at the end of a dirt road. The neighbors were hardly ever around and when they were, they weren’t very visible. The immediate lot next door only has a shed with the main house behind the cottage. Overall, it feels very private.
Cooperstown and Saratoga Springs are nearby (~60 minutes) and fun to explore.
If you’re going to Cooperstown Origins Cafe is highly recommended for a unique dining experience.
Not enough words to describe the incredible experience available at Sleepy Loon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a dreamy cabin! We spent five days and hardly ever left other than for pretty walks on the backroads. The screened in porch is such a great hang spot for early morning coffee. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking and the house is perfectly furnished!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is a great getaway for someone that wants a very quiet and relaxed vacation. It comes as advertised as a very secluded place with only a couple neighbors on one side of you ( which we never even saw). The house was fully equipped with everything you would need. It was a short trip into Gloversville/Johnstown each day for food or a trip to Walmart if needed. We went to Saratoga one day as well and it was an easy 45 minute drive. Mark and Lori were extremely quick to respond or check in. I would give this place the highest rating for the cost! Thank you
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed when staying at the Sleepy Loon Cottage.
The waterfront screened porch provides a wonderful setting for bird watching and to watch the ever changing water.
The Cottage has a well equipped kitchen, it is very comfortable and spacious.
Thank you for the wonderful vacation."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at the Sleepy Loon. Mark and Lori are amazing hosts and answered all of my questions promptly. The fishing, kayaking, campfires, and wildlife made for an unforgettable trip. The location is premiere and quiet. It was everything I needed to get away from the hectic day to day grind. The ducks, geese, deer, birds, coyotes, beavers, and of course, the loons provided countless encounters. I hope to stay again soon."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling to the Sleepy Loon Cottage was one of my best travel experiences ever. I was so sad to leave, and am still recovering from the “Sleepy Loon Blues”.
As for the home itself, it is immaculate and clearly well cared for. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you could possibly need for your stay. This came in handy as all meals were cooked at home and there was no shortage of supplies. The two bedrooms are the perfect size, the beds are VERY comfortable, and the bedding itself was very nice. There is even a cute little “nap nook” with a twin bed, perfect for children or cozy naps. The bathroom is at the front of the house, which is wonderful for privacy. The water pressure in the shower was strong and there was never any issue with hot water running out or anything like that. The screened in porch was clutch for rainy days and night time. You can still enjoy the beauty of the location without subjecting yourself to the elements! I do agree with previous reviews that this home is much bigger than it looks in pictures.
The property itself is beyond priceless. The lake is so quiet, private and peaceful. The backyard is a great size and equipped with a picnic table, campfire, dock, Adirondack chairs, grill and more. The front yard has a beautiful little outdoor dining patio and stunningly gorgeous flowers surrounding. The cottage comes with two kayaks, and a row boat. This was just an added bonus as it truly enhanced the experience at Lake Edward. There was awesome fishing, beautiful sunsets, and breathtaking sunrises. It was truly special to be able to enjoy a cup of hot coffee on the dock while watching the sun come up.
The location is wonderful and within driving distance to many beautiful nature escapes. I enjoyed hiking Kane Mountain and Tenant Falls. I did not explore much in terms of nightlife or restaurants, as this was more of a nature getaway for me. I did venture out to the general store which is right down the street and Walmart which was only a 15 minute drive. The location of this cottage provided exactly what I was looking for.
As far as the hosts go, I truly cannot say enough about how incredible Lori and Mark were. Connecting and communicating with them truly enhanced my stay as I have never experienced such warm and gracious hosts. Their love for their home is both evident and contagious, which made the stay even more personal and memorable. I loved chatting with them throughout the stay and sharing photos. They expressed such genuine enthusiasm for the experience I was having that it just made me love it that much more. They were quick to respond to any and all communications and always responded with kindness and warmth.
I have traveled the world and have stayed many places. I’ve never felt the way I felt leaving the Sleepy Loon. This cottage, along with Mark and Lori, will forever have a special place in my heart. Both the cottage and the hosts made me feel so at home, which made it that much harder to leave. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to book this stay. You will not regret it and you will be forever changed because of it. I will certainly be spending more time at the Sleepy Loon in the future, and am already looking forward to booking a return trip. I feel truly honored to have had the opportunity to experience such an incredible place. I am forever grateful to Lori and Mark for sharing their slice of paradise with me."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sleepy Loom is an absolute gem. This little lake house is at the end of a small drive on a lovely, quiet lake (no motorized boats allowed and opposite shore completely undeveloped). As two couples we were very comfortable between the screened in porch (plenty of seating), the spacious kitchen, and the backyard picnic table and fire pit. The cabin seems recently renovated and is very clean. The best part of our stay was taking the two kayaks and the row boat out in the morning and at sunset. We didn’t end up swimming much, but in warmer weather I’d recommend bringing a raft to float out past the lilly pads to a nice clear swimming spot. Highly recommend the Sleepy Loon."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! Lori provided everything we needed and checked it to make sure we were comfortable! Will be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Sleepy Loon Cottage was fantastic thanks to Lori and Mark! The cottage had everything we needed, the kitchen came complete with all cooking utensils and appliances (even spices), you would need to provide the comforts of home while away.
Lori and Mark’s communication throughout our stay was wonderful, they were extremely responsive and ready to answer any questions we had. The beds were super comfy and we were provided with a plethora of towels, linens etc! The lake was beautiful, the wildlife was awesome, we were greeted by ducks and loons, and even heard coyotes at night! So cool!
There is a beautiful breeze that comes off the lake during the day, keeping the cottage a comfortable temperature for summer months, and it was not as buggy as we had anticipated, although we did keep a campfire going (which helped). The cottage was very clean, well stocked and extremely spacious! The woodwork was beautiful too!
We brought our pup, and the cottage proved to be very pet friendly! Our pup LOVED jumping off the dock and swimming in the lake, there was so much for him to do! The neighbors were extremely friendly as well, overall very good vibes all around!
Our only regret is we didn’t book a longer stay at Sleepy Loon! We will most certainly my book a stay with Lori and Mark again!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Sleepy Loon was great. It’s at the end of a non motorized lake. It was fun to go out on the kayaks and explore the wildlife. The cabin was very well appointed and we especially liked the screened in porch. Lori and Mark were very helpful.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sleepy Loon is a beautiful cottage in an idyllic setting. The house was clean, comfortable and it's clear that the hosts care about their guests stay. Both an easy check in process and responsive hosts made it a wonderful trip. PS- you may fall in love with the local loons, so neat!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great wildlife viewing all around the lake.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sleepy Loon Cottage is a great destination for a relaxing getaway. I highly recommend.
I stayed for 4 nights in June with my girlfriend and really enjoyed the space. Lori was a very clear and responsive host.

- Screened back porch is great for rainy days
- Propane grill is in great condition
- Kayaking on the lake is really nice
Area Tips
- About 20 mins. away from the main areas of Gloversville and Johnstown. Both worth a visit.

- Can't recommend any restaurants since we grilled for all meals
- The Kane Mountain Trail in Shaker Mountain Wild Forest is a nice moderate hike
Hope you get a chance to enjoy it as much as we did!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful retreat. The lake is gorgeous. It was nice to sit on the back porch and watch the wildlife. We comfortably slept 3 adults, 3 children and and an infant. The host was responsive and very helpful. We definitely hope to return."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is really really cozy, but somehow spacious at the same time! (It definitely feels bigger than it looks in the listing.) It's so cute, stocked with everything you need, has a lovely common area to hang out in, and the beds are very comfy. We were pleasantly surprised at how cool it stayed inside during a fairly hot day, and we loved sitting on the screen porch and watching nature (saw several beavers as well as loons and deer). The cabin is located out of the way but in a small cluster of homes on the lake, still very peaceful but with the comfort of civilization nearby; it's a short (beautiful!) drive into town, which is honestly super cute and not nearly as small as I expected. So close to a ton of great trails etc., though our favorite activities were relaxing at the cabin and fishing off the dock. I appreciated the clear communication upfront & quick check ins from Lori and Mark, definitely felt like they were available for anything we needed.
Overall, this is genuinely a great value ESPECIALLY for this region. It's a lovely place to stay in a very cool part of the southern Adirondacks.
FYIs:
-We found the bugs to be no problem when the breeze was blowing off the lake, but otherwise you'll need some bug spray.
-Internet works fine, but can be a bit slow at times; generally, I'd recommend only one device on the internet at a time, and don't expect to be able to download content. That said, I did a whole Zoom call at one point with no problems.
-All internal doors are sliding or folding, so sound does carry a bit, which we actually liked because we could hang out in separate areas and still feel like we were together. The bathroom is also on the far side of the cabin from the bedrooms, so there is more privacy there. One of us went on the screen porch when we really needed quiet."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sleepy Loon Cottage is the the perfect name for the perfect place to completely relax and unwind! And unplug! The camp has been recently renovated and it is airtight and super clean. Lori was great to work with. I highly recommend this camp!!
