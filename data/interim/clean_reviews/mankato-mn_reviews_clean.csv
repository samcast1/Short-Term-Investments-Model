The five of us were away for a weekend and like to do our own cooking to avoid eating out too often while away and the house was well equipped for this. We did have on issue with the touch screen on the stove however our host was very quick to respond with suggestions on how to fix the issue and when that did not work they personally came out to fix this.
If we return to Mankato there is no doubt this is where we will be staying!"

One needs to descend approximately 6 steps to reach the unit. This studio is well lit with multiple windows present which allows natural light to enter the apartment.
In summary, we had a lovely stay & would highly recommend this accommodation."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice spot for a one night stay. Everything was new and super clean. The only drawback is the noise coming from the upstairs house.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Alex's place and enjoyed biking around Mankato. The basement apartment was well done, comfortable and had everything we needed (we didn't do any cooking, so can't speak to the specifics there but it looked like there were supplies). Alex was very helpful, including lending us some tools we needed for our bikes. As expected, there was some inevitable footstep noises that many basements have. We would stay here again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was very cute and everything we needed. Only a 5 minute drive from the Civic Center and all the downtown happenings. It was in a nice neighborhood and a park across the street. For being a pet friendly house it did not look or smell like a pet friendly house. The beds were comfortable. All in all a great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was nice and well-furnished. There was a bit of an odor, but that’s to be expected in an older home. The bed and bedding were pretty comfortable. I was mostly able to find what I needed—except for a washcloth, oddly.
The location was convenient. It was a bit busy there, but not too bad. There was a railroad track somewhere nearby but it didn’t keep me awake or anything.
The fenced yard was great for a dog!
Karen was very responsive and friendly! I would definitely recommend the house."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Karen was an amazing host and her place truly did feel like home away from home :)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen was a very responsive host which I really appreciated after a bad experience in Washington DC last summer. The house was just as represented and very clean. It was in a nice older neighborhood and felt safe and comfortable. Karen checked in several times via text to be sure we got in ok and to see if we had questions or needed anything. We were in Mankato to visit family and will definitely stay again if available.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Karen is a great communicator. She has a cute little house and we loved the location. Our pup enjoyed the back yard. We really appreciate being able to stay there with pets.

Lots of space for 2 people ..much more than we needed but it was perfect for us. Easy to get around and nice to have a Home to go yo every night. Regret not booking sooner because we missed out on an extra night or 2 there . Responsive host…appreciated efforts to get us checked in.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was exactly as pictured, very clean and easy to find! Less than 10 minutes from downtown and in a nice part of town"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it was a nice house i enjoyed staying there everything was clean and i liked where it was located
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, first and foremost! Very comfortable beds and great cotton sheets! Great location! The front door lock worked fine but the door handle was a little funky. Drawbacks: front screen door missing glass panel and piece to hold door open, and no shampoo 🙁 Luckily, my husband brought some along. A nice deep tub and great shower heads - but for older folks, some grab bars would really help😁
All in all a great place to stay when in the Mankato area! (Loved the wood furniture in the master bedroom and dining room!)"

There's a walking trail just across the street, beautiful maples in the yard, and a large lot which made it feel private.
Jaci was a great host. A great experience! I look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Mankato."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Dylan’s North Mankato house! My favorite surprise was the morning sunrise over the river valley. Wonderful view from their huge living room windows. The house is newly renovated and beautiful. Very clean and comfortable. Dylan was a great host. Communicated well and was responsive to all our questions. The house has easy access to downtown Mankato and yet is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Our kids loved that we could walk to a park that is just down the street. We will definitely book again if we are in the area!

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This stay was great! We had booked this stay rather last minute to avoid some nasty winter weather, and Dylan was accommodating and allowed us entry into the home early. My husband and I were both impressed at how nice everything was inside. Everything was clean and new in regards to kitchen appliances and items in the kitchen, which is not something that is normal in most of the bnb's we have stayed at before. The location was nice and private, although off a main road so it was easy to get to. Beds were comfortable and we had just about everything we needed."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A fantastic place to stay! We were blown away by the attention to detail in supplying ANYTHING you could possibly need and the absolutely deliciously comfortable beds.
The samples of locally made organic toiletries were such a wonderful touch. The tie out for pups was also a big surprise & incredibly helpful.
We didn’t need to use the fold-put couches so can’t speak to their comfort, but again, the real beds were fabulous. Wish we could have taken them with us.
Would absolutely recommend."

We had plenty of space and the accomodatioms were so lovely. The host was so easy to communicate with and has obviously worked very hard to make numerous cosmetic updates. We will definitely stay here agin next time we are in town.

2024-05-01,4,Group trip,Great location near campus. Met our needs for the weekend.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,Cute house in a great location. They accommodated my resquest for check in day. Our only issue was that the TV in the main living room did not work and we could of watched for a little bit. Not a big deal since we were not at the house much anyway except for sleeping.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Gloria’s while attending our daughter’s college graduation. It was perfect! We had between 4-6 people and room to sleep, bathe, and eat. The house was neat and clean with plenty of towels, linens, blankets, and pillows. There was room to park 2-3 vehicles in the driveway. She has a nice backyard, although we didn’t get to use it since it was raining. Quiet and safe neighborhood."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very clean and housed us comfortably for a weekend in Mankato. Gloria’s home is nice and has everything you could need. The only minor critique that I will mention is that I was a little surprised to find out that the host lives there full time (not while we were there) and that her things would be in the fridge and what not. I just think that should’ve been disclosed prior in the listing description. Other than that a great stay and would book again if in town! Thank you Gloria!

We will be back again."
2021-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"I expect the next guest will have a much better experience; the host owned up to the issues and made amends.
In short, this property simply was not ready yet. It is in a nice neighborhood (saw a deer in someone's yard one morning), clearly some of the rooms have been recently remodeled, the furniture and covers are very nice and there are decorative flourishes, so with time I expect the problems I encountered will be resolved."

2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,The house was great - We ended up missing our dinner because the code to get in the house was not working. This was disappointing as it was one of the main reasons we were coming in town. We got a hold of host 30 mins later but was not in enough time as we were already in a rush. There is not a lock on the door the garage which made us a little nervous . Other then these few little things the stay was great and in a great location for us.

We will stay here again when traveling to Mankato!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a cute and cozy place just outside of the campus. The house matched the photos and descriptions and the inside provided a very modern look. It was easy to get around if we needed to go out, the neighborhood is peaceful and quiet which was what I liked. It was a nice getaway for a weekend with my boyfriend."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you we loved our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""Black Sheep"" only discribes the color of the house. It by no means is a ""disgrace"" to stay at.
It has very clean, uncluttered spaces. The bathrooms are big, and it was nice to have one on each floor. Being able to park in the garage was a plus. What a blessing to have it so close to MSU/Mankato to able attend and celebrate our daughter's college graduation.

Not only that but the place was beautiful with a great kitchen.

Upon hearing of our stay, our colleagues at the conference were jealous that they hadn’t thought to reserve this place."

There is easy access to the university, good restaurants, as well as downtown Mankato from here - both are just a few minutes drive away. It was also nice to have a garage to park the car in, especially since it snowed over the one of the nights we were there.
Jenna always responded within an hour and made it clear that she was happy to help with whatever questions or concerns we may have had."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night - too short! We really thought it was so modern, clean and just what we needed for 2 couples."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looked exactly like the pictures! Very modern and tidy. The bedrooms and bathrooms are very spacious with plenty of room to store your things. Jenna was very responsive to my messages.
Two things to know if you plan to stay here. 1) There are LOTS of steps up to the bedrooms, so if that is a problem for you, this probably isn't your place to stay. 2) The downstairs floor is pretty cold in the winter, so bring slippers!
Overall, a great place to stay."

2022-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Very clean and comfortable house. Bed was very comfortable. There were some delays in communication as the host was in Australia. The listing should have mentioned that construction was starting next door—the property is owned by the host. Also entry was through the garage and there was no lock in door to garage. Overall, very good."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend The Black Sheep. It's in a great location. Super easy to access restaurants and shopping. The house is beautiful and so clean with high-quality products available.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccable design choices. I love the simplicity and style. I felt safe in the location/neighborhood. Entry was a breeze, and it was fantastic to have access to a garage to unload/load everything.
Seems great for young families (toys, high chair, etc.), but was not a good fit for me because I needed a place to work. My fault for not researching more! I was captivated by the design and ready to treat myself to a few productive days in a great space while in town. There was one small desk, so I am thankful for that.
There was also no breakfast option--not that I need much, but I was just unprepared since every Airbnb I've stayed in at least had something small like a granola bar. (Some have had supplies for me to make eggs, sausage, and toast along with juice, milk, cereal, granola bars, yogurt, and fruit ... almost like a self-serve B&B!) So it was kind of like an AirbnBYOB.
Just be prepared for those elements, and you will have a lovely space to be in! The neighborhood was quiet ... super-peaceful place. :-)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly amazing, I can’t express enough how nice and clean it was. I highly recommend staying here. I will definitely stay here again!"

Jenna was also very quick to respond any time I communicated with her. My friends and I all agreed that we would definitely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice! Location was great. Communication with Jenna was easy & responsive. Nice to have a garage as well. Any city information materials would be helpful going forward. Was unable to check in until 3:30, a half hour late due to cleaning, but no problems otherwise."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a wonderful place to stay while in Mankato nothing else compares. The decor is modern and clean with a minimalistic earth-friendly vibe. All the high-end creature comforts of home, exactly what you need while away from home. Jenna was a great host, attentive and extremely responsive, concerns and questions addressed and answered very quickly. The Neighbourhood is super quiet and as a working professional you cannot go wrong with the amenities, chief of all the internet speeds. You can get work done and enjoy your favourite streamed content/media at the same time. Definitely somewhere I would stay whenever I am in Mankato for business and/or pleasure. Thank you so much Jenna you are truly worthy of your status on AirBnB as a SuperHost and your property speaks volumes.
Cheers,
Chris."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Classic modern gorgeous simplicity at its finest. The attention to detail making this place feel like a luxurious overnight for my fiance and I. Couldn't ask for anything better!

Jenna was great about staying in touch and responded quickly to all of our inquiries."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are a party of 5 (3 adults and 2 kids) and we stayed at the Black Sheep for almost two weeks. We love the convenient location, modern interior design and quiet neighborhood. Coffee, towels, shampoo and body wash, some toys, utensils, pack and play, high chair, Netflix, etc are provided. Jenna is quick to response and accommodating to a few requests we have.
The only thing is too much sunlight in the bedrooms for us, but they are in the process of installing blackout blinds so that won’t be a problem in the future.
We would definitely stay at the Black Sheep in the future."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great house. Comfortable space. Good communication with the host. Would recommend.
(One small thing…..We found only one bath towel in the upstairs bathroom. Two additional towels were in the lower level bathroom. I’d recommend outfitting the bathrooms with more towels)."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"such a lovely home and stay. the home is tastefully decorated and thoughtfully equipped. it was just an overnight stay this yime, will look forward to a longer stay in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Black Sheep is a beautiful house, sparkling clean, and perfectly set up (there was even a high chair!) for a weekend in Mankato to attend our dear friend’s wedding. It is spacious, making it possible for old college roommates to comfortably stay together, our first time since before the pandemic began.
Jenna was great. She always responded quickly to messages and made accommodations that eased my first time mother’s anxious heart as this was the first trip of this kind with the baby. If I could give it more than five stars I would!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, modern and peaceful. Host lives close and was extremely helpful with any questions l, I would highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a quiet and modern place in Mankato!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,fantastic place
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was very clean and just want we needed to break up some days of camping. Plenty of food delivery options and very easy to check in and out!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! what a amazing weekend we had!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and new place-location is not far from just about everything-especially MSU.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at 5 Star Eco hotels that do not compare to this space! Clean, comfortable, convenient. One of the best experiences at an Airbnb for us. Having the attached garage was an added bonus. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place to stay! Jenna is very kind and responsive to messages. There are several items such as shampoo/conditioner/body wash offered as well as plenty of kitchen essentials. The house was very clean and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in Mankato to help our granddaughter with projects at her new home. This beautiful home was just what we needed after a long hard day. WE didn’t really cook or anything at the house but it is stocked very well for anything you I might have in mind. Such a beautiful and serene place. Hope to stay there again some day.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenna is an excellent host and very communicative. The house is immaculate, new, very clean and well equipped. Close to restaurants and coffee shops, the old town stores are a most see and not far away. We came for bike trails of which there are so many and they are all gorgeous. We definitely will come back to this great value!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a WONDERFUL house! A rare gem among such a limited Airbnb market in Mankato. Jenna was welcoming and considerate and helped us to feel right at home. We stayed a full week and would highly recommend this lovely home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Black Sheep! We were in town for a family wedding and had brought our nine month old. Jenna went above and beyond in providing a great place for our little trio to rest and relax away from all the family activities. The kitchen had all the basics you would need to make a few simple meals, the bathrooms were clean and the counter tops spacious enough for getting ready in the mornings. The laundry machine was a huge asset (you know if you have kids)! They even had shampoo and conditioner in the showers. The little touches were a great addition to an already beautiful and well thought out AirBnb.
My one complaint was that the windows in the bedrooms let in a lot of light in the mornings so we were awake with the sun. The curtains were pretty light so they didn't do much in the way of blocking the light. However, our little guy wakes up pretty early anyway so it wasn't a huge issue, just something a future visitor may want to be aware of.
All in all, it was a great stay! If you have a vehicle you are a 10 minute drive from lots of cute little shops and restaurants in the downtown area near the water. There is also a Target and other shopping an 8 minute drive if you find you forget anything for your trip."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean simple and good location. Easy to get around the area. Love the use of the garage to storage our recumbent bike.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Beds were comfortable and it was nice to be able to park our vehicle in the garage. Jenna was great with communication. My only (small) complaint was the curtains were white and the sun shone in every morning at 5am. Darker curtains or blinds would help. Otherwise the place was perfect!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Black Sheep served as a great home base for a three-night stay for me and my two teens. The space is clean and modern, and the beds were comfortable. We all agreed we'd happily stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This listing is nicely provisioned with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Quiet location. Easy access to everything if interest in the area. A real nice place to stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We appreciate the clean space and having a garage was a nice bonus. My kids enjoyed riding their bikes on the quiet street and there wasn’t too much for them to get into.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! Spotless and immaculate! Excellent host.....Jenna was immediate in her responses to any questions I had and made us feel so welcome. The unit is like being in a new, modern hotel but with the privacy and room that having an entire house gives you. Having access to parking inside a garage and storing our bikes there was icing on the cake! The unit is in a quiet neighborhood so very peaceful but within walking distance to food and drink. Will definitely visit again when we get back to the Mankato area!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Black Sheep is one of the best AirBnB’s I have ever stayed at. It was exceptionally clean, comfortable, and had all of the amenities you could possibly want.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at the Black Sheep was great! Easy to find and safe location. It is an amazing beautiful and clean space. I can picture “getting ready” photos for a modern bride being taken there. There is so much natural light!

We stayed 3 nights with our kids for Hockey Day MN. Location to the campus is perfect! 2 mins away in a quiet neighborhood.
There is plenty of space to sprawl out, which we needed with all of our outside gear. Use of the garage is amazing, especially in the cold weather & snow!
Bathrooms & kitchen were well stocked with everything we needed.
We highly recommend this property & will be staying there again for sure next time we visit Mankato!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another amazing stay! The Black Sheep was definitely the highlight of my time in Mankato! I’ll be booking with Jenna anytime I’m in the area!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jenna's place was a great location and place to hang out as we were in town visiting our daughter who attends MSU. Very clean and quick communication. Only thing was we picked up pizza's to cook and we weren't able to find a pizza cutter. No big deal - a knife worked. We'd definitely stay in again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a gem! You won’t be disappointed.
Spotless and welcoming.
Will book on a return trip."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my sister enjoyed our stay at the Black Sheep. The home is so beautiful and was just as described. We used the kitchen to cook a few meals and it had everything we needed. Would recommend for anyone visiting Mankato or a fun staycation.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was fantastic. The open lower level made hanging out together very easy. The kids loved having that space to move around and burn off energy too which was nice. The bedrooms and bathrooms all had a nice amount of space too. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, close to a school that has a nice playground but it was a quick trip to campus, downtown or up to the shopping area.
We will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Was staying here for one night while visiting a friend and Ali was super communicative before and during my stay. Everything was as described and in a quite neighborhood. Clean space. Would definitely stay here again if needing a place to stay while visiting Mankato.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’re a repeat at Ali’s place. It’s been the perfect place for our family to stay while visiting family in the area. We love that there’s just enough space so we’re not cramped, but not too much- we’re basically just sleeping here and eating a quick breakfast before embarking on our day with family and friends. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen had what we needed! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house , thank you for everything"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was very impressed with the cleanliness and very thankful for the water in the frig. Not enough kitchen towels. Loved having the cleaning stuff under the sink. Just a nice place all around. Nice neighbors too.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ali was very responsive and cordial I would definitely come back at her place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ali has made a place that feels like home away from home. There is something familiar and so comforting about it. Ali was incredibly friendly in her communications and responded almost immediately every time. She made me feel as though I were staying at a friends' house. If we're ever up in Mankato again, we would gladly book again!"
2024-05-01,3,Stayed one night,The neighbors above were dragging furniture across the floor at 12:30 in the morning. Otherwise the place was spotless and beautiful. Just didn’t get a great night sleep.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for graduation and the place was lovely! In a nice neighborhood and very clean! Definitely enjoyed our stay.

Once again, thank you Ali"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The space was perfect for our family of four. We spent most of our time exploring Mankato, but when we were all ready to sit back and relax, Ali's Place was exactly what we were looking for! Ali was quick to respond to suggestions on what to do around town and also replacing the Keurig after discovering a piece was missing. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us, we truly appreciate it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay and hangout!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ali’s place looked just like the pictures. It was easy to check in using a keypad and there was a driveway for parking. There were a couple of things we had to figure out (radiators can be tricky when it comes to calculating where to set the knob so you aren’t too hot); overall it was a comfortable place to sleep and hang out. The additional den/living room was really nice, it made the place feel bigger and added an element of privacy."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great comfortable space. Stayed here twice...no issues. Love it!!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, excellent location in a private neighborhood. Nice and quiet but not too far from many things to do. The kitchen was clean but the pots/pans were fairly beat up and some of them needed to be washed before we used them. Aside from some stray cobwebs, everything else was clean. One day we had hot water for our showers and the other day we had lukewarm water with no pressure. This place served its purpose as a nice cozy and secluded place to stay in Mankato."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfy and simple. Loved the beds. I slept well. Perfectly accommodated. Great communication with host
Private quiet neighborhood setting
Safe and loved it all. Thank you again. 😊"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and tidy. Much bigger than I thought it was going to be. Having 2 living rooms is great for big family stays!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would definitely stay here next time and refer Ali and her place to friends and family. We traveled with an infant and Ali was SO accommodating. The place is a perfect size (actually SPACIOUS) for beds for a group up to 5. With two ""living rooms"" definately space for inflatable as well. With a longer stay, can be great having washer/dryer! We found her to be IMMEDIATELY responsive to our messages. We appreciated the comfort to feel ""at home""- A relief when traveling with kids! We know she's family-oriented, with little feet running in the rental upstairs (they also observed the quiet hours so well.) Thank you."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the place was awesome
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for the event we were going to, very close to restaurants, very clean and had everything you would need. The bathroom shower/tub didn’t drain very fast but that could be a quick fix. Overall great place only downfall was you could hear the upstairs neighbors talking and walking around."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband, father-in-law and I stayed at Ali’s place for seven nights and we have no complaints. Lots of space for the three us, very clean, quiet area and lots of parking. A huge bonus is the washer and dryer in the unit. Ali provided clear directions and easy check-in instructions. She was always super responsive any time we messaged her. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Owner was very easy to communicate with. Nice, 2 bedroom place. Clean and free of clutter. Bed was very comfortable and clean. Off street parking is really nice. Easy to find and get into to. We were only there for about 12 hours, so it was just a place to sleep before leaving town. Would absolutely recommend to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host! Easy check-in, communicative host and great space!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Just a quick overnight stay. Never met the host but she was great about instructions and communicating . Was also very kind about check out.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and spacious. A few things to note: the bathroom vanity sink top is old and cracked around drain and faucets. We were not aware that there were 2 levels to the apartment and that the bathroom was located on a separate level than the bedrooms. The bottom step down to the bathroom is higher than the other steps so that is jarring when not prepared for it. One disappointment was that Egyptian cotton sheets were mentioned in the description but polyester sheets were on the bed. All in all, we were happier at Ali’s than in a hotel! Thanks for sharing your space with us!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay. The internet is lightening fast, which made it easy to work remotely. Ali was a great host - responded quickly to my questions and was helpful when I needed to schedule a delivery to her home. The place is on a quiet family-friendly street with a lot of parks around. The only thing that potential guests should be aware of is that the unit is a basement apartment with multi-levels."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ali's place. It was clean, spacious and homey. The private entry was nice and welcoming. She responded quickly to any questions we had and was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was spacious, comfortable, and had all the amenities to feel right at home. I had my own parking space right in the driveway. Ali even set out a bike and helmet for me to use. I would stay here again."

It’s multiple levels with a few stairs at entry (shown in photos) and several stairs to the bathroom level.
I would say it’s more of a large basement apartment than a side by side townhome/duplex. Plenty of windows for natural light."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unit was clean and comfortable. Close enough to any thing you might need, but removed from traffic to feel like a retreat. I had a lovely stay at Ali’s place."

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Ali is very kind and put us first ahead of her own family’s convenience. She let us know everything that was going on at the house and offered us the whole driveway. Second stay and everything was very clean and ready for us to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ali was great!
Communication, accommodating an early check in so the girls could get ready for commencements.

- Responsive host and check in with us
I will definitely stay here again in the future when we visit Mankato!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a nice stay. I was just accepted into grad school at Minnesota state & it’s under 10 mins away, so it worked perfectly to come visit for a few days. The area is quiet and peaceful. The space is a lot larger and nicer than it appears in pictures. Ali was very friendly & welcoming :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, comfortable and cozy! We will stay again if we are in town!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The living space was better than the pictures. Off street parking was wonderful. Would recommend.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ali was super responsive to all questions, was great with adapting to our schedule with early check in time and was great in a pinch when we needed a ride somewhere even because she was available and Uber wasn’t! Definitely recommend this place if you’re passing through Kato or there for a show or event at the event center!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The place looks as it is shown in the pictures. Check in was easy & it was a cozy stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It's cozy and comfortable but still bare enough that it doesn't feel like someone else's home. All the quality of a hotel room but cheaper.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Previous comments mentioned the place being cold but actually we were comfortable and at times a little warm. There was a space heater there and extra blankets if needed. Ali was very quick to respond. Only bad thing was there was ice on the sidewalk and in front of the door and being that we came in at night it was a little on the dangerous side. With no ice melt or sand to put down we had to be extremely cautious when we brought our bags in and out. Also it was hard to see the house number since there was no light on it. Otherwise everything else was as listed and was great. If we do another midway girls weekend we hope to be able to make it work to stay there again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ali’s place worked out great for us. Very close to Minneopa State Park and there was a really cute tea house down the street. Ali was very responsive and helpful making sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend her place!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy wasn’t exactly missing anything for essential. Truly felt like a home away from home

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ali was a great host for our son as he waited to get into his new apartment. She was friendly and responsive to all of our questions. we would recommend Ali's place!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location close to downtown! We loved having the whole half of the duplex with spacious kitchen and living room space to spend time. Parking in the driveway was nice as streets had high snow piles.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great space in a great neighborhood. Conveniently located right off the highway. Communication was great, with easy check-in instructions. This is our new favorite place to stay when visiting family in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were attentive with quick communication. Very quick to clean the driveway after the winter storm! Tons of space, bigger than pictures"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ali had a great place and she made sure we had everything we needed! We got to town a little earlier than expected and she let us check in earlier so we could get to the slopes when we got to town! We will definitely stay here again!
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place and in a quiet area. No cooking pans, but had a fully stocked cupboard with utensil's. The only two issues we had were that
1)the BnB was attached to the main heating of the house with no to cool down the rooms to a lower temperature.
2)The mattress in the main room is very saggy and old spring style. We couldn’t sleep on it and ended up sleeping on the couch downstairs.
The location is great and close places to eat, just minor comfort upgrades would go a long way. Definitely a better bed for the master, and fans to cool the rooms down would go a long way to making this a perfect BnB. We’d definitely stay again if these were updated."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed alot of airbnb's this is what it looks like in the picture's I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. For the price it's excellent

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We got together to celebrate a big birthday - sisters, Mom and I. Perfectly decorated, comfy couches and beds and lots of space for chatting, laughter and catching up. Clean, comfy and spacious. Thanks Ali!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, safe, organized, and convenient. Lives up to it’s “cozy” name. Ali was just a phone call, or message away, and always responded quickly if I had any questions, or concerns. Would definitely stay again!!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time Anb-er. I really enjoyed it. Thank you Ali for making the process easy. We had our own space and everything was private. The living space was comfortable with TV and a few games. The Kitchen was wide open and had a nice vinyl plank floor. Even the bathroom was big. It was fall with some cool nights and our host was kind enough to make it cozy with space heaters just in case. This was thoughtful but I found we didn't need them.
