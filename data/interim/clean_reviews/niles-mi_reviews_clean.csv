2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jerry and Alma's place was wonderful for our needs this trip!
Check-in was a breeze, and we were delighted by their welcoming note.
The house is conveniently located - minutes from downtown South Bend and from the Notre Dame Campus. The property feels secluded in spite of its proximity to everything, and it was very easy to get to.
The house was spacious, clean, and tidy. There was plenty of room for our small family on this trip, and we'd have room to spread out if we were traveling with a group. The kitchen is spacious and well-equipped. The bathrooms even had commonly forgotten toiletries!
The property has lots of open space and some wooded areas. We weren't feeling adventurous enough to go down to the river, but you certainly could! Our dog loved sniffing around and exploring the space.
Jerry and Alma were easy to get ahold of, and we did take advantage of the opportunity to meet them and learn more about the house. They are extremely friendly and know the area well!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect place to celebrate for my daughter and her friends. The space was exactly what we needed. Thank you for being available!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here and due to unfortunate circumstances I had to extend my stay. Tom and his wife Luann were extremely kind and accommodating to me. Just genuinely good people! I would stay here every time I travel back home if I could. Thank you so much for everything!! Still think this place is amazing!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating. They offered us an inflatable mattress and extra sheets so we could all sleep comfortably. The place is comfortable and nice. Still being renovated but it doesn't affect quality of life of the living area. Property is beautiful.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the Izzy Inn. Hosts were super friendly and responsive even as we arrived late and needed some help with extra bedding. The photos do not due justice to how spacious it is, with very large TV and leather recliners. Kitchen and bathroom were great, and loved the awesome shower. Thanks so much for having us,
Jamie"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place! I felt right at home, this home had everything I needed and more! I had the pleasure of meeting Tom and his wife in passing and they were wonderful people. I would definitely stay again and I recommend anyone that is going to be in the area to check this place out…. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful setting in nature to relax and recharge, Izzy Inn is the place! The cabin is incredibly spacious with a wall that collapses opening the entire space to the screened-in porch. The cabin is incredibly modern with tons of bells and whistles. Communication with Tom and the entire family was superb. All of my questions were answered promptly and with kindness. I highly recommend staying at Izzy Inn. To be able to simply relax, rewind and recharge while being surrounded by the sounds and beauty of nature is an incredible remedy! Thank you, Tom and Family, and of course Izzy!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I reserved this for my wife, mother and sons. They found it to be wonderful. Host was super easy to work with, they were very proactive, and had everything set up and ready at checkin. We will definitely try to stay here again next time we're in the area!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home. Perfect for large groups. Super clean with plenty of space and things to do!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The senior class of Newtown Harris absolutely loved their time there!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house exceeded all of our expectations. There was a lot to do for the kids and adults. The house was clean and had everything we needed. The host was extremely responsive. We hope to come back to this location again next year.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’d say our group of 16 had the best time possible. No one of as bored everyone had personal space and the home was unbelievable. We will return for sure. Amazing communication and a clean home.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place with a lot of activities for a larger group
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely perfect stay for a large group of families! Our kids enjoyed the basketball court and the pool while adults were able to relax around the fire pit. Hosts were extremely responsive throughout the whole weekend. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a large group of people stay here and everyone absolutely loved it. At no point did anyone feel crowded or overwhelmed, there was so much space for everyone to enjoy themselves. We never got bored thanks to the pool, pickle back, billiards, basketball, wiffleball outside or just hanging out in 1 of the kitchens. The beds were all nice and slept all of us comfortably. The house is tucked away from the rest of the neighborhood in a wooded area and is gated which was very nice. This house was great and everyone said we needed to go back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked this place for our extended family’s spring break. It was out of the ordinary as we live in the north and wanted to stay close to home this year instead of heading south. This place was perfect. Lots of great things to do for the kids and adults as well. The house was very clean and just as advertised. The pictures and descriptions are very accurate. All in all we had a great time and plenty of private space for everyone.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Cannot say anything negative about this rental or the host. The house was beautiful - just like the pictures. The warm pool, full basketball court and mini arcade room were something we could only dream of renting to have privately for ourselves. Within minutes of walking in, you felt right at home with a variety of bedrooms (with very comfortable beds/bedding) to suit any family's needs. 2 kitchens, endless bathrooms, 2 sets of washer/dryers and dish washers kept our large group beyond accommodated. It was secluded enough to feel like a true retreat yet minutes away from Notre Dame and major stores/restaurants. We have already talked about coming back and have recommended it to others. What a wonderful stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible place to stay, especially for large groups.
Don was a great host, very responsive and communicative.
Property was even better in person than the photos! Very clean, with lots of fun activities, especially the indoor pool and gym.
Location was conveniently located near supermarkets, food and shopping.
Will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at the home for our annual staff retreat. We spent our time working on planning for our non-profit's next fiscal year's work as well as spending time team building with one another. The house was perfect for both types of activities. We had room to spread out and have discussions in small groups. We were able to get breaks in the gym, pool, and outdoors. The house was spacious, clean, and provided the privacy we needed as a team. Instructions for both checking in and out were clear and they answered every question we had promptly. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay that exceeded all our expectations. A+ communication from the host, and lots of attention to detail in the house. The house (villa?) was not only stylish and well-maintained but also exceptionally clean. The location was perfect, offering both convenience and plenty of privacy on it's own small forest of land. The incredible amenities made the stay truly memorable. This Airbnb truly exemplifies hospitality at its finest, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an exceptional and memorable retreat."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If your family has grown and you have found it difficult for everyone to get together, this is the place to go. The 9 of bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, multiple kitchens, and especially the Gym and Pool, made this the perfect place for our entire family to come and reconnect and enjoy ourselves. It was even more than what we expected. The children had so much safe play time and the adults had time to just sit and talk and feel like a family again. I Highly recommend this property for any large group that wants to just have fun and enjoy quality time together. Everyone in our family wants to go back and do it again. Worth every single penny!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a group of 21 friends & family & this property worked wonderfully for us. It's very spacious with plenty of activities for all. 2 large kitchens near each other with plenty of cupboards & 4 refrigerators in house worked great for our large group. The basketball court was a unique treat- having pickleball was a bonus. The gaming area with video games & pool table was also great- & a fair bit of euchre was played in there. A lot of board games were played on the big kitchen tables. Lots of tvs with streaming options- had the Lions winning playoff game on throughout the house. Last but not least we loved the pool area & really enjoyed some extra warm temperatures in the room & the water itself. Matthew was very helpful & responsive to our needs.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a large gathering with multiple families and kids. Everyone loved the house, and there was so much to do for everyone! Indoor pool area was amazing!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place and convenient for all ages. We and the kids love it.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our family booked the house for a Christmas celebration in Dec. There were 11 adults and 8 kids (ages 13-3). The space was great for the group - with plenty of space for the kids to run around and the adults not hear them.
Unfortunately, there were a few kinks that put a bit of a damper on the weekend… the house would not unlock, the pool heater broke, & the house sound system didn’t work. Upon arrival, the management company was quick to respond and were able to unlock to door remotely, but then I was notified that the pool heater was not working. Extremely disappointing, since it was a main amenity that made us book the house. We were strung along on day one in hopes it could be fixed, but were informed late that day that it was a custom part and it’d be broken for the duration of our stay. Additionally, they noted the issues with the sound system were known.
Overall, it’s a nice house, they ended up comping part our stay for the issues, but not the glowing 5-stars I expected."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent stay! We had 10 adults and 7 kids in our group and it was plenty of space. There is so much to do on site, a little something for everyone. The home is clean and comfortable. It was very well stocked compared to other Airbnbs that I have stayed in."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home met and exceeded our expectations. The property was gorgeous, had all the amenities our group wanted, and the cleanliness was beyond what you expect in a vacation rental. The responsiveness of Don/Matt was helpful and quick. We thought all the spaces were functional and roomy. The kids said “this is the best house ever” and we ALL hope to be back next year."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Spectacular facility, perfect for a corporate event or a weekend with friends. It was well furnished, clean and the pool was very warm. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We hosted a retreat here and Don's AirBNB was perfect. There is a ton of meeting space, nice roundtable feel for the kitchens, and the amenities helped us incorporate fun activities. The location is private and provides beautiful scenery. I would absolutely stay here again. No complaints!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to stay at a place that will leave people in awe when they step through the front door, book this place! You won’t regret it! Had an absolute blast staying here with family! Will definitely try and stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Weather or time of year should not be a factor in booking. Lots to do right on property. Our group (20) used and enjoyed all of the features on the property. Great for multi family vacation or large group event. We will consider this for our next meeting.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place, somehow exceeded my lofty expectations. Host was extremely responsive and made everything super easy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found this home because we were looking for an indoor pool, but we got so much more than a great pool. The home is beautiful and really well taken care of. The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious and high-end. We all enjoyed playing basketball and dodgeball in the gym and using the game room, backyard, and trampoline. The kitchen was well equipped, but we also ran into ""town"" and ordered food from nearby restaurants.
We were a large group of adults and children and everyone had something to do all day and plenty of privacy at night. The owner was super responsive when we had questions.
This home was amazing and we will definitely be coming back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing home that exceeded expectations!! Pictures don’t do this property justice. We had a group of 20 us from toddlers to grandparents. Everyone loved the home! Everything was new, modern and worked perfectly!
Pool and lounge area were a hit for the teens. The water temp was perfect.
We loved the indoor basketball court and game room. Enjoyed sitting outside in the evening by the fire pit with a private, peaceful view of the wooded area.
The tech in the home was a little challenge at the start for controlling the music and temperature, but Don was a super responsive host and we figured it out quickly.
Will definitely rent again if back in the area. Thanks Don!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay in Niles. The house was clean and spacious, everyone in our large party had their own room and bathroom. The indoor pool, gym, and huge backyard kept everyone happy and busy. Will definitely be back again!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent host, beautiful home, soooooo much fun! Worth every penny! Will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First time using a Airbnb, and Joanie made it one of the best trips of my life. I was shocked at how kind, thorough, and accommodating Joanie was. Her place has to be the absolute best place to stay in the area, it was amazing. Literally zero bad things to say about everything, she made it the perfect vacation."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joanie’s place was a peaceful respite in between a weekend of my daughter’s graduation activities. Since it was close to Saint Mary’s, my family often returned to Joanie‘s place after an activity to rest, eat, and get ready for the next activity. With the exception of a wood chipper next door that was run all through the night the first night, there was only pretty bird song and an occasional deer visitor. The full kitchen and BBQ space outside were perfect to prepare meals, the bathroom was spotless, and the washer and dryer were greatly appreciated so we could all fly home with clean clothes. The surroundings are beautiful!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Harry’s apartment in Niles exceeded our expectations. We were attending a wedding at Hidden Vineyard Wedding Barn and wanted to find somewhere nearby, and this apartment was the perfect spot. We had no idea what to expect in Niles and we found it to be a super cute, quaint town with lots to explore. The apartment is nearby restaurants, coffee shops and dessert places. Super cute area. There was a carnival and live music going on in town which was fun to walk to. We loved the local recommendations from Harry like Iron Shoe Distillery. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and spacious. We felt very relaxed during our stay here and would highly recommend it for a weekend trip!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed before and Harry has always been helpful and accommodating. The unit is a beautiful modern update on a downtown historic building and is super charming, private and spotless! I visit Niles often and think that I have stayed at every Air B&B downtown near the river walk... I like that this is a single unit versus most that are broken up into multiple units. found it to be much quieter and felt more secure knowing I was the only person with access to the entrance. It was exactly what I hope an AB&B should be when I book. GREAT HOST, GREAT PROPERTY, GREAT LOCATION!..5 Thanks Harry, you have a beautiful property, I will be back!"

They left extra items food items such as fresh fruits, pizzas and yogurts and additional toiletries in case you forgot something! They really take the extra thought and time to do what they can to go above and beyond for their guests. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here several times now, these hosts are wonderful! The place is always clean and tidy, the hosts respond very quickly to my messages, and they are flexible when they can be to accommodate my work schedule. I really enjoy relaxing here after work, it’s just next to the river and right downtown next to shops and restaurants-all within walking distance. I’d recommend this spot to anyone staying in Niles. 🙂"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were in Niles Michigan for a weekend concert, and we decided to stay at Harry's place downtown Niles MI. A beautiful one bedroom apartment that exceeded our expectations. Easy to find and easy access. Convenient parking in the parking lot adjacent to the apartment entrance. Within walking distance to River Front Park, nice restaurants, coffee shop/bakery, and the Wonderful Theater, where they show current movies for $5 and popcorn for $2.
The apartment was spotlessly clean with functional furniture and a confirmable bed with with nice linens. A great Kitchen with everything we needed during our stay, and then some.

Two TCL Roku modern big screen smart TV's capable of automatically erasing personal info so you don't need to. We set the heat to 70 when we arrived and the modern heat pump did a good job. There was cold beer and pop in the fridge, fresh fruit on the island and a frozen pizza in the freezer. We had a beer and a Vernor's and left a beer. We were dining out so had plenty of leftover's so the pizza is still up for grabs. The bathroom and shower we good with a serious vent fan and the towel's were great.

I was familiar and excited about the downtown location.
Harry was very proactive with apartment & local information plus ample warnings of the entrance steps (FYI: my 87yr old mom was able to slowly climb them).
The apartment was decorated to be homey, comfortable and supplied with anything needed.
The fireplace was a bonus for a cool rainy weekend.
We would gladly stay here again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Lauren's Lillypad Cottage! The deck was amazing, so close to the water and awesome sandy beach. Entrance to the water was very shallow which would be nice for little ones. The inside of the home was just as shown, elevated decor, spotlessly clean and had every amenity we needed. The space is very large, and open but also had nice quiet areas perfect for reading a book, or for afternoon naps. We walked just a block away to Wagners Lakeside Grill for great local fish as well as other great options. I can't say enough about this little slice of heaven, but that we can't wait to return and make more memories."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time! The house is perfect for a little get away! We enjoyed the private beach on a quiet lake- the host had multiple floats/paddle boards available to use. The house was well stocked with kitchen appliances/dishes and had ample beach/bathroom towels. The host, Lauren, was extremely kind and responded quickly! I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking to spend some time at the lake!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic getaway with our puppy! The place had everything you could need and beach front access. We loved going for a walk each morning, lounging at the beach during the day and making dinner on the grill every night.
Lauren gave some great recommendations for wine tasting, local restaurants and coffee shops. We found a nearby dog park one afternoon and our pup loved it.
We loved the house and everything about the trip. It was so easy to communicate with Lauren and everything was as she described it. We look forward to staying another time!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a true gem! Everything was so clean & we loved the decor! The lofts & upstairs common areas were beautiful! The beds were comfy & the showers were awesome with their rainfall shower heads!
We never got connected to wifi. It kept kicking us off when trying to sign in, so that was disappointing. I phoned our host to get clarification, but it still did not ever connect. We were only there 1 night or I would have contacted the host again.
Be sure to look at all of the photographs so you understand where to enter! Also, look for the text from your host for your door code, etc., as the one listed through the airbnb app was different than the text we received! I can see how that could become confusing.
We walked to 2nd & Main Coffee Shop (awesome) & The Rage (food was decent & the building is cool)! The river trails were also a great walk!
The only thing we thought we could have used, was a bit more light in the TV area. Not a deal breaker though! We HIGHLY recommend!"

It fit our family of six comfortably and was decorated and designed exquisitely. The only disclaimer is that the air conditioner runs loudly, but Sage did provide earplugs. That being said, I would have no qualms about using it again. I would also say that Sage is a true super host, and I would recommend her and Unique Stays to anyone looking for a great place to stay!"

It's a clean, comfy stay and beautifully decorated and the short river walk is nice. It's a great value for how nice it is. The only downsides at all are the paper thin walls (can hear EVERY. THING.)

thanks ladies for a lovely place to stay :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You never go into an Airbnb and get more than you’re expecting. Unique Stays was one of the best places I’ve stayed in for the price. The space was larger than I thought, way nicer than the pictures do justice, and it’s in an absolutely prime location. Me and my girlfriend spent our one year anniversary at one of their lofts, and it sincerely blew us both away. We will absolutely be return guests. For any first times guests wondering if this is the place for them, it’s a great find."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a GREAT place for a couples' weekend ! Each pair has their own romantic room with a unique farmdoor closure.

And bring your Scrabble game and a deck of cards and have a lovely weekend !"

Unit 10 actually has two bathrooms and nice king size bed in one of the bedrooms (queen in the other). Also a full size bed in the loft with TV (also tvs in both bedrooms and in the living room). There is also a small sofa bed in living room. We really enjoyed our stay! Only wish the windows could open to get a bit of fresh air. We will be back. Thanks!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great choice!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect one night stay for our family of 4!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in apartment 10 for 3 days and it was perfect for our trip. We loved the location due to it’s convenience to South Bend.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was clean and cozy. Located in such a cute town with so much within walking distance. Loved our stay and would definitely recommend
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Unit 10 is such a beautiful space with plenty of room for you and your family (3 beds and 2 bathrooms). The unit is clean, cozy, and seriously cute. It has a B&B feel on the second floor of an office building with businesses operating in the suites below. This is not an apartment, but you’ll find amenities just steps beyond your door. The only part of our stay we didn’t appreciate is housekeeping knocking on our door 20 mins before check out."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely get away spot especially for the weekend. Fast communication, easy check in and very clean. Would definitely stay again!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just want to say the owners are very nice and respond very fast. I mean - within minutes if you need help during your stay.
Though pictures to do not the place justice and the room is actually bigger than what the pictures show. Each bedroom has their own shower that have two shower heads.
The only problem I had was our door code didn't work. Our door never locked back once we got into the bnb. We could only lock it from the outside. Also we couldn't use the Guest WiFi- so we had to contact the owners again to gain access.
Other than that, we'd stay in Niles again and at the place. Absolutely loved the asthestics."

Beautiful location by river, clean, modern and affordable."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I went with some friends to see a Notre Dame night game. This place was great to stay at because we were a very short drive to campus and the location made it so easy to get in and out of the game day traffic.
The space was INCREDIBLY clean and comfortable. The communication by the management team (Sage) was terrific. I had to call a few times to ask questions about directions and wifi access. Slade was very helpful, cheerful, and responsive. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Great job!
One note to maybe help in finding the place...it is in a building with some offices on the ground floor. If coming in at night, it will look like a closed building. But, at the front of the place, there is an access door to the upstairs where all the units are. So, just park in front or off to the side and go to the front and you'll see the sign.
Again, great place!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay in Unit #10! It was a clean and lovely space and had everything we needed. The bathrooms (especially the showers) were amazing! Location was perfect and was walking distance from the adorable downtown area. Check this place out!

We were about 25 minutes from Warren dunes, 45 minutes fron the outlets at Michigan City, and just a couple minutes walk from some great restaurants and of course, the riverwalk. The building is made of ten units, all are different sizes with different amenities, but share common areas. We were very pleased with the location, the amenities, and the cleanliness of the unit itself. The building is quiet, even during business hours with the businesses below. We had an issue with the door not locking the second day and the property manager sent the cleaning lady to fix it in a matter of minutes! We would absolutely stay again. (Fyi: we also had our 5 yo and 7 mo with us)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very cute, clean, and comfortable! About 30 min away from St. Joseph and walking distance from restaurants and cafes! There is no kitchen, plates ect but are not really necessary as there are places to eat close. There is a mini fridge and microwave. The beds were comfortable and the area was very quiet and nice. There is a beautiful river in the backyard as well. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent suite. You wouldn't get this much room at a hotel for this price. And there were two bathrooms, which was a plus because the description stated there was one. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable. The host was very responsive. We needed bedding for the sofa-bed, and it arrived less than 15 minutes after I contacted them. There were free laundry facilities in the common area, which was very convenient."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing service.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is incredibly clean and well decorated. The beds are comfortable as well as the living area.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The apartment was just as expected.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so cute and so easy to stay in. I was in a wedding at the Grand LV and it was so conveniently located. If you are having a wedding there you should consider renting this whole place out for your guests! Everything was set up very comfortably and the space was quite quiet. I loved the shared community spaces and also having everything you needed in your own space.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Met my sister and her husband for a weekend . Location was great for places we wanted to visit. Plenty of room for 4 adults; 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. Excellent communication; hassle free check in and check out."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice two bedroom suite. No kitchen (I might have missed this in other reviews), but also a lack of cups for drinking water or having coffee in the morning. Not a big deal since there is a coffee shop right up the block!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A little tough to find for the first time but besides that a fantastic accommodation and great value
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amazing value for a longer term stay! Gorgeous little location on the river, great amenities, clean, and exactly as pictured. WiFi was strong and the complimentary coffee saved my ass a couple days. Would def come back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"The loft we stayed in was a 2 bed, 2 bath unit. There is a small mini fridge and microwave in the space, but there isn't a full kitchen for use. The space was very clean and exactly as pictured."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean and veryspacious
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a relaxing getaway
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,feel. It’s a truly unique experience.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, our stay with Unique Stays as our host was impeccable! We always book with them when we travel to this area. Thanks, again!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place in a decent area. We didn't know the area and that always concerns me, but this place was very safe. The first floor of the building has offices. There are 10 loft apartments on the second floor. No elevator though for those who may require it.
In the common area, there is a bank of four very new and large washers and four driers, all free to use. Very nice! However, there is no laundry detergent available, not even for purchase. We hadn't planned to do laundry since we were only there for the weekend, but mouthwash spilled in one of our suitcases and I found myself washing clothes by hand in the sink late at night since I didn't want to venture out at midnight in an unfamiliar area to search for laundry detergent. I recommend you bring laundry detergent ""just in case"".
The heating/air conditioning worked well, but since it is a refurbished loft, the large blowers in the ceiling were very loud when they kicked in, waking us up. If you are a light sleeper, that may be a problem.
The unit doesn't have a hair dryer, iron or a place to hang clothes (wall rack but no hangers provided) so please bring those if needed. These were indicated on the amenities list, but not everyone would catch that these common items are missing, so I thought I'd point them out.
Our cleaning crew missed a few spots like the microwave, one of the garbage cans and crumbs on the floor. While the place was nice, all of these things added up to a four star rating instead of 5 stars."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay‼️

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was a bit of a surprise! It was stylish and interesting and located on an adorable river walk. We knew nothing about the area and walked to have drinks and pizza at a cute spot nearby. The host left chocolates and there was an awesome area to get coffee. The beds were super comfy and the bathrooms were really beautiful! Our thermostat seemed to be malfunctioning and the place was too warm, but Courtney responded quickly and sent someone to check it after we left (we were there one night). She was very kind and assured me that our experience was her first priority. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was very nice, we loved staying here! It was right next to downtown. The apartment was beautifully decorated and we'll kept. The host was very accommodating and informative. Since it was an apartment, we could hear the group staying next to us, but the noise was not too bad at all. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Unique stylish spot. Close to everything in Niles and not far from South Bend. Hosts very very courteous and accommodating. There was building and kid noise that was unexpected but tolerable. I would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy house in a nice quiet neighborhood! It was perfect for our stay while visiting the Lake Michigan area
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here during graduation weekend and it was perfect! It was in a quiet neighborhood and had a large backyard. There was a full kitchen so we were able to cook all our meals. Jordan had many thoughtful touches like some snacks and toiletries in case you forgot anything. He was a very responsive host and the house was a perfect size! Overall a great price for a great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed a 4 night stay at Jordan’s place while visiting Niles. It was a very spacious and comfortable place, located in a quiet neighborhood, all at a reasonable rate. I couldn’t ask for more. Jordan was a great communicator and a five star host. I would definitely recommend this place to others!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lona was incredibly welcoming and friendly. The home and property are beautiful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful setting. can walk down to the river which is like your own private park and could launch kayaks.. she has up to three bedrooms She rents with one and a half shared bath between those three rooms. we took the two rooms upstairs which each had a queen bed and a queen air mattress. half bath is on the upstairs with two bedrooms and the full bath is on the main floor with a bedroom there ( we did not see that/ did not utilize). she made us wonderful breakfast and even provided menus to choose from which was marvelous. she is an excellent cook and very sweet and responsive and friendly. there are two house cats but they will not be seen unless you're a cat lover and want to entice them to get to know you. bath towels were soft and luxurious. only one bedroom upstairs has an AC window unit, the other was a bit warm but since we stayed in May, it wasn't a big problem. there are a lot of lovely outdoor spaces including fire pits and patio furniture. Highly recommended."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay for my family, perfect for the occasion we planned. Lona was friendly and accommodating.

You can also access the river for fishing and kayaking directly from the yard. Lona is an incredible host. She was super friendly and helpful. She really made us feel special.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful riverfront property and Lona is a lovely host! She went above and beyond to accommodate and welcome me. My trip got cut short, so I didn’t get a chance to explore the neighborhood very much. The water was smooth like glass and gorgeous though!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful country setting amazing host will definitely return if i am in the area thank you so much Lona.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay for the weekend. It was just what we needed. And the price for this amazing 3 bedroom home was great too. It didn't cost us an ""arm and a leg"" and was perfect. What a great home. Will plan on staying here in the future if it's available as we come to Michigan quite a bit."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Jeff was helpful from the first correspondence we had. We stayed there during a winter storm - Jeff had cleared the driveway before we got there and was there again after more snow fell. Super friendly! The house matched the description and the photos. We felt right at home. Would definitely stay there again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,It was a good place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeffrey's house was so comfortable and inviting, like visiting a good friend or relative. He thought of everything we may need during our stay and was 100% on top of communication. The neighborhood seemed very nice and the scenery was gorgeous, especially in October when the the colors were changing. My three friends and I had plenty of space to move around without feeling cramped, since there are three bedrooms, plus living room, bathroom & kitchen. We were able to make our own meals since the kitchen is fully stocked with utensils, dishes, pans, etc. Fresh autumn mums & sedum in vases were a thoughtful touch. It's obvious that Jeffrey cares very much about the comfort of his guests and wants them to have the best possible experience. However, we were not informed prior to our stay that Jeffrey grows a patch of marijuana in the backyard, which he blamed for the strong odor inside the house. It smelled to me and all of my friends like pot had been smoked inside the house."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was perfect for what we needed. House was beautiful. Beds very comfortable. Whole place was very comfortable. Loved watching the wildlife out of the kitchen window. Hummingbirds on feeder, squirrels came up on porch. We could not have asked for more. Everything was supplied and thought of. We plan on coming back in May!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great 3 night stay for our family as we moved a daughter into Notre Dame. Older generation charm with clean rooms and comfortable beds in a quiet neighborhood not too far for a daily commute to South Bend. Jeffrey is a thoughtful host who set us up well. He was available yet gave our family space and privacy.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The house is located in a tranquil rural area. Very comfortable and spacious. An excellent value! Jeffrey was very accommodating and helpful. I would recommend a stay here.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeffrey’s house was cute, cozy and clean, and he went the extra mile to be a good host! He did as he said and respected our privacy and we didn’t hardly even notice he was there. It worked well for our party of 3 adults, 2 kids, and was only 35 min from Warren Dunes State Park, which was our vacation destination. As a family traveling on a budget, we appreciated being able to stay at a comfortable house with plenty of space for an affordable price."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We rented at this airbnb so we can go to an event at Notre Dame University. The neighborhood when you drove in felt like home very pretty and quiet The house had everything the kitchen was fully stocked. Everything on the listing was correct the 3 bedrooms were big enough for all of us and the living room was comfortable. The house does look like my grandparents house but very clean, And Jeff was the perfect host we talked a little bit about our activities when I finally met him, it is very secluded and private. Jeffrey even allowed me to send a package ahead to his address and he had it waiting for me when we arrived. we had a great week and Jeffrey was top notch very nice and a great host. We come once a year and we will definitely return to this Airbnb it is a gem!"

The house was stocked with just about everything you would need to feel comfortable. Thoughtful post it notes to let you know where things were. We even had some great conversations with Jeff.
The surroundings are beautiful and well maintained. Neighborhood is quiet and just about 5-10 minutes from Walmart and some restaurants.
We would definitely recommend this home when visiting Michigan."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely, quiet neighborhood, accurately described home and amenities. Jeffrey was helpful, respectful and available when needed. Even immediately fixed the broken toilet handle ( we broke) with no big deal.
He is kind and went the extra mile to be sure we were comfortable. Furnished coffee and goodies, and agreed to play cards with us (yay!).
We have alot in common and plan on remaining friends. (and of course, we loved his cats!!)"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was just perfect!! When I travel I look for BNBs as they are convenient and affordable. If you are looking in this area PICK THIS ONE!!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I stayed here for Christmas break. We go to Nile’s every year so we knew it would be a great location, but the stay surpassed our expectations. There was enough room to breath and have your own space with having a big family stay. There were more than enough toiletries and towels. There was a Christmas tree as well adding to the comfy and coziness of this place. Very affordable and one of the cleanest places we’ve been. Looking forward to the next time we visit."

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, furniture was comfortable, rooms were large, beds were comfortable, kitchen was stocked with all the nessary items to make it feel like a home and not an extended stay hotel suite, all you need to do is bring your suitcase."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have stayed in several AirBnB’s and Jane’s house was so comfortable that I stayed an extra day.
Loved the bedroom downstairs bc stairs are taxing for me.
There are windows all around and the house can be full of sunshine and light.
I judge houses by the feeling I get from them. Jane’s house is loved and happy. And the cost was very reasonable. I will stay again and recommend Jane’s place to everyone.
Ps. It’s only a 20 minute drive to Notre Dame. And 30 minutes to the beautiful beaches of Lake Michigan."

Great location close to area restaurants."

All the details were thought out, especially the small things like soaps, garbage bags, etc, that are difficult to account for when traveling a great distance. The location was perfect. Just a short walk over the bridge to downtown for restaurants and shopping. We will definitely look to book again if the need arises!"

2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"This lovely home was perfect for a family wedding held at Morris Estates. Had enough bedrooms to accommodate my family of 7.

Could not use the bathroom,
Clean home, well stocked kitchen! With extras!!!!"

If we are going to visit the area again, and I am sure we will, I will check with Jane first!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place that's walking distance to some of the best spots in Niles. Place was clean and as advertised. Has fenced in backyard and reasonable pet cleaning fee. Also has a well stocked kitchen. We would definitely stay again.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Super cute loft apartment that was very comfortable for my daughter and I! Easy to locate with the clear provided instructions and looked exactly like the photos. Had everything we needed. Only downside to this location was the building provided little to no sound dampening – we were loudly awakened around midnight by another family coming in who didn't go to bed until around 2. Other than that, we had a lovely stay and would go again."

2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Love the decor, a few added amenities might have been nice like some utensils so we could eat our leftovers from Mom's. Of course I didn't pack a hair dryer. Suggestion, take out the dresser and put in a chair with a back or a small loveseat. There's no where to sit except the bed and stools. Will be back"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I booked this last minute for a staycation. Host contacted me immediately to get me all checkin information. The unit is recently updated and clean. Would stay again.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place is in a great location. I loved the walking trail behind it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Squeaky clean.
Super cool.
Regarding every part of the design.
Of the room.
Airplugs and chocolate.
Was a nice touch. The common areas.
Were immaculate
And again plain cool. We have already checked out their website and will be using them
at other locations."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great: The onsite staff was attentive and friendly. The shower was luxurious.
Good: The room (and building itself) was clean and well taken care of. It’s close to downtown and the riverside walking path is steps from the building.
Bad: I wish the listing made it more clear that there was no elevator and the room was on the second floor. Also, i wish it was clearer that the room was the size of a large closet. As others have said the walls are thin and you can hear the neighbors TV / voices even at low volumes.
Ugly: The ladder to the top bunk was steep and dangerous looking. Did not attempt it."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quick trip!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. very local and easy check in! would stay again !

2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay in Niles! The apartment was exactly like they described it, and the room, beds and bathroom were very clean. I would definitely stay here again. The only thing I would better prepare for was that this is in a complex, there are other apartments, and the walls are very thin. We could hear other people talking and watching TV in their rooms. This didn't both us, and they have strict quiet hours and provided ear plugs, but it was definitely noticeable"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful room right off the St. Joseph river. Perfect area for a nice walk by river. Very close to downtown, restaurants and movie theater. Excellent prices for the quality of the rooms. Would recommend 100%"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful place! Will definitely book again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love the place it was very cozy and I hope to stay there again sometime.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was nice! Only thing that I didn’t really like was that the bed was a little to stiff.
Also the bathroom door needs to be fixed didn’t close properly. Other than that my stay was great!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had trouble with the tv. The staff responded to my questions right away. Location is on the riverfront where there is a trail for walking. Also within walking distance of downtown. I enjoyed my stay very much.
Only negative thing—the walls are thin and you can hear conversations from the next room."
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Our host was extremely clean. From the moment you walked in you could tell that someone takes a ton of pride in how the units look and are presented. The unit was beautifully decorated and perfectly cleaned and sanitized. I keep pushing this because hosts don’t always take this much pride in attention to detail. We did have a hick up while there, but the host desperately tried to fix the situation during my stay. They were very responsive in communicating with me once they knew there was an issue. They tried their best to rectify the situation and I appreciated the effort. I would recommend this air bnb to others who are looking in Nile’s . Thank."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say enough great things about this cute little gem!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay!! We had a great time!! Super cozy and cute!

2022-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Very noise, and location is not clear upon arrival. Bring toiletries with you."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice location !
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,My daughter found the lofts where I stayed in Niles Michigan for 7 days. I’m so grateful she did her research and recommended it. The area was peacefully located next to flowing river with walking paths and close proximity to the downtown area. The room was clean and comfortable and the hostess was punctual with her communication and directions on how to make my stay the best possible experience. If I ever return I hope the property is still operation and available. I would recommend it highly to anyone traveling to the Niles Michigan area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location, very clean and easy to get to. Washer and dryer are provided. Would definitely book here again"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place to stay in Niles, Michigan. Clean, beautifully decorated units."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax after a long day at work. Cold A/C and a shower fit for a king! Nice comfortable bed and to top it off great service. Had a problem with the WiFi and the owner helped us in a very quick manner. Great place and great service.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"our stay was overall very enjoyable. there are plenty of pros and cons, but i will just list a few of each.
- a few pros: good (safe) neighborhood, extra pillows/blankets, plenty of room for two people, close to several malls, beaches, etc., and the host responded quickly when we needed help.
- a few cons: the bathroom door does not shut properly (which causes a lack of privacy), there was human hair left on the bathroom walls when we first arrived (i assume from a past guest), and the bed frame has a large bar on the front of it that blocks your ability to watch the tv.
i would recommend this place, but be aware of the cons that i have listed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute and cozy loft, very comfortable stay. Walkable to the (few) restaurants and bars in Niles that were open. The lofts were located in a medical office style walkup building which was a bit confusing when we first pulled up, but found the sign for the Unique Stays door on the left door's entrance. There doesn't seem to be much insulation between units as we could hear our neighbors having a muffled conversation. I would recommend bringing some white noise if you need quiet/consistent environment to sleep. Roughly 30 minute drive to Benton Harbor / St Joseph. Great place to stay if you want to get out of that chaos a bit but still want to visit."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay but recommend ear protection
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This space is comfortable, clean and so cute. Location at the edge of downtown is awesome for walkable access to restaurants and parks"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent little studio overlooking a riverwalk. Missy & Sage were very attentive and perfect hosts. The studio was charming and well decorated, with cute lights strung across the room. The bathroom felt like my very own private spa. The whole space was a very relaxing place to come to after a long day of work."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place very easy and clean

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was amazing. I ended up having to stay beyond the original date and Unique Stays was very communicative and helped me extend my stay by providing multiple options. Both lofts I stayed in were extremely clean, esthetically pleasing and functional. I will definitely be staying again when I return to visit my family."
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice apartment, with a wonderful bathroom. The only issue is the noise due to the thin walls. Some nights I needed to sleep with noise cancelling headphones to block out the sounds coming from the neighboring rooms."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The walls are too thin.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy to find and great communication. Worth the drive to Niles for our visit to Notre Dame."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommend this space for a 1-2 person stay. The location has a great view of the river. It’s close to restaurants too. The room was clean, it smelled nice, and it was easy to park on-site. The a/c was nice as it got a little warm during my visit. The shower was amazing and even without a closet there was plenty of storage. The only drawback is that the walls are pretty thin. I could hear my neighbors’ conversations and TVs playing. Definitely will stay here again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! A perfectly small-sized stay with awesome style and nice levels of coziness. There are a couple coffee bar sections, laundry, seating areas, etc. and we just loved it. Absolutely everything we needed for our short trip!"

2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute place. Thin walls though.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Walls are VERY thin. Heard neighbors conversations, laughter, and screaming children for the duration of what was supposed to be my relaxing getaway."
2021-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"Your place was beautiful, clean, and the bed comfortable. The location was great and would be nice for a short vacation or weekend stay."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazingly cute loft. Clean, nice location, a little noisy from thin walls, but I’d imagine it to be just like apartments.
Construction was going on during our stay, but all around it was quite nice and peaceful setting!
Exactly what we needed and great price."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Small but nice and economic. Nice folks!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The best
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful location and set up. Lots of extras not even listed in the description. Things like bugspray, hand sanitizer, hot dog forks.... the list goes on. The heated blanket and heater were amazing and kept the tent comfortable all night. Beautiful decorations. Took a walk around the property and the front area with the basketball set up and volleyball court were very cute and fun. Location to the dunes were perfect. Will definitely visit again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice little wooded retreat not too far off the beaten path. Accommodations were comfortable, I enjoyed walking around the property (day and night)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute affordable getaway! We celebrated our 10 year anniversary there and had the best time. Took a 30 minute drive to the beach which was breath taking! Definitely recommend!!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Booked this cute little glamping spot in a spur of the moment for me and my daughter. We got in when it was dark and Melissa had a fire already started, torches going, lights on and heater on in tent. My daughter loved it and so did I. Highly recommend, will be back! Fantastic place and people!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, peaceful weekend in the woods. Alpacas were great neighbors."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time, the moonlight walk was awesome."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I took my girls up for a quick spring break trip and glamping experience! Everyone loved the space. The animals were so cute! The blankets and heater kept us warm at night and having fire starters provided was great! Smores were delicious! Melissa was an excellent host and we will be back again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved glamping here! We were worried it would be too cold because the low was 36 when we stayed, but the yurt stayed so nice and toasty! If we were too cold by the fire, we could go in and warm up for a few. The alpacas were so cute! We would love to revisit when it warms up a bit, or maybe in the fall. If you are looking for a unique experience, don't hesitate to book this spot, regardless of the season!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we had a lovely time. it was a cute set up. we sat by the fire for awhile and took a moonlight walk through the garden. we would definitely recommend staying here for something new!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Delightful.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an incredible experience, this place was truly magical just like the humans hosting. Can’t thank ya’ll enough!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first time glamping, and we will definitely do it again. Lots of privacy, and we'll maintained. Worth every penny, even in cold weather! Love it! Thank you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I could go on and on!! This place was adorable & affordable! We absolutely loved it! It really is the small details that make it the best! Like my name on the chalkboard when we got there. Everything is so well stocked even ice and water! Heated yurt. Lots of extra blankets SUPER cumfy. Even the bathroom (compost) was incredibly impressive! But the property itself was the highlight! They have alpacas, chickens, a small park, vollyball sand, a super inventive basketball free throw game, the most beautiful yoga spot I ever seen and hiking trails! Pet friendly!! The old blue bus is seriously so beautiful and charming. The place is great in the day but WAIT TILL DARK! Everything is lit up. I would love to see the lights go even further into the woods to light up the full walking trail. This place was great and I CAN NOT WAIT to come back! Hosts were so kind and down to earth. Very responsive. Even offering a tour in the morning but we left out early. Must return!! So worth every penny"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The yurt was SUCH a great find! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a peaceful stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is magical. I wish we had more time to stay. Melissa is a wonderful host. The accommodations were perfect. I will definitely book again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stay here every year on our way from CO to NY. It is the perfect half way spot to relax and refresh. All the added amenities this year make the space a true glamping experience, and were much appreciated. A hot shower after being in the car 18 hours, worth every penny."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,She responded to everything very quickly and even gave me a refund when I accidentally double booked! Beautiful land with lots of walking space which was great for our dog! Thanks for the stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of my most favorite glamping experiences, by far. Such a beautiful, unique, peaceful setting located right outside of town, nestled in the trees. From the flower fields to the great camp spot set up’s, walking the beautifully lit paths at night. A great place to be, relax and unwind. A truly magical spot."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect weekend getaway destination. When I arrived I was welcomed by a sign with my name on it and hand picked flowers. The glamping “tent” was beautifully decorated with string lights and had a comfortable bed. Loved spending time by the fire at night, which was easy to make thanks to the provided fire kit, and picking wildflowers during the day. Melissa has gone above and beyond to create a location that is both comfortable and peaceful. I can’t wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super beautiful. Really really good vibes
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This yurt set up is fantastic!! It's definitely camping, but the way Melissa had everything you could possibly need right there for you was amazing! If you want to go camping, be very comfortable, and not carry any equipment with you at all- this is the place!
Melissa was also amazing in letting us meet the alpaca gang ❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice retreat with a lot of thought put into the area. Would stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was looking for a place to take a solo retreat and thought this place looked like a good blend of nature while not spending all the time and effort of camping, and boy was I right! It was incredibly peaceful and restorative! Melissa was a great host and made accommodations for my stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Blooming Bus Farms! The yurt and site were beautiful and clean. The hosts have really thought of everything you could possibly need. From the gorgeous flowers, to lounging in the hammock, sitting by the fire, shooting hoops and hiking around the grounds, it really is an awesome escape from the hustle and bustle of Chicago! Waking up and seeing alpacas parading past your site (bandanas and all) was something else! We bought their farm fresh eggs and honey, both delicious :). Melissa and her husband are salt of the earth people and have an awesome space for relaxation/enjoying nature without the set-up and take-down of traditional tent camping. Highly recommend this place for a weekend getaway or an event in a unique space. We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay in the glamping tent. We didn't meet Melissa in person but the communication over the Airbnb messages went really well. The glamping site had everything we needed. The sleeping tent was surprisingly spacious, very clean and cozy. As there are nets on the doors and windows there were no insects in the tent. There were some spiders in the bathroom tent, but you're in nature. We had a nice BBQ on the firepit and watched the fireflies. In the night it was really quiet so we had a good rest. For everyone who likes glamping we strongly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great spot to catch a reprieve on our drive. We loved the fire pit and having everything ready have fire. The shower is nice and hot. My dog loved have the freedom to sniff around and explore. Melissa and her farm are lovely
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"we had the most magical time! the bed was comfortable, the little touches like flowers and a welcome sign were so sweet! 10/10 recommend and will likely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa and family were great and very friendly! We appreciate the hospitality!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place! Definitely recommend.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and reminded me of the beauty that Michigan holds that I often take for granted. Very quiet, spacious and so cute! Very comfortable and the PERFECT glamping getaway. Melissa and her family are absolutely beautiful people inside and out and did nothing shy of making us feel welcome. We even got to meet their Alpaca family! Also, it was so refreshing being able to take my dog somewhere that does not discriminate certain breeds.
I absolutely cannot wait to stay again💝"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,great place
2023-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"The stay was nice, I wish that there would have been wipes or hand sanitizer or something. I thought it was a fair assumption that there would be something like that if the composting toilet tent was a part of the advertising, and it's referred to as ""glamping"". Otherwise, it was nice that they had a cooler there with a full bag of ice and waters and plenty of wood for a fire."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great stay! Really helpful directions to navigate our way there even in the dark. The weather was cold, but we were perfectly warm in the yurt! Woke up to fresh snow - it was a beautiful and magical experience!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect glamping experience, Definitely want to return during spring or summer to see the flowers,"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a wonderful time at Melissa’s property! We can’t wait to return!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa was a fantastic host. The whole experience was incredibly easy and the wh camping site was perfectly set up to accommodate a comfortable and enjoyable trip. Would absolutely stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An excellent place to stay! Lovely people, well thought out and excited to visit again and see the progression of their regenerative farming."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was amazing and relaxing. The yurt was very clean and homely. There are many great things to do at the sight and close by. A place that feels like home away from home.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit and I think that speaks volumes! I was so surprised to see all the flower gardens for first time. This is a delightful, peaceful place and the hosts are so kind and helpful. I can't wait to return in the fall."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough good things about our stay. We had such a relaxing time and any questions we had about things to do in town, fun suggestions, etc were answered promptly and perfectly. Ended up checking out a farmers market in New Buffalo on Sunday and popping into some great shops and restaurants in Three Oaks. Highly recommend. Wish we could have stayed a few more nights. Everything was perfect"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute and everything you could need is provided!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I highly recommend staying here. Melissa was a wonderful host! We had such a good time! It was beautiful and so nice to be out in nature while still having a nice place to sleep and even shower! We will definitely be returning
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful space & had everything you need!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this experience for anyone! This was our first time taking our boys camping and we are hooked. The amount of care and attention to details that Melissa put into our stay was amazing. From a personalized sign and fresh flowers, to rugs, linens and lighting in the yurt. I was apprehensive about the compostable toilet, but even that was a pleasant experience. We enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to our next one."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our first time glamping completely exceeded my expectations. I forgot warm pajamas and panicked because I’m always freezing, but the yurt was so cozy and I was very warm. Lots of sweet touches, extremely well thought out and overall a magical experience for us and our 4 yo. Meeting the alpacas and playing badminton were highlights too!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The campsite came jam packed with not only the essentials but with ways too keep us entertained. I couldn't have been more excited to face my cousins in Beach volleyball and badminton. I can definitively see myself coming back, if not this year then next year for sure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! I can't wait to come back with my kids.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this experience so much. Melissa was such a warm and prompt communicator. The site had everything I needed (bug spray, flashlight, lantern, tinder, firewood, lighter, etc.). I loved the compost toilet and portable shower option. There were thunderstorms both nights that I camped, but my pup, and I were so cozy in the yurt. The site is on a beautiful urban farm with a few other glamp sites set up. That said, I felt like I had plenty of privacy. Cannot recommend this spot enough!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Its was great! They had everything set up waitin for us an even lit our camps tourches. It was lovely!! Definitely recommend
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a fun little getaway! Everything was described perfectly and it was nice to have some peace and quiet.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is perfect. What a great experience. We've never 'glamped' before, but I think we're spoiled now. The tent was immaculate. Every little detail was thought of: wine opener, bug spray, a little fan to keep us cool, kindling for the fire, a lighter to get the wood pile started (which was pre-set in the fire grate for us!), a cooler with ice and water already chilled, soap provided at the dishwashing/handwashing station, a little generator for charging phones... I mean, it was insane how well set up this place was. And the bed! So comfy. That mattress was a dream. We wish we could have stayed longer, but we were just passing through on our way to Colorado. If we're ever in Michigan again we'll be sure to hang out here. Truly, it was great. Thanks, Melissa!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great host! This place is perfect if you want to enjoy nature at the comfort of your home. Good location too! It is like a forest within a city.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a fun place to visit and all was exactly as described. Go out and relax in the trees!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa was a great host who was very quick to respond and provided all the basics. The water was a little chilly in the shower, but it was totally usable and the rest of the stay was magical."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a fun camping trip! Amenities were very comfortable. We had a blast!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was the perfect campfire get away! Will be coming back and recommending to everyone! If it’s warm though I definitely recommend bringing a fan since it gets very warm.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"From first glance it’s small, once inside it opens up and feels very spacious. Might be one of the better beds I’ve laid in (girlfriends #1). Stormed the night we were there and it held up very well, minus the nasty thunder. We were unable to use the shower which we were hoping for. Would stay here again"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, would visit again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my very first glamping experience! And I really really loved it! The place was very cozy and warm! It was in the middle of the forest which I really enjoyed!
I highly recommend this place and I will definitely come back again when it’s warmer!
Melissa was amazing and very fast in responding!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great experience even though it was raining and snowing. We stayed very warm under all the blankets that Melissa provided. Perfect getaway from the chaos of life. Beautiful setup. There was water and ice for us to us along with plenty of wood for the fire. Will definitely be back! 😄
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We wanted the experience of staying in the yurt and booked spontaneously. It was my first time being away from my kids and really just a wonderful little weekend getaway. We got some rain but we were able to keep the fire going which was awesome. It was chilly at night (between 32-37 degrees) but stayed quite comfortable in the yurt with the heater & electric blanket! The portapotty was convenient too :-) we enjoyed looking around niles and shopping through some antique stores. I have no complaints about this stay :)
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and value. Close enough to everything you’ll need while still experiencing nature and the outdoors. Their pristine yurt offers a fun and unique camping experience!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay! Enjoyed it thoroughly. Great hospitality, with firewood, torches, a heating blanket and heater. Loved the Niles downtown area and hiking. Recommend staying here and also, go visit Apothica Teas!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great experience, so unique, private, and plenty to explore around a bit! I would recommend it as a getaway to anyone looking for something unique and magical!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Want a place to relax get away form everything this is your place.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The fire was lit, the space heater was on, everything was cozy and inviting which was perfect considering the weather was cold and rainy. It was dreamy"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will 100% be back! Perfect location and easily accessible camp site. Electric blanket saved us on a cold night.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Yurt was a blast! The hosts were amazing. We were warm enough at night and had a wonderful time by the fire. We will for sure be returning ! Great little trip to relax!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a unique and low key getaway…exactly what I was looking for! Super fun in the winter. Introduced my two daughters to glamping. Tiki torches and a fire going upon our arrival. Try it!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Yurt was exactly as described, if not better. Melissa had excellent communication and provided everything we needed for a great short stay. Would definitely come back in the warmer months but even with snow on the ground it was perfect."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was exactly what i was expecting and what I needed. Beautiful place and property. I live in a city so I most appreciated the quiet and privacy. I plan to return, no matter the season."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great. Especially for anyone wanting something different, and with a sense of adventure. The host is extremely accommodating as well"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The yurt made for great weekend camping on a roadtrip. My aussie loved romping through the woods. We'd stay again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute! About 60 degrees inside on a night around 17 degrees. Absolutely perfect under the blankets and with the electric blanket 🤗
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The yurt was wonderful! It was warm and comfortable, even in the middle of December. Plenty of blankets and firewood. Secluded, but still close to town to get anything that is needed. Will definitely stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to get away from it all. The yurt was amazing. The bed was very comfortable. The host were wonderful and had everything covered that you would need. I will definitely be coming back! 10 out of 10 in every way.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place & host!! Thank you :)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect glamping spot! We were pleasantly surprised to see a porta john when we pulled up and Melissa gave a heads up they were able to get heat to the yurt. We ended up bringing things we didn't need with them having them ready for us, ie: table, a couple chairs, umbrella and they supplied beautiful DRY firewood that was easy to light and smelt amazing, on top of an aim n flame and a box of cardboard. Inside the yurt is plenty of room to hang out and the bed is super comfy. There is LED lights but we did use a couple of our own lights to see a bit better. Check them out. We cant wait to go back for another stay. One night wasn't enough!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this little boho getaway!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Melissa has thought of everything. It was perfect spot for our trip.
The yurt and campsite was clean. It was a cold, wet weekend however we stayed warm and dry.
Cannot wait to come back to see the sunflowers!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect space. Highly recommend. Melissa is super about communication. We arrived late and like others mentioned she had the space lit up with torches and a fire going. It was so relaxing sitting there enjoying a fire we didn’t have to start! Nice touches all the way through.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Best getaway ever! So cute and comfortable. We will definitely be returning next year when the sunflowers are in bloom! 11/10
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa and the property were absolutely amazing! Definitely worth checking out and I will be staying there again soon
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts. Everything as expected. Comfy and nice!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"SO BEAUTIFUL & clean. We enjoyed our stay even with the rain. The hammocks, my gosh! Love it! I brought my little one along and she had so much fun. We stayed warm and dry with everything we needed to be comfortable. Bathroom and shower was great. Overall a great/relaxing experience at the Yurt. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ! Can’t wait to be back!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a little fairy like setting! absolutely gorgeous and the photos don’t do it justice!! the yurt was so much bigger than expected! you are provided with all your extra needs like extra water, a sink, towels, extra blankets, and bug spray! melissa has done such a good job with making sure you have everything!
we arrived at dusk and the torches and fire was already set up for us!
very secluded and peaceful! bed is super comfortable and the comforter keeps you incredibly warm! toilets and shower were super clean and roomy also. it’s the perfect place for a glamping getaway!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So beautiful. Don’t know where to start! I never wanted to get off of the hammocks. I brought my toddler along and she had so much fun. There was a sand pit area we played in, tons of fun. It was clean, and she had everything we needed to be comfortable! It rained and it was such a beautiful sound, she insured me it was a nice stay even when it rains! Bathroom was great for being an outside bathroom, didn’t use the shower but she had towels provided and showed me how to use it! I could go on and on about ho relaxing me beautiful it was. There was plenty of room in the yurt. Overall an AMAZING stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Every time we are in town we try and book… this place is a little piece of heaven so quiet and magical… a very romantic get away for the misses and me.. Melissa always has the place lit up and everything ready to go including ice for the cooler😊 always clean and stocked with everything you could possibly need .. all you have to do is stop and grab some beer.. something to throw on the grill and stuff to make s’mores 😉
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here to go to the ND football game and it was so inviting and comfortable! I would love to come back and just spend the weekend there at the campsite. It has everything you could need: 2 hammocks, a fire pit, and torches to name a few. You feel so secluded but are not far off the beaten path at all.
We had to arrive late so didn’t get to meet Melissa unfortunately, but she was so kind over messages and had the site well lit when we arrived so we could easily find it. While we were gone at the game she stopped by and made sure we still had plenty of fuel for the torches and hadn’t run out of firewood or anything.
It was cool and rainy and we could not have been more comfortable with the sleeping arrangements. Hope to visit again soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the best air bnb I have ever seen. The pictures really don't do it justice. I would 100/10 recommend and will be coming back next time I'm in town!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pictures don’t do this place justice!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was an awesome night. It was beyond my expectations!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful little yurt in the woods not too far from everything. Checked in later than we anticipated but host was gracious and had the torches lit so we could see the way back to the campsite. Very quiet and secluded feel without being in the middle of nowhere. Will definitely be back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We LOVED everything about this stay. Can’t wait to go back.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melissa and family were great hosts. Everything was perfectly set by the time we reached. Melissa received us in person and showed us around the camp which was great. Very responsive host who attends to all your needs immediately. We will definitely return.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa is an incredible host. The camp was prepared and well maintained upon arrival and throughout my stay. The area is safe and secluded yet there’s so much to do around there! The yurt was a dream! So comfortable and cozy. I hadn’t slept so well in months. Bugs were minimum, the shower water was warm and the toilet clean. This was a relaxing weekend and I look forward to visiting again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Best place by far very magical and quite
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a fun experience! We are seasoned campers and have slowly upgraded to a class A motor home. This was so great to “get back to nature” and just sit and enjoy ourselves with no distractions. Brushing our teeth and showering were super easy and I appreciate feeling clean even while camping! They have definitely thought about everything when setting up! We didn’t NEED anything! Amazing site and would definitely recommend.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host. We were late and still the place was set up perfectly. Everything from the fire to the bed made this Camping without all the work and discomfort. We would do it again. Fun adventure.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great experience at this Airbnb. The host and co-host were responsive and understanding/flexible. Buchanan was a great place to stay, where it was much more peaceful than some of the bigger cities like Kalamazoo or New Buffalo. Unfortunately, garbage day is Saturday, so it was a bit noisy in the morning while we were trying to sleep, but it did not last long, and we fell right back to sleep. The place was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in, even the dishes were clean. We also loved the hardwood floors and neat design. If we had the occasion to come back, I would strongly consider staying here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean. Would highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was so amazing and they were so sweet! Definitely will back.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful lodge styled loft. Private and peaceful. Restaurants in downtown just a short walk away. Host was great. Would absolutely stay here again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this condo. It was so cozy and super clean. Checking in and out went super smoothly, we had zero trouble finding the entrance and using the code lock. We loved that everything was walkable, we walked to get dinner and breakfast. Both places were right around the corner and absolutely delicious! We will definitely be visiting again 😊"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could have stayed longer! Love this place. Very cozy, clean and comfortable."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great stay. thank you
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! The place was clean and so cozy with just the right lighting and an electric fireplace. Lots of thought went into the furnishings and decor. The bedroom was airy and bright (not at night) with an incline bed that made it extra relaxing. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do ie visit friends in South Bend, hit some local Breweries, enjoy the small town feel/businesses and Fernwood Botanical Garden. We even took a drive up to Lakeside to check out the beach that beautiful day before heading back to Indy. Already booked another weekend in June!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was just as clean and cozy as the pictures showed! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT! Its location was perfect for walkability and right next door to the best coffee shop ever! I would love to return in the summer so I could use the amazing back deck and grill! Thank you so much for the great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay and would stay again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's even better than it looks in the pictures to be in the space. I had everything I needed and more. It was great to wake up to the gentle awakening of a small downtown. Get up and just hang out or get up and walk out the door onto the downtown sidewalk. Yoga studio, small bank, public library (!), dispensary (if interested), coffee shop with breakfast, sweet shop with lunch all within 1/2 a block. Delightful. Very nicely appointed loft. Amazing decor and fun finishings. The kind of place that feels instantly like home."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was incredible. The space is very warm and comfortable. Everything you need and more! The apartment is right in town and walking distance to everything in town. You won't find another spot with the furnishings, bedding, bath, and kitchen as nice as this. I definitely recommend this location for stays. Ulrike and Lindsey were super responsive and left us a bottle of champagne as a welcome gift. Excellent stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Everyone in our group enjoyed the stay. The house was beautiful and immaculate. The hot tub was great, the property was beautiful, and that couch was amazing!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely fantastic experience. I stayed there the night before my wedding at the Morris Estate and it was absolutely perfect.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a beautiful stay here! We highly recommend it. The host was very attentive and quick in sending responses to any questions I had. Beautiful setting.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely immaculate home. Every amenity was thought of and they were all the highest of quality. Mark allowed us a later check out and immediately contacted us when he saw we were having some difficulty with the door lock. The views of the river from every bedroom were beautiful. Heated floors, LED lighting, an 85” TV, this home had everything. Absolutely one of the best Airbnbs we have ever stayed in! Thank you for sharing your home with us for our anniversary."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,It was honestly so peaceful and a beautiful place to stay. We saw a lot of wild life. The pictures don’t do it justice for how beautiful the home is inside and outside. We will 100% be going back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best surprise retreat for my honey for his 33rd birthday. We loved it here and could have stayed forever. The host was great to help me with the decorations and a couple vendors I hired to help me decorate since we were coming in from Chicago. We can’t wait to come back in the warmer weather to go kayaking!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent property for a refueling getaway with my so! The property is tucked away in the woods with lots of privacy and a beautiful view. We especially loved the cozy fireplace, as we stayed in most of our trip. We’ll definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for my family, we are coming back summer time"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great my family loved it . Thank you we will be back in the summer for longer stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at this beautiful, comfortable home. Scenic views from every window. We were pleasantly surprised by the many amenities throughout the home and property. We had easy access to everything we needed.
The host was great! Very accommodating and responsive even when it came to details.  Can't wait to go back!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Nancy is a fantastic host and the house was just as the listing described. There was plenty of room for all 7 of us, the furnishings were comfortable and there were more than enough towels/washcloths/linens for our stay. The yard was fantastic, plenty of room for our grandsons to run and play.
We loved our stay and weren’t ready to leave!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My colleagues and I stayed for a week at Nancy's home. We had a bit of trouble figuring out the parking situation upon our arrival but Nancy was super responsive and helped us get everything situated. The home is quite large and provided us all with enough space to spread out. We'll definitely keep this one in mind if we should ever find ourselves in Niles again.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,From registering until checkout the host was very responsive and wonderful. She accommodated to all of our needs and beyond.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this 160 year old home. The home is comfortable, relaxing, plenty of room, beds were all comfy. We were 100% satisfied. Host was attentive and quick to respond to any questions."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The stay was awesome. My family really enjoyed themselves. The house was comfy and cozy. We felt right at home. The host was very responsive. She was very attentive and she made sure everything was right. I will make sure I recommend this house to others. I will definitely stay again. I hate we had to leave but our visit ended. Thanks for allowing us to use your vacation rental.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Outstanding beds, bedding, towels. Amazing black out curtains. Great water pressure. Full kitchen for cooking. Easy directions for heating and cooling. Felt right at home! Nancy is clearly a super host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is beautiful and spacious for a small group.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely perfect for me and my family. The house is gorgeous and the large private back yard and patio got a lot of use! Everything was well stocked and I've never slept in comfier beds at an Airbnb! Would absolutely stay again - highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy is a great host and her home is beautiful, we enjoyed our weekend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place in very convenient location. Well stocked and clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"OMG! Nancy’s place is a magnificent house full of cool surprises and exquisite taste!
The beds were comfortable, the place is enormous, and there’s an excellent fenced in yard for our buddy Jericho.
We built a fire, and cooked in the well stocked kitchen and had a relaxing and lovely time.
Nancy was super responsive and very kind. We’d definitely go back again!
Thanks for a great weekend!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A lot of old charm. Interesting home. Spacious, there were 3 of us, men, we had our 'space'.
I think the place is one of a kind.
Restaurants in Niles are limited. Especially on Sunday. Nothing is open. Kitchen is very well stocked with spices etc. Nice surprise! Beds were comfortable.
Town has a laid back appeal. River Park and downtown shops within walking distance.
Airport was 20 minutes away.
All in all it was an enjoyable stay!! Thank you, if we are ever in the area again we will definitely choose to stay with you!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,excellent house and awesome host! recommend if you're headed to the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! This historical home is great and is going to just keep getting better as the owners continue to revitalize it. It’s huge, the yard is huge and private! So much room to enjoy the space. The bedroom (we stayed in the king bed room) was wonderful. The linens were comfortable and the bed perfect. All of the rooms looked like they would be the same. The master bathroom is also very large. I really loved the “retro” kitchen and all its little cool things like the kitchenaid shelf. The kitchen had all we needed to make our meals too. So much space in this home. And there will be more usable space in the future so that’s awesome. Walking to town is a breeze, about 0.5 miles and it’s pretty the whole way. Great food and drinks in town. The Italian bakery is yum!! We cannot wait to see what’s next for this property and will be back for sure!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a pleasure to stay in your home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don’t think you could find a home more spacious and comfortable.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming old home with beautiful built-ins and moldings. Large fenced backyard for our fur babies to roam! Well stock kitchen. Would stay there again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at Nancy’s and it just keeps getting better. Classy and elegant.
She even had a Christmas tree and candle lights in all the windows. it snowed and someone came every day to clear the walks. It’s my new home away from home.
The house is an easy ride to Notre Dame."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful historic home with charm and character. Thoughtful details for our stay and a warm and cozy atmosphere. Would highly recommend.
2022-09-01,2,Stayed with kids,"I only Stayed one night out of the 10 I reserved. The house is old and I was aware of that(I’m also from the area and know the house has been there forever) but the smell was so overwhelming in there it made me lose my appetite. The windows do not have screens on them and don’t open. So this old house without ventilation smelled bad. The house also had old furniture that also had a smell and stains. The fridge wasn’t clean(I took Pics of everything wrong with the house) and also was filled with expired condiments that added to the foul smell in the home. Wallpaper ripped on the walls as well as the walls were dirty, dirt in the tubs/shower floors. I didn’t Even shower there nor did I bathe My toddler there. Overpriced for the experience and quality of the house. I was Extremely disappointed."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,beautiful home with all you will need!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Nancy was very attentive.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay at the ""not-on-the-lake"" house in Niles MI. We were visiting my sister who lives on Barron Lake in Niles for an extended family gathering. The house worked perfect for us. We all loved the character and decor. The beds were very comfortable, the house was well maintained and yard was just wonderful for our dogs to enjoy. When we returned from having lake fun each night, we gathered for a movie in the living room before going off to bed. We would definitely book here again. Communication was great and Nancy is the ideal host. We had a wonderfully time."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,What a wonderful house. We enjoyed staying in a place that was over 100 years old. Loved the high ceilings and staircase. The amenities were perfect and the kitchen was well supplied. The location was the best and we got around with no problem. Nancy is a great host and was very responsive to our needs. You can count on a wonderful experience.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this home for multiple reasons. The ambiance alone is a blast from the past, high ceilings, ornate trim and molding, spacious is putting it mildly. And at the same time each modern update seems to blend in with the era.
There was plenty of everything and many extras that you wouldn’t expect.
Nancy was always prompt at getting back with me.
Niles was my home town and I plan to stay there every time I visit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can not say enough good things about our stay !!!
Nancy’s house has so much character and charm! I love old homes and hers definitely didn’t disappoint.
Had all the amenities, full kitchen.
We made dinner one night.
Great location.
I strongly recommend staying with Nancy. She even left us local coffee, jam and wine! Truly one of my favorite place’s I’ve stayed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best airbnb experience we've had to date, beatiful home and easy access to SW MI and beyond!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This home is THE best place to stay while visiting NOTRE DAME! It’s a pretty drive to and fro to campus too.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this one -of -a -kind, charming, spacious, well appointed, welcoming home! The host is thoughtful and leaves local treats honey, wine, coffee, jam etc., in addition to thinking of EVERYTHING you might need or like.
The beds were all comfortable and dreamy. The towels were spa quality and fluffiest ever in an Airbnb. We would highly recommend this home!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome house, especially if you like historical details. Great beds, linens, and tons of space to spread out. Lots of local options for food (check out the Front Street Pizza Pub), great years for pets, and nice local treats from Nancy upon arrival. We loved it!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Special historic home. So much charm. Spacious inside and outside w full privacy fence. The kitchen is stocked and ready for cooking which we did a lot! Dog friendly and great , communicative host!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, beautiful charm"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The most unique home in the area. History and architectural is all around. All your needs for kitchen and utensils are above 5star.
Bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable. Patio, seating, and propane grill is perfect for all the imagination. 5star ratings for all."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely, charming, provisioned, clean and relaxing."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great place and great hosts. They are making upgrades and it’s a nice place to stay. Close to ND, shopping, anything you need.
We plan on booking next year with them for our ND visit!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This chill getaway in Nancy's charming home was exactly what my husband and I needed. Nancy's property had a wonderful mix of historic, modern, SUPER CLEAN, and ultra comfy (so much so that we investigated our bedding and bought a new mattress before we left to head home). I even loved the little things that were not quite finished renovating yet, it made me feel at home because we are in the midst of ""last final touches"" ourselves!
Nancy was kind enough to check in with us just before our arrival date. But their welcome binder had all the info in it that we needed. Plus the little locally sourced treats you left for us to enjoy was a very thoughtful and nice touch.
We also found Niles, MI to be a very charming and friendly down with plenty of places to eat all within 5 minutes. My husband and I intended to do some hiking and take photos, but to be honest, we mostly just hung out and enjoyed the home and backyard, went into town a few times, visited one destination, and caught up on sleep!
The backyard was great too. We at on the patio several times and played a yard game. The privacy is also excellent with 6-foot fence surrounding the backyard.
We especially enjoyed multiple breakfasts at Ginny's Place (aka, the Viking Grill) and Gabrizio Italian Café and Bakery. We could not get over how friendly and nice EVERYONE was that we encountered."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This historic home is large and spacious and has a whirlpool! Nancy was quick to answer messages and calls. There were local goodies when we arrived. It’s a 170-year-old house so it has its quirks! Overall, it was a good time."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,An amazing family reunion in a fantastically equipped and charming home! We can’t wait to return next Summer. Nancy was superb at communicating and has thought of every detail to make us feel at home.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My parents, my 3 children, and I stayed here for a family reunion in Niles. The house is grand and beautiful! It is a work in progress and it's a very old house, but Nancy and Josh were extremely responsive to any questions or issues we ran into, and they went out of their way to make sure we had a good a stay. I would definitely recommend this one-of-a-kind home!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house in Niles, MI provided everything I could need during my stay. It is close enough to Lake Michigan's beaches, South Bend's great restaurants, and other local attractions to be a perfect home base during the stay. In addition to these great attributes, the home had a great feel. Plenty of space to spread out, a stocked kitchen, and a large, fenced-in backyard. It was obvious that Nancy provides this home the TLC it deserves."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in the historic house was a real treat. We were especially charmed by the tall windows stretching floor to ceiling framed in arches and alcoves. Nancy was communicative and helpful when needed. The place was clean, well appointed for cooking, with lots of space to spread out. Comfortable beds. We enjoyed the location – quiet neighborhood with easy access to town and field trips, too. We feel fortunate for the experience."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for 30 days and strongly recommend the house and the hosts. The house is a large, gracious, 170 year old home -- either the oldest house in town or pretty close to it. The house is wonderful to explore and even after a few weeks I was still finding nooks and crannies, furniture or wood trim, or other really interesting features. Yes the house is 170 years old and the hosts have not owned it for very long. You will not be staying in a brand new luxury hotel -- but Nancy and Josh have done everything possible to make a stay comfortable. They've never really lived in the house yet they've put every possible device and cooking implement in the kitchen. The beds are incredibly comfortable, the sheets and towels are new, the AppleTV provides an assortment of premium channels -- I could go on, but the hosts have done so much to make sure guests are comfortable. The air conditioning systems are being updated, but I stayed in the house during a heat wave in July and the house was sufficiently cool. In fact Nancy was so concerned she purchased upgrades to the cooling in the bedrooms during my stay. The house has a spectacular back yard (huge) that my dog loved. The house is also conveniently located. I walked my dog around the neighborhood and always felt safe and got to know several of my neighbors. The house has some quirks because of its age, but none of them would detract from a stay -- plus you get to stay in a beautiful and majestic 170 year old home with gracious and generous hosts."
2021-06-01,3,Stayed about a week,Interesting old houses but still needs lots of TLC.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nancy is an excellent host, friendly, accommodating, helpful, and quick to respond. Her home in Niles is a lovely and well appointed vintage treasure, with lots of room for larger families. The house was very clean and comfortable, everything worked, and being dog friendly was a huge plus. Our doggo especially loved stretching his legs in the large fenced back yard. Nancy includes a helpful binder in the home with details about the property, local places to eat and shop, and check out procedures. This home made great base for us to explore the entire region. Everything seemed to be no more than a short drive away. Absolutely recommend this for your next stay in the area.."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent host and a gorgeous house that is huge and elaborately decorated to match its age. If you appreciate an older home and it's beautiful detail you will love this home. Safe quiet neighborhood.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful historical house with unique pieces throughout the house. The store was close by and they left suggestions of local places to eat which was very appreciated. We would love to stay again and get the opportunity to see the place when it is all finished!
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house and yard are gorgeous. The owners are still making improvements, but beds were comfortable and we enjoyed lounging in the beautiful vintage living room while using the smart TV. Some advance planning is required if you intend to cook - we recommend getting in touch with the lovely hosts to coordinate."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute beautiful home! Just the coolest older home with all of its old charm!! We loved it! Had the most relaxing weekend! Took advantage of Door Dash, walked down town for the best Carmel apples at Veni’s Sweet Shop, Togo lunch at El Amigo Pepe’s...the pet friendly touches were so appreciated! Home was very clean, instruction book for home and area was awesome! Loved cooking in large kitchen....to many things to list! Can’t wait for our next get away weekend!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had an amazing stay at Nancy's place! The house is HUGE and allowed for everyone to have their own space. The living spaces were stylish and so well put together. The location is great with easy access to South Bend. We'll definitely be back again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was even nicer than the pictures. Great central location for Lake Michigan and South Bend. Also a recreational park two minutes away for pickleball and a path to another park by the river. Very peaceful home. Would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My coworker and I stayed here while out of town for work. The place was very clean and affordable and had everything we needed. Hanging out in the backyard after work was very relaxing. Kelly was super friendly and accommodating and we would definitely book again if we are back in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Harper House! The location was perfect—quiet yet conveniently close to town. We loved having easy access to the beach, hiking trails, wineries, and breweries. The home was very clean and comfortable, with the added bonus of kids' toys that kept our little ones entertained. The fresh, pleasant smell upon arrival made us feel right at home. Mornings were a delight as sunlight flooded the living room through the numerous windows. The host communicated exceptionally well, making our stay seamless and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kelly’s place was a great find! We are going to be in town again in a few weekends and we are so sad that it isn’t available! Loved the yard and comfiness of the home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place off the beaten path but not far from town. Great Place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place!!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,I have stayed at Kelly's multiple times with my furbaby while in town to visit with family and we always feel right at home as soon as we arrive. Kelly is always very reaponsive and great with any questions that we have during our stay! Will always recommend it to others- Thanks Kelly!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,the house was exactly as pictured and we enjoyed our time in the house.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice quiet place with a several trails if you have a dog. Very peaceful. Enjoyed my stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kelly was very responsive when we had an internet problem and even offered to look deeper into it, but it fixed itself.
The sun room was my favorite area. Cozy. Peaceful. Quiet. Felt right at home.
Great yard space to tie dog up out by tree to explore the large yard.
Comfy beds, Amazing clawfoot tub.
Dog food and water bowl was provided as well as baby/toddler high chair, toys, a cup, and a plate.
This was the most “at home” air bnb I’ve been in, where I didn’t feel like I was in a fragile glass house.
We plan to come back to MI in the summer and may have to stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Kelly was always responsive, friendly and clear. The space was exactly what we needed for work in South Bend. The house was in perfect order. Will definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Exactly as described. Very warm and cozy.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very homie and responsive Will definitely be returning. Highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved having a comfortable house for a relaxing weekend instead of a cramped hotel stay at a higher price. Being able to bring our dog and do laundry was a huge bonus. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Location location, location. This house is right next to the town of Niles but enough off the beaten path that you don’t feel like you’re right in town. It’s also close to the county parks which have amazing cross country skiing trails. We had a great weekend and will come back to this place the next time in Niles."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay here. Cozy home with everything we needed. Easy drive to everything we wanted to do. Host was very helpful and friendly.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Worked well for what we needed. Loved the porch!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Harper House was clean and cozy. It was the perfect spot to stay during our time in the Michiana area with a cross-country move. It was removed from the hustle of Notre Dame traffic in nearby South Bend, IN and also nearby family in the St. Joseph, MI. Niles itself has limited offerings, but the house was in a quiet neighborhood, aside from the passing train, which we loved. The house with its front porch area was quaint and the beds and sofas were comfy. The house is not handicapped friendly. The house is one level, but there are a few steps to enter. My senior mother would have had issue bathing in the clawfoot tub, but there was a shower set up in the basement that we were able to use. I did have to assist her with going down the very narrow stairs to the basements. Despite the hassle, my mom really loved the house's charm and the host's attention to detail. There were ample blankets and everything smelled fresh. Supplies were limited, but we did extend our stay, which contributed."

We would love to stay again on our next trip to Niles!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Very calm and relaxing place. Hosts were nice. Place was clean. Just a couple issues. Air conditioning wasn’t effective. Couldn’t get early check in. The cleaning lady lived next door and we couldn’t get in until after she left (about 20 minutes after checkin)

We loved the enclosed front porch, comfortable family room sofas, extra shower in the basement, separate desk area, dining room area, two bedrooms which sleep a total of 5 people, and kitchen with cooking supplies, plates, and utensils. The house was very clean and additional items were placed throughout to accommodate every need. This place has such country charm! You will want to come back!"

After a full day out & about we were ready for a restful stay. Kelly’s place is such a cute and comfortable place to stay, and she is a wonderful host! We had absolutely no issues during our stay except not being able to find toilet paper. Kelly quickly responded and let us know where it was…right where is should be! How did we not see it?
My daughter LOVES the claw foot tub! We enjoyed our morning on the porch, such a cute space and very homey. I highly recommend the Harper House, and would give an award to Kelly for being such a great host if I could!"
