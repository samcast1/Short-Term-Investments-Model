2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jodi's place was perfect for our one-night stay in Fort Collins. My husband and I were just passing through town but would have happily stayed for another night or two. I've stayed in many Airbnbs, and this was one of the cleanest. It is also a bit more spacious than pictured. Scenic with the trees, clean, peaceful, and would recommend to others."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,In a nutshell: both my husband and I now want a treehouse of our very own. If you have the chance to stay there we highly recommend it. Jodi is excellent when communicating and goes above and beyond as a host.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a visit to CSU! The neighborhood is nice and quiet, while still being very close to campus. As a bonus, there were chickens in the yard when I left for the day! It may be a little cozy for 2 people depending on your preferences, but it was more than enough for a solo trip. I would happily stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the quiet tranquility of the tree house. Jodi was very responsive to our needs. It was cuter than it looks in the photos and we especially liked the high quality linens. This was the perfect place to stay while visiting our CSU student and we were able to walk to campus from the tree house.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Basically got what we saw on the listing. Only negative was no closet or hangers for clothing (though a few hooks were available). Really enjoyed the accommodation and would return.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jodi is a very hospitable host. She is responsive to communications, friendly, and accommodating. The treehouse is well named - it’s a lovely little garage apartment surrounded by trees. It’s in a quiet neighborhood which is also easily walkable to restaurants and groceries. Definitely recommended host and recommended place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's impossible to overstate what a delightful stay I had at The Treehouse. The place itself is gorgeous and homey, in a lovely neighborhood close to the CSU campus. It's at the back of the same property as the main house, but feels completely private. Jodi is very thoughtful and personable; we had a very nice conversation one day and she gave me some great recommendations for food and drink. There is a wonderful, low-key entertainment district within walking distance, with a variety of good restaurants, pubs and taprooms, which feels like it's popular with the locals and the students. And the more tourist-y ""Old Town"" district is a very short drive. More on-topic, the check-in and checkout were very easy and accommodating. There are so many nice touches in the unit; whole bean coffee and a grinder were provided; a tea kettle, full size fridge, so much more. Highly recommend and will definitely stay there if I visit FoCo again! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Treehouse, and we loved Grouse and Natasha! Grouse is such a funny dog. If you're an animal lover and had to leave your pets at home, this a great place to stay. Friendly dogs and chickens in the fenced in yard combined with the secluded deck on the Treehouse makes you feel less like you're in the city and more like you're in a cabin in the country. Jodi is a great host with wonderful recommendations. The place was spotless, directions were easy to follow and checkout was a breeze. The location is just 1/2 mile from the college and Old Town making for an easy walk to many of the restaurants, bars and shopping."

Host was responsive, friendly when we crossed paths and made sure my stay was perfect. Grass path through the yard & narrow staircase up to the Tree House was the only potential concern if you come with large luggage. Home had nice bedding, good towels, coffee & tea choices, beer in the ‘fridge, fans & extra blankets which all made the stay very comfortable. No question, I’d stay there again!!"

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice unit on a beautiful property. There is a nice sitting area on the patio. Fort Collins is a nice town and this was overall a good place to stay.
The only down sides were (1) some windows do not have curtains/blinds which limits privacy, and (2) one of their dogs was not okay with strangers. I had two tense interactions with said dog when they left it off leash in the yard. My review would be 5 stars if not for these two draw backs."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space is perfect getaway close to town and yet seemingly far away in the privacy of Jodi’s backyard. You’ll have everything you need here.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place. Great setup and great neighborhood. I will always try to stay here when I am in town!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay in FoCo! We were able to walk to CSU easily, plus restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The neighborhood is adorable. Grouse the pup was in the front yard to meet us and always made sure to say hello anytime we were walking through the yard to the Airbnb. Such a cutie. It was in the high 80s F outside but we didn't even need to use the AC, the fans and the shade from the trees kept us comfortable. The place has everything you could need for a short stay. Bed was comfortable. It should be clear from the listing but you are staying on someone's property so you may see the family. Wasn't a problem for us but something to consider if you want full privacy. Good value and we would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jodi's treehouse is really cute, felt like a home immediately. Everything you need is there and it was super clean. Communication was great."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Really comfortable and cute! Loved the dogs and chickens greeting me too😊

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Simply put... great place for 2 people. There is ample room and amenities to make any stay wonderful.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Treehouse was a great stay and would absolutely stay again. Great location close to all the restaurants and shops in Fort Collins but located behind a charming little home on a beautiful tree lined street. Easy access and good communication with the owner, great shower, all you'll need for a BnB."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean space. Super easy check in, and great communication throughout by the host."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our experience at Jodi's Treehouse! Clean, cozy and everything we needed for our first trip to Fort Collins. We were greeted by such a sweet pupper(Grouse) and beautiful chickens! The Treehouse was adorable and such attention to detail! Jodi couldn't have been sweeter, we really enjoyed our conversation and we're happy we got to meet on our last night.
A short and lovely walk brings you right into Old Town which has great bars and restaurants(Social was our favorite). We spent our days hiking and nights enjoying the charm FoCo has to offer. We would love to come back to the Treehouse!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our quick stay in this clean, comfortable space. There was plenty of room for the two of us. The neighborhood is lovely, very walkable and peaceful. It was about a mile walk to where we had dinner and drinks (The Mayor of Old Town—highly recommended, delicious food & 100 brews on tap); there are tons of other walkable options as well. Their dog is so cute & sweet—we loved when he visited us on the deck for some pets—and the chickens made me smile. The hosts are both thoughtful and respectful of privacy. The “tree house” is in their backyard, and we did glimpse family members outside a couple times, but it still felt kind of separate and private. We would certainly stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great little place.. very nice hosts and very accommodating.. we will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful Airbnb. Just what we needed for our trip back in Fort Collins. Jodi has a lovely property that’s so quiet and relaxing. An oasis in the city.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, well thought out unit in a very nice neighborhood close to CSU. Jodi and her husband are friendly and helpful.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here for about a week and loved it! The host was super helpful and responsive to anything I needed but otherwise it was a totally isolated stay considering it’s on the same property! The location is convenient and the studio is stocked with everything you may need. I loved the animals they had around! I hope to stay again on my next visit to FC
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard’s place was great! It was the perfect size for a weekend getaway, & everything was so well maintained & conveniently located. I passed it a couple times the first time I got there, but that was my own fault! Once I found it, it was very easy to find again & perfectly matched his description of where it would be. I would definitely stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 4 nights and it was easy to find, the space was great and very clean. Richard was right there when I pulled in and offered help if I needed it. Very friendly and responsive."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome host. Everything was perfect start to finish.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,my husband and I had a great staycation here while our house was having it's open house weekend. it was such a cozy little place with everything we needed. the weather was bad so the biggest thing we were bummed about was not getting to enjoy the view.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Probably the nicest airbnb experience I’ve ever had. I sincerely wish to visit again because it was so peaceful, and the host was so welcoming. The space itself was spotless, and it was very easy to relax. The entire property is lovely, with happy ducks, chickens, and pigs all with the backdrop of a huge mountain."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place!! Was within easy access to Fort Collins, or if you are traveling to Cheyenne, WY. Close to restaurants, hikes, and brews. Richard had a lot of great recommendations!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely stay. Richard, the animals and the space are all great. Looking forward to staying here again! Must check with Richard ahead of time about the hot tub so he has time to prepare it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We visited our friends who live in Fort Collins in March and needed a dog-friendly place to stay. This is such a cozy and cute Airbnb. I love how quiet it is and the kitchen has all the basics you need. You have the beautiful view of the snow covered mountains in the morning while having coffee. I enjoyed seeing the pigs, ducks and chickens in the morning. There's a fenced-in yard where our dogs can do their business (and yes we picked up after them before we left).
It's located off the highway, but it's quiet at night. There's only 2 of us so the queen sized bed is fine though a bit tight (we're just not used to it) . One improvement would be a small closet or some drawers to put your clothes or stuff.
Overall, it was a great deal and surprisingly a short drive to downtown and close to our friends' house. The host was very responsive and always ready to take action if there are issues. Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was awesome! Beautiful cozy space with amazing house plants and views. We thoroughly enjoyed saying hi to the pigs, ducks, and chickens!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing spot! We had a beautiful view of the mountains and our dog loved watching the pigs and chickens peck in the yard. Easy to find, sparkling clean with lots aof beautiful plants and great natural light, and had a great 2 nights of sleep. Lory State park nearby and easy access to old town Fort Collins. a perfect weekend getaway!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Absolute adored the atmosphere… the ducks, chicken, geese and chickens provided a delightful experience. Great little place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really nice little spot tucked away with covered deck and yard. Rich was extremely responsive and friendly. Loved seeing all the other animals on the property. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this Airbnb for 2 nights and it was absolutely amazing. Richard was extremely helpful, super nice. Hot tub was amazing the only issue was it was kind of confusing to find but I do have to say he gave extremely clear instructions (it was a long trip). Other than that, it was easy to get there after we knew where to park. There was little to no traffic where the Airbnb was. It was quiet, beautiful and we honestly were writing notes for how we want our house in the future. After we used the hot tub I forgot to close the front door and complained about how cold it was until I found out It was actually my fault. It was still one of the best night sleeps I’ve ever had. The bed is so comfortable by the way. I definitely will come back if I ever need to."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is very lovely. It’s the perfect size for a weekend stay. It is clean, bright, and cozy. Richard is a great host as well.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had such a wonderful stay here! The house is adorable with a beautiful view of the mountains out back - the photos do not do it justice!! We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and the place was spotless upon arrival. Richard was beyond helpful and responsive. We will absolutely stay here again if we return to the area.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is small but quiet and well designed. Everything I needed for a quick trip with my pup. Richard is a great host and the growing collection of farm animals was a real treat.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a sweet guest house! Beautiful sunrises and sunsets. I got to watch the ducks and chickens and the pig while sipping morning tea - very entertaining! The house was clean and cozy with gorgeous house plants. The house had everything I needed for a 2 day getaway.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Richard's place was peaceful and quiet in the back of his wonderful property into which he has put so much effort! His creativity and skills and artistic sense all shine through. The kitchen and living area are cozy and functional and the bathroom and bedroom are downright roomy! we enjoyed talking to him about his projects and appreciated his flexibility with our check-in. Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a lucky find. Cozy place close to where we spent our days. Great spot for our dog. The place had everything we needed to sleep comfortably and enjoy coffee.

You pass his home, garden, hot tub, and chicken run (with ducks and a friendly pig!) before arriving at your private stay with a porch and beautiful mountain view. The inside is comfortably decorated and comes with everything you need to enjoy time alone or with a loved one. We'll be returning for sure! Richard is a fantastic and responsive host, and we couldn't ask for a better time away."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique and lovely space!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute place with lots of character and everything we needed. The pig and ducks and chickens was super fun too! When walking through the main house yard to the guest house where we stayed was absolutely beautiful too, a little pond, lights around and the landscaping was so well kept too! Wish we could have enjoyed it more but we had a special event to attend to. Thank you Richard for having us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love his place and his animals, very nice and responsive!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Relaxing, beautiful view, close to trails! Richard was very responsive. Place was just as pictured and the hot tub was an added bonus. Close to the area trails and downtown. I would stay here again, but for longer!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time here! The space is adorable and was perfect for myself, husband, our dog, and toddler for a week. Our highlight of everyday was going to say hi to the animals. We will definitely be back in the future!"

Had a wonderfully experience.
Host ""Richard"" friendly, responsive and great to chat with."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Air B&B reservation, and it did not disappoint! Richard was very friendly, and showed us around the property right when we arrived. If you’re an animal lover this is the perfect place to stay. I couldn’t get enough of his backyard animals. Dogs, chickens, ducks, and my personal favorite Nugget, a cute little pig. The view was spectacular. I enjoyed waking up in the morning to the golden sun, mountains, birds, and squirrels. We chose to eat breakfast out on the deck each morning. There’s a nice swing to relax on, and you get to hear the animals go about their business each morning. The guest house is very quiet, and a little chilly at night, but I personally prefer that while sleeping. There’s a fire place next to the bed if you wanted it warmer, or you could leave the windows closed at night. I loved the guest house, and the backyard. Richard was on the property during our stay, but he felt like a friend. It wasn’t uncomfortable. I loved this Air B&B, and Nugget! 🐷"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying with Richard & it was just as great as the first!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Richard was super responsive and helpful. He had a few recommendations that ended up being perfect for us. The home was clean and quaint with everything we could have needed during our stay. We'd gladly stay at Richard's place again. Thanks for hosting us!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property was very pleasant and well-maintained. We didn't have any problems, and really enjoyed our stay. The fresh eggs and available garden was delightful, and overall the place was very homey. I would highly recommend it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is idyllic!!! Originally I was only going to stay 2 nights....but after being there, I did not want to leave and added 2 more nights....every morning i went to a different place close by for a beautiful hike and then the rest of the day I spent at this airbnb, working remotely. The view was beautiful and peaceful. I really enjoyed the porch swing in the evenings as well.
And Richard was a good host, making sure i had everything i needed and wanted, even shared his farm fresh eggs with me.
If I'm ever in Fort Collins again, i know where I'll be staying!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was perfect, fantastic host"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Richard was ver responsive to helping us getting checked in and settled. Quaint comfortable place close to town and great view.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely one of the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in. It was such a cute and quaint place to stay. Plenty of space to let the dog out to roam and play on private space. Would definitely definitely recommend staying here.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay so much! Thank you Richard!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW! This place is magic. It’s a peaceful retreat, close to everything Fort Collins has to offer. The guest house is immaculately clean and comfortable, with an amazing view to wake up to. We enjoyed doing yoga and drinking coffee on the porch in the morning, looking at the mountains. Richard and his pets make this place extra special. Do not hesitate to stay here! ❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I had a great time staying here. The inside was clean and had good vibes all around. Loved the fenced in yard for my dogs and also the pig - she is sooooo cute.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Richard was super responsive and proactive in communication about our stay! We loved saying good morning to his pig, ducks, and chickens! I would recommend staying here if you are in Fort Collins. It is close to downtown but still a nice little retreat."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I lived in Fort Collins, CO for 26 years until moving away in 2020. This was my first visit to my other “home” and I brought my dog along. The two of us could not have had a better stay than we did at Richard’s incredible property! It is absolutely perfect. The carriage house is quaint, quiet, ideal for a dog to accompany you, and it’s SPOTLESS. The bed is really comfortable and everything works perfectly in the house. Richard is ultra-responsive and friendly, plus it’s an added bonus that he has an urban farm with animals! I loved seeing the chickens, ducks, and pig each morning in their area.
This is the best home rental I’ve stayed in and it made my trip absolutely perfect. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it highly!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable stay with comfortable bed! Loved the swing and farm animals out and about. Great views! Would come back again for sure.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is how airbnbs SHOULD be!!! A local who uses some extra space on his own property. Richard’s place was so cute & we loved interacting with his animals. He even gave us some free goose eggs & they were delicious! I hope we get the chance to stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Their space was just a little piece of Heaven on earth. They were just the most kind and accommodating~ if we ever need to pass thru again we’ll be there!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Richard’s place is like a little bit of home! The animals, garden, views, and adorable tiny home were all perfect. 10/10 recommend a stay with Richard!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I stayed at Richard’s place with our dog and it was perfect for us. Richard is super friendly, responsive and helpful. The property is awesome, we loved the animals, sunflowers and other plants. The separate fenced in section of the yard by the guest house was great for letting our dog out. The guest house itself was minimal, very clean and had everything we needed. We really loved the light from the windows in the kitchen and the porch swing. My wife and I were both working remotely from the guest house and had no issues with the internet speed. Location is not far from downtown and very close to the Poudre trail, which is really nice. I would definitely recommend staying at Richard’s place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful, beautiful and peaceful place to stay. It was so nice to see the animals and garden area too. Reminded me of home. I loved the way they had it set up. The careful attention to details and notes made it very easy to feel comfortable."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a beautiful time . The place was clean and our host was friendly. The ducks and the pig were so cute. The hot tub was very clean and relaxing. I would recommend this spot to anyone.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Richards with my pups! Having the private fenced in area for them was perfect. Made mornings sitting on the swing perfect. Richard was very responsive with any questions I had. The place is just as pictured and has everything you would need! Everything was clean and bed was super comfy! Location is great; far enough away to have some peace and quite, but short drive to all the restaurants, coffee, shops, etc. I appreciated the lights around the pole out front to help find It more easily at night! :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Walking through the abundant garden to the little guest house was lovely. We enjoyed watching the farm critters from the private porch with a view of the mountains. The guest house is sturdy, homey, quiet, well equipped and comfortable.
Richard was super friendly, available and went out of his way to repair some minor damage we did to our vehicle."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful, tranquil stay. Richard was a delight, as were his animals! The place felt isolated in the best way, and our stay was really peaceful. A short drive to lots of places - dog park, walking trail, grocery stores, restaurants, ice cream! Water pressure and temperature was great! Bed was comfortable. Everything we needed for a great stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful property with stunning views from a super cute carriage house. On the main road but feels like a little oasis. Private fenced in yard for the dogs adjacent to chickens and ducks. Richard was super helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we were accommodated. Would recommend to anyone wanting to visit Fort Collins or catching a show at the Mishawaka.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Richard’s home is one of those places that you experience for the first time and think “I love Airbnb”. It’s incredibly unique, thoughtfully crafted, and perfectly situated with a Mountain View. Richard is also a very responsive and flexible host, and an overall quality human being. I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Richard was very friendly and answered all our questions. He gave us great advice for places to eat! Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy spot with a responsive and friendly host with easy access to lots of things to do in FoCo/LaPorte. Would stay here again. Animals, nice views, quaint interior, and a hot tub in a lovely setting."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my third time staying at this AirBnB and for good reason. It's exceptionally clean, very comfortable, and centrally located. The hot tub is a huge bonus and the hosts are always very welcoming and making cool improvements to the outdoor spaces."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard was a fantastic host. The Airbnb is in a great location with super fast access to downtown Fort Collins. Would highly recommend this place to anyone.
The bed is really comfortable (better than my bed at home) and the shower is great (great pressure, lots of hot water!).
The airbnb feels personal and well thought out, and it is clear the space has been curated carefully to make guests stay as comfortable as possible.
We really enjoyed the personal touches and highly recommend the hot tub in Richards beautiful garden (great for star gazing!).
Although we didn't get a chance to use it - it was really nice of Richard to leave firewood for the outdoor fire-pit next to the decking - had we been staying longer we'd have loved to use this and the outdoor grill.
Richard's communication was fantastic throughout always responding quickly and happy to help with any queries.
Thanks again Richard!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Richard's place! It was the perfect quiet retreat. Unfortunately, there was a big storm the night we arrived, but Richard was great about meeting us outside to walk us back through the yard since there was a lot of debris from the storm."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely perfect for a getaway. Even though it was on the host’s property, it still felt very private. Very rustic and calming!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Richard is great. Please is super unique and close to all the good spots in old town. Hot tub is awesome.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy,cute, cottage! In my mind one of the better VRBO’s that I’ve stayed at If you like hanging out in the gardenwith very calm ducks and chickens this is your place. Set a few miles off from town, with excellent views of the mountains. Nice functional kitchen. True confession, I’m not really a dog lover. This place would be super perfect if you were bringing dogs with you. But just great if you’re two people that are doggone tired and wanting a quiet place to hang out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, perfect place near the poudre canyon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's place was homey, clean and a great respite from the bustle of Ft. Collins. Beautiful views of the mountains and we were able to have cozy fire pit at night.
Per Richard's recommendation we had a an awesome breakfast at MeOhMy restaurant just minutes from his place.
Thanks Richard for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard’s place is so amazing! The views are phenomenal, the space is so nice and Richard is great!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Out of 5 stars we give Richard's place a 10. It was so cute and clean and cozy. The location is great, close to Old Town. There's a grocery store nearby but you feel like you're out of town.
The view from the house is great, and there's a cute little outside area that's fenced. We enjoyed the animals on property, and all the plants are gorgeous.
Richard was friendly and very responsive to messages. I definitely will book this rental if I ever get the chance again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an unexpected home, away from home experience - and Richard is a charming and gentle host, offering the perfect balance of welcome and privacy. We look forward to visiting again when the grounds are in full bloom - the thought of a wall of hops and a path flanked with sunflowers peaks my imagination and curiosity. Funky, immaculately appointed, thoughtfully clean - accessible to anything you want to do."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome stay at Richard’s! Clean, inviting, cozy, and friendly! Must book if you have the chance!!! Thanks so much Richard!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard’s place was perfect for my daughter and me on our long weekend getaway with access to great hiking and restaurants. Richard is friendly, helpful and not intrusive. We enjoyed watching the ducks, chickens, and rabbits and especially appreciated fresh eggs! The hot tub was an awesome addition after a day of hiking. I would definitely return to this little gem!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of our favorite AirBnB we had ever stayed. Richard was an awesome host. He’s very responsive to our questions and messages. The guest house is super cozy and that view is absolutely amazing, it was very relaxing. The hot tub was very clean and very accessible. We had to leave our stay early due to family emergency, Richard was so accommodating and helpful with the process. He certainly helped making a difficult situation at home easier by being so understanding and accommodating. He even gave us some chicken and duck eggs to go. We will definitely return to Fort Collins to complete our trip in the near future, and will most definitely return to stay with Richard. His place is so great, don’t think we will ever stay anywhere else in Fort Collins!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was great. It’s very clean and beautifully decorated. We loved waking up in the morning to view the mountains, the ducks and chickens were a bonus. Richard even gave us some eggs. He communicated with us well, and also gave us privacy. The hot tub is worth paying a little extra for.
It was close to town. I also loved all the plants in the cabin. The bed was cozy and the fireplace next to it made it difficult to get out of bed! Would definitely stay here again!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had the best time being able to just check out of reality for the weekend and just enjoy our first wedding anniversary. The hot tub was amazing and private with views for days. We cannot wait to get back up there again very soon.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay!! Richard was and is a very generous host. His response was immediate to each message we sent him even when we asked to see, pet, and love on his fur children! The mountain view from the kitchen is impeccable and breath-taking; definitely a place to stay for those who don’t see mountains often (like us!).
Richard offered us duck eggs to make for breakfast one morning which were delicious! He gave us our space, as expected, but checked in with us periodically after making a personal connection with him the first day there…..coming from Iowa, we greatly appreciate hosts/hostesses who reciprocate the friendliness and personal connections!
The pictures online showcasing the place matched perfectly to where we stayed. Everything was clean and tidy and all instructions were thorough and understandable. I would recommend this stay to anyone and everyone tenfold. We will be here again in the future!
Love from Iowa."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Richard’s home on the range was absolutely wonderful! The carriage house is beautiful, filled with live plants, comfortable bedding and a beautiful view of the mountains. The fenced in yard was perfect for our pups! It’s a perfect little getaway to feel like you are out of the city and you are just a quick drive to town. We really enjoyed his animals and he shared his delicious duck and chicken eggs for us to eat for breakfast."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely stay, cozy spot I would highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about this listing and the host, Richard! The guesthouse is so cozy and only five minutes from Old Town! Richard was very accommodating when I needed to add an additional pet to the booking and was super friendly during our stay! I would highly recommend this stay to anybody going to Fort Collins. My wife and I had a very relaxing experience!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at Richard's place! It felt like we were out in the country and the home is adorable. Will definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quite the little getaway. We (especially the pup) had a wonderful time staying at Richard's guest house. Richard was very hospitable and accommodating. We look forward to staying here again while in Fort Collins.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful place! My partner and I wanted to plan a quick weekend trip and it was important that we were able to bring our dog, so finding this place was perfect! The property was lovely and all the accommodations were perfect for people and pets. We very much enjoyed our stay and would absolutely choose to stay here again 😁"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Richard and his place were great. He was very welcoming and even gave us eggs from his ducks! The hot tub was very private and Richard gave us a very easy run down on how to use it. The location was also great, a quick five min drive from downtown foco! My only recommendation is that if you have dogs w a high prey drive to think before you book here. The small animals share a fence w the yard of the guest house which led to some chaos."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Richard’s place is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places that I’ve ever stayed. Will definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay!! We enjoyed mornings on the porch swing and the lively personalities of the ducks! It was also super clean and cozy! Richard was super helpful and responsive.
It’s only 8 minutes away from downtown. I thought it was a so kind for him to offer us duck and chicken eggs! Also he had lights on the pole outside, for super easy findable at night, really thoughtful!! Overall would most definitely stay again! :D"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely time at this tiny house! Clean and cozy and even a private yard for our dog. We were comfortable all around! We loved the ducks, chickens, and bunnies too! Thank you, Richard!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Easy check in. Great amentities. Richard was very responsive and very nice! Would totally stay here again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A girlfriend and I decided to fly in for a long weekend last minute, and we absolutely lucked out with finding Richard’s place! The space is quaint, cozy, impeccably clean and honestly about the cutest space I have ever seen. Richard by far gave us the greatest Airbnb experience I have ever had- He was helpful, accommodating, communicative, thoughtful (even left us fresh eggs by the gate for breakfast). If we ever find ourselves back in the Fort Collins area, there’s not a second thought as to where I’ll be staying!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Dog Friendly with fenced yard! Richard is an amazing host and was so open to my last minute booking with MULTIPLE dogs that I was transporting from Cali to MN!! Due to weather/storms I didn’t get in until late. The instructions were easy to follow and path well lit. The decor was rustic and I appreciated the overall vibe/energy of the place. Richard was great about getting the 4-6 inches cleared from the path, the deck for the dogs and even cleared off my rental van, which of course didn’t come with a snow brush/scraper!!! A very helpful and gracious host! He has a separate area/yard for his dogs while his guests are there with theirs. Dog friendly hosts are few and far between!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love Richard's little cottage. It was such a relaxing and wonderful stay for me and my dog. Of all the dog-friendly hotels and Airbnb's I've stayed at, this was the best! There were extra water bowls and treats and dog bags, and an entirely private fenced in yard. The expansive view of the mountains was also a pretty good perk!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little house! Beautiful view and the pet policy was amazing, 4 dogs were welcome!
Host made everything very easy and stress free."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard was a fantastic host, very helpful and quick with communication. The location is absolutely perfect, and the views are one in a million. What I was most impressed by was the cleanliness of the home. Richard goes above and beyond to ensure you have a confortable stay. If we are ever in Colorado again, we’re staying here. Highly recommend!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot near Old Town, but still felt far enough out like a cottage in the woods. A beautiful garden with sunflowers and twinkling lights at night. The place had everything you could need and more, including fresh eggs from the chickens. Cute bunnies, chickens, and ducks live in the garden! The decorations were adorable and the vibe was perfect! Richard was a great host as well."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent place to stay, exactly as described. Off a major road so does make it hard to find initially but the spray painted numbers do help. Peaceful and great for our dog."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful spot. Traveled there with a dog and a baby, recommend spending a few nights to truly enjoy it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Richard's guest house was the highlight of our trip! It was great to come back from a day of conferencing to relax and recharge in the beautiful little guest house. The space itself was warm and welcoming, with extraordinary views. It had everything we needed for our five day stay and Richard made us feel at home. While off the highway, we couldn't hear the traffic at all. Instead, we were surrounded by peaceful quiet broken up by the content noises from the chickens and ducks. A wonderful and restorative place to stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A little oasis off the highway. This is a unique stay with wonderful charm. We would stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our quick stay. Very relaxing space and love the urban farm environment. House is beautiful and comfortable.
Thank you for being such a great host."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean. The view was great. The hot tub was a wonderful addition. The cook wear was pretty nice. The cottage was air conditioned. Little personal touches made the place feel unique and homey. He had fresh eggs from his hens waiting for us! Richard's availability and communication was excellent, and the place being smack in the middle of his beautiful garden made it special. Worth the money."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite Airbnb experiences yet! The inside is awesome, even better than the photos, and has everything you need for a laid back “farm-feel” stay. Our favorite place to hang out was the cozy outdoor space, and our dog loved getting to stare down the chickens and rabbits on the property from the fenced in yard! Richard was an excellent host: communicative, thoughtful, and personable! This is on our list of Airbnb’s we hope to return to in the future. Thanks, Richard!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Richard’s place was great for crashing after a show at the Mishawaka. Very rustic with great mountain views.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is an absolute gem!!! Richard has done a beautiful job creating a space that feels comfortable and welcome. There is an air conditioner as well as fans that make the space very livable. More than that, the location is more in the country providing a wonderful oasis from day to day busyness."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is exactly why I love Airbnbing. Richard was a great host and did a great job at making a really special little place for guests to stay! The carriage house had everything that we needed and is very close to town…there are also awesome recommendations for places to go and eat in Fort Collins. We lived meeting Richard and his “pack” and felt very at home!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Creative design, relaxing porch swing and the various pets on the property add up to a great visit. The owner is helpful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Close enough to Fort Collins, but also far enough away where you can stay out of the college crowd, relax on the porch swing, and enjoy the views of Horsetooth. There is your own private fenced in yard, so not only I, but my dog was able to take advantage of the space.
Richard is a very accommodating host and the space was very enjoyable. A new a/c unit had been installed and there were enough fans to go around so staying cool in the CO heat was a breeze.
Will definitely be returning when I visit Fort Collins in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Richard was an outstanding host. He was so accommodating to our stay. It’s been a little warm this week and Richard installed a portable A/C for us to be comfortable during our stay. This place is perfect for a quite getaway and well stocked with whatever you need. We will definitely be back here when in Fort Collins.
The Elliott’s"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic spot. Beautiful outdoor space with a lovely porch swing. Super dog friendly. Warning: if it’s over 95 in Fort Collins, this place will be HOT during the day. The bedroom has no windows, so it can take a while for the house to cool down for comfortable sleeping. For every other month of the year, I’d stay again in a heartbeat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little oasis is a perfect home away from home. We loved the atmosphere of the place so much that we decided to stay in and relax on the patio for an evening, and it was just the recharge we needed. Our dogs had much-needed room to run, and we enjoyed not only the view beyond the home but also the beautiful landscaping of the homeowner's yard. All around a lovely place to stay and somewhere we would consider staying again if we ever return to the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Lots of love in that place. Great spot to crash for a night at the Mishawaka/Ft. Collins. Thanks Richard.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent experience. Cool little spot!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Richard’s place is awesome. We were sad to only be staying one night. The guest house is super cozy and has beautiful mountain views. The fenced in area for the dogs was great. Richard is super friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Brought my old dog for a short getaway, very pet friendly! Ft Collins downtown area is very cool, lots of great local places. The cottage was clean and comfortable."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed staying in this lovely cottage with nice view of the mountains. It was perfect for us to come visit our daughter who goes to CSU. Richard is a great host and made sure we had anything we needed not to mention he is just a great guy to chat with. We would love to stay here again next time we come to Fort Collins.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a brief stay--but I loved the cabin and Richard was a great host.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Richard's guest house was exactly as we had hoped and exactly as promised by all the other rave reviews. It was private, peaceful, and cozy. We arrived during a snow storm and Richard had already shoveled the walk for us. I was a bit worried about the insulation in the guest house and whether we might be cold, but it was perfectly warm! I especially enjoyed the faux-fireplace heater near the bed. Richard welcomed us when we arrived and made it known he was available as needed. But we never needed him! The house was clean and fully equipped with kitchen wares (french press, kettle, coffee, tea, dish ware), bath supplies, and plenty of entertainment. We particularly enjoyed Richard's selection of board games and card games. Oh, and must not forget the hot tub! That was an especially nice feature on our wintery getaway. The views from the kitchen and living area make you feel like you're in the country, but don't worry, you're no more than a five minute drive from downtown Fort Collins. All together, we have nothing bad to say about Richard or the guest house. It was a perfect experience and we will be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The entire cabin is magical and absolutely beautiful! We greatly appreciated Richard’s hospitality and the suggested hikes, restaurants, and bars. We definitely hope to stay here again!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely perfect little carriage house! Very clean and cozy!
The fresh eggs from the chickens were a perfect breakfast!
If arriving at night, it is a little difficult to see which driveway to pull in to, but once we managed it was a wonderful experience.
Outstanding!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Richard's place is a great home base for a Fort Collins trip. We had no troubles getting an uber to/from downtown to his place. It is tucked away behind the main house with great views of the mountains. The space itself is perfect for a couple (we brought our dog too!). Richard was super communicative and I would stay there again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing stay!!!!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really nice get away place to stay! Very cozy and soothing atmosphere! We loved it! It is a bit of a hike to get back to the cottage but once you are there it is worth it! The fenced yard is small but so convenient if you have dogs as it helps them feel some freedom and be able to run around a little. The cottage has lots of amenities we didn’t expect…board games, guitar and bongo drums to enjoy, computer and speakers for music. The little kitchen was well stocked with what we needed to cook for ourselves. The hot tub is private from the neighbors but not really private as it is up next to the main house . The chickens were fun to watch and we enjoyed fresh eggs for breakfast! Richard is a very nice guy and willing to help with whatever you need."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard was an excellent host and the house was so cute! We brought our husky and Aussie who loved having a fenced in space to play. The decor and ambiance was very well done. Easy Uber to the nearby breweries and downtown FoCo. Would stay here again!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! A short drive from downtown Fort Collins, but feels like you’re staying on a farm out in the country. Richard is communicative and helpful. Loved the farm fresh eggs and the fenced in backyard for the dogs!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at Richards little piece of heaven. Very close to CSU and Old Town. He is also a very talented singer and song writer not to be missed if he is playing out during your stay. I highly recommend booking a stay there.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable little house has been beautifully renovated. My friend and I came to Ft Collins for a show in Old Town, so we were perfectly situated at Richard’s place. The house had all the amenities we wanted. We loved seeing the bunnies and chickens, too. And Richard was super accommodating and helpful."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Richards place and it was exactly as pictured and it was such a idyllic little getaway for myself and my wife. You’re close to a brewery ( total walking distance to paddlers pub), 5-10 minutes from downtown and it’s also just a perfect spot if you’re looking to stay put and not go anywhere. We loved sitting on the patio, listening to the chickens and playing board games that Richards place provided. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Fort Collins area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The street going past Richard’s is busy but don’t be alarmed. When you slip along the fence, chickens and flower lined path, you’ll find yourself in a little oasis. We enjoyed a breakfast of eggs from the resident hens while watching hawks catch field mice in the meadow. The lodging is creatively and comfortably decorated."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great! Richard is a very nice guy and the cabin is really cool and relaxing. Great views of the Front Range, great decor, comfortable bed. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a place to relax in Fort Collins."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Richard's place. The carriage house was clean, cozy, and exactly what's pictured on the listing. Communication was easy and stress-free, and we loved being about a 5-10 minute drive away from the heart of downtown Fort Collins. Overall this was an excellent stay and a great value!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's place is the perfect getaway! The bed is comfortable, the views are gorgeous, and the shower temperature is easy to control. I'd absolutely love to visit again!!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Good clean place to spend a night
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Richard’s place was wonderful! It was just outside of Old Town yet secluded with no houses or anything behind you and a beautiful view out the kitchen window. The place was extremely clean and cozy. We enjoyed having breakfast on the porch each morning. The coffee Richard provided as well as the fresh eggs were delicious! Richard was very friendly and responsive. The hot tub was lovely in the cooler Fort Collins evenings we had. Richard’s rabbits were adorable and it was so fun to see the huge frogs hopping around in the backyard! Just a great stay all around. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to others.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard’s place was great for exploring both Rocky Mountain National Park and Fort Collins. Our city pup enjoyed the new sights and smells. The house was clean and included perks like sunsets views, instruments, games, Netflix, and sunflowers lining the walkway. Richard was great communicating with us before and during our stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,oh my goodness! such a cute spot. my partner and i booked this spot for a romantic weekend away and it was just what we needed. the animals are all so cute to watch and you have a gorgeous view of the mountains.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a comfortable stay at Richards’s place. Very private. Cute, and comfortable space. The enclose private yard was a plus for us since we traveled with our little puppy. Great communication and easy check in."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's place was great and matched photos perfectly. It sits right on the north side of town, very close and convenient to old town Fort Collins and also nice and close to Poudre Canyon if you're looking to hike. The place was wonderful and we really enjoyed sitting on the deck in the evenings.
We were a little worried about the lack of air conditioning (highs when we were there were in the upper 90's), but Richard provided a bunch of fans, and it cools off enough at night that we ended up putting on extra blankets to stay warm. So I wouldn't let the lack of air conditioning stop you from staying at this wonderful place! Overall highly recommend, and would stay there again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Richard’s place! Richard is a wonderful and welcoming host and his guest house is super cute and close to everything! We had a great time exploring Lory State Park (only 20 minutes away) and Horsetooth Reservoir as well as a few (of the many) breweries in town. We would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is so carefully thought out. Beautiful views, great vibes, and located close enough to town but far enough away to feel like a getaway."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really cute place with lots of thoughtful touches. Entering the cottage through the towering plants and sitting on the veranda looking into the mountains and listening to the chickens made us feel extremely relaxed. Would definitely stay again :-).
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is awesome and great for traveling with your pup! The fenced in yard was perfect. Feels so secluded but is also super close to downtown Fort Collins. Had a great trip! Wish we could have stayed longer, thanks again!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your place was absolutely AMAZING! I was a little worried about being secluded and it was perfect. The sunflower path was GREAT! Helps so much with privacy.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean studio, and although it was a ways away from Old Town, it was very easy to find. I would have liked to have had more towels and washcloths in the bathroom, but other than that it served our purpose great."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I had such a fantastic stay here!

Area feels very safe!
Amenities were 100% and we had everything we needed.
Bed was super comfy, and for the price I was so amazed with the amount of space we got!
The separate entrance made it feel very separated, and like our own little space.
Cute little deck was so perfect and relaxing.
Plenty of hot water for showers/baths.
I could easily live in there!
Owners were so quick to respond, very helpful, and super sweet.
We were so happy to catch this spot, and I would 100% stay here every-time visiting Fort Collins again! Super recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely loved my stay there. It was perfect for my needs while I was in college for a month. Close to old Town fort Collins , so much to see and do.

Steve and Maggie responded immediately to an issue with the AC and fan when I first arrived and took care of it. They were also very friendly.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Very clean and was a pleasure to stay on.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The area is good, quiet and very close to charming Old Town. The bed is comfortable as is the sofabed.
Unfortunately, upon arrival (on a Sunday) we were informed that per the previous guests, the microwave wasn’t working and that a technician was scheduled to come on Wednesday. The guy came and told us that it had to be replaced. The whole stay came and went and the hosts never contacted us about it. Neither did they offer a solution. We cooked breakfast every morning and not having a microwave was an annoying issue.
Also, I dropped something that went under the bed; when retrieving it I saw 3 pieces of used kleenex tissues and 3 hair ties. In the restroom, by day 3 , a pink rim appeared in the toilet with morning and before bed use only. That only happens when a toilet hasn’t been thoroughly cleaned. There was dust here and there and a few hairs in the bathroom. They need to check the place after the cleaning team finishes and before guests arrive."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Steven & Maggie for an absolutely fabulous, cozy, quiet, and private studio stay during my Colorado adventure!! I felt safe and right at home.

Easy, fast, wifi access with a generous offering of streaming entertainment access. Lovely space for remote work while enjoying Ft. Collins day and night life.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a great time staying here. The recommendations for food, activities, etc. in the guest book were so nice! The bed was very comfy, the neighborhood quiet and safe. The entire place was spotless- shoutout to whoever cleans their apartment. We didn't have to communicate with the hosts at all- all directions were very clear and we had no issues with anything in the unit. They even included some local brews in the fridge, which is so kind, but my partner and I don't drink so we left 'em for the next people. All we had to do is throw in a load of towels before we left, easy peasy :)"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Steven & Maggie was good overall, but there were some issues with cleanliness (the tub was not draining when we got there, there was a lot of hair on the carpet, the pillowcases seemed used, the hand soap in the bathroom was empty, etc). When we informed the hosts of these issues, they were very responsive, professional, and kind in fixing all of the issues.

It's clean, cozy, well decorated, and well laid out. Great communication with the hosts, as usual. We were a bit short on coffee pods and the ice cube tray was broken. We asked for more coffee and a fresh tray and they magically appeared within a couple of hours. Great to have the hosts living right next door! Thanks again. I'll be back!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steven and Maggie's Airbnb is clean and well kept with good amenities and good recommendations. Even when the power went out (a first) they were extremely prompt before I was even aware the power had gone out and we're available to assist to make my stay as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. would recommend staying here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean! Small space, but well designed with comfortable furniture and a pleasing aesthetic. There were a couple of beers in the fridge as well as tea, coffee pods and a coffee maker if that's your jam. There was no Brita (which I expected coming from CA) but it turns out the tap water is great to drink in CO. Good water pressure with a nice showerhead. The smart TV worked great. The complex is clean, quiet, and inviting. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Steven and Maggie’s space is as advertised! Super clean. They were responsive when I had questions regarding the bike trails. Very basic kitchen items include Keurig pods, salt and pepper, olive oil and a few beverages in the fridge. It feels very much like a hotel room with small kitchen, and you will hear dogs and babies and the train passes nearby. Quiet hours are from 10pm-7am according to the guest book and that was true! They do ask you to start a load of towels before leaving and the checkout time is stated for 11am, but the guest book in the apartment warns cleaning crew arrives at 10am, which was not the case for us, thankfully - we purposefully choose Airbnbs with later checkout times. Overall, we would stay again if we needed an overnight in the area. Thanks for having us!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a stay in Ft.
Collins. The description of

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Steven and Maggie's immaculate studio apartment is well-equipped and even has an outdoor space that is perfect for enjoying the cool mornings and evenings of summer in Fort Collins. The location is perfect: close to Old Town, the University, and less than a mile from a food store and access to the extensive system of paved bike trails.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful little place with the amenities we needed during our travels including parking, the ability to throw in a load of laundry, and a full kitchen for our extended visit. Being north of town, it takes a bit longer to get to locations on the south side of town, but it's quite nice for access to Old Town, Poudre Canyon, and breweries.

I hope to return in the spring to visit my family again. I can't wait to visit! Thank you, Anne!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Anne was a fantastic host. I always had anything I needed, she kept a well stocked kitchenette and bathroom.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne is an amazing and friendly host; her timely responsiveness and proactive kindness made us feel very much at home when visiting Fort Collins for CSU parent’s weekend. Being in such a quiet and beautiful neighborhood was a treat after busy days and we hope the place is available next time we visit. Perfection! XO
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne and Jim are wonderful hosts. Always responsive and friendly. The location is great, and everything in Fort Collins is in reach - asking to borrow a bike was a great call, and I was able to explore a lot more of the city without needing to drive. Anne even baked some banana bread for me, which made for great snacks for my hikes. Overall a great experience! Thanks, y'all!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and easy to access. It is a basement apartment so you can hear the hosts at various times, but that was expected."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a delightful overnight stay. The accommodations were spot on as described in the website. Anne and Jim were kind and helpful. We were close to downtown Ft. Collins. It was a perfect getaway with a friend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Clean, quiet, private, and safe. The location was perfect to all the breweries and restaurants we visited."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,We were in Fort Collins to visit family. Anne’s basement apartment was ideally placed being only 3 minutes walk away and so perfectly suited our needs. . The area is residential with pretty gardens. We loved having bikes made available to us as Fort Collins is the most bikeable city we have been to with trails and bike lanes everywhere. Visitors need to be aware that although Anne graciously offers to wash dishes for her guests there is no kitchen so actual cooking ( apart from breakfast ) would be difficult. Anne kindly made us wonderful banana bread which we shared with our family! Visitors like ourselves who are used to sleeping in a queen or king bed need to know that although comfortable the bed here is standard double and feels small. Anne welcomed us on arrival and communication with her during our stay was easy by phone messaging.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Generous and kind hosts. Clean and comfortable place. Good location and super quiet!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anne's home was super cozy and exactly what we were looking for. Traveling with a 1 year old comes with a whole bag full of challenges and surprises, but having a host like Anne makes things much easier because we were so well taken care of. The best part was being able to set the little one up to sleep in the living room, while we slept in the bedroom. that way we aren't waking each other up throughout the night like what happens in a small hotel room.
Note, if you have a really big cooler, it can be tricky to navigate the stairs with. It's able to be done, but having a smaller cooler would have made it much easier, but that's obviously on us for having an obscenely large cooler.
If we're ever back in town, we will definitely look up Anne. It was an extremely smooth process and we had no issues."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely get away from the blistering temperature in New Mexico. Would recommend it to anyone needing a summer get away. Lots to do in Fort Collins especially around the campus area. And the hikes and reservoirs are all worth playing in. Anne knows all about these things and more!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay near Fort Collins. Anne and Jim were very responsive and even extended our hours to stay while we waited on an incoming flight to pick up our son in Denver. Thank you for a nice welcoming stay. You have thought of everything. I loved all the detail.

The location is great as you are close to restaurants, shops, etc. but yet you feel like you are in a very quiet and safe neighborhood at the same time. I felt so safe staying here even traveling by myself. Anne and doggy Drey were so sweet to greet me, and the private entrance was great as I was able to come and go as needed. I was so cozy in the space and had access to everything I needed. I’m very glad that I stayed here and would highly recommend it!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying at Anne’s place! Location was great, and everything was exactly as advertised.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne’s place was perfect for my visit to Fort Collins. Will definitely be staying here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I stayed at Anne's place for two nights while exploring northern Colorado. Super cute and clean. She made the most divine banana bread for us! Her dog, Dre, is a sweetheart. We didn't sleep super well but that is typical for us. It was so nice to have simple snacks like instant oatmeal, fruit, and especially the huge jug of drinking water with a nice spout. We did not use the television on our trip but Anne has a fun collection of movies! Thank you, Anne!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lots of personal touches in this space. Really glad to have the bicycle to reach more of the city. Hosts were very helpful and even made me a surprise treat! An ideal choice for bringing a couple of friends or family to visit Fort Collins.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,I was immediately comfortable staying at Wild Dandelion. This is a great place and I enjoyed my 10 day stay.

It was very accommodating and Anne left us banana bread and a bottle of wine ~which we forgot to drink haha~ but it was so cozy and charming. They have a little booklet of all the places that they love and books of trails to hike. Would recommend this place to everyone and anyone.
Thank you for sharing your home with my partner and me :)"

They provided extras like beach towels, checked up on us regularly, and even gave us some delicious baked goods! We visited at an unusually hot time of year, but the basement apartment stayed cool and comfortable with fans on. It's also a good location for visiting Old Town, which is where we spent much of our time when we weren't out on other adventures like rafting or paddle boarding. We'd definitely consider staying if we ever visit Ft. Collins again and would recommend it to friends."

The TV was great for the one night we used it. There are plenty of bikes to use as well.

I felt welcomed as soon as I pulled up to the curb and saw charming lights lining the little path to the private entrance. Once inside, I was blown away by the thoughtful touches. They had truly thought of everything I could possibly need and then some. Everything was clean, comfortable, and convenient. Getting into Old Town, as well as picking up essentials at the grocery store, were a quick and easy bicycle rides, and I could securely store my bike in the backyard when I wasn't riding around town. My stay was a much needed and appreciated get away after a rough year, and this space made it a truly relaxing experience. Seeing the chickens every morning was also a delight!

I don't want to set the expectations TOO high, but I did get fresh baked pumpkin bread AND gingerbread during my stay, not to mention other food and coffee goodies all set up upon arrival. There is not a full kitchen, but there is a small refrigerator, a microwave and plenty of dishes that you leave out on a little tray after you use them, and they magically turn into new, clean replacements. It's a comfortable and inviting basement space with its own entrance. The neighborhood is quiet but close to many conveniences. It was a great week in Fort Collins made greater by this great rental."

The apartment was extremely clean and comfortable. So many thoughtful touches in the apartment - soft carpet, cheerful decor, everything we needed for a comfortable stay. About a 15 minute bike ride to Old Town through very safe neighborhoods on wide bike lanes. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Fort Collins. Thank-you Anne!"
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Anne’s place was super clean and comfortable with nice colorful and charming touches. The bed was really comfortable and we enjoyed having the microwave and fridge for all our food. The place is the entire basement of their house, and has a separate back entrance. The only hiccup we had was with the connectivity bc my husband and I were both trying to work remotely. The basement does not have any cell reception so we were reliant on the WiFi which was spotty. Anne kindly gave us her home WiFi and I worked in the backyard but it was still a bit laggy for video conferencing unfortunately. However, Anne’s hospitality (and delicious lemon cake!) was amazing, the stay was really comfortable and overall we’re really glad we found this place."

But the best thing ever: Ann delivered muffins, sliced watermelon, fresh eggs, and fresh posies for the table. A lovely stay. Calm, quiet, good location, friendly hosts - would recommend."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay at the Wild Dandelion Suite. It was super clean and inviting, and everything we needed was there. The location close to campus and Fort Collins Old Town was ideal. She has a very informative guest manual full of lots of recommendations that we made good use of. The description of the suite is very accurate and there were extras we weren't expecting like a cooler we used on our day trip to Lory State Park and fresh muffins on our first morning. We had such a comfortable stay and enjoyed exploring Fort Collins so much that we forgot to be sad about saying goodbye to our college freshman!"

My husband travels for work, therefore we stay in a lot of Airbnb’s. It didn’t take even an hour for my husband to express how he thought “this was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at”!
Anne is the sweetest person in Fort Collins, I’m convinced! She baked us the most delicious muffins we have ever had, TWICE!! She always made sure we had everything we needed.
The space is BEAUTIFUL and so COMFORTABLE! Perfectly, sparkling clean!!
The carpet is so soft, that I (being 36 weeks pregnant) took a nap laying on it!!
DO NOT PASS ON THIS PLACE!! If it’s available, it should be your very first choice!!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne’s space is quite comfortable, quiet, cozy, and private.
Anne is thoughtful, pleasant, helpful, and straightforward.
This was our second stay at Wild Dandelion and it won’t be the last..."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Friendly hosts and comfortable space! This was a great place to relax at the end of a long day skiing or exploring town.
2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very charming and the location is great. Very easy to get to and just a short drive to Old Town. Anne was a very gracious host and left warm muffins outside the door. My friend and I enjoyed lounging in bed while drinking coffee and planning our day. The amenities are fabulous and the space is well thought out. There’s a large dog on premises and he seems quite protective. So if you have an aversion to that, it’s good to know ahead of time. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot and great space with lots of room. I was thoroughly impressed. It was great to be able to use the bikes to get around and bike & brew. Highly recommended!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne and Jim were great! Their home is lovely and i would absolutely stay again!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my home base for a short trip to visit my daughter at CSU. The place was very nicely set up, Anne was very responsive and a hospitable and gracious host- I'd stay again."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Wild Dandelion over Thanksgiving while visiting family in the area. The suite was spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful amenities. Anne & Jim not only provided tips for enjoying the area, but also things that travelers may want for Ft. Collins but may have forgotten at home (a backpack to borrow, reusable water bottles, hiking maps etc.) I also appreciated their focus on sustainability (metal straws!) It had just snowed, so we weren't able to take advantage of riding bikes etc, but definitely will next time we're back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Anne was very accommodating and welcoming. Her place was very clean and has fantastic decor. I even received some delicious banana bread! Check-in and check-out was a breeze. I highly recommend staying here.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wild Dandelion is comfy, cozy, private and secure, a great place for an older woman traveling alone. It is very close to Old Town and easy base for my stay in Fort Collins. The owners are great communicators and made sure I was comfortable, even bringing me freshly baked muffins."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in many AirBnB's but this one ranked at the top of the list. The place itself was very comfortable, but Anne and Jim have seemingly thought of everything. There was a wonderful area for coffee with a microwave and fridge. Backpacks and an umbrella by the door, bikes to ride, books to read, great guide on Fort Collins and their favorites areas to visit. To top it off, I woke up the first morning to find a (still warm) freshly baked loaf of pumpkin bread with a chocolate ribbon no less, waiting for me outside my door. I highly recommend the Wild Dandelion suite!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet, private, with thoughtful touches throughout (cruelty-free products, organic healthy snacks, gas fireplace). Anne was immediately responsive to my questions and helpful but non-intrusive. I hope to stay here again in the future. Thank you!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! It's a quick bike ride to CSU, and the bed is so, so comfortable. The eggs from the backyard were a great perk, and I'd definitely stay here again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wild Dandelion turned out to be a great place for the two of us as a ""home base"" to explore Fort Collins, the foot hills and beyond. Our stay was great fun, and I recommend Anne's Wild Dandelion."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is spotless and comfortable, with lots of thoughtful touches to make your stay there convenient and pleasant—-such as a bedside outlet for your phone, a kettle devoted to water only so your tea doesn’t taste like coffee, and good local recommendations."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, perfect location close to everything, clean and private."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Place was really clean and tidy, the hosts were really kind and helpful and the location was really close to some beautiful parks and not far from old Town and some shops. Really enjoyable time."

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anne's studio is a perfect place to enjoy the outdoors, food, and beer of Fort Collins! A great private space with a lot of yummy snacks. Longish walk or very short lyft to the best breweries in the country!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had my family stay here when they visited from PA. They loved the space! Cozy feel with a friendly introduction and plenty of tips on what to do in the area.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Seemless, from beginning to end. Chris is incredibly organized. I really didn't need to contact him because he was so thorough. The space is comfortable, cozy, charming and very well stocked. The beds were comfortable as well, a wonderful surprise (Im pretty picky). I really loved the vintage theme and there were some interesting historical items. Bottom line, I highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is definitely as described, and the experience is indescribable. You do feel like you're traveling in time. Chris thinks of every detail, and it truly feels like a home away from home. The setup is very functional, with everything you need readily available. We loved using the sauna during our stay. We will definitely be coming back on our next trip. The location is also centrally located, making it convenient for exploring the area."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The basement apartment is cozy and well stocked. The vintage furnishings are a treat. Christopher was welcoming and flexible.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant six night stay while visiting relatives nearby. The unit is spacious; the ""great room"" is great indeed. The unit is very quiet - the house is on a dead-end street - but it is only three blocks from the main road between Fort Collins and Loveland. It snowed during our stay; the roads are plowed once a day. Everything worked. The appliances are vintage-style but not vintage. We were able easily to prepare breakfasts.
We'll hope to stay here again on our next trip to the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here. it is quiet, very spacious, and close to restaurants and shopping. Check-in was very easy. we hope to stay again when we visit the area again in the fall."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay. A very cozy place - Chris is an excellent host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was truly a home away from home. Our 1-yr old felt so comfortable right away, and it was awesome teaching/learning about the various antiques. Chris was very responsive throughout our trip, and they even dropped off random surprises!
Will absolutely be looking this place up again when we return to Fort Collins!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This felt good from the moment we walked into the space! Tasteful, fascinating antiques scattered throughout the rooms. We had plenty of room to relax, cool off and unwind. Very, very quiet place. No noise was heard at all!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host really did think of everything a traveler would need when staying in a home other than their own. Labeled cabinets/drawers, sample toiletries, and plenty of towels. Great host and this will be my go-to now when I come to a Fort Collins."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,I had a long stay at Christopher’s - 3 weeks. I can honestly say everything went very well and I had no issues. The place was well stocked - way above what I expected. The living area was roomy and I was most comfortable. I appreciated the goodies and little extras. I felt at home the entire time!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great for our quick overnight or
an extended stay."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Thank you to Chris for the use of his home. The many antiques were interesting to see and brought
back many memories. However, when we read the Airbnb description of the house…lower lever with
separate entrance…we mistakenly thought this was a walkout unit. As senior citizens we were quite
surprised to see we had to negotiate a steep stairway with all of our luggage. I think this ought to be
explained in the Airbnb write up. We did love all the little treats that Christopher provided us with. We
were here for a family reunion and the unit was in a good location with easy access to Loveland where
other members of our family were staying."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to stay. I would definitely use it in the future.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Christopher's place. Instructions for parking and entrance were excellent.

The property is conveniently located near to Fort Collins and has easy access to many local places of interest. The sauna was an added bonus and we made great use of it. I would definitely recommend Chris and his Airbnb.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very welcoming place! Vintage means old but not broken down. The cushions on the chairs reminded me of my grandmothers. I have 6 of her old needlepoints that matched them. She has been gone for over 30 years and the place just felt like she was right there. There were 3 families that went to a family wedding in Ft. Collins. Two stayed at hotels and we stayed at Christoper's. We loved it! The others had complained.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clear check in instructions. Very clean and homey. We even had a personalized welcome note when we arrived, Andres mints in the pillow!! If we are ever in Fort Collins will definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was very nice. Very nice beds, furniture, amenities, special thoughtful touches such as candies, sodas and water if fridge. Large enough space to not get in each other’s way. We had a car and the easy 15-20 minute drive to old town area was easy. There are natural areas to go out and walk around nearby. Highly recommend."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very homey. The beds were very comfortable and the vintage decor was awesome. There were snacks, hot cocoa, oatmeal and granola bars that were greatly appreciated. The sauna was an extra bonus we enjoyed.

We were a little nervous parking our car on the street, but we had no issue as the neighborhood seems fairly quiet."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in dozens of AirBnBs around the world. I've come up with a checklist of things all hosts should provide in their space, and Lindsay and Dave ticked every box! They have thought of everything from extra blankets and towels to toiletries to tea/coffee and snacks.
The room is very spacious with vaulted ceiling and super comfortable bed. There is a couch that can be made into a bed that looked like it would be comfortable if traveling with a kid. The shower is ***AMAZING***. WiFi/Internet is VERY good with 150mbps download.
The space is very quiet. Parking in drive is a great convenience.
This is a great place for a short-term stay. If you need to work or eat, there is a small foldout table in the mud room with one chair and enough space for just one person's computer. It worked for me, but I wouldn't want to hang out there for any length of time. Otherwise, very lovely space!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Place is very convenient to Old Town and CSU. Super clean and felt right at home.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful weekend at Lindsay and Dave's. The suite is just as described and perhaps even better. The shower especially is phenomenal!

It was roomy, the decor is calming and contemporary. Beautiful natural light and plenty of overhead light for evening work. Extremely clean and well organized. Perfect privacy with a separate entrance and ability to do laundry if needed. The yard is attractive, so I kept all the shades open to enjoy the view.

Communication with Lindsay was smooth and quick. She kindly pointed out us to a special event in the city, which we then visited. The old town is about a 10-15 minute walk away and the neighborhood of the property is very peaceful and quiet. All in all, we were absolutely satisfied and can only recommend it."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here to move our son into CSU. Because we were flying from PA, all our bags were packed with stuff for his dorm so we each only brought a change of clothes. It was nice that this place had everything you needed (ie. blow dryer, toiletries, bug spray...) The space was very well thought-out and we loved the decor style. The only negative was the wifi signal was not very strong so my husband had to go to a local coffee shop to make his work calls because they kept dropping. But that seemed to be the issue everywhere we went in FOCO."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, relaxing decor in a comfortable, fresh, private suite. The location was ideal for walking through beautiful neighborhoods and downtown Fort Collins. Lindsay and Dave were gracious and wonderfully welcoming. They allowed us privacy but were available to help if we needed it, and to answer any questions. Their place was better stocked with toiletries, snacks, etc., than any AirBnB we’ve stayed in. Would come back without hesitation on any future trip to Fort Collins."

By the way... this shower is the best shower you may ever experience. 😍 I might book again just for that alone!
We ended up having to leave Fort Collins a night early, and they were very flexible and we had zero issues. 100% recommend!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stylish well-equipped rental in a great neighborhood and a great location that’s a 15 minute walk to the center of Old Town & CSU. lyndsy and Dave have it set up with great instructions for checking in so that if it’s after dark like it was for us it couldn’t be easier. We would stay here again at any time and our only regret is that we only got a quick peek at Nelson and never got to say hello but when your dog lovers on the road even that can be uplifting.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at! I am not even exaggerating! This Airbnb was very clean, in a great location, and the hosts were more than friendly and accommodating! All of the check-in and checkout instructions were clear, and we even got to wave to our host as we were pulling in the driveway! She always kept in contact, and I can’t say enough good things about this place! such a cute unit, very clean, very warm, and there is even a friendly, four-legged pup we got to watch play in the snow out of the
glass sliding door! The pup did not come in our area at all, though :) the Airbnb was well stocked and had everything you need if you may have forgotten something for your trip! There was even a snack basket, that we exchanged some snacks with! We were so happy to visit Fort Collins, and when we come back, we will stay with them again! Thank you for everything."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This suite was even better than I expected. The space was extremely functional and beautifully decorated in a minimalistic style.

2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely appointed. Spacious bathroom. kitchenette was adequate. A regular coffee pot with better coffee is needed. With no running water near one cup coffee maker, its very cumbersome.
Check-in was easy. List of ""jobs"" to leave makes me wonder why the cleaning fee? Taking trash outside (which I didn't do) and stripping the bed both more than one should do when paying a fee."

Lots of great touches to make it feel homey: nice kitchenette area with microwave and fridge. They supplies plates, cups, silverware, etc. There’s plenty of space to hang or put away your clothes and there’s a water bottle in there as well.
The bathrooom is stunning: huge shower and a heated floor. Definitely a great feature!
The bed itself is comfortable and there’s also a sofa/sofa bed combo should you need it.

We really appreciated the air conditioning on these warm summer days, as well.
Lindsay & Dave were friendly & welcoming, & always quick to respond to any texts. The location was in a nice neighborhood, just a short walk to all that Old Town has to offer. The space was also super clean, and the patio was nice to sit w/coffee in the morning. The little kitchenette amenities were thoughtful & just enough for us. We slept so well on the super comfortable bed, and the luxurious shower was a treat. It always felt good to come back to the comforts of this quiet oasis at the end of the day. We look forward to returning next time we’re visiting Fort Collins… Many thanks again for such a wonderful stay!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome. I was visiting my daughter at CSU, so I was never more than a 5 min drive away. There are far too many personal touches to mention, but their thoughtfulness regarding a well-stocked kitchenette (including a basket of snacks) blew me away. The exposed wood ceilings in the main room plus the bathroom’s heated floors and “pebble” shower belong in a decorating magazine. This is 5 out of 5 and very high value - I will return for future trips!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place that’s located conveniently to town! The little touches like all the toiletries you might’ve forgotten and then some was a nice perk!

Well, we were happily surprised the majority of restaurants and shops were less than a mile walk away! Cute little bungalow, with the best outdoor space, was the perfect little getaway. Gracious hosts, thank you so much!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At first seemed too good to be true because it was a great deal and no cleaning fee (!) but the great reviews convinced us.
It’s really like getting two rooms and a great balcony space. The spiral staircase to the third floor was no issue for us but might be for others.
The place had everything you needed in the kitchen without the clutter. The layout, aesthetics, size and amenities were perfect for how we use a place when we go out of town.
Loved that my husband and I could sleep separately since the futon was comfy for me as I preferred firmer bed and we were both light sleepers.
The balcony was really a nice bonus and even saw a rainbow after the storm. We loved that we could walk the trails and New Belgium brewery.
Just felt like they thought of everything , even jackets you can borrow in a pinch. The guitar sounded great and even had capo, too bad I can’t play very well. Lol.
We definitely would pick the place again if they have opening next time we return to FoCo."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot that is in a great location, clean and has beautiful views. Bonus- Damon and Kim are very responsive and friendly."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay and had a great time in Fort Collins. The place was clean, updated and very comfortable to stay in. The hosts were very responsive and friendly.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! A top-tier Airbnb experience. The apartment is beautiful and spotless. Peaceful balcony overlooking snow-capped mountains.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! Located in a small neighborhood with similar interesting architecture and backing to many walking trails. The hosts generously provided both coffee and half and half, plus many other items (spices, tea, condiments). While it doesn't have a full-size kitchen, it has a microwave, fridge (smaller size), hot plate, toaster, so really easy to still prepare foods. Very nice bed and pillows, and a comfy living space to stretch out. Hosts are nice and responsive! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 stars!!!!!
Everything we can think of was there.
Absolutely through host.
Beautiful property. We really enjoyed the comfortable stay.
On our departure day we found thick snow when we woke up. The host came more than once to clear our door area, stairs AND took off snow off the car. What a nice thing to do!!
We were so so impressed with their warm thoughts. Highly recommended!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best AirBnBs I’ve stayed in. Walkable to Old Town (bikes for use if you need them) and their guidebook had plenty of recs. Damon also helped us with early check-in and some advice with RMNP.
I would stay here again in a heartbeat. What great hosts!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit is really well laid out, with a private entrance and separate kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom, and even a private balcony. Damon & Kim thought of everything, including all basic kitchen supplies, extra blankets & towels, guidebooks about Ft. Collins and surrounding area, jackets in the closet... they even provided a guitar to play!
The location was great, within easy walking distance of Old Town Ft. Collins, extensive parks with walking/bike paths, and a couple of Ft. Collins' famous breweries. Also convenient to the highway that takes you up the beautiful Poudre Canyon (highly recommended).
Check-in was a breeze, with a simple lockbox that Damon sent directions for. There's a reserved parking space right next to the stairs to the private entrance.
This was probably the best AirBnB we've stayed in, at a very reasonable price. If you visit Ft. Collins — which you really should! — this is the place to stay."

Will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. Great place in a great neighborhood. Close to everything in Fort Collins and walking distance from New Belgium Brewery.

We would definitely stay again and highly recommend!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything as described in a quiet, newer neighborhood. The stairs could be an issue, but they were disclosed ahead of time and easy to navigate. Prompt responses to any questions and changes in scheduling. Excellence value for location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Damon and Kim’s place is what all airbnbs SHOULD be. Plenty of clean linens, cute, clean and comfortable bed, a good size, clean, instructions clear but not preachy. The no cleaning fee is the icing on the cake. I loved staying here!
Only caveat would be the spiral staircase - be prepared to take your luggage up! Didn’t bother me too much though."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great spot. Old Town North has great proximity to Old Town Fort Collins. New neighborhood. Very progressive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place! It's fully stocked with everything you'll need for a short stay, and the hosts are incredibly friendly & responsive. The little apartment has a lovely view of the wooded area in the back & a walking trail that leads to the Poudre River. It's super close to downtown, too, and if the weather is nice enough - you can walk there with no problem. Overall, an incredible value for a top-notch stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay there was wonderful and very peaceful. It was perfect for the both of us. We really enjoyed our stay and appreciate you having us there.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely lovely stay! The bike trail is immediately behind the house and they loaned us bikes and a lock up for when we were out and about. The town is beautifully accessible by bike trails everywhere so bring helmets and get to it! Gorgeous design, immaculately clean (who doesn't love a *spotless* bathroom while traveling?) and private deck. Lovely natural light, and the apartment maintains temperatures well, not a lot of temp flux inside even when it fluxed a lot outside, just open windows for fresh air & fret not about hot or cold. The spiral staircase to the third floor entry is no joke - both very cool and I won't lie, a tiny bit intimidating to an acrophobe, but how often are Colorado visitors afraid of heights? Everyone shows up for mountains. Ft Collins is chock full o'trains but we only heard like 3 - in a 6 day stay, pretty quiet the whole time so that's impressive. Hosts very proactive/ responsive too."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our go to place when we are visiting our son in Fort Collins. It is the perfect size for two of us. Great apartment with a comfortable bed. It has everything we need

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect home base for my week in Fort Collins. The view of the mountains from the patio was lovely and the location was great. I took advantage of the quick walks to both downtown and the New Belgium Brewery several times during my stay. Since it's located so closely to the Poudre River Trial, the biking was excellent as well.
The apartment itself was thoughtfully furnished with all the amenities that I needed. I had to work a bit while I was there, and the peaceful neighborhood, coffee, lovely views, and speedy internet connection made for a lovely experience.
Thanks for the wonderful stay!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental was perfect for the two of us. Plenty of space. Kitchen had everything we needed. Bed was comfortable. Outside patio was perfect and the best patio furniture we have ever had at any AIRBNB
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was squeaky clean and the amenities were thoughtful and well-stocked. It was a lovely spot for our home away from home for a few days.

We appreciated the cleanliness and modern decor, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the bikes were an extra perk that we were able to utilize during our stay. We ate out a lot and the mini fridge is perfect for leftovers and basics, plus a coffee maker and hot plate gave us everything we needed. The location couldn’t be better, within walking distance to the Poudre Whitewater Park, river access, bike paths, and biking/driving to Old Town, restaurants, breweries within minutes. The outdoor patio is perfect for morning coffee and evening relaxation. The hosts were super responsive and accommodating, would definitely recommend and will come back here everytime we visit FC. We did get used to the spiral stairs!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wonderful apartment - beautifully decorated and spotless! We loved sitting on the deck and watching the sunset.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good spot, everything you need, plenty of space. It’s easy to get to Old Town, etc. I enjoyed my stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is as described and in a great location for exploring downtown. The place is very clean and modern. With no central air the living room and kitchen can get quite warm on hot summer days. The WiFi is generally fast but would drop several times throughout the day. This is a great place to stay while exploring Fort Collins.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Damon & Kim were great hosts.

The hosts are kind and gracious, the neighborhood is up and coming, and the walk to Old Town will put a warm smile on your face. You'll get over the vertigo of the spiral staircase after just one trip up and back down. After that, you'll feel like royalty each time you walk down the stairs. A++"

Overall, it’s a beautiful apartment and I’m happy with my choice of accommodation."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Damon & Kim’s apartment was great and their communication was excellent. I enjoyed sitting on the balcony with a view of the mountains. I used one of the bikes to get into old town—about a 10 minute ride. The area is residential & quiet. The narrow spiral staircase is a little precarious, but Damon had offered to carry up my luggage if needed. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay here again!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in the sky, the circular stairs taken to complete the journey was so worth it. Comfortable and super clean. Thoughtful touches made the difference as well the location.. The view from the patio was amazing. Bed comfortable, easy to use a/c in bedroom and fans in every room, kitchen well stocked although we were usually out enjoying ourselves in downtown Fort Collins only a short walk from the place. The hosts Damon and Kim couldn't be more hospitable and friendly. We habe stayed in several places in this area and this beats every single one. We will be back for sure."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this clean, modern apartment and found the location to be perfect for launching our Ft. Colins adventures.

His hiking, cycling, and dining suggestions made our experience in Fort Collins one we will never forget!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean cute apartment. As the hosts state the stairs might be too much for some people but didn’t bother me. Location was great and really appreciated the no cleaning fee.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend. Extremely close to the new whitewater park (and poudre river walk) on N college and to new Belgium brewery - just a little bit further to Old Town, however they have bikes available with a short notice. Apt had all the expected necessities and even had the coffee measured out by day! I live in Fort Collins and got this for my visiting parents who like to relax in the evening and this apt has an amazing roof top deck with comfortable chairs and a nice view of the sunset/mountains (perfect for enjoying a nice glass of wine). Kim and Damon were exactly what you would expect from a host, not intrusive, but checked in to make sure everything was going a-ok"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful place. It's spacious, comfortable and has everything you need. We didn't get a chance to try out the bikes, but they would have been a great way to get around in this area."

This was also the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! Would definitely stay again. Thank you Damon and Kim!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the apartment is great. It is easily walking distance to downtown. We also walked to New Belgium which was very close.
We loved having the hot plate to cook breakfast. The hosts have clearly put a lot of thought into the space and it shows. Everything was clean and as advertised."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Damon and Kim are wonderful hosts and provided a lovely, clean contemporary space close to the downtown area. They shared a couple of bikes that allowed us to explore a few of the many trails in the area. There’s a balcony deck right off the kitchen- perfect for a morning coffee or afternoon drink. Damon responded quickly to messages. We appreciated the attention to privacy too. We highly recommend this sweet spot!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, quaint getaway to Fort Collins.
Absolutely perfect for a couple, enough space for 2 people to comfortably work from home and take calls, as well as hang out and lounge (with space!)
If the traveling group is a group of 3, this space would also be perfect, but would not recommend 3 people working from home, it would be best used for hanging out and spending time together.
There is also a porch which had absolutely gorgeous views of the rockies - would 10/10 recommend staying here!
The hosts are incredible - continuously checked in and ensured that the snow was shoveled each morning and throughout the day as it snowed!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very awesome and quaint place. Beautiful view and perfect place to spend time in the Rockies and Old Town. A very clean place to stay.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Damon and Kim's place - the apartment is well furnished with a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom - plenty of space. My favorite was the deck off the kitchen with a beautiful view of the snow-covered mountains. I also loved that I was a block from the Poudre River Whitewater Park with lots of pretty walking and biking trails and the river runs through the middle. I walked there every day. The location is a few minutes from Old Town and 10 minutes to CSU. I also drove up to Estes Park which is beautiful. The spiral staircase can be a challenge - take it slow and hold on to the railing. Damon was so helpful and offered to take my luggage up, gave me a late check-out and was easy to communicate with. The only drawback is the train that came through at 4:30 am blasting it's horn. The schedule varies so it's hard to know when it is coming as it doesn't happen every night. I really enjoyed my stay here and Colorado is so beautiful!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was very clean and well maintained. Great location to town, campus & the mountains. I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Ft Collins."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I couldn't have had a better stay. The space is gorgeous and very comfortable, quiet and private. The view of the mountains from the patio and the kitchen is incredible. I was able to work remotely on the Wifi and Damon was extremely responsive and welcoming. The neighborhood is an easy walking distance to breweries and Old Town, but feels quiet and restful, near great walking paths along the Poudre River. I hope I'll get to stay again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so great for a quick stay in Fort Collins! Amazing location and amazing hosts who will cater to whatever you need! We had such a warm stay:)
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, new place. Great location walking distance to downtown restaurants and shops. Stylish quality decor- and warm -which was important as it was 9 degrees and snowbound for our stay. Spiral staircase might not be for everyone .
No charge for cleaning was a huge plus -very fair."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The appartment is pristine, in a comfortable neighborhood to be out at night, well and stylishly appointed, and near everything downtown Ft Collins has to offer."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, mid century modern third floor apartment, with private access via a spiral staircase.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Definitely within the top 3 of all air b&bs that I’ve ever stayed at, and I’ve stayed at quite a few. The property was beautifully furnished and gave off an amazing NoCo vibe. Everything was clean and sleek and modern and it was so great that I just had to extend my stay a couple more nights. Damon and Kim are also very hospitable folks and were always friendly and always concerned about my comfort at their place. Location is excellent as well. If you have a car you’re a couple minutes from everything to see in Fort Collins and if you don’t, everything is a short walk away. I strongly recommend this stay to anyone who wishes to experience Fort Collins and Northern Colorado from a comfortable and cozy lodging."

Great location, great hosts, and a very stylish and cozy place. Has everything you'd need. Damon was an great host and full of great information. No reason to stay in a hotel in Fort Collins with a place like this."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Is it possible to give six stars?! Damon and Kim were so incredibly nice. I was having car trouble so they let me use their car charger to charge my battery. They always offered to help and it made our stay so much more enjoyable and less stressful. The place is beautiful, clean and had everything we could possibly need. Wonderful hosts! Thank you so much :)"

2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Damon & Kim’s place was great for our stay in Fort Collins. Within biking distance to Old Town and driving distance to anything else you’d want. Parking is never an issue with your own spot. They weren’t an issue for us but there are two flights of stairs, one being a very narrow spiral staircase to get in. Beyond that the place was inviting and felt like home while we were there and Damon was incredibly friendly checking on us when he’d see us coming and going"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly appreciate the quick responses to our inquiries regarding the area! Whether it was beer, food, activities, or shopping...they had answered for everything! The bikes were fantastic and truly allowed us to explore much more of Fort Collins than we anticipated! Great location, great communication, great everything!

A little over an hour to Estes Park and the Rocky Mountain National Park. Damon was excellent with communication and offered up some great recommendations. He was very accommodating to our early arrival and super friendly. We loved sitting out on the rooftop once it cooled off at night. The space was clean, well stocked, and comfortable. We would stay again in an heartbeat. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Damon an Kim are beyond super host for they were always there to assist with daily needs and questions. Only problem I had the entire time I was there was the heat inside during the daytime, but if this isn’t that big of an issue if your out hiking all day.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a couple or friends. It's quiet and beautiful. Note that the spiral staircase is like they say, it's not the place to stay if you're afraid of heights. And the building is quiet with other tenants, so don't plan on being loud. The patio was great and we watched a beautiful sunset!!"

Don’t hesitate to book this place as it’s a great place to base your Dort Collins vacation from.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Damon was very warm and welcoming, great access to downtown. Cozy space that is easy to relax in. The stairs to get in are a bit of a challenge with heavy luggage, so plan accordingly!"

Within walking distance to the concert venue Washington’s and lots of other cool spots. Look forward to returning one day."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This ties with one other Bnb (in Bozeman) as being the best AirBnB I've stayed at. The place is actually better than the pictures show. Spotless; great amenities; the amount and type of sundries was appreciated. Just at the edge of Old Town, so very walkable with plenty of restaurants and shops. Only negative is some of the street noise - walkers beneath you being loud late into the evening."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are debating selecting this place, do it. It is one of my favorite Air BnBs I’ve ever stayed in.

The space was spotless, had a gorgeous bathtub, cozy bed, and the kitchen was lovely and stocked with everything I needed. This is in walking distance to lots of great restaurants and shops. All in all, a wonderful stay, I will come back again for sure."

If you love Old Town Fort Collins, or are looking for somewhere new to explore, you couldn’t stay in a better location. Old town is a great blend of shopping and restaurants in a beautiful, walkable space. The loft is mere steps away and a fantastic base from which to explore. I’m always looking for unique places to stay and the loft fit the bill. A great blend of urban and comfort. Beautifully exposed brick, steel stairs but accented with a luxury kitchen, and warm welcoming tones in the furnishings provided. The effect was a very calming and peaceful space. Felt at home the minute I stepped though the door.
The bed was comfortable and down right luxurious. The primary bath room would be right at home in any high end spa or hotel.
Parking and access were simple and effortless. Christine has created a beautiful space. I will definitely be back and can’t recommend it enough."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent three nights at Christine’s beautiful Airbnb in Fort Collins while visiting my daughter, a student at CSU. It was everything I’d hoped it would be and more!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully appointed. We got in late and felt bad we were not able to put this great kitchen to use. Bed was wonderful. The smell of the restaurant next door makes you want to go and try it. We did and the food was great. We parked right in front and even though it says no parking from 3-6am, it’s not enforced unless there is snow.
There are some stairs, but they are very solid. All in all, just a very great place and we would definitely stay again."

Odell is a close walk, everything is on the sidewalk. The loft itself was incredible. Clean, comfortable, well appointed, with high end touches. Easy to get in and parking close by. It’ll be difficult to stay anywhere else when visiting Fort Collins. Host was very accessible, and communicated clear instructions. Also available throughout our trip."

Easily walkable to all the amazing shops and restaurants in Old Town, with lots of easy parking. Despite being in a busy location, the Loft is very quiet. The space is beautifully designed with everything you need. The ""honor"" snack cupboard was a nice touch!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My only regret staying at Christine’s place is that we didn’t stay longer! The place was absolutely gorgeous and right downtown in Fort Collins. Everything is top notch and we’ve already bookmarked it for when we head back up that way for future trips. I would recommend to anyone!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place! We will be back!!!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is luxurious!
It is two blocks from the really bustling area, and so is extremely walkable to what Fort Collins has to offer while not having too much noise from crowds. The entrance is right on the street with a glass door with a keypad. I didn't have a car with me, but there was plenty of street parking.
The place is airy and cozy and feels elevated and quite fancy. There was soft jazz playing upstairs to welcome me in. I didn't use the spaces downstairs or the upstairs loving room, but every spot was pristine.
I like a firm bed and this was exceptional - so cozy while being supportive. Made it hard to get up!
Oh my gosh the bathroom! It feels like you are in a seriously upscale hotel.
The kitchen had everything you need and the honor pantry was an excellent touch.
I would have paid much more for this place and 100% recommend it!
[The train passed through town at 4:30 and 8 AM]"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft on Mountain was a great splurge for my last visit to Fort Collins before my daughter graduates. It did not disappoint.

This would be perfect for a football weekend because there is a great entertaining space downstairs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second time staying here and we still love it! Felt like coming home. The bed is so comfortable it’s hard to get up and get out to explore Old Town.

Can’t wait to come back again soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was attracted to this place by the pictures that were provided on the site. The place was even nicer than the pictures. I haven't been to a ton of rentals, but this one was easily the most well-stocked places I have ever been to. Our schedule was way to busy to take advantage of all of the luxuries that were available to us. If I have a reason to come back to the area, this is the place that I will look to first."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time to stay at a airbnb!! We LOVED the Loft!! It was close to shopping and restaurants!! If we ever get the opportunity to go back to Fort Collins, we would LOVE to stay there again!!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful place in Old Town FoCo. Very cozy. There was nice jazz music playing when I arrived. I was there midweek and the night scene was pretty quite. Daytime parking on the street is limited to 2 hours, but there is other parking fairly close by. May come back sometime."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine's home was exactly what we needed for our short trip to Fort Collins. Easy to find on the street, easy to park with the garage right around the corner and extremely easy to walk to a restaurant(s), bar, shop and to visit the quaint city of Old Town Fort Collins. The loft was perfect for my husband and I for the weekend. We loved everything about this place! Bonus perk was the honor pantry. We arrived later on Friday and both needing something to eat quick.. the pantry was fully stocked and satisfied our needs! The only downfall for someone would be the level of noise during a Friday or Saturday night. You can hear cars and people walking to and from restaurants/bars. Not a problem for us due to the fact that we were out past 11pm and the noise seemed to die down around midnight. But other than that, it is a CHARM! Highly recommend! Great location and great host."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, everything was within walking distance, amenities where great, wish our stay was longer. Very relaxed environment and heated floors were a nice surprise downstairs."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Old Town Fort Collins. The only drawback is parking availability, so best to plan ahead."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well designed, appealing and intimate, the Loft is a wonderful splurge for romantics! It’s sparkling clean and tastefully appointed. The ambiance is warm. The kitchen is great—our hosts had our culinary needs covered with everything from oil to spices to coffee. For dining out we had only to walk down the block to many of the city’s finest restaurants. Back at the Loft the enormous soaking tub and spa shower called us in for a relaxing hot water escape. The king bed was luxurious and comfortable. A perfect getaway!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely beautiful!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Christine was very responsive and helpful with any questions I had! I highly recommend this beautiful condo…it’s in a excellent location.

It is a beautiful space and is well cared for. The space looked and -felt- clean, the directions were clear and correct, and everything worked as it should. I am a traveler and can say that this is one of the best spaces I've stayed. I was impressed with the space but thats not what made it the best. It was the small touches, the communication, the fact that everything worked as it should have, and the general feeling that the hosts care about the experience. I can't wait to stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beat Airbnb we’ve stayed at!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was amazing! So clean and bright with plenty of space!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful loft! Near all the happenings of Downtown, but set just enough off of it too. Lovely decor and furnishings. Fantastic kitchen (got some ideas for our home remodel). Bonus entertainment area on the street level. Bed so comfy that my teenager didn’t want to get up out of. Wonderful stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting us. we so enjoyed it!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It is spacious and clean with a beautifully updated kitchen and bathroom. The location is very walkable to nearly anywhere you’d want to go in Fort Collins. Christine is very easy to communicate with and made check-in/check-out a breeze. Looking forward to visiting for our next stay in Fort Collins!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and comfortable loft! Very well appointed, lovely furnishings and convenient to walking the downtown district. Beautiful fully stocked kitchen. Comfy bed and Awesome tub/shower set up in the bathroom. I wish we'd had someone to entertain in the downstairs space with the tables and bar, it was very charming!
It is located beside & above the fondue restaurant, and if you enjoy the aroma of garlic (which I do), then its lovely. If you are sensitive to smells, it may be a little much for you.
Really the only Con; which is not the hosts fault, is the parking. We used a parking garage overnite, parked in front to load up for the day, left for several hours and came back. Went down in less than an hour to move the car and had a citation for being on the same block twice in one day. Again, not the hosts fault, but we observed them being fairly aggressive with enforcement so be prepared.
Overall a great experience, we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely clean and welcoming environment after a day of cycling through Fort Collins. Would highly recommend this loft

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,From the time we walked in and the music was playing All I Ask of You from Phantom of the Opera until the time we were leaving our vacation was great.

Thank you so much for a wonderful time in Fort Collins. We will definitely stay again if given the opportunity.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you first walk in, the tone has already been set - the furnishings are warm, cozy and welcoming. As soon as you ascend the stairs in to the loft, you’re transported to your private getaway. The amenities from the kitchen, living room, to the bathrooms are all top notch. We opted for the ultimate lovers package, and we highly recommend it! From starting with your dinner downstairs, then ending with chocolate and champagne in the loft, it made the perfect special experience for an anniversary weekend.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! It doesn’t just look nice in the pictures it is nice. Everything is quality in this place. Location is awesome! I had a hard time with the door code but got it eventually. Most likely user error on my part haha! Host answered my calls right away too when I needed help. Totally stay here, 5 stars!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great location! Just around the corner from everywhere you'd want to be in Fort Collins. The kitchen was incredible and had everything I needed to make a few meals during our stay.
If you are a light sleeper I'd recommend using a sound app to sleep. There is a town train that comes through the area at night, and being on a busy road (ie it's downtown) it can get noisy late at night and early in the morning. Were used to bigger city vibes so it didn't bother us, but I can see how someone might be surprised.
Great TV- We watched a few shows at night to wind down with the electric fireplace going in the background.
BONUS: the giant snack drawer filled with mac, ramen, nuts, chips, jerky, popcorn, and more. Dollar donation is totally worth it!!
The host was clear, quick to respond, kind... everything you could ask for.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Loft on Mountain is by far the best place I’ve used! I highly recommend the stay!

Will definitely stay again if we are back in Fort Collins and highly recommend to others."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for a quick trip to Fort Collins. The property was in great shape and Christine was easy to communicate with the entire time. Walkable to just about everything you'd want to do in Old Town and just a quick drive to the mountains for some hiking. Highly recommend
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a wonderful place. Great location, clean and very relaxing. Would recommend and will return.
Thanks"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This AirBnb is 5 stars in every way. It’s spacious, beautifully designed, luxurious and comfortable. We did the Melting Pot experience during our stay and that was truly memorable. Stay!!! You won’t regret it."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! Perfectly appointed and a great location.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Walking distance to everything in old town. Easy drive to everything else. This is a unique place with a very cool vibe. Very updated. Very urban. Feels like we’re on some home remodeling show. Has everything you could need. Great host - good communicator and offered many times to be helpful although we didn’t need anything. I wasn’t sure about parking but it was no prob at all. Just follow her directions and you’ll be fine. We’d like to stay here again someday.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine,
Thank you so much for allowing us to use your terrific property. We thoroughly enjoyed the space and the location was perfect. I also appreciated your proactive and prompt communication that helped coordinate our visit. One item, Christine, to consider — your place is so great that the photos and description on Airbnb simply do not do it justice.
Thanks again,
Doug & Jill"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning little loft, in a perfect location! 😍"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and a perfect location. The loft has everything. The best one word about the furnishings is Luxury. Very comfortable. I would highly recommend it and will stay there again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect! It’s such a sexy space- perfect for a night away with that special someone. The host is such an amazing person. And was 100% on top of responding to every question I had and made special accommodations for me. I highly recommend this location!!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay while visiting Fort Collins! Close to Old Town with so much within walking distance! My Wife and I didn’t use our rental car at all. The Loft was clean and very nice, with a full kitchen that is stocked with everything you would ever need. My wife and I might actually be stealing some of the interior design ideas for our own home. The first floor bar area was our favorite place to enjoy some drinks before heading out. Overall 10/10 and I will definitely see if this place is available next time I’m in FoCo!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is a beautiful place, immaculately clean and a brilliant location.
A clean and modern flat in a very central location. Christine's communication ahead of our stay was great and she responded quickly to any questions we had. She was very friendly and responsive to our needs. Check in and out was simple and quick. She even found a charger we had left behind.
The pictures on the internet do not do this property justice. The loft has tons of space and lavish but comfortable furnishings that made us want to stay longer! The kitchen contained all the items you would need and all very clean and well presented. We would definitely recommend the loft, as we feel so lucky to have found this treasure in the beautiful town of Fort Collins. Definitely recommend the place if you are planning a trip!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far the best AirBnB we have ever stayed in. This place had a ""wow"" factor from the moment we walked in the door. The front entrance was right off the street and had a large area to host guests and enjoy time with others. The upstairs loft was decorated and designed in such a thoughtful and luxurious way. We were greeted by soft jazz music and turned on the fireplace. With the ambience of the downtown area and the amazing bed, TV, bathroom, and kitchen, it was an incredible stay. Being in the old town area of Fort Collins was a great bonus and we especially loved Little Bird Bakeshop around the corner. Thanks for making this a wonderful stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Extremely clean, very up to date, best location. Can’t miss on this one!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christine is an amazing host! Not only has she created a space with many thoughtful details but she is a champion communicator. The space itself is very comfortable and welcoming. The kitchen is very well stocked and provided all we needed for cooking some of our meals. The bed is comfortable - love that while sitting in bed you can look out the windows to trees. Highly recommend a soak in the bathtub, perfect for relaxing after a day of hiking. The location is easy to get to and there is plenty of parking close by. Fun to stroll down a few blocks to old town. This is the best vacation rental experience I have ever had. Thank you so much, Christine!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pics didn't do place justice, was much more than expected. My choice for FOCO visits in the future!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,What a unique and beautiful place to stay! The design of this Airbnb is on point! And the location is close to everything downtown. We had a hiccup with check-in that could have been a huge issue-but Christine helped us eventually figure it out and she made it right. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication with the host was perfectly clear and always speedy. The location and the “loft” were both perfect. It’s a 2 level, beautifully furnished place. Everything was BEYOND well stocked. tons of silverware, cooking Potts, pans and tools. Tons of glasses mugs and dishes and they even provide hotel style/spa bay product travel sizes. This place is so cozy and modern. And had a reallly nice bathroom snd walk in closet. The downstairs is a little social area with your own bar, reading area and dining table. The laundry room is on this level as well. Staying here made our visit. Melting pot is literally Next door and you are in old town, but, on a quieter street, so you are not going to be bothered by TONS of noise. It’s a minute or lesss walk to the nearest restaurants, so this location is perfect. I also felt the price was extremely reasonable per night. Honestly, I have zero negatives for this place/host. The hit it out of the park."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the best air bnb we have ever stayed at! It was so cute and so comfortable! The bed was such a great nights sleep!! Thank you!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect location that is walkable to breweries, restaurants, and shopping, and with the mountains and RMNP nearby, there is so much to do!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb we’ve stayed at. Loved that everything was walking distance. Highly recommend taking advantage of the melting pot packages as well. Absolutely stunning and would definitely return.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay in Fort Collins. Location-wise its close to lots of restaurants/bars downtown, and the Odell Brewery is just a short walk. The place itself was also excellent; Bed/bathroom/shower were great, everything was clean, big TV (the Stanley Cup was on!) We'd absolutely stay there again."
