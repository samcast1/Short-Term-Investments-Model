2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Alli and Casey's lakehouse is an absolute gem on Lake Kampeska. The beds are super comfortable, and there's amenities in every room, which made our stay more than wonderful. The massage chair is an added bonus that was used by all after long days in the lake. The home was immaculate. Also, it was my daughter's sweet 16 birthday and Ali left an awesome gift!! So sweet!
I cant say enough good things about this lakeside oasis. We loved it so much we didn't want to leave. Amazing, cherished experience!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little condo. Casey and Ali are awesome hosts! The place is immaculately clean, which is something that is extremely important to us. The linens were soft and smelled fantastic! We only used the queen bed which was comfortable. The washer and dryer were so nice to have. Loved the view. No beach on property but there’s a huge public sandy beach just a houses down the road. Great fishing on Kampeska! We caught bluegill, walleye, white bass, crappie, smallmouth, and northern! Highly recommended!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Alli and Casey’s adorable Lake cottage! The view is beautiful! The lake house is stocked with everything you need to be comfortable. Alli and Casey are also great hosts and available right away if you need them.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place to stay and very clean! Eric was really friendly and quick to respond. No issues with check in or out. Central to some places to eat in the area, grocery store, and a nice park across the street. The bed was super comfortable. I do wish there was a microwave, but did not impact our stay. Just would be nice to have for the future! Would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eric’s place is beautiful, comfortable, and extremely clean. It is in the middle of everything across the street from a gym, half a block from a supermarket and close to places to eat. I enjoyed my stay there and will be returning."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A great place to stay at while contracting in the area. The host was very responsive and attentive to all questions and concerns.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just want to say this place exceeded all our expectations!! The pictures really don’t do this house justice. It’s so spacious, bright, charming. We stayed here with another family of three and didn’t feel cramped or like we didn’t have our own space. Loved the kitchen, loved the view of the lake with the double bay windows, loved the deck, ate out there. So many seating areas! It was nice it had a basketball hoop for my friend’s son. It was nice to wake up to the peaceful water and end our day with the beautiful sunset. Anna and her husband were great hosts. We didn’t have many questions but she was quick to respond."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, clean, and beautiful views from anywhere in the house!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place for a sibling and spouse get away!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb was perfect as a launching pad for our group. Anne was a wonderful host. Her communication was timely and greatly appreciated. Would highly recommend Anne and her Airbnb. Thanks again for letting us enjoy your beautiful place. Cheers!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group loved our stay even though it was winter and we didn’t get to enjoy the lake aspect. It was big and had plenty of space for our group to be together when we wanted and spread out and get some quiet time when we wanted.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our group of 9. We’ll be back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was perfect for our family to get together. We would like to stay here in the summer to enjoy the lake also.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! 2nd time at this location and will come again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place for our family to all get together and share the holidays! The living areas were spacious & the beds were comfortable. Lots of space for us to all be together in the same area or for individuals/small groups to go to separate areas and read, watch tv, play games or engage in conversation. The kitchen area is well stocked, user friendly and large so that several people can work together to create meals, etc. We very much enjoyed our time and hope to go back when temperatures are warmer so that we can enjoy more of the outdoor activities that are available."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very pleased with everything about the house!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked short notice for a family funeral. Fall at this place is lovely and peaceful. We would love to try a summer visit.
We appreciate that this place is pet friendly. The dogs and kids had a blast playing in the backyard. Our dogs are off-leash- and crate-trained, which was handy for full enjoyment of this place with dogs.
The kitchen, coffee bar, bedrooms and bathrooms were all wonderful and as listed. It has a ton of living room space to spread out and gorgeous views of the lake. We didn’t take advantage of the access to the shop or the kayaks, but both are very nice amenities.
We did have an issue with the primary heating system (baseboards) but there is a backup system that kept us reasonably comfortable. Anna was responsive and worked hard on getting it resolved. She also had a space heater sent to the house that we didn’t end up needing. Our stay ended before the repair was complete, but I have no complaints."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home in a fabulous outdoors location. Anna is very responsive to all questions.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at Anna's. She is such a great host! The place is so comfortable.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Anna's home on Pelican was STUNNING. The interior was pristine and so tastefully decorated. The kitchen has everything you need and was large enough for your whole crew to hang out in. Even if there's 8 of you! The linens were fantastic, and there were extra towels and blankets throughout the house. The outside has enough furniture for everyone to hang out in. The hot tub was a bonus, and we rented the pontoon for our stay, which was a last-minute decision that Anna made happen super quick. Communication was excellent from her and Jeff (the friendliest coolest guy). We would go back because everything was perfect. And she doesn't have 500 checkout rules, which is always nice, haha! Don't miss out on this lake treasure. You will be so happy you booked it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, very peaceful and plenty of gathering space!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and location! The home is large and spacious so that everyone is able to have some private space, but there are also plenty of common gathering areas large enough for everyone to eat and play games together. The lot is large and no one is on one side and on the other side the neighbor is a considerable distance away. The house has everything you will need during your stay. Our family will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The lake home is the perfect getaway- very private location with amazing lake views. From the inviting scent when you open the door...to the fully stocked kitchen and linens...to the beautiful decor....the owners have thought of everything. The coffee bar and reverse osmosis are nice additions. Anna was very responsive to any question we had. We'd love to return in the summer and enjoy the lake home to its fullest.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Anna's place is beautiful. I wish we could have been there in warmer weather, but it was so comfortable and bright and sunny. There was plenty of place to stretch out and relax. It was very nicely decorated and the beds were very comfortable."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"I rented this home for my family over the Class A GBB tournament this last weekend. They were so thankful to have a beautiful, clean place to hang out. They were so appreciative to have a relaxing place with a view and be able to all stay together and make memories and said the environment was so much better than staying in a hotel. There was room for everyone and space for everyone’s vehicle with the extra shop especially over the winter weather.
They asked to book again this summer!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is beautiful and tastefully decorated. The location is private and serene. Great place to stay. Will definetly be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at Anna’s place! We will be back for sure!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. Enough room for everyone to spread out! We will definitely return!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was extremely well maintained, beautifully decorated, had lots of windows facing the lake, walk-out basement was very family accommodating with lots of room to sit and visit. It was everything we could have hoped to have for our Family Christmas! They brought over a decorated tree & large crockpot for our stay! They let us check in early due to an ongoing BLIZZARD that we drove into! -47 below! Access to the Shop to park and make room for visiting vehicles was top notch! The garage was extremely essential as we had our 80 year old Parents & 4 babies under 2 years old with ""stuff"" to unload out of the weather! The kitchen was very well stocked and even had a few seasonings and baking ingredients that came in very handy. The 2 living spaces were comfortable and having 3 large tables for seating was fantastic for games and meals. The bedrooms were roomy and cozy. The Coffee Bar gets the biggest Nod from the girls. A Very Blessed Christmas Vacation for us all!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, host was very good at responding to questions. Loved the lay out of the home. We had a couple kids along so it was nice to have the bedrooms away from the main part of the house. Great location, close to town but not too close."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great house!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fabulous lake house. Great communication with owners. Highly recommended.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The skies over this incredibly calm lake were so beautiful and this lake house has it right outside its door! It is a very tranquil place to get some needed rest & relaxation, especially away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. If you are looking for a place that soothes the soul, this is it! We will definitely look to stay again in the future. Anna and Trent were very timely with their responses and just like this house, very accommodating."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here to visit family nearby. The coffee bar was my favorite part of the house!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with lots of space and a great view!!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We are a family of five adults who stayed for the first week in August 2022. We loved the house! The kitchen was well equipped, the beds were comfortable, the towels were abundant, the deck was furnished nicely and was really cute with the lights on at night. We enjoyed the fire pit, took the kayaks out often and played cornhole. We also loved having a hot tub. It was nice to have the garage to store our bikes. The neighborhood was good for walking the dog and the neighbors are friendly. If you're there in summer on a Sunday night, consider the stock car races...fun time! The Terry Redlin museum was fantastic and we liked visiting the thrift stores in town. Watertown street parking is free! How about that? Nothing says friendly like the absence of parking meters. Anna and Trent are great hosts and responded promptly to the few questions we had. We highly recommend this house. You'll love the layout of the home, with the kitchen on one side of the house and the bedrooms on the other... early risers don't disturb late sleepers! You will also love the decorations throughout the house; there were many special touches. Many thanks for a great stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful property! It has a large kitchen which made it easy to gather in for family meals. We loved the coffee bar, the lounge space in the family room, and the large backyard. We had great communication with the hosts. Our family enjoyed our stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was an absolute dream to stay at, it is beautiful and so comfy it makes you feel right at home. The view is awesome, the beds are comfy and there are just too many other features of this place to name them all. The personal touches were the best from the welcoming gift to the Wi-Fi, Netflix and fluffy white towels! The main thing that meant the most to us was the hosts They were so helpful and went out of their way to help us with any questions about the lakes and area, throw some kindness in there and boom your stay is made!! I'd give this place a 10-star rating if it would let me!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was beautiful, clean and modern. Beds were comfortable. Our group enjoyed the ping pong table and games. Kitchen well stoked."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"What an open and cozy space! We had plans that had fallen through and ended up finding this place on our way. Eric answered our request extremely quickly. It saved our weekend and made it even better than it would have been. It was peaceful and not surrounded by other houses, felt more private than the other places in the area. It was a beautiful place and decorated minimally but comfortably. We all agreed we would want to stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating and comfortable house.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The listing was as described on the website. It is a wonderful location that met our needs for the weekend. The location was clean, lots of space and very welcoming. Eric was quick to respond and was very generous when we asked about both an early check in and a late check out. Before we had arrived, I had inquired about a grill being available. At that time the answer was no. Our family made some adjustments to our menu for the weekend and no longer needed the grill. On Saturday we returned late to the house to find that a grill and several outdoor chairs had been delivered during our absence. Although we had changed our plans for using a grill, it was great that Eric had made arrangements to have one available before our visit was over. Overall, our stay was enjoyable and we would recommend this location to anyone!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was perfect for us - plenty of space to gather, kitchen had everything we needed, very clean. We felt safe to walk, had walking paths near the lake and a park nearby if small children. It is just a short drive from town. We have family in Watertown so will definitely rent again. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were so happy with our stay at Chris' home. I have to say that the reality even exceeded any pictures that were posted. The home was beautiful, very cozy and spacious, and well stocked with anything we could have possibly needed (minus groceries, of course). Our view out front was a beautiful pond and farm place on a hill, and behind us - we were right on Lake Kampeska.
We were all so comfortable there, wished we could have stayed longer!
I think my kids' favorite was the fire pit out back. We really appreciated the attached garage, as we got there in pouring rain and were easily able to unload our vehicle right into the house.
The house was also very neat and clean! Spotless and very well maintained.
Chris' communication was always super fast and friendly in response to any questions. We had no concerns at all during our visit. He is a wonderful host! We hope to get back there in the future! Thanks again Chris! :-)"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the cabin for a quick ice fishing get away, we were not at all disappointed! Walk right out onto the lake, and the small attached garage was nice as a landing spot for all our gear (was even heated so that was awesome for a real feel weekend temp of -28!) Place was clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for home cooked meals after a day on the frozen lake.
Place was clean and comfy and the living area was nice and spacious."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! We loved everything about this cabin. The location near the water, the spacious cabin, the cleanliness, the grill, the extra items in the kitchen, etc. It was the perfect place to stay during our hunting trip."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at Christophers multiple times for our family fishing trips. We keep coming back because it checks all the boxes. On our last trip, my father experienced a serious medical episode on our very first day. We had to abruptly leave and were not able to fulfill our commitment. Christopher was gracious enough to refund me the maximum allowable amount. I cannot say enough how appreciative I am for that during such a stressful time. I 100% recommend Christopher as a host and his property."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,everything was excellent
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was excellent
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We all agreed this was such a comfortable, well kept cabin. Being right on the lake was just an added bonus. Also the decor, huge TV, movies if so desired, games, completely furnished with as many towels, linens, pillows you could ask for. The ""only"" thing missing was a can opener. lol
Would most definitely stay in the future. Felt like home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is right at the lake and walkable distance from the public park. The house was relaxing to stay in. You can go to lake whenever you want. The house has everything you need from spices to utensils, including kayaks and life jackets, grill, etc. We will be back"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I really enjoyed the cabin which was beautiful, comfortable, and well supplied. We stayed during the week and it was very quite in the neighborhood which was appreciated and a little unexpected. Sitting outside gazing at the lake was peaceful and therapeutic! The kitchen is huge and stocked with everything you could possibly need to make a delicious meal (especially if you include the outdoor grill). I spent some time indoors watching tv and found the love seat recliners welcoming indeed. It was so much like home only better because it WASN'T! Hope to be back again sometime."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little spot for a small gathering! Fully appointed home, clean, quiet neighborhood right on the lake! Much bigger inside than it appears in the photos. Patio on the lake was perfect! Had access to kayaks which was very nice! On bike trail for walking or biking. Chris was responsive and pleasant. We’d like to come back next summer!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,cabin has a beautiful lake view and was in excellent condition. outdoor seating was almost right on the water and great for campfires and grilling. The only issue we have was not being able to stay for the weekend. Checking in Sunday afternoon and having to leave by 11 AM Friday just won't work out for us going forward
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything I had hoped for and more. Kitchen was furnished from coffee to utensils it was all there. Windows to the lake were fantastic and tranquil. Nothing better than going to bed hearing the water and waking to a clear glass lake. I will definitely be back next year.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax; the whole family enjoyed the lake view and swimming/kayaking in the water.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lakeside cabin is right on the water, easy access to walk/bike path, and so quiet during the week.

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was cute but too small for our family of five to sleep. It was clean but had a strong odor. We had trouble getting the keys out of the lockbox and trouble unlocking the doors. The manual was helpful and the owner is very friendly.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed during a very cold couple days. The place was very warm!
We really only used it to sleep as we were ice fishing all day every day.
Only thing is the front door lock was hard to operate. May need a little WD40.
Would not hesitate to stay again!"

The view from the backyard is absolutely lovely and the host provides lots of comfortable seating and a nice BBQ to enjoy the outdoor area. The home is very well organized with many nice extras such as board games, well appointed kitchen, extra cleaning supplies and snuggle blankets.
A couple of items that should probably be addressed: the dishwasher didn't complete cleaning cycles and the door is broken. We finally read instructions in the kitchen to open a cabinet drawer to hold door shut while cleaning. Also, the freezer drawer had no handle.
Overall, an excellent property and friendly hosts."

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only complaint I had was that it stated there would be a washer and dryer and there wasn't, ended up we did not need this so it wasn't a huge deal. The add also does not mention that the place is an upstairsapartment ment with its own entrance. Again this was not a big deal but would just be nice to have a heads up when booking."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Silverstar Stable was just what we needed for our stay in Watertown. We had beautiful sunset views, fun watching the chickens roam around, and slept peacefully. Great space for the two of us to relax and recharge, as we sat in front of the fireplace with a cup of tea. Only 10-15 minutes into town, and her recommendations for places to eat and enjoy were spot on!! We will definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was homey and we had a great time visiting our daughter and her boyfriend while we were there. It was nice to be able to cook meals as well.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cora's space was just lovely! Really cute, clean and handy, with a well-stocked kitchen. It is also a very convenient location to Watertown. I would note, as an earlier reviewer did, that the other side of the space is connected via a thin wall. It worked for me as the other party was a group of hunters that were quiet after 10. So, if the quiet hours work for you, you won't have any issue. The space looks out over farmland and it's peaceful to enjoy a cup of coffee while watching the chickens move around their coop in the morning. And I spent a couple lovely evenings outside on the patio watching for the meteor shower. Overall it's a real find and I would recommend it!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a serene, quiet place to stay with a homey atmosphere:)"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place to stay!! So peaceful and yet so close to restaurants and shopping! My sisters and I have met in Watertown for years as it is half way for all three of us……we will never stay in the hotels again if Cora’s place is available! Absolutely beautiful!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd time staying here and we enjoyed the quiet setting. It feels rural but is actually a very short drive to everything.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am filling this out for my parents who stayed in the Stables. They were hesitant about the whole experience at first but within minutes they couldn't stop talking about how much they loved it. They definitely want to come back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No words just do it
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Silver Stables has a cozy feel. It is perfect size for 2 guests. Location is not far from town, so there was access to restaurants and coffee shops. It is right off the highway, making it easy to find.
Be sure to bring games and books so you can hangout inside with things to do. TV has Wi-Fi and access to streaming services which was nice!
Chickens are on the property giving a sense of being on a farm, and the decor also brings that feeling too!
It was a nice little getaway for a weekend."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cora’s hospitality, communication, and space were absolutely phenomenal! The living space was incredibly clean and comfortable.

This was absolutely worth the money and I would highly recommend to anyone!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cora was such a wonderful host! The pictures don’t do the space justice - it is even cuter and homier in person! It was such a wonderful space to have a mother-daughter getaway! It was even roomie enough with an infant! I also appreciated when Cora saw that I was bringing an infant she immediately messaged me to ask if I needed a pack n’ play which I thought was exempt thoughtful and a wonderful amenity they could offer their guests. Cora and her family definitely didn’t skimp on anything in the stable suite! It is the perfect balance of rustic chic. I would highly recommend this place to any one staying in Watertown or looking for a quaint and peaceful place to stay outside the city! I would definitely rather hear chickens in the morning then neighbors I’m sharing a hotel wall/ceiling with.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Good choice overall. I stayed for 1 month for work, close to town but far enough alway you don’t deal with any of the town noise"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed for two nights for a little getaway. It was so peaceful and serene. We loved watching the chickens run around and the sunsets were beautiful. We spent some time at Lake Kampeska which is only about 15 mins from the barn.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cora put a lot of work into this unit and it shows. The combination of the old and the new make the stay quite comfortable. The shower is lovely with good pressure - especially if you're super tall; no bending over to get wet. Both the bed and the bedding are very comfortable. There are plenty of extra blankets and pillows. The location is very close to town and only took us 4min to get to the city center. Probably the thing I appreciated most was Cora had the porch light and heat on in the unit for us after we let her know we'd be coming in super late that night. It was SO nice to come in from the rain/ice to a warm place to stay. We will definitely be staying with Cora again when we're in town - this is a great place!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd Airbnb, 2nd with Cora (previously stayed at her place in Sioux Falls). Her decor is like something out of a magazine, and yet very peaceful and ""homey"".
The ""stable"" was a good fit for a family of 3 adults, bed was comfortable, and no worries about the sleep sofa. The extra thick mattress pad means you don't feel those ""bars"" that are normally such an annoyance. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, pans, etc. Appliances were modern, and the shower was GREAT! The towels were so very thick!
The setting was quiet, and yet convenient to all of Watertown, including local lakes for fishing. It was also pretty easy to get to freeways to other areas. I encourage you to check out her properties. They're MANY times better than conventional motels, and at a competitive price."

It was so cozy it made us feel right at home. It is out of town in the quiet county, and the sunsets are exquisite. It is very clean and I’m a picky person about cleanliness. Even though it is in the county, it is close enough to town to be convenient. We didn’t cook, but everything was there if you wanted to, including a grill. I highly recommend this beauty in the country."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Silverstar stables was the perfect location for me and my fiance to get away and relax for a few days. It is one cozy room that is an ideal size with a full kitchen, bathroom, living space and bed. The owner was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make this experience special. I planned to propose to my current fiance and asked the owner to decorate it as a surprise. She did an outstanding job and we couldn't ask for a better way to start off our engagement. Very clean and only 5 mins away from anything you would need in Watertown. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I kinda want to write a negative review so that the Silver Star Motel is more available when I want to stay there. Instead, I'll honestly describe it.... Very nice, quiet location, and great amenities. Clean, comfortable and accurately described. We stayed there on a hunting trip and it worked great for that. Cora, the host, was very responsive on the run-up to the stay as I had a few questions. She was also very accommodating. If you need some yard games or have a rainy day to pass away, there are plenty of options in the abode."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, fun and comfortable. Exactly what we were looking for for a brief getaway. We hope to return and stay - often!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place. Not too far from town, but still out of the city enough to feel like you're properly getting away for a while. Everything was clean and we really liked how the place was decorated. They gave us plenty of privacy and were quick to respond when we had a question. One thing to know, however, is that the bedroom is sectioned off with a curtain and not a door so if you have kids that go to bed early you'll probably have to be quiet the rest of the night.
The suspended couch/bed was really cool! We want to see what the other two airbnbs on the property look like inside so we might just have to come back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a quick anniversary getaway. Was exactly what we needed- enjoyed playing bags and using the firepit.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cora’s place is peaceful and serene. I loved seeing the chickens walk past our door each day. It is a fun place with the swinging bed that is super comfortable.

The rustic decor adds to the ambience of such a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. The floating bed is the perfect comfort for sleeping an watching TV.. We stayed for a week while I was on work assignment , I felt like was coming home every evening. We had our dog with us. The area surrounding the Silver Star is plenty of room to run our ex-large breed . I would recommend to stay here to anyone. I will definitely stay here again when in Watertown. Oh and every kind of shopping you will need is 8 min away.
10/10 Silver Star !!!

From the many fuzzy throw blankets to the piles of pillows to the fully equipped kitchen and gas grill outdoors to all sorts of items stocked in the bathroom you may have forgotten, the ambiance of the Silverstar and Cora's hospitality will make it an exceptional stay. Cora was very responsive to messages and we would definitely stay there again.
I recommend checking out what is going on in Watertown, popping by the Dakota Butcher for either a meal or take a few steaks back to grill, walking through the Terry Redlin museum and the beautiful grounds, ordering the Pie of the Week at Dempsey's pizza and getting yourself a flight of beer at the Watertown Brewery."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was awesome! Unique however very comfortable. Host was very good with communication. Would definitely recommend.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barn is super comfortable and cozy! It was very clean and nicely decorated. You are able to hear the neighbors a little, but this was not bothersome to us. Nothing different than you would have in a hotel. It was far enough from town to enjoy some peace and quiet, but close enough to go grab a bite to eat! We highly enjoyed our stay!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Silverstar Barn was the perfect place for a quiet weekend getaway! It was so unique and beautiful and had everything I could have needed!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great and unique place to stay if you are looking for a quiet place in the country but close enough to do all the restaurants and sights around the Watertown area. It was very clean. We would stay there again if we travel to that area.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique and simple place to say
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB is awesome. I had this rental on ""my list"" for over a year and the stay did not underwhelm. So convenient to have a smart TV to cast to and an actual DVD player for movies - we utilized both. I was so excited about the swing bed, but ended up feeling nauseous when it would move/swing (which is not an issue regarding the rental itself, just my experience with it). We used chairs on the corners to stabilize it and it worked great. Everything is spacious and open feeling, the cute lights added ambience, and the location was serene. Great communication with Cora and no issues with check-in or check-out. There were times we could hear the people next door through the wall (additional rental), but it wasn't bothersome, just a heads up. The kitchen was lovely - easy coffee in the morning and big fridge for our food and drinks. I hate being hot and am glad to report that the A/C unit is sufficient for the space and did an excellent job keeping us cool. Lots of room in the shower and bathroom as well - I appreciated that. Thanks for offering this wonderful rental!"

Thanks so much!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family really loved staying here. We are from Florida and come up for a week every summer to see family. We really didn’t want to stay at a hotel so we are so glad that we found this place instead! The beds are super comfortable, the place was very clean and the kitchen was really nice. It was peaceful, private and very relaxing. The decorations and style is a bonus and made it a more unique experience. We were close to a Walmart and other stores which is a huge plus when you have kids. Definitely recommend!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and this one knocked it out of the park! It was amazing to have the woodstove during an October snowstorm. The swinging bed was so comfy and we enjoyed the complimentary Netflix to binge watch some while we hunkered down! The kitchen island is huge and was great for playing board games. The kitchen was well stocked with anything we needed for cooking and the oven was so new and fancy! Loved the huge fridge space as well! We would definitely stay again and also have our eye on a few other properties Cora owns!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Silver Star Barn is extremely welcoming and felt like we were staying in our own home. Having coffee watching the sunrise or coming back to a wood burning stove to warm up in the evening- I miss it already and can’t wait to come back. If you think the pictures look good, the ambiance is even better in person.
If you like generic and sterile hotel rooms that might have a mini fridge, this isn’t the place for you. It was great to have a well stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, and high speed internet access all while being a short drive into town."
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"A great place for a young family, a lot of room for games. The steps to the lower level could be an issue for bad knees etc. but with 3 bedrooms upstairs and the 4 seasons room and patio we didn’t even need to go down except to grill."

Their sun room became one of my favorite places to unwind and watch the sun set. A million dollar view! They had a ping pong table, poker table, lots of kid toys, video games, an outdoor playground and fireplace, the perfect family retreat!
Definitely one of the most peaceful, relaxing places in Watertown. It was like being on vacation without leaving town. Katie was so responsive and welcoming, we were so happy with our stay!"

What you can’t see from her posting is the many amenities they have throughout their house. If you forgot to pack something they probably have it there. The kitchen is well stocked, from great knives, pots & pans to a crockpot and air fryer. The linens and beds are comfortable. The very large hot tub was a big hit with our family. I would highly recommend booking this house."

The place was perfect for our family vacation with our adult children and 2 grandkids. It rained the first 2 days, but with the sunrooms up and downstairs, we were just fine and played many games of ping-pong. There were toys for the grand to check out in the closet downstairs. The lot is large and there was plenty to keep our 3 year old occupied, with the rainbow play set and the obstacle course and zipline. Beds were all comfortable and we utilized the toddler bed in the master. It worked out great. Hot tub was great also. Smart TV is all set up so no need to sign in to your own accounts, thank you for that! We had a great time there and I would definitely recommend. It was a great value. Thank you Katie!"

You could tell they were still getting things put together in the house so there is not a ton of decorations and there is a lot of open space that could be used that we never stepped foot into but honestly it was one of my favorite airbnb's I have ever stayed in. Anything you needed in Watertown was pretty much always 11 mins away which was nice cause it is close but not in the town so it made it very peaceful I highly suggest giving it a shot!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us to stay with our kids and grandchildren. Each group had their own space to get ready for the day and wind down with baths (grandkids) for the night. And, the main floor space was large enough for all of us to be comfortable during meals and just hang out with each other. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with cookware, dishes, etc, and there were many condiments, sauces etc in the refrigerator.
There was open space nearby, and it was a great place to fly a kite (which we did because of course it was windy). We did not plan or engage in any water activities because it was still quite cold. We very much appreciated the paved walkway that ran parallel to the road as it was a welcome bonus for those who like to walk, jog or ride bikes.
The host was great! He was very friendly and welcoming and responded very promptly when we had questions. We will definitely try to stay here again in the future when the need arises."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and very comfortable. Great place to enjoy Lake Kampeska.
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Hello,
Our family was excited to come to Watertown again. We usually stay on the water. Your post said there was ""lake access"" and just a path to walk on to get there. It was very deceiving. If you are willing to share your dock, lily pad, etc, then the tennants need to understand they are sharing YOUR property and they do not have their own area. Then, it needs to be communicated when the other property is being used and by who. The owners? Other renters? We just did not feel comfortable walking across the street to access the lake without knowing if anything was already being used. My son and I did make one trip across the street to check out the water. There was dog crap everywhere in the grass. Please clean up after your animals if we cannot bring animals to your properties.
Entering the front door was easy. However, you failed to mention there were separate codes for the 2 inside doors. I only found this on the website after struggling for several minutes.
Upon entering the first floor, the tiled floors were sticky. I thought it was just humidity at first. We turned down the air in attempt to cool down the house. However, a short while later, I accidentally spilled some water on the floor. I wiped it up with paper towels. The paper towels were completely black when I threw them away. The floors were sticky because they were filthy!!
The whole kitchen was very dirty. The fridge had crumbs and dust inside it. The cutlery tray had hair and crumbs inside it. I was so disgusted, I washed it out myself. The empty shelving in the kitchen was dust filled. And lastly, there wasn't a broom/dust pan or vacuum in the house. But your ""manual"" was very clear we were supposed to clean up after ourselves. How??
Believe it or not, we did actually read your manual. We were very surprised to have to put out the garbage cans. We were on vacation for pete's sake. And paid a pretty hefty dollar amount. You live across the road. Shouldn't you be responsible for this??
As far as accommodations are concerned, the place was not very welcoming. You definitely sent the message that your tenants are just a bunch of trash. The kitchen only had one washcloth, one kitchen towel for a 5 night stay. Really?? The coffee cups and drinkware were obviously just junk you found at the salvation army or garage sales. I honestly cannot believe you do not have a complete dinner ware set for least 8 people, per floor. The same can be said for the pots and pans. The bathroom towels were thin rags. And again we didn't have enough. We actually went and bought more towels for ourselves. There were zero extra pillows or blankets. There were cheap toiletries in the bathrooms. This whole experience just screamed you didn't value us as a client."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great rental as it has 2 units for privacy. Very clean and good location. Will definitely rent again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property was perfect for our annual guys fishing trip. The beds are super comfortable; the entire property is very well maintained and cleaned. The neighborhood is quiet and was great for sleeping. We were fortunate enough to meet Bill who is an excellent host. You will definitely appreciate this place.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best place we have ever stayed! Made me want to move there! :D Gorgeous homey place with the absolute best location and view! Wouldn't stay anywhere else if we venture back to Watertown again. Great hosts and very accommodating.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. William was fantastic throughout. The location was nice and the home accommodated our every need. A+.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a great value. A few quirks though.
It’s a new build and had some electrical issues. Stove didn’t work downstairs. Luckily we did rent both units so we had access to a different stove. Slightly inconvenient. Tv upstairs randomly turned off and it turned out to be the breaker blew.
A couple of times the owners (or I assume the owners) entered and went into the garage. This is fine but a heads up would have been appreciated as us girls were not expecting anyone to enter so a slight scare.
There must have been issues with others about taking the garbage out if you stayed there on a Sunday night. Think we were told five times in addition to the instructions in the rental.
There is a pub down the way you can walk to. The burgers were decent enough and lots of beers on tap. Short staffed so some things took longer when there was a crowd but we were not in a hurry."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,William was great to work with. He was patient with our group's needs and was very helpful in making it a great experience. The house itself was beautiful and very clean. couldn't have asked for a smoother experience. definitely plan on staying there in the future.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I'm so glad I chose The Dakota Room for my weeklong stay in Watertown. Paul was a spectacular host. I had trouble getting into the building one day, and Paul was on site in less than two minutes to help me out!
WiFi was fast: 79 Mbps down, 31 Mbps up. The laundry room was a nice perk, just a few steps down the hallway. The room was clean and stylish. The bathroom was exceptional. Several days of my stay overlapped with a brutal heatwave, and the window-unit A/C kept the space nice and cool. I loved the mini-fridge, as well as the coffee and tea station. Good amount of storage space in the closet, too.
The building was within walking distance to restaurants, a coffee shop, a bookstore and a grocery store.
I found the mattress to be a bit stiff, but there was a range of soft-to-firm of pillows provided. There wasn't really any place to store clothes: No dresser, and no hangers in the closet.
Overall, I thought The Dakota Room was a good value given the amenities and location; I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling through the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great room right downtown, it was cozy and worked great for my quick trip down! Paul was easy to get ahold of and made the whole trip that much better."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This room is fantastic--bright, quiet, spacious, simple, with all the amenities for a comfortable stay in a great location. It's right in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of great restaurants and shops. It's absolutely perfect for a get-away. It's furnished with antique-style decor with an air of the by-gone era to match the feeling of the building it's in and the location downtown. We were 100% happy with the room and the host!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Cleanest Airbnb ever! It was very peaceful way better than a hotel! Next time I pass through I will try to book again!

Bathroom was spacious and clean. It was perfectly located for where we needed to be in Watertown. I would highly recommend."

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We wanted to get out of Sioux Falls and do a little fishing and this lake front cabin was perfect for us! You truly cannot be that view!

We didn't realize it was quite so close to the highway but it wasn't a problem. Accommodations were clean and had everything we expected and needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay here at Kay’s place on the lake! If it had been warmer, we would’ve spent more time outside and on the lake. We did get to make use of the kayaks one day, and there was everything else we could’ve possibly needed to do more lake activities. There was a paddle boat, tubes to float on, and even a large floating pad. The bed was comfy and we both slept well, and the view of the lake was beautiful! We will definitely stay here again if given the opportunity!"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"All around this little cabin is amazing! The house part is small, but we knew that coming in and was perfect for us. Very comfortable and they had everything we needed for the weekend. The best part is the screened in room connected to the garage. Amazing all around view of the lake and comfortable! Felt like a private lakeside restaurant when we had meals out there. The weather unfortunately for us was pretty chilly for our stay so didn’t get to enjoy the water as much, but looks like they had everything needed to go out on the lake (a couple kayaks and paddle boat). When we did get there we discovered there was no lock on the door, this had not been discussed. But did let us know it was being fixed soon, and is a nice quite area. Was a little unsettling at first, but ended up being just fine. All around great place and would recommend to a small family or get together. The town itself does not have a ton to do, but for our short trip it was perfect."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has such Breathtaking views of the water from 2 sides of the property. The 3 season room was fabulous. I didnt see my husband much, he sat in there early m orning to sunset, unless he was fishing from shore. He caught so many fish, he started throwing them back in the lake. The cottage is so cozy. Wonderful views from the couch looking out to the patio and water. We throughly enjoyed our 4 nights there. We would of stayed longer but it had been reserved."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cabin on the lake!
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,A nice place to stay and be by the water. But still close enough to town for shopping and restaurants.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worked good for us! The cottage was in the location we needed, having the kitchen worked perfectly for breakfast/lunches/ and a couple suppers. The North Shore restaurant across the bridge was open Saturday night but was closed Sunday - Tuesday so we traveled into Watertown for a couple suppers.
We used the four seasons room for playing cards but a little chilly in November for spending much time out there too late at night. In the warmer months the game room (3 bag games, darts, ...), four seasons room, and lake location would be even better. We had a great stay and looking forward to coming back in the future!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for the perfect lake house look no further. It’s in a great location and close to many local spots in Watertown. The sunsets are beautiful and great spot for fishing. Only downside is that there was a mouse in the house and the bed frame was broken. Sure all that can be fixed. The internet went down one night but the owner was super attentive and helped us fix it. I would highly recommend this place and would gladly stay here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is exactly as listed! You get to enjoy a cozy cabin that is located right by the lake and close to (almost) everything in Watertown. We had a great vacation there.

The screened in porch is very spacious perfect for meals and playing games. We brought our two pups and they loved swimming in the lake. There is plenty of outdoor seating and a fire pit. A few reviews mentioned the busy road, there is plenty of yard away from the road for safety and privacy. We met the owners and they were delightful. They take care of the property and enjoy it with their kids and grandkids. We would stay again and have recommended the place to a friend."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Was super clean and guest ready. Will consider coming again.

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place on the lake for the price. Be aware, the public fishes right across from your shore spot. Also, the busy street is visible and audible right when you step out the door. Although, there is a great quiet beach spot on the other side of the four seasons room. The yard is big and so soft and you have plenty of privacy to sun near and on the water."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great. The location was beautiful and serene. The paddle boat was so much fun. It was a wonderful weekend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay! Great fishing and swimming right in the backyard. The 3 seasons room was amazing and was perfect for relaxing outside without dealing with any bugs. We brought our 2 year old dachshund and he absolutely loved it! Had a nice yard for him to run around and the beach area was perfect for him to go swimming. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will consider coming back next year!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. There are a few things that I would have liked to know prior to booking. The oven is tiny. We had frozen pizza one night and could only cook one pizza at a time, but there was a gas grill available. The bar games in the garage is really only corn hole - lots of boards for this. There was a dart board but no darts. There were kayaks and a paddle boat but no adult life jackets. We loved the screened in dining room and spent lots of time there. It is just a few steps from the waters edge. The lawn was beautiful and would provide a nice space for kids or pets. This cabin is along side a very busy street. There is a restaurant and gas station/convenience store near by. The communication with the host was excellent. We had a very enjoyable get away."

2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice spot on the lake to enjoy!
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an older place with two rooms. The bedroom was updated but the kitchen hasn’t been. The owner was very quick to address the things we brought to his attention. The lake is beautiful, but the house is on a busy street (something to think about if bringing children). There is a game room and enclosed porch which was nice because when we stayed it was really windy. We enjoyed our stay and chatting with the owner."
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet place by the lake, this isn't it!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin just outside watertown. Was very clean. Has a darling little sunroom on the back of the garage facing the lake - great place to hang out if the weather is not nice enough to be outside. Large yard facing the lake. Kitchen a little less stocked than expected but manageable - communicated with host on this and she was very receptive. Would absolutely recommend!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here! It was clean and the additional sun room space was great for our family to have a meal!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was so cute! House was clean and had plenty of room. We were able to have some friends over for dinner and the yard was amazing. Games were fun and kayaks and paddle boat was a great workout in the AM.

,,,"If you stay, being your own mousetraps.
There were critters in the walls and the scratching sound made it difficult to sleep. Also, the TV didn’t work, which was disappointing. This was by far the worst air bnb experience we have had."
