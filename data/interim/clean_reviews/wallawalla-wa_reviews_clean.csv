2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best farm stays I’ve ever had! Colleen knew I was here for work so unfortunately I didn’t have much time to check out the grounds but I’m sure they’re great. She was very respectful of my anxious dog and she was easy to communicate with. The place inside was spotless which is rare for a barn farm stay. Everything was cozy, thoughtful, intentional, and I felt right at home. Great place to get some studying in, some nice night breezes, and ample room for my dog to enjoy himself inside and outside. I definitely need to return when I’m not on business. Thanks Colleen!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we've stayed at Colleen's barn. It's a beautiful spot with a view of the Blue Mountains and easy access to downtown Walla Walla by car. Colleen and her husband, Vern, gave us the royal treatment, especially our son who was celebrating his 6th birthday! He loved interacting with their chickens and goats and meeting one of their dogs, Gringo. The barn is comfy and cozy! We would definitely come again!"

They are caring and humorous people. We had a great time staying with them. Our toddler loved feeding the animals and doing simple farm routines such as collecting eggs. Colleen and Verne are very patient with us and included us in a lot of activities. Colleen gave the best recommendations to local restaurants. Verne lets us drive his tractor. Our chocolate lab had loads of fun, too! We learned lots of fun facts about farm animals. It was one of the most relaxing vacation break for us! We hope to come back!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Colleen and her husband were wonderful hosts. The space was very clean, cozy and comfortable and we loved that it was pet-friendly for our two pups.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I wanted a place where my 7 year old daughter could have fun and feel at home. we were traveling with many hours on the road and knowing that the animals were there and a comfortable stay made her extra happy.

If we’re ever back in the Walla Walla area this will be the place we stay!! Thank you Colleen and Vern!"

My wife and I will definitely stay there again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay. Colleen did a great job of being helpful and supportive while still allowing us to just be without interruptions. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed (including a couple items we had forgotten).

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet! East drive to downtown. Great yard for the dogs. We were invited to interact with the animals and evening chat. Colleen’s is a convenient location to the local area and a peaceful stay. Very responsive to questions. Colleen and her husband are provided a warm welcome and a very nice stay. If we’re in the area in the future, we’ll stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Colleen's place was absolute PERFECTION. Super cute, impeccably clean, and she and her husband were so gracious about greeting us and letting us hang out with the furry and feathered friends on the farm. The fold out couch isn't 100% comfortable for an adult, but if you're traveling with kids or sharing the main bed, I would be hard-pressed to fine any fault. Super location for wine tasting and would 100% stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful experience. Country living at its best. Friendly hosts offered 1st class hospitality. When visiting Walla Walla, choose Colleen for your stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colleen was a fantastic host! She made herself available to show us her brood of animals and offer advice about getting the most out of our time in Walla Walla! The space was just what we needed--very cozy with all the amenities we needed. The location was lovely--just a short drive from Walla Walla but on the outskirts with a gorgeous view of the mountains. We would come back in a heart beat, we had so much fun!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Colleen and her husband were consummate hosts. They greeted us upon arrival and introduced us to all the friendly animals on the farm. The accommodations were very comfortable and idyllic. My girlfriend and I agreed it was the best place to stay in Walla Walla.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was great. I highly recommend staying in this cute, comfortable Airbnb. Colleen and her husband were great hosts."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen was a perfect host, and my daughter and I had a nice stay. It was a bonus getting to feed treats to the horses and goats!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying with Colleen is more than just getting a cozy-as-heck room that is close to downtown Walla Walla and a bunch of wineries. It's what the folks at AirBNB aspired to make when they created the company in the first place. It's an experience in and of itself.
Communication was easy peasy with Colleen. We let her know that our arrival time would be a wildcard because of the road trip we were taking and she made our VERY late arrival super easy and comfortable. The morning after we got to see the goats commute to their pen, fed horses carrots and marshmallows, and met the family chickens and pups. We were so enamored with the goings on at the AirBNB that we almost forgot their were wineries to get to, a car show to experience, and a farmers market to get fresh produce at.
On top of that, Colleen made it easier to make a list of things to do in town with her helpful knowledge of the local food spots and wineries. We followed her recommendation on The Maple Counter for Saturday brunch and I had some of the best biscuits and gravy of my life.
I could go on but I think you, the prospective visitor to Colleen's barn, understand. If you're heading to Walla Walla and need a place to stay, I could not recommend this spot enough. It felt like you were hunkering down with family (you can stand) for the weekend. All the stars!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen’s place is truly one of a kind and one of the best Air BnB’s we’ve stayed in. Their property is so beautiful and such a wonderful place to escape to. The location is fabulous! You feel removed from it all, but within 10mins you’re either at a winery or at the heart of downtown. Colleen was very communicative, hospitable, and had so many fabulous recommendations! We can’t wait to come back and stay again! Colleen helped make our anniversary getaway extra special. Thank you so much Colleen!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed with Coleen and her husband for a long weekend, and had a wonderful stay with them. Don’t let the “barn” part fool you, the private room and bathroom are very comfortable and has all the necessary amenities. If you have a EV there is the ability to 220 charge your car. We also brought our dog with us, he enjoyed the private fenced yard and all the smells. Colleen and her husband were great hosts and offered great recommendations for wineries and restaurants. We’ll definitely stay with them again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great hosts, great hospitality! Perfect for our pup. Clean and cool in the heat. We’ll be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect getaway in Walla Walla if you are looking for something truly unique and special. The room had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable and Colleen and Vern were exceptionally warm and kind. The location is great - close to town but you feel that country relaxation. The best part is spending time with Mocha and Shaman the horses, the goats, chickens and dogs. We look forward to coming back soon."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn was cozy and comfortable, a perfect oasis after wine tastings and family get togethers. And the goats!! Meeting/feeding them was a special treat. Colleen and Vern were amazing hosts. So glad we stayed here!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the BEST stay at Colleen & Vern's! They are extremely generous hosts, and had every last detail accounted for. They spent lots of time introducing us to their animals (horses, goats, chickens) and encouraged us to feed them. We truly felt at home when staying on the property. Not to mention it's in a great, central location. We will undoubtedly be returning!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful time at the Vern and Colleen's Ranch, sat together and talked and fed the Goats and Horses and them Chickens !! And who knew that them Chickens loved those marshmallows so much !!!!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen and Verne were the ideal hosts. We were welcomed immediately and they opened their home and farm to us to enjoy as we liked. I got to feed the horses, goats and chickens, and even with rain the farm is beautiful and lush and the animals beautiful and friendly. For this city chick, in walla walla for a family wedding, to be able to enjoy the countryside so fully was a true bonus. Highly highly recommend!!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at, and it’s not close. It’s small but comfortable, and very thoughtfully appointed. The animals are an absolute delight - horses, goats, and chickens, all friendly enough to eat out of your hand. Colleen and Vern are great hosts and wonderful people, and we spent a perfect Saturday afternoon sitting by the barn with them, drinking sangria, and throwing treats to the goats.
I would give six stars if I could - I can’t wait to return. We came to Walla Walla for a wedding, but will be going back to stay at this amazing Airbnb."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at the farm! Colleen and Verne are friendly, warm and very attentive and gracious hosts. They made us feel comfortable and welcome right from our arrival. It was really fun to meet the animals on the farm as well… our little one had the most wonderful time.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous views and the room is stunning. The pictures do not give it justice. It’s just a few minutes from downtown and wineries. The hosts are extremely friendly and willing to help out with anything. My friend brought a quiche to make for breakfast but didn’t realize there was not an oven in the room.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here! Nothing like being greeted by friendly horses and goats (behind fencing), and getting to feed them was so fun. The place was clean and tidy, andva bottle of wine awaited us next to the 4k TV. One highlight for me was the huge shower with great pressure and hot water! The king sized bed was cozy, and the fenced in yard was perfect for our dog. Great place to stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We've stayed in Walla Walla many times -- and this place is a gem. The unit was spacious and airy with a little fenced grassy yard where we could sit out in the evening (with the dogs -- who loved it also). Many nice touches inside and out. Colleen and her husband welcomed us warmly, provided some great recommendations for restaurants, and made us feel right at home. The horses and goats were fun to watch and feed! And the views of the wheat fields and the Blue Mts. rising above them were just beautiful. There are many motels in town, and a few high end places -- but Colleen's place is truly special. Just perfect for us and our adult daughter and pups."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little unique spot. Close to the wineries and town. We were in for a wedding so it was a quick one night stay. The bed was very comfortable and the wine was a nice touch. It was also very clean.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Must stay! This was our favorite Air BNB we have ever stayed at. The hosts and the animals are super friendly. Our dog is usually nervous in new places but he waltzed right in and felt at home right away. He loved all the space to run around and had a blast playing with the goats. We will 100% be coming back here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described, an extremely comfortable spot for humans as well as critters.
A really comfortable bed, nice touches such as ambient lighting and night lights, a big shower, fabulous towels.
Outdoors is a fenced area for a pooch, with patio chairs for the human companions. Additionally a large lawn, corrals for horses and goats, AND extremely gracious and hospitable hosts.
I spent two days in respite from a family adventure gathering in one state and a coming wedding in another.
Walla Walla has many charms, but I stayed put and felt nourished and renewed with my very young dog."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! Welcoming hosts and a beautiful location. Our daughter loved to meet the goats, chickens and horses."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Colleen’s place is ideal if you are traveling with dogs. We had an excellent time. She provided wonderful food and winery recommendations. I even got to hold some baby chicks!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is hands down the best Airbnb experience my wife and I have ever had. We stayed with our 3-year-old son and 15-year-old dog, who both loved it as well.
The studio itself that you stay in is wonderful, cozy and perfectly put together. You have a fenced in front lawn to yourself with comfortable chairs, a great place to sit and relax. The farm that you're on has horses, goats and chickens that you can feed and get to know. Our kid loved feeding the horses and goats, and he spent a lot of time chasing the chickens (of course never catching them). There were fruit trees where he picked apples and pears to feed to the cows next door.
Beyond the place itself, Colleen and Vern (the hosts) are incredibly welcoming, fun, helpful and easy-going. We're grateful to have met them.
And finally, Walla Walla is just a few minutes away driving, where we had excellent meals and a good time walking around, and the Blue Mountains are about a 15 minute drive in the other direction - we had a beautiful afternoon driving through the farms and up into the hills.
We couldn't recommend this Airbnb more!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colleen’s place was everything we imagined and more. She and her husband went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed as well as recommended some great local places to check out. I highly recommend staying at Colleen’s place if you are looking for a place of comfort, excellent hospitality, and friendly animals!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet setting. Nice, fenced area for our dog and hosts were so accommodating. We needed extra room to trailer a car down and Coleen and Vern had plenty of space. They gave us great dog-friendly suggestions for wineries and restaurants and while things are still a little unsure with COVID, the apartment was so clean and comfortable! A perfect getaway!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place!! Colleen and Vern were wonderful hosts and met us with cold drinks and a nice visit! And a bottle of wine!!

The goats in particular were a riot to watch. The little baby goats are so playful. The space is very well done (living area/bedroom combo and large bathroom) with lots of special touches. They’ve done a beautiful job decorating the home and making it warm and inviting. The barn conversion is very creative - loved all the decorative touches! The bed was super comfy and we slept great!! Picturesque mountain views from the property were such a treat. The hosts were very thoughtful and provided a bottle of wine upon arrival, waters and other things like coffee and tea. Great suggestions also for restaurants and fun things to do. Highly recommend this darling place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully kept place and a lot of fun - out of the box and a country type of experience! We fed the horses, pet the goats and enjoyed talking to Colleen and Vern so very much. It’s close to downtown and many other wineries and really close to Slieght of Hand - our favorite winery that we visited!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful three-night stay at Colleen and Vern's beautiful farm paradise. We whole-heartedly recommend their Airbnb.

We would definitely stay with them again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time, Colleen and her husband are really wonderful hosts. The unit is great, super-clean and comfortable. There's a nice private grassy area but it's great to sit with the hosts and have a beer or two as well. We had our dogs with us and it worked out great, the grassy area was perfect for them to roam around a little and lounge. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to others."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Colleen’s place had everything we and our 2 dogs needed! It was spotlessly clean, very comfortable, with lots of room for us and the dogs.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful lodging, and is short-drive convenient to both downtown and southside wineries and dining. Colleen and Vern have gone to great lengths in making the accommodations welcoming and comfortable. Everything is modern and new. Getting to watch the running of the goats and chickens, and enjoying a glass of wine or beer while watching GoatTV in the evening helps round out the experience w a smile or laugh. We hope to return soon!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I normally don't write long reviews because I just forget or run out of time or am too busy. But I wanted to make sure to write a review for Colleen and Vern's place. It was awesome. They communicated well, the place was as advertised (or even better), and everything was very clean. Lucy, my French bulldog, entertained herself by chasing chickens and goats. Jasmin, my friend, got to walk one of the horses and feed them. I had to work, a lot, and the space was creative and perfect for getting things done. Every evening we knew we could sit outside and have a beer (or water, whatever you'd like) with Colleen or Vern or both. We really enjoyed our three days here! Can't say enough good things."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen and her husband are certainly SUPER HOSTS. We really enjoyed our restful time there! The animals were so fun to watch, feed and pet.

We will definitely be back and so highly recommend this beautiful space!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen’s spot was really comfortable, and great with traveling with our pets. We loved the bed, and bedding it was really comfortable. And, they were really friendly, helpful and knowledgeable with recommending local spots to check out. The internet and cable was a nice treat in the airbnb (I ended up running 30 miles for a local Trail Race, and so it was nice to sit down and watch tv for a bit at the end of the night!). I also really liked the shower, and towels were really nice. And, I loved the Barn Theme- and Rodeo artwork, and they gave us a bottle of “Dark Horse” Red Wine as a welcome gift which was really nice, and my Hubby really appreciated the microwave popcorn as a Saturday night snack while watching SNL! Overall, it was fun being out there, my dogs loved roaming around the property, and it was neat seeing their horses and other animals around. The highlight was getting to hold their baby goat that was born 4/6/2021 and we saw it on Friday 4/9/2021! So sweet!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Heaven on earth for my 4yo son. Colleen and Vern are magnificent hosts and their amazing home is a wonderland of interesting animals, good conversation and relaxing accommodations. Highly recommend."

2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Colleen was really friendly and offered us great tips for places to eat. Also the bed was amazingly comfortable- we slept so well.

Overall a great stay and would definitely stay again!

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Walla Walla, about 5 minutes or so from downtown and situated on over an acre. And if you have pooches in tow (like we did) this is THE PLACE. Really nice space - a converted portion of the barn with all the amenities - and everything updated and clean. Plus carrots to feed the horses and a bottle of wine on arrival..
PROTIP: At the host's recommendation we had breakfast at The Maple Counter. Mind blown!

Eventually we decided to ignore the road closure blockades and cones."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay - love the pool!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorable house with a lovely pool in a very walkable location to downtown Walla Walla. The beds were super comfortable, the towels soft and fluffy, and everything very tidy and clean. The home had every little thing we could need without being cluttered with unnecessary items. We loved sitting at the vine-shaded table with the misters on, watching the kids play in the pool #vacation vibes! We also appreciated the home's ice-cold air conditioning as it was extremely hot outside.
We visited in late July 2022 and many of the roads around downtown Walla Walla are undergoing major road construction. The street directly in front of the home was torn up and unusable but there was no actual work going on during our stay and thankfully no construction noise to disturb us. At first, I was very nervous about this situation. The hosts answered my call immediately, were very reassuring, and followed up with me to make sure we were happy and everything was good (it was!) Patty was very helpful with local recommendations, going out of her way to find us a babysitter and a massage appointment.
We will for sure look to stay at one of her properties next time we visit Walla Walla."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This spot was amazing. And that’s an understatement. Location was perfect with easy access to everything. The one questionable thing was that the pool was a tad cold (April may be early to go swimming in Walla Walla). Thank you Patty!

The house itself is beautiful and the location is great, but the thoughtful and artistic touches - all while being cozy made it a stand-out! The beds and linens were so comfy, the kitchen had all the things we needed, the long tables were great for teleworking/snacks/games, and the hosts were very responsive.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Couldn’t have asked for more. Certainly top of our list of Airbnb/VRBO. The host is very responsive and has a great attention to details. The heated pool and backyard add a nice touch to the overall stay. It is not as toddler friendly but we moved furniture around to block stairs etc; thanks to the accommodating host.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is fantastic! Not a detail missed, exceptionally clean & well stocked. Great communication, great location, incredibly comfy & cozy, my family had a wonderful time & we will be back ❤️"

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This may be the nicest Airbnb in Walla Walla! An amazing outdoor space with the heated pool, multiple options for outdoor seating, I love the bright clean design of the home and the king beds! Patty thought of everything (like the king beds, charging stations, fans, and nice linens in all the rooms). We absolutely loved the place and enjoyed cooking meals in the fully stocked kitchen and playing games and drinking wine at the large outdoor table. Walking distance to downtown and great restaurants and tasting rooms. Loved it!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Love this house! We will definitely be back.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This house is great! It has three king beds in three separate bedrooms, which is pretty rare to find! The house is appointed with anything you could need and it's right on the edge of town for easy walking to restaurants and wine tastings. They're great hosts."
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Had a great time visiting walla walla. This house had a beautiful outdoor area and the inside was well furnished and clean. The only downside is that there were lots of flies/bugs that appeared throughout our stay.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic!! We were 3 families with three toddlers who loved the pool and spacious indoor play space, and outdoor dining. Proximity to downtown meant that we did very little driving once we were there. Kitchen had everything we needed for making our own meals. Loved this stay!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is Airbnb perfection, one of my favorite stays ever! The beds, baths, laundry and kitchen were all well stocked. We loved the minimalistic yet warm feel of all the home decor. We had kids with us and this place is outfitted nicely for them with good TV options, a pristine pool, outdoor eating and walkable park area (crawlers might be tough with the wood stairs). The proximity to Walla's cute Main Street area is wonderful. You could easily park at the house and stay busy there for a few hours before check in. Highly recommend pre-ordering Best Pizza Ever for delivery before you get there to cover dinner your first night to get everyone poolside sipping a cold drink asap. It was a great start to our trip at least. We definitely plan to return here, bliss!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a magical time staying at Patty’s home. The photos don’t do their pool and beautiful home justice. The location is perfect to walk downtown and to local parks. Patty and her husband’s communication and support was fantastic. Thank you for a wonderful experience!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oasis is what you see in the photos and MORE! Our family gathered and spent a week together in the house and couldn’t have asked for a more comfortable (the beds!), welcoming (Patty is an amazing host) and fun (the pool is too perfect for fun!) and the location is unbelievable convenient (a block from Whitman and walkable to great shopping, wineries.) I highly recommend staying at the Oasis!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean, well-appointed and conveniently located to walk downtown or to Whitman campus. Pool and outdoor area were perfect for our two families with kids. Some road noise for two of the bedrooms… but not a deal breaker. We’ll be back for sure!!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The decor inside and outside are super. We enjoyed our stay and location so close to downtown. The backyard with pool is private, but subject to road noise."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful location and beautiful, clean accommodation. Couldn’t have asked for better communication. This home is so close to all the shops, food and Whitman! I can’t wait to come back and stay again! 5+stars !!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property description says this is an oasis, and it really is. The home is beautiful, and Patty has filled it with thoughtful touches. The most well-appointed kitchen of any Airbnb I’ve stayed in, everything helpfully organized and labeled. The pool was a major hit with our kids.
Highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is gorgeous and has a great outdoor space for entertaining. Incredibly clean, well appointed, and a comfortable stay."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Patty has curated an amazing Oasis...great decor, amenities, and separation of space! So nice to be near downtown, while offering such a private space with plenty of room. Great local food options within walking distance, for every meal. We definitely enjoyed/utilized the outdoor dining space and pool most of all, and the no-fuss fire is a bonus! Lovely stay, lovely host:)"

Everything was well kept and comfortable, and Teresa was nice and accommodating to talk to :-) Highly recommended. Short drive to Walla Walla DT."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's an extremely peaceful location with birds singing in the background and fresh air. The A frame itself is attached to the main larger house and is not a stand alone unit but extremely private and comfortable. Everything is in 1st rate shape, literally as good as you can find on airBnB if you are looking for a 4.5 star weekend away from it all. At this level I don't know why the host didn't add angled window curtains to cover the highest windows. That's my small complaint in one of the better places I've stayed. To go to the next level of elite airBnB experiences, I'd get high-end modern furniture in there. The bed is great by the way."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan and Teresa did a great job of communicating everything about the stay. They should say something about the wonderful walk-in shower with heated floors that is was very nice at it after a walk and cool day. Stay was quiet and serene very peaceful and enjoyable place to stay would definitely stay there again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Dan and Teresa’s honeymoon suite. The hime and area is so beautiful and quiet and the suite is well appointed, clean and organized.

I would definitely stay again if I was looking for a place to escape for a few days."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect peaceful country setting for some rest and relaxation. The amenities were wonderful, room was super clean, and bed and furniture clean and comfortable. The location is easy to find, and 10-15 minutes from local restaurants and shops. We look forward visiting again soon."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a great Birthday weekend & enjoyed the hot tub!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay here. Just right for our needs.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan and Teresa's apartment was immaculate, and well stocked. We brought food for several days. Breakfast and dinners, the kitchen had everything we needed so we were able to use everything. The location was great with us spending some time dining and window shopping downtown, enjoying a couple of wineries, and a little road trip out into the base of the Blue's. Dan and Teresa provide great value, everything you need is here. Communication was exceptional, everything was laid out well. I am certain we will be visiting again, we really love this area.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Directions to this place were spot on. Getting in a little harder. They show a picture of a slider in the the photos, but entrance is on other end. Looks like they rent out the other part of the house due to the fact our entrance door looks just like the other and is only about 15' appart. Once inside, you feel right at home. Kitchen is nicely equipped. The place is nicely decorated, very clean, heated floors in the bathroom was a nice touch. Had to turn the heat pump off at night due the noise it was making even when it wasn't running ""like electric can opener."" Could use a couple extra sleeping pillows, however bed was comfortable. Overall I rate this place a 4.8 out of 5. We didn't use hot tub, so no report there. I would highly recommend as a base for wine tasting."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is in a beautiful and very peaceful setting. Inside was very comfortable, clean, warm and quiet. It had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. We were able to cook some of our meals in a fully equipped kitchen. The walk-in shower with the heated floor was an extra special feature. We were thoroughly pleased."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and for someone like me, on the road a lot for work, I just need a place to sleep and shower but this place was nice and affordable and I’m thinking about booking again since I’ll be working here another month and when the snow is gone."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW. Such a lovely stay! I am so bummed that we were in a bit of a hurry and didn’t have much time to enjoy it. The bed/sheets are super comfortable. The bathroom with the heated floors and gigantic shower was such a luxury, and the fluffy bathrobes! The kitchen had everything we would have needed, and they even left snacks/water/coffee and sparkling juice. So thoughtful! The property is so beautiful and peaceful and we got to see a herd of deer saunter by across the street. We will definitely be back when we have more time because I definitely want to sip some coffee on that patio :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic stay! Everything was clean, well-stocked, and the location was very peaceful. Hosts were responsive, and provided very clear and easy instructions.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"A very nice home and yard. The hot tub isn't exactly private and there may be construction workers outside in the morning when you want to go for a dip. It would have been good to know in advance. And except for the morning hours, it is very quiet."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay (again!). Highly recommend, the best!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great stay in the country at your wonderful place. Will be back very soon!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Walla Walla may not be at the top of everyone's ""bucket list"" but, having been born and raised there until age 12 and returning after more than 50 years of absence, Joyce and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We visited during Frontier Days so, besides me reminiscing over sites familiar to me as a youth, we attended a Beach Boys concert and three days of what I have always heralded as the BEST rodeo experience of my lifetime. Wheat fields have been replaced with vineyards elevating our stay to a very enjoyable adult level. The vineyards made for beautiful rural scenery and the historical significance from Fort Walla Walla (where my great grandfather was the leader of the band and I played on the ""Fort Grounds"" as a youth) to the Whitman Monument (where my older sister would take me on horseback rides) brought back fond memories. Joyce and I sincerely appreciated Dan and Teresa sharing their lovely home and would recommend the ""Honeymoon Suite"" to anyone seeking a relaxing and fun time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely stay just outside of downtown Walla Walla! All the amenities were perfect, right down to the cozy bed. I would absolutely stay here again. Don’t miss out on this adorable location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although is wasn't our actual ""honeymoon"", we did get married the weekend we were there. Dan & Teresa's place was PERFECT for us to ""get away"" from all the wedding activities happening in town, and have a wonderful place to relax. We travel to the Walla Walla area regularly and would definitely stay here again. We love to meet our hosts and although we missed Teresa, Dan was very kind and took a few minutes away from what he was doing to chat a bit and give a quick rundown of how the place came to be. This is the type of thing we love.
It is a little bit of a drive from town to get to. For us, it's exactly what we wanted, but you won't be walking or biking to any place close. Fresh French pressed coffee while sitting on the porch...we'll come back just for that!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is about 5 miles from the downtown. Small but very nice place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the country setting and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was above and beyond comfortable and spotlessly clean with everything we could have possibly needed.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Soooo relaxing, peaceful and just what i needed. Beautiful scenery for sitting outside, a great road for taking a walk. The place is right close to wonderful Farm that has you pick flowers and vegetables and really great local produce and fun gifts. I went in the morning and bought peaches for breakfast and picked a bouquet of flowers. Walla Walla is fantastic for restaurants and wine and the people are so friendly. The sunsets both nights were wonderful. I needed rest and relaxation and peace and quiet and this was the perfect place for me."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay while visiting Walla Walla and the area.

We had several walks down the country road in front of their house.

They welcomed us with Sparkling cider, chocolates, and a boatload of snacks. They had the softest robes ever waiting for us as well. Their hot-tub is really nice too. Their cat Simba was so friendly and handsome! Highly recommend staying here. So peaceful and on a beautiful well kept property. We were very cozy the entire time. And less than 15 minutes away from all the grocery stores, restaurants, and entertainment. Plus less than 10 from the golf course."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a very comfortable inviting place to stay as a couple. one of the most comfortable bed we have ever had at an AirBNB!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hi, Dan & Teresa -
Thank you for hosting us again. We had a great time there this past weekend.
One quick note: we think the numeric lock Battery level might be low. Maybe you can check when you have time."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay in Walla Walla. A beautiful setting. Our hosts were friendly, yet not intrusive. They were helpful and so very nice. We highly recommend a stay with Dan and Teresa. And while you’re in Walla Walla, be sure to go downtown to the Wine District and sample some of Walla Wall’s finest!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent and as advertised. We rented this to attend parent weekend at Whitman College. It’s a short hop out of town and gives you a sense of just how beautiful the area is.
Comfortable, clean and nice to relax in. There is a private side deck—great for wine and cheese. Above average kitchen—though we didn’t cook, there was a thoughtful and complete set up not always found in airbnb kitchens. Nice to have luggage racks and small but decent closet area so you can hang up a few things from your suitcase. Private—we didn’t run into anyone.
Responsive host, when our flight was cancelled was quick to respond. There is plenty to recommend about this place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and comfy, with a nice kitchen and a private deck in a quiet location out in the country, but just a short drive from town. The heated bathroom floor was a wonderful surprise! I brought my bike and enjoyed a couple of nice rides, including a 30-mile loop on flat to rolling terrain just west. This was the perfect getaway spot for a gal from the rainy side of the state. Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Teresa and Dan's suite was a great place for us to rest during our bike tour of Walla Walla. It was sparkling clean and like-new. We especially enjoyed the air conditioning and the heated floors in the bathroom!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroghly enjoyed our stay at the Honeymoon Suite! The unit was spotless and the fully-stocked kitchen was much appreciated when we prepared meals. The location was ideal for being close to downtown (15 minutes) and nearby wineries (5-10 minutes), and the rural setting was ideal for peaceful walks along the quiet roads. It was unfortunately rainy for most of our stay (rainbows!!) so we didn't get to enjoy dining on the outdoor deck. Highly recommended!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super clean and quiet! lockbox made it easy to check in after we got in pretty late at night!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This property is well located and beautiful, very clean and even better than the pictures. The unit is really well appointed, and we enjoyed it. Air conditioner worked great. Teresa is a wonderful communicator and they are clearly focused on creating an enjoyable experience for their guests. Our only issue was with the bed which is too soft for our liking, but I understand many others may enjoy the soft mattress. We didn't use the TV, but the Wifi was strong and fast."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have found this place, look no further! Here’s what you can expect. A super comfortable bed, easy to control room temperature, heated bathroom floors, great water pressure in the shower, cozy towels, handicapped assessable, strong wifi, full kitchen, many cooking essentials, lots of ice, easy to use iron and ironing board, centrally located between town and wineries and respectful hosts! I can’t report on the tv situation, as we never turned it on. Too many other fun things to do!
This is our new go to place in Walla Walla!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This hidden gem far exceeded our expectations!!

We would definitely recommend this place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, clean and comfortable, clear instructions, easy private access. The animals and access to fresh eggs from the chicken coop sets this place apart from others. We did very little cooking but the kitchen seemed adequately stocked to make meals. The king mattress is comfortable with plenty of blankets and pillows, even for my pillow loving husband! There is also a murphy bed. We were able to adjust the temperature to our liking and there was a freestanding fan. Would be comfortable even in hot Walla Walla summer! Within 15 minutes of MANY wineries, restaurants, shopping, golf and the blue mountain lavender farm. We loved our stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay so much, we immediately planned a return trip. Very family friendly. Our kiddo really enjoyed all the animals and space to run around.
We found it was a great location, close to good road biking, wandering at the Whitman Mission, and wineries. It’s a short drive to WW, and well worth the relaxing deck to come back and watch the sunset at.
Also this is the first Airbnb that we ever stayed with that provided half & half for our coffee! So many fine details, I can’t list them all."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing! Our stay at Q Corral was amazing. Beautiful property, fresh eggs for breakfast, friendly donkeys (we named them Shrek and Donkey lol), and there was even more we didn't have time to explore! 100% recommend!!"

Both Alicia & Bob were so accommodating- especially when I accidentally locked myself out. I will be back. I love Walla Walla."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely perfect for my daughter's birthday (she LOVES the country!) wine-tasting trip! We could go out during the day & come ""home"" & relax (w/ a glass of wine! 🍷) on the deck by the fire pit & watch the sun set...
And the animals!! OMIGOSH!! My daughter collected eggs from the chicken coop BOTH mornings & made breakfast for us! Feeding the donkeys was another highlight for her. ❤️

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is really awesome. The beds are comfortable. Kitchen is stocked with enough pots and pans for basic breakfast and cooking. Alicia was very generous to put out a great bottle of wine for us. The animals were the highlights of the stay for sure. The cat and donkeys are adorable. Farm fresh eggs and special coffee blend were a nice touch for breakfast. We definitely would recommend this place to anyone. We'll be back for sure.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Better than expected. We loved the deck with the fire pit and the surrounds were absolutely beautiful. Great place to relax. The donkeys were a highlight of the trip.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it. The donkey. The chickens. The apartment was super cute, and they were able to accommodate adding our boys for one night. We appreciated the half n half for coffee, the complimentary bottle of wine. Treats to feed the donkeys. Being able to gather our own eggs.
It was a wonderful getaway and we were sad to say good bye to the donkeys."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was sold on this place when I saw that you could collect your own eggs and feed donkeys! I was in need of a last minute stay and this location exceeded all expectations. The check-in was easy and even included the cutest bottle of wine.
The host Alicia was friendly and accommodating, and the apartment itself was clean, cute, and had everything you need! The animals (cat, dog, donkeys, chickens, horses) were so lovely and made the entire stay more of an ‘experience’ than just a place to lay your head. I would absolutely recommend this Airbnb to singles, couples, best friends, and small families. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice apartment close to our family’s home. A little further out from town, but still close to some wineries.
Nice sized bedroom and bathroom with well stocked kitchen.
The donkies are really cute. My daughter enjoyed seeing so many farm animals.
The bed was a little soft for our taste. But not a deal breaker for visiting again in the future. Looking forward to using the porch next visit (too cold this time)"

Loved the donkeys
Loved being able to collect eggs
Great dog and cat

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. Had the best time and the donkeys are darling.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia provided a story book experience. We wish our stay in Walla Walla was longer so we could enjoy the amenities she offered to us.
We hope to be back next summer and will schedule more time to relax on the deck, see the garden and just take it all in.
She is a wonderful host and responded quickly to my questions and worked with me on a last minute change to my reservation."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia’s place was warm, inviting and very clean. We loved all the special touches with complementary coffee, half-and-half, snacks, and fresh eggs. Alicia thoughtfully had a beautiful bottle of bubbly Rose’ awaiting us, as she knew it was our anniversary. We enjoyed mingling with their little farm animals, including their dog Benny. The location was perfect for us, quiet and peaceful, yet within walking distance to the Whitman Mission and a couple wineries. Overall a lovely stay. Would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very spacious apartment with beautiful green surroundings. I loved seeing the donkeys, chickens, and horses around the home. Walla Walla has so many wineries and was lovely to visit a few of them during my stay. I enjoyed walking the trails around the Whitman Mission, just a few minute drive from the Airbnb. The town of Walla Walla is about a 10-15 min drive, and there are many restaurants and things to do there. On my arrival Alicia had a note saying fresh cream was in the refrigerator and local coffee was right there. A nice big kitchen, a huge comfortable King bed and even a private deck. A Lovely place!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely one of the best places to stay in Walla Walla. We loved our time there and it’s great to be about 15 minutes from the city. Loved Alicia’s place on the farm and especially the patio with the fire pit table. Will definitely come back again!

We enjoyed the propane fire pit on the balcony, and the beautiful surroundings. The highlight of the trip had to be petting and feeding the donkeys! The farm fresh eggs for breakfast was a nice touch for sure. The Q Corral was located close to town and was located within minutes of several incredible wineries. I fully recommend the Q Corral and look forward to booking it again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, we really loved this apartment. Rarely have we had such good facilities and loving furnishings. Modern yet cozy, very clean. We loved the large roof terrace for sundowners. And of course all the animals too, an overall beautiful property."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Corral Q was a great place for my visit. The bed was really comfortable, the décor was perfect for the farm setting and the kitchen had all the extras I needed to cook my meals. I loved the country setting with the mini donkeys, horses and of course the family dog Benny. I would definitely come back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Bob have created a wonderful space for visitors. The unit is spacious and well laid-out, comfortably furnished, and has a lovely deck. Lots of extra touches we really appreciated--like fresh half & half in the fridge, lots of pillows on the bed to accommodate different preferences in firmness/height, and two bedside lamps, both of which had phone charging pads. We only had a couple days there, sadly, so we didn't get to enjoy very long. Highly recommend this place for your stay in Walla Walls!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the Q corral and we had a lovely time. We highly recommend this location and hope to visit again soon.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can’t say enough good things! The property was beautiful, and the farm animals were so fun to watch/feed. The accommodations were exactly what we needed and better than we expected. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen/bathroom were spacious and had just what we needed. We will for sure recommend this location to friends and family."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a stellar spot! A very comfortable and clean apartment with some outdoor balcony seating as well!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location in a country setting and close to town and other activities like wine tasting and site seeing.
Enjoyed the mornings on the deck and watching the current meteor showers at night with minimal to no light pollution.
Alicia was very responsive, the apartment was very comfortable and the special amenities were much appreciated.
Make sure to say hello to Bennie, the chickens and horses/donkeys:)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia was a wonderful host with a lovely home. Lots of thoughtful touches, really appreciated the chilled wine! The home is the perfect size and very comfortable. We loved looking out over the farm in the mornings, the animals and the sweet dog. The location is great as well, convenient to town and wineries. We are only sad our stay wasn’t longer. I would highly recommend Alicia and the Q Corral!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Q Corral is a wonderful place to stay and we felt right at home from the very start. The place is nicely decorated and stocked with everything one could need. There was even a bottle of wine chilled for our arrival and coffee... 2 things that are a MUST on vacation! Alicia was welcoming, as were the horses, donkeys, chickens and Bennie the pup! We had a much-needed tranquil stay and were very comfortable the week we were there. The drive into town only took about 10 minutes, so this place is perfect for being close enough to everything but just far enough away for that country feeling. Did I mention fresh eggs? I HIGHLY recommend booking a stay in Walla Walla at Q Corral!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our time in Q Corral. It is a special place and Alicia is a wonderful host. She was always quick to respond, was generous to let us us her laundry machines, the property was beautiful and the space was super clean and home-y. We would stay there again without hesitation!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond our expectations! It was exactly as described, and there wasn't anything we were lacking!

Thank you for one of the best AirBnB experiences we have had!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, comfortable place, great hosts. Thank you so much."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Bob provided one of the best airbnb experiences I have had. They were welcoming and provided really helpful tips for local wine tasting, and their place was well appointed, super clean, and very comfortable. We enjoyed farm-fresh eggs every morning, walking their beautiful property, sunsets on the balcony, and good nights rest in their quiet, air conditioned space. They even provided locally roasted coffee and fresh cream for our mornings! It was very comfortable for 3 people, with a bedroom and a murphy bed in the living room. Highly recommend, and we look forward to returning!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great, 5 mins from a fantastic golf course and 9 minutes from downtown walla walla as well as countless winery’s. The unit was very clean and the bed super comfy. I would recommend if you need a place to stay in walla walla"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the huge apartment space and great location for wine tasting. Fresh eggs for breakfast was a bonus!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful couple days at Alicia's airbnb - located just outside of Walla Walla it has the peace and tranquility of a farm stay while located just 10 mins from downtown Walla Walla and a few extra minutes to dozens and dozens of wineries.
The space was spotless, quaint and spacious, made perfect by the Q corral ground coffee and farm fresh eggs available to collect each morning in the adjacent barn. What more could one ask for on vacation! Tie this in with great communication from the host, a super friendly dog, 2 adorable miniature donkeys and a deck that overlooks the surrounding area, I'd say this has been one of our favorite airbnb stays to date. It wasn't just a place to stay for a few nights - the space is a great experience as a whole."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,fantastic. We were in town for a family wedding and Alicia's place was perfect. Loved morning coffee on the back porch and farm fresh eggs for breakfast!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! From the peaceful view off the back deck to the four-legged friends who lived on the farm, it was a perfectly relaxing place to unwind in the middle of wine country."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming unit with lovely balcony. Well decorated, well stocked. Loved the farm animals - donkeys, horses and chickens. We had fresh eggs each morning! Only 10 minutes from town so a perfect place to stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Possibly the most I've ever enjoyed an Airbnb! The apartment had everything we needed, including some snacks that came in really handy for traveling with a toddler. Benny the dog was the perfect welcoming committee, and my son loved the donkeys and horses. They were so friendly! Sunsets were gorgeous, and we saw and heard lots of nesting herons. The bed and furniture were all comfortable. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We genuinely enjoyed our stay! Alicia and Bob's place is about 10 minutes from downtown Walla Walla and was peaceful and relaxing. The setting on the ranch was unique and the animals (Benny the dog, mini donkeys, and horses) were all friendly. We highly recommend staying here and will be back in the future"

We appreciated all the extras...half n' half, wine, cold water in the frig. Especially the coffee. YUM! It was also fun to visit the animals. Definitely recommend if you like a peaceful country setting. Doesn't get any better than this! Thanks Alicia and Bob so much."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Q Corral. It’s a very comfortable 1 bedroom apartment above the garage on what could be described as about a 10 acre ranchette located about a 10 minute drive from downtown Walla Walla, out in the quiet countryside. There are a couple of miniature donkeys and a couple of horses on the property as well and you can go visit them and give them treats provided by the hosts. The space was perfect for a couple and it has a comfy king size bed, a small but well appointed kitchen as well as a living room and deck outside where we observed wild turkeys and deer. The space was nicely appointed, we would definitely to stay there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So happy we selected this AirBnb for our first visit to Walla Walla. It’s 10 minutes outside of downtown, and in a beautiful farm setting. The apartment was bigger than we expected and so comfortable - especially loved the deck to have outside seating and West-ward facing views in the evening. This place has everything you need for long weekend or more. The fresh eggs and coffee were an extra bonus. Overall, friendly hosts, a great value and a great spot!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Alicia's was pretty spectacular. We felt right at home and were very comfortable in the apartment and surrounding area. We were able to enjoy the deck and fire table, but also the comfy furniture inside. It's the perfect setting for a Walla Walla get away."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay! Easy to get around and a beautiful property.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a return stay at Alicia and Bob’s place. We really enjoyed our first stay and the second was just as good as the first. The place was just as described, spotless, and comfortable.
The location is great and Alicia was proactive to make sure we checked in without any issues. We would not hesitate to return again on our next trip to Walla Walla."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Q Coral. The unit has beautiful furnishings, spotlessly clean, and so relaxing. Beautiful bird watching and great views from the deck. Great hosts. A 5 star place!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and visit the vineyards of Walla Walla!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful apartment on farmland acreage was just what we needed after a stressful week. We were greeted by a Frisbee catching dog, cute burrows, horses and were able to collect farm fresh eggs. Amazing to see wide open beautiful spaces! We will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best experience we’ve ever had , highly recommend Alicia’s Airbnb!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,By far one of the best Airbnbs my wife and I have stayed in. We very much appreciate the accommodation from Alicia.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a place to stay in walla walla this is it. It was our first time in walla-walla and we loved the distance. It is only 10 minutes from downtown! Perfect distance to avoid busyness, noise, and heavy foot traffic. The animals at their house are all so dang welcoming. It’s insane! They are so friendly! The cat is so cool and the donkeys are extremely fun and friendly. They can count on us being repeat customers 😁"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very relaxing place. Great communications. Will definitely stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia was responsive. Really good welcome pack that is super helpful to anyone that is there for wine country. Location is great and accessible to the surrounding areas. We cooked thanksgiving dinner while we were here and the kitchen didn't have quite everything we needed, but Alicia was quick to lend the missing items to us. Overall great experience."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This fantastic place was exactly as advertised and will stay here again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting and wonderful, private space. Country living with great amenities and comforts! Would love to visit again in warmer weather! A + !"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The perfect cozy space on a peaceful farm! My kids enjoyed meeting the horses, donkeys, and other animals on the property. We felt welcome and Alicia was a great host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and apartment. Must stay 10/10. The animals are a joy and Alicia is one of the best hosts we have ever had.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming place to stay with a taste of farm life and plenty of comfort. The unit is very nice, with plenty of space for 2 people. The bed and seating is comfortable and the high quality TP is a luxurious touch! Noise and smells were not problems at all, which was a nice surprise for staying on a farm. We had a few house flies, which were annoying, but also common throughout Walla Walla. Hopefully the provision of a fly swatter can help with those in the future. Wi-Fi wasn't the strongest, so you may want to download any video entertainment ahead of time, but it will handle more basic usage. Location is a quick drive into downtown WW or any of the surrounding wineries. Overall, this is the perfect place to stay if you want a taste of modern country life."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little spot. Very accommodating and look forward to coming back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Honestly one of the best airbnb stays we have had. Alicia includes nice special touches and the setting on the small farm was fantastic. Close enough to town that we biked to Walla Walla and a winery. Also nice biking on rural roads nearby. You can walk to Whitman mission which was worthwhile. My husband walked to the creek/river nearby for birding.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great space and excellent value. Also very comfortable with pretty views of the farm.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great and comfortable place to stay. Loved the peacefulness,
walked to the Whitman Mission, visited nearby wineries. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay with Alicia and Bob was amazing! Their hospitality has by far been the best we have ever experienced! Fresh eggs, Q Corral coffee (amazing!!) along with fresh cream and cold water in the fridge. Also, a bottle of wine waiting for us. Their home is comfy and so very clean! The view from the balcony was a bonus! Will definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect spot for some rest and relaxation. Great location. This is our second stay at the Q Corral and it only gets better. Also there are two mini donkeys that welcome you back. Looking forward to our next stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Alicia was a terrific host who was very hospitable to our family, and let our young children roam around the farm and have a great time. The unit was very spacious and private, and included all necessary amenities. The farm grounds are great, friendly donkeys, horses, dogs and all. Also a perfect location close to the city, but isolated enough for that peaceful country feel. Lots of wineries closeby! Would definitely return sometime when back in Walla Walla."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodation. Direct communication and flawless exp.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great get- away. The rooms are spacious & very comfortable. There is all you need for a long stay. The hosts are very friendly, as are the donkeys & dog! We had fresh eggs for breakfast from the resident chickens. Although this farm is a ways out of Walla Walla it is very convenient to several wineries. We would definitely come again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great. Convenient location, great setting, very comfortable apartment. Hosts were very nice and helpful."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a special spot!!! The owners are lovely, the donkeys are friendly, the dog greets you enthusiastically. It is quiet and private and clean and lacks nothing. It was so comfortable and I slept like a dream. Many years ago I lived in an in-law apartment on a horse farm in NH, and this spot made me nostalgic and even a little homesick for those days. A short drive into town, and still close to a bunch of wineries - this place has it all. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alicia's place is excellent and exactly like described in the listing/pictures. It's about a ten minute drive to downtown but a short walk to local wineries. Its the perfect place to stay if you want a relaxing weekend. I tried taking several pics to capture how beautiful it was but it didn't do the location justice! Would absolutely recommend this place if you are going to walla walla.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Bob were awesome hosts! The apartment was a great size and we had everything we needed for the week. We really enjoyed getting to see the donkeys and horses on property. Location was also fantastic. We were able work remotely all week, but still visit a lot of the tasting rooms around the greater Walla Walla area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our anniversary destination and it happened to be in Walla Walla which was also a treat! This home away from home exceeds expectations established from the description and images. Wonderful!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little apartment in the country! It was super quiet and the roads were perfect for riding bicycles!
The apartment itself was well equipped and cool in the heat.
There is no tv- which we loved."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay! Only 10 minutes from town. Quiet, peaceful and very comfortable. The hosts were very attentive and helpful. Plenty of room for the two of us. We will definitely return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a quiet, calm, clean, private place to stay in Walla Walla this is it! We loved our stay and would absolutely stay again. Feeding the mini donkeys was so fun. They are the sweetest little guys and we miss them already!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Q Corral was such a pleasant stay. It was so peaceful out there. They have a couple special greeters named Benny (their dog) and Elton John (their cat) who both have a ton of personality. Benny is quite respectful and likes to play fetch. The apartment above the garage had everything we needed. A spacious living room, a well equipped kitchen and a sun deck. They even had a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us.
The Q Corral is about 10-12 minutes from town. 5 minutes from Wine valley golf course and steps from the creek near by if you need to cool of from the heat.
We will definitely be back the next time we’re in Walla Walla ."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved everything about our stay at the Q corral. We will definitely stay again. Everything was so comfortable and the hospitality was amazing. Thank you so much for everything.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Q Corral, the apartment was spacious, well decorated and had everything we needed! All the animals were very friendly and fun to interact with.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, period!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay and will definitely be back! Highly recommend. :)
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Q Corral was one of the nicest, good value, Air B&Bs that we have ever stayed at. The apartment was very clean with a super comfortable bed with various pillow options, and the nicely decorated, rooms were spacious. In particular, the large bathroom was unusual for many smaller 2-3 person Air B&Bs. We also appreciated that all of the rooms were very well lite. The unexpected purified water tap in the kitchen sink was wonderful. The parking was very convenient. However, there are some steps to access the apartment. We did not at all miss the lack of television, and more importantly, Wi-Fi connection was very good. We also found that the location above the garage to be very quiet. If we stay in Walla Walla Area, we will most definitely return to the Q Corral."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this gem 💎 ❤️ such a relaxing and cozy apartment. Our boys loved all of the animals 💗 cant wait for our next trip to walla walla, we hope to be able to stay agin soon."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to experience Walla Walla from; the apartment is super spacious and bright, with lots of great light. Super close to town and being able to visit and offer a treat to all the animals was a highlight for us. Would absolutely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Private Apartment at the Q Corral. The apartment was so spacious with everything we needed, complete with a deck facing west. Our wonderfully generous host, Alicia, left a bottle of red wine and a box of chocolates that were delicious which we savored. The location on their beautiful property offered a quiet retreat for us to relax in. We truly enjoyed spending time with Alicia, Bob, Benny the dog, horses, donkeys and chickens. This is one of my very favorite Airbnb accommodations I have ever experienced and would book a stay there again sometime."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wife and I had a fantastic experience staying at the Q Corral. It was a highlight of our visit to Walla Walla. Great place for those wishing to be away from downtown Walla Walla and find rest near the country side. Location is not far from several wineries and historical sites.
We will definitely try to book this place next time we visit Walla Walla!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a peaceful and beautiful retreat. It was just what we needed and can’t wait to visit again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and relaxing place to stay with everything you might need. Will definitely stay here again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and inviting. We loved our stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an excellent little farm experience just far enough out of town for some peace and quiet but close enough to town that it’s not inconvenient. Quiet and cute and clean. Great value for a small family or two couples. The animals are sweet and friendly and it has everything you need. No tv, but that is one thing that makes it great. The host has done a great job making this a great place to stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Q Corral was the most amazing experience! I already miss my new donkey and horse friends. Alicia was a fabulous host! The place is clean, comfortable and wonderful."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia's place is our favorite place to stay in Walla Walla. It's clean, quiet and very comfortable."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dreamy spot to rest or take off for activities. Excellent host, wonderful space."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bob and Alicia's place is a perfect place to enjoy a Walla Walla wine exploration trip. The description matched what we experienced and the location was really peaceful and relaxing. The check in and check out process was straightforward and the communication with the host was very responsive to the few questions we had.
The kitchen had what we needed and everything worked perfectly , and most important the bed was comfortable. Since it's still cool at night, we appreciated how quickly the place was able to warm up and get comfortable. The furnishings were very comfortable and the place was spotless. After a busy day visiting the great wineries available in Walla Walla, being able to completely relax was much appreciated.
The bonus was getting a chance to walk the area, feed the donkeys, play a bit with Benny, and enjoy the freshest eggs for breakfast possible!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay--the unit is spacious, set up very well, and it worked great for a family with young kids. We loved the setting and the deck was a great place to enjoy an exceptional bottle of wine provided by the hosts. We definitely hope to stay at the Q Corral next time we are in Walla Walla."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We can’t recommend this place highly enough! It’s the perfect location to explore Walla Walla from. Alicia and Bob were wonderful too. Make sure to set aside some time to explore their property and interact with all of the animals!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable. Donkeys and chickens and horses, oh my! Wild turkeys wandering across the yard at dawn, egrets nesting in the trees by the creek. I'm a sucker for good coffee first thing in the morning (they have it). Fresh eggs for breakfast, too. Extra blankets and pillows (yay!). A short 10 minute drive to downtown Walla Walla. One Walla Walla warning: if you are coming in an EV, be prepared to scrounge for (slow) charging. Walla Walla is a charging desert."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Alicia has made the unit super inviting with an at home feeling. The décor is calming, the furniture comfortable and the unit is very clean and spacious. Upon arrival we found all the amenities, as time went on we found so many little things that made the stay even more awesome. Fresh cream in the fridge, farm fresh eggs straight out of the coop, multiple bed pillow options, very well supplied kitchen... the list goes on. The location is super convenient to wineries and to downtown where there are multiple tasting rooms (just a short, easy drive). We stayed three nights and had incredible meals in town. All those very cool things aside, the property is great! As you enter your unit, upstairs and super private, there are 4 very friendly and quiet donkeys. The dog (didn't catch his name) is friendly and not in your face (well a tiny bit...just enough), horses on the property in the distance, and a deck to watch the sunset. All in all we would definitely stay here again and hope to when we get back to Walla Walla. Thank you Alicia for an amazing stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Be sure and gather some eggs from the chicken coop every morning for breakfast! You may have to reach under the setting chicken to get them but, hey, get your farmer fantasy going!! We had a great time staying here. There was a heron rookery just 300 yards from the house and I saw an owl one night as he was perched on the peak of the roof. All in all, a very pleasant place to spend some time."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, bright and clean, this is a lovely spot and it's easy to see the care that Ben and Alicia have put into it. From complimentary coffee, wireless phone chargers on the nightstands, plentiful pillows of varying firmness and a cleaning regimen that leaves even the window blinds dust free, this place is a treasure. We really enjoyed staying here and getting to visit with the animals too!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true retreat! Alicia’s place is a perfect hideaway from the daily grind- the space is cozy yet spacious enough to spread out with a good book and cup of tea. The welcoming touches of real cream, fresh roasted coffee and bottle of wine were a surprise. We appreciated the immaculate space and attention to COVID precautions. Most of all, the miniature donkeys were the highlight of our stay. Can’t wait to return!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend ! Super clean and nice , they have the cutest dog and the kids loved petting the donkeys ! Would definitely book again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be the cleanest AirBNB rental that ever stayed at. It truly was spotless. It’s pretty much as advertised…a cute little apartment above a garage on a farm in the middle of wine country. There’s a big, friendly dog, numerous chickens, and some miniature donkeys right outside your door. But somehow, it manages to be super quiet. The king- sized bed was very comfy and the place was well equipped. The nice bottle of wine that was awaiting us was much appreciated. A big thumbs up and we’d gladly stay here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay. It has all you need - plates, cups, cutlery, cookware, towels, comfy pillows, great seating area, no TV (yes that’s a plus!) and its location is beautiful. If I ever have the need to stay in Walla Walla again this will be my top pick and I’ll spend more time outside! I loved time on the back deck in the sun and I wish I had gone for a walk around the pasture."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cozy apartment with field views and close to wineries. Alicia was a fantastic host, great communication, and even came to the rescue when I inadvertently locked myself out."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Q Corral! The apartment was spotlessly clean, thoughtfully put together and stocked with essentials. The location is lovely as it’s a quiet area surrounded by farmland, but only a quick 10-15 min drive to town and even closer to some wineries. The miniature donkeys are adorable! We felt very at home and comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised to find a king bed that was quite comfortable!
The apartment is above their garage which is used mornings and evenings for their chores. You could hear some doors open and close but nothing that disturbed us. We appreciated their quick replies to questions, the delicious coffee, and breakfast snacks provided.
We will absolutely stay again on our next trip to Walla Walla!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place is very nice. Nice and clean. The bed is comfy. It’s nice that it is out in the country yet still close enough that you can get to town quickly. The host is super nice and helpful. Loved that we could go say hi to the animals that are on the property. The only slight issue is that it is an apartment right above their garage which the use on a regular as they live on the property. Made it kind of feel like we had to be quiet all the time (slightly difficult with a very active 3 year old) and kind of felt like we were “invading” their home.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My kids and I LOVED this place. Such nice spot and we couldn’t get enough of the animals. She left snacks and tea which we definitely enjoyed. And fresh eggs in the morning was such a treat!!!!! Thank you!!!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place met and exceeded our expectations. The entire apartment is thoughtfully put together, and the hosts are kind and communicative. A perfect home to visit Walla Walla and enjoy a peaceful country setting."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,15/10 would stay again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect vacation rental! Clean, cute, private, beautiful view, plenty of space. The perfect place for a cozy weekend getaway. The friendly animals made it feel even more cozy and welcoming. Host is professional, thorough, and thoughtful."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is wonderful location and the property is beautiful. The apartment itself was very clean had everything we needed. The animals were a delight and we loved the fresh eggs!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a great place very accessible to most wineries in Walla Walla. Got some good winery suggestions from the host and they definitely lived up to it. We got to play with the dog and feed the donkeys and also got to see a nice sunset. Missed out on the farm fresh eggs which I'll look forward to next time. Overall, It was a fun stay and would recommend!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is immaculate and looks very new. The kitchen is stocked with coffee, tea, oatmeal packets, etc. The blankets and linens are of good quality and clean. One of the most important features to us in a rental is a comfortable bed, and the king bed here is very comfortable. Also it is covered with a variety of pillows, so you’re bound to find one you like.
The location is a short drive to town and multiple wineries.
The miniature donkeys are fun to pet and feed (Alicia leaves a bucket of treats for the occupants to give them). And, of course, their dog Benny is friendly and gentle. We saw deer in the pasture both days we were there.
We will definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Q Corral is a great home base for a weekend of wine tasting or historical visiting in Walla Walla! Super clean, bright and cute space--would go back again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia and Bob were fabulous hosts! The private apartment over their 3-car garage includes a kitchenette with full-size stove, fridge, and dishwasher; a cozy living room with comfortable love seat and chairs; a cute and well-equipped bathroom; and a bedroom with a very comfy king-sized bed. Additionally, there's a lovely deck overlooking their bucolic setting outside of town. They've thought of just about every possible amenity already, but if you need anything else, a quick text gets a very prompt response.
They have horses, cows, chickens, a couple of adorable donkeys, and a joyful dog, and encourage you to interact with them if so choose. Additionally, the chickens provided us with delicious, fresh eggs for breakfast!
The location is terrific and so quiet you could hear a pin drop! It's very close to several notable wineries, and just a few miles from downtown Walla Walla, where another 30 or so wineries await you within a few blocks of each other.
My husband and I will definitely be back to the Q Corral the next time we're in the area. It was an exceptional experience."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying there and everything was as perfect as before. Didn't get to play with Benny, this time but hopefully the next. The mini donkeys and horses are always fun to pet and give the treats provided. Looking forward to a return visit hopefully next year!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Q Corral was a very a fun and comfortable place to stay. Everything was just perfect and Alicia was a great host. This is a nice location out in the country, but close to town and wineries."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at Alicia’s Airbnb twice. It’s in a quiet rural area near Walla Walla, with an easy and scenic drive into town. The apartment has a well-stocked kitchen, a comfortable bed with very nice linens, a great living room with a lovely sunset view, and it’s immaculately clean and fresh. The little donkeys are charming and seemed to appreciate an apple and pear I shared with them. I’ll bring more next time!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay when you’re in Walla Walla. Close enough to town but a nice quiet country setting. My wife had great fun giving the donkeys their morning treat. Would definitely revisit
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,AMAZING STAY! Donkeys are so friendly (plenty of treats to share) and the garden is awesome. Alicia was kind enough to allow guests to take any of her vegetables and flowers! The bed was incredibly comfy and plenty of space for us to roam.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! Beautiful views. Alicia thought about everything. She supplied the things we didn’t even know we had forgotten. The home is beautifully decorated very comfy. Looking forward to out next visit to the Corral. The cherry on top of it all was the two mini donkeys that would greet us each time we came or went.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. So cute inside and beautiful outside. Close to shopping , wineries and great restaurants. We stayed here our wedding weekend and they let us take pictures with the mini donkeys in our wedding attire! We enjoyed coffee on the deck overlooking the farm. Would definitely stay here again"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Close to Whitman Historic site, wineries and thriving downtown Walla Walla"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars is not enough for the Q Coral! We had an amazing stay and can't wait to stay again soon. Alicia was a great communicator and an outstanding host. She has added so many little touches to the space like extra pillows/bedding, amazing coffee/cream, and even cold water waiting for us in the fridge. We could not get enough of all the animals to include the donkeys and their dog Benny! We saw packs of deer from the wonderful porch and it was a perfect serene location to unplug a bit. We also visited many wineries suggested and had an absolute blast. Best airbnb stay in a long time, we will be back!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the Q coral! Clean and quiet with kid friendly touches my nieces loved. Great spot to pick for Palouse falls and general exploration in the area.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place - comfy and well appointed with a lovely balcony and the added plus of adorable donkeys, horses, and very playful doggie!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous place, beautiful views, especially enjoyed the horses and donkeys. The donkeys are to the left of the house. I didn’t discover them until my last day. They had such a funny personally. Actually so did the horses! There are treats inside the door to feed them, which is really fun.
And their dog is so cute. He has these wild eye brows! I wish I could have spent more time with him!!
It’s a cool place!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful. The apartment was great and the property was wonderful. Our kids loved the animals. We would definitely stay there again!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at Q Corral was one of the loveliest Airbnb stays I've had in a long time. Alicia's attentiveness and attention to detaill surpassed expectations. She went above and beyond to ensure we had a nice stay. We had a wonderful time in Walla Walla and a large portion of that was thanks to this beautiful home! Our one year old son especially loved feeding the horses and donkeys.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay! My daughter had the best time greeting the animals in the morning.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia is the hostest with the mostest! There was nothing that we needed at her lovely place that we didn't find, especially the air conditioner for those 100+ degree days that hit us in August. My son loved the Murphy bed that pulled down from the wall and had some of his best sleeps ever. We loved being out in the country after our trips to the wineries. Quite a few wineries were just minutes from her place, but it was great to go for nice long walks among the horses, cows, donkeys, and crop land. The place was like brand new and spotless. Would definitely return upon my next trip to Seattle -- worth the drive!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just perfect. So clean and comfortable. The setting on the farm with the access to animal visits, and only about a 10 or so minute drive into town was ideal. We would recommend this place to a friend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alicia place was perfect. Clean, quaint, well appointed. Everything we needed for our short time in Walla Walla. Make sure to spend a few minutes for fetch with their awesome dog, he will love it!!!

The apartment was spacious, clean, cute and very comfortable with all the amenities you need. Alicia and Bob were wonderful hosts. We cannot recommend the Q Corral enough and can’t wait for our next Walla Walla visit."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After much consideration, we chose to book at the Q Corral. It’s always hard to tell from photos if the space will live up to expectations. This space absolutely did. High ceilings, lots of windows, and well laid out space. Special touches such as coffee and cream, and some often forgotten toiletries are a nice addition. The bathroom has a nicely tiled tub and is quite large. Shower got hot and water pressure was good. Lots of pillow options, plenty of blankets. Good WiFi and cooling system. Easy check in and out. And a gorgeous property with the friendliest pup. What’s not to like? We loved our time here and think you will, too."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay, I highly recommend! Our family of 4 enjoyed the farm, were very comfortable, and loved the location. This exceeded expectations."

Would definitely recommend. Good value!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Q Corral is a little slice of heaven. The apartment is bigger and more charming than the photos lead too and it is filled with everything you need for a great getaway to the beautiful area. Take a walk down to the horses in the morning and then sit on the deck in the evening to watch the gorgeous sunset. A stop at Cugini's on the way back from town is a must.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Q Coral so much! The apartment is open, spacious and very comfortable! The bed and pillows are so comfy...great night’s sleep! It is close to some wineries and a short drive to tons more...and downtown Walla Walla. We were greeted right away by Benny - the most friendly dog - and visited Burr and Ito as soon as we got there. Loved there were treats provided so we could feed the mini donkeys and horses. We had a fresh bottle of cream, cold water and bottle of wine waiting for us...and snack of cheese and apple! We enjoyed our stay so much and will definitely look at Alicia’s place again when we come back to the area!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Q Corral had everything we needed for a long weekend out in Walla Walla! A short drive to downtown and wineries.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay - near wineries and in a lovely setting. It has a full kitchen which we used more often than we anticipated as many area restaurants were closed on Sunday. We slept so well in the comfy bed.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice comfortable daylight basement apartment. Comfy bed and useful amenities in the kitchen. Quiet location, simple decor."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a long weekend in Walla Walla. Private and quiet. All the personal touches, coffee, snacks in the fridge and in the cupboards. We absolutely loved it and will stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this space. Shari had the place spotless and clean. There were even snack items and other amenities which was much appreciated. We will definitely look at this option again next time we need a place to stay in Walla Walla.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay in a wonderful place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend this location! It’s in a quiet neighborhood, but not too far away from downtown. The space was clean and equipped with everything you could need for your stay, including extra toiletries and coffee! Great value."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for a quick drive to local wineries and restaurants. Would love to stay in again for another Walla Walla visit.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sharis place was perfect for what we needed and very spacious. She was great and extraordinarily responsive !
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felt so comfortable and peaceful.
Just what we needed!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shari was a great host and very responsive. Her place is well stocked and had lots of nice amenities. It is also very quiet and comfortable. We hope to come back again upon our next visit to the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shari’s place was very clean, comfortable and private. It was perfect for our quick family weekend, celebrating our dear auntie who turned 100 years old!! There were a lot of very thoughtful and extra touches that made our stay quite enjoyable. Shari Is a great host who communicates extremely well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"my daughter liked the place, I'll stay there again if available"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place definitely recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean comfortable place, bigger than expected with thoughtful amenities. The coffee and breakfast items were a nice treat! I hope to stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"An excellent place, with privacy & spacious accommodations.
There were plenty of nice touches & extras throughout the place.
Very good value!
Shari was very flexible in adjusting the date."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose an air bnb for our stay in Walla Walla instead of a hotel because we wanted
something more comfortable as we had our baby with us. This space was exactly that. Clean, comfortable, and quiet. Would definitely stay here again.
The only “complaint” (if you wanna call it that) was that the turn into the parking space from the alley very tight if you have an suv. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this spot."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. I literally parked and walked everywhere I needed to go during my stay. However, I like getting out and stretching my legs. If you don't, you'll find that everything you need is a short drive away.
Also, if you are used to cats in the house, you won't notice the occasional thumps they make upstairs at odd hours of the day and night. Being forewarned, their minimal noise didn't bother us at all."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not a lot to say- absolutely matched the posting- bed was comfy, check-in instructions were clear and detailed, from street/alley directions, to parking, to the key lockbox. Ample kitchen supplies, but all I needed was the keurig. Heat instructions made sense and worked great. No complaints, no problems. Great weekend at the Walla Walla Guitar Festival- I highly recommend it if you’re there in March. 😁"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and quiet place for a quick overnight trip. The host was responsive and her instructions to find the place and get inside were great!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just needed one night by myself for a quiet nights sleep. That's exactly what I got. Clean place, comfortable bed. Coffee supplies ready to go. This place and others like it are why I love AirBNB vs staying in hotels. The check in was easy. I even forgot something and Shari let me know I could just stop by and grab it. This place will be my go to when coming to Walla Walla in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shari’s place was exactly what I was looking for. It was comfortable, relatively close to a great grocery store (Andy’s Market) and coffee shops. It’s also walking distance to Walla Walla University. The kitchen is super well equipped, and the washer and dryer are a huge plus.
The unit is, however, in College Place, not Walla Walla proper, so it’s a distance from downtown if that’s a goal.
I would stay here again without reservation."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend if you need to stay in area. Quiet area and great location. My family's first experience with an AirBNB and will definitely be looking into them more often due to our visit.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing host, and a great place to stay at college place!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cute basement apartment. clean & tidy. well stocked kitchen. even had snacks!! comfortable beds.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great clean space, easy check in and over all perfect for our family overnight trip!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very nice basement apartment that is well stocked, clean and comfortable. Sleeps 3 in two bedrooms very comfortably. We only stayed one night but could have easily stayed longer.
My first experience with an Airbnb was not very good and I was a little hesitant to do it again. But our stay here at Shari's was very nice. I go to Walla Walla a lot and look forward to staying with Shari in the future and hopefully longer than for one night."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect little place for our stop over in College Place. Everything we needed was provided, plenty of bedding, towels, some toiletries, coffee and creamer, even English muffins and lovely jam for the morning. Plenty of room for mom, dad, oldest child with her toddler and big teen boy on the couch. Nice safe location easy to get in. We’d definitely stay a again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for us. And we will definitely re-book.
Two nights in a LOVELY space. It’s like a huge studio. With a killer bathroom.
The view was just stunning, and the room felt like someone really took the time to make it welcoming.
Super comfortable bed, tons of options for hanging out, a cool crows nest which we visited once or twice, the high winds kept us off of that a bit!
Awesome location, easy to get to Walla Walla (20 minutes), easy to get to Pendleton (30 minutes).
And…waking up to the from sunrise across the vineyard is a great way to start the day.
Samantha was absolutely communicative and responsive 👍🏼
Thank you so much for letting us stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a peaceful beautiful place. We wish we were here for more than just one night! The views were wonderful, the space open, clean, and inviting, and the bed was super comfy! Samantha was very responsive to all communication. I highly recommend!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. It was so peaceful and beautiful. Exactly what we wanted. We loved walking the vineyard and the view from this place was lovely. Easy, short drive to restaurants in Walla Walla and wineries."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay! I thoroughly research our vacations & I couldn’t find anything that came close to the Crow’s Nest in value & beauty! You would normally have to spend hundreds more a night to stay at a property of this caliber. Crow’s Nest is simply stunning!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Due to weather conditions our stay included 2 nights of windmills that sounded like hovering helicopters. Our third night was extremely windy and the noise it made sounded like the roof was being removed. The place is beautiful but we left our stay sleep deprived. We have learned a valuable lesson about staying in a vineyard, no fault of Samantha. We were just unlucky with the weather."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked the Crow’s nest for a last minute weekend trip. Space is open, very clean and super cute. Samantha was quick to respond to messages and provided recommendations on the nearby wineries. Would recommend a stay here, especially when the winery opens to the public!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place to stay. Very unique, cozy, and well appointed. Samantha is a great host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautiful and peaceful, just as described. Definitely looking to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back! And tell all our friends!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! It is about 20 minutes driving from downtown Walla Walla, but near to several great wineries (such as Rotie) in the Rocks District. The space is super unique and lives like a true loft - one huge room with a kitchenette, sitting area, and bed. The space was spotless and clearly well cared for. While it was foggy during our stay, we did peek up top for the gorgeous view of the surrounding vines. This property is an active winery, so there will be a little noise during the day, but nothing overly disruptive - it is 100% worth it for the unique setting and truly peaceful nights. We feel like we found a hidden gem and can’t wait to come back! Also, thank you to the reviewer who recommended Patty’s - excellent Mexican food."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful gem. Peaceful and clean.
Positive energy and we will be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the feel of this spot. Being amongst the vineyard was fantastic. The view from the porch can’t be beat. Just wish there was at least a hot plate and one pan as it is more remote to make a lazy morning even more perfect.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just wow. So beautiful. We had everything we needed and then some, very comfortable stay. Such a nice retreat for a weekend getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place overlooking a lovely vineyard. Was perfect for us as we were trying to break up a road trip. We got lucky finding this place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Will recommend to couples. 😍
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A MUST STAY! An absolutely beautiful and romantic place to stay. We only booked for 1 night and wished we had booked our entire stay there. No reason to leave when you’re staying above a lovely winery! Thank you for making our anniversary so special, we will be returning next year!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great celebratory stay. Overall clean and great views!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most accommodating hosts. With special permission, we were able to utilize the venue as a location for our bridesmaids to get ready for the wedding, amazing first look photos as well as us to stay there the night of our wedding. a little birdy told me that you may be able to get married here next year... if your considering this place is Amazing!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,tranquil setting overlooking the vineyards; rooftop view superb; comfy bed; nice shower; perfect for a couples getaway; bonus to see & learn about the grape- picking; would definitely return; thanks Samantha!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I loved the experience. The bottle of wine, snacks, and warm feel were definitely worth it. Try out Patty's for some excellent tacos and drinks. Milton-Freewater is definitely unrated for sure. we will back. Thanks."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was amazing and a great romantic getaway for our anniversary. The space exceeded expectations. There isn’t much of a kitchen space, but we knew that when we booked."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful apartment on a gorgeous vineyard! We couldn’t have asked for anything more on our trip to Walla Walla! We’d love to return when their vineyard is open to the public too!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Samantha and her husband have made a fantastic retreat for people. It's located above a working vineyard, which is what we look for when we book on airbnb-an experience!! We interacted with the host one time despite being on the same property, we appreciated hearing their story while also just being by ourselves for a majority of the trip. The unit was very comfy and the views were spectacular. It stayed cool in 98 degree heat and we had plenty of space for two people. It was so quiet out there that it reminded us of our childhoods on the farms we grew up on. I wouldn't change a single thing about our trip and can't wait to visit again once the tasting room is open-we will be following their journey! Thank you guys for opening your property and soon to be business to help us have a relaxing trip."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is such a beautiful place right on the winery. Host came out and told us about the winery and grapes they grow on the property. We had an amazing stay. We highly recommended it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Samantha's place was one of our favorite stays with Airbnb! Such a beautiful setting and everything was so plush, clean, and new. I just loved the fluffy towels as well as real bathmats, comfortable bed, easy check in, and clear instructions. Samantha gave us suggestions for where to have dinner and breakfast! We would have loved to stay longer and explore the area more. Hopefully we can come back in the near future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful loft! And the view of the vineyard was amazing !
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! What a unique and beautiful place. We would definitely stay here again. Samantha and her husband are great hosts.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing location. The studio was well laid out, so comfortable, and such a wonderful getaway. The rooftop access and balcony overlooking the vineyard was beautiful and peaceful. Thiss location was close to town but far enough away to give you that country feed. Samantha was friendly, helpful, and available when needed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful area, secluded, and quiet."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique and picturesque setting! The accommodations were inviting, private, clean and comfortable.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Well appointed- Lovely place to stay! Well stocked with anything you might need. Very clean and new. Private quiet country setting with beautiful peaceful views.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shelby was a very responsive & helpful host. Place was clean, roomy & comfortable. Nice to have a comfy King bed. Kitchen was well equipped. To say it was quiet would be an understatement... there was total silence except for all the beautiful bird sounds. Sunsets were awesome and the back patio was a great place to enjoy them. Will definitely stay again when in the area."

We loved staying here and we will definitely be back!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a wonderful, quiet and peaceful stay. The location is out of Walla Walla a little ways , but close enough to access the downtown and College Place area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful relaxing stay at GG’s place. Clean and quiet. Peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Didn’t cook much when we were there but had great appliances and well stocked to do so. Will definitely stay here again. This place is perfect for a couple to stay and have a quiet get away.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very pleased with our four nights at G.G.'s. The apartment is in a great vicinity to wineries. We enjoyed some beautiful drives. The apartment looked out on a lush green lawn and we were able to catch a few hours sitting out on the patio. We always try to leave a place better than when we found it and this was hard to do at G.G.'s! Plenty of towels and linens. Immaculate kitchen. The electric fireplace added to the coziness of the living room. The bedroom and bath were filled with natural sunlight but we were grateful for the blackout curtains at night. Laura was nicely communicative which we appreciated as well.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our time at GG’s place. We felt right at home; it was a comfortable, clean and well appointed place."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a 5 Star Experience! I highly recommend this rental! Very clean, well organized and stocked, and easy communication with Laura. The rental is much larger than the pictures show (separate bedroom and living room areas from the kitchen, huge bathroom and walk in closet). I enjoyed being slightly outside the hustle and bustle of downtown Walla Walla, yet within a 10 minute drive. Extremely close to Southside wineries. Hands down one of the best rentals I’ve had!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have stayed in over 30 Airbnbs in 7 countries and this was one of the best experience we had!!! It doesn't have a gorgeous view from apt but it has everything else! The modern apt is well-appointed and is in PRISTINE condition. She orginally had it made for her recently deceased mother, and created a real gem of a place. Everything is luxurious, new and super nice! The king sized bed was so comfy and the adjoining bathroom is awesome! After hiking and wine tasting (surprisingly GREAT reds & whites for all budgets in Walla Walla - we loved Reynvaan, Rasa, Savia, Sleight of Hand, Double Back, L' Ecole, Force Majeur), it was nice to relax in the air conditioned apt. We ran into a wine critic at one of the wineries and he was paying $265 to stay at one of the mediocre hotel chains... no way that hotel can compare in price and comfort to Laura's apt! Suffice to say, this is when Airbnb is at its best, when they have super duper accomodations and hosts. Laura's place is TOP notch and like the top-rated wine from the area, highly recommended!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"GG's House provides everything anyone would hope for when seeking a perfect place to stay--a cozy, beautifully decorated home, a first rate kitchen with absolutely everything you need and then some (crockpot, air fryer, microwave also serves as an oven, etc.), amazingly comfortable king sized bed with luxurious linens, walk-in shower was divine, and for those who like to walk the neighborhood - Wow!

She had all of the things I could need from fresh coffee beans and a grinder to eye makeup remover wipes (my fave :)).

Laura provided me with all the information I needed and showed me around. The home is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. I cant wait to come back with my daughters in the summer for vacation."
