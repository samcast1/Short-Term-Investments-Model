Stayed a few nights","This home was very charming! The beds and other furniture were comfortable, the kitchen was stocked with all the essential cooking tools, there is a nice patio out back that gets great afternoon sun, and our host left a coffee and hot chocolate bar with snacks for us. It wasn't within close walking distance to downtown but it is a short, easy drive. This house was a great base camp for us to go explore nearby hiking and Lava Beds National Monument."

Stayed with a pet","We did a 4 week stay at Danielle’s rental, and we were so grateful we chose her place.
Even more comfortable and well thought out items and design for guests than the pictures let on. Downtown was walkable! Even if you aren’t much on walking there is a convenience store and a couple of restaurants right around the corner.
Communication was great the whole time.
Mattresses were great. Kitchen was stocked well with dishes, cookware, and utensils.
We were slightly concerned with the heat (as it’s a wall unit in the living room) and a lot of our stay was in the 20°s, but it worked well for the house! Especially with the small space heater provided and the nice fact that the bathroom had a heater switch.
We are hoping to rent here again in the future."

Her place is beautiful, exactly like the photos, and very clean. You can tell that she puts love into this space. The beds are very comfortable and warm. The kitchen has everything you need for a week long stay. The neighborhood is very peaceful, and parking under the carport was perfect. We loved watching the snow fall from the living room window while sipping the provided chocolate and tea. We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","This is a great little house but with plenty of room for the three of us. It is nicely furnished and the beds are very comfortable. It is a remodeled older home, and the work has really been well done. Very thoughtful touches. The neighborhood is close to things and is a real mix of homes that are cute and homes that aren't really maintained, but that is the flavor of Klamath Falls even in the ""nicer"" neighborhoods, so it is not a negative here. It is just an observation. Overall, this house is wonderful and a very nice place to stay. Danielle is a very responsive host and is so friendly with her messaging and checking in on her guests. It makes you feel cared for even if you don't get to meet in person! A great spot to stay."

Stayed with kids","Danielle was a wonderful host! She was responsive and answered all of our questions!
We stayed here for 8 weeks visiting family, and the house had everything we needed, from extra linens to a full stocked kitchen. The beds were very comfortable, the shower had good water pressure, and the kitchen had a good amount of pots, pans, and bowls. The backyard was very quaint and quiet. It was fenced in which was great for a toddler to run around. The neighborhood was overall very quiet, the next door neighbors pups bark when you’d leave the house.
We would absolutely recommend Danielle’s place to stay!"

Having a washer and dryer, plus detergent, are an amazing addition to the place. We stayed for several nights and were able to freshen up our clothing and outer wear!
It snowed a lot during our trip and Danielle cleared the walkways and laid down salt even though we told her it wasn’t necessary. Top notch service and an amazing experience. This will be our new place to stay on our annual trip!"

The house provided a nice and convenient stay and a great value compared to staying in a hotel. Everything is just as you see in the photos and description. It is close to local restaurants and a grocery store, and just over an hour drive to Crater Lake. In my opinion, the neighborhood looked a little rundown, but I would say this house is sort of a hidden gem. If you need a place to stay for a few days while visiting Crater Lake, you should consider staying here. Lastly, Danielle was accommodating and communicative which was helpful in deciding where to stay."

The ranch easy to get to — just a mile off U.S. 97. The apartment was pristine, clean, well stocked, and easy to get around. A folding bed makes it feasible to accommodate more than two people and we were overall very satisfied.
Melody is a great host — communicative and friendly; and we’d love to go back some day."

There were lots of nice touches like snacks on the counter and good quality products in the bathroom. Only issue for us was that there is a lot of Christian decor and literature that was not apparent from the photos and it felt unnecessary in the space.

We couldn't stay more than 1 day, but it would be easy to live here for an extended period, & we intend to do that as soon as we can. The house & location has everything needed for enjoying a life that is normally not available to city dwellers. Melody was not visible, but responded immediately to questions. We felt like we were staying in a beloved friends home while she was away."

It was evident that you take great pride in maintaining a peaceful and serene environment for your guests.
Every detail, from the perfectly arranged furniture to the spotless bathroom, showcased your dedication to creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. It was a pleasure to relax and unwind in such a well-maintained space.
Your attention to detail and commitment to cleanliness truly set you apart. It was a breath of fresh air to stay in an Airbnb that was not only aesthetically pleasing but also impeccably clean. I cannot thank you enough for the effort you put into ensuring a pleasant and enjoyable stay.

Stayed with kids","This place was a gem. My 9 year old and I were passing through back home to Boise, ID from the CA coast. This was far more comfortable and cozy than a hotel. Instantly felt right at home. The personal touches made us feel welcomed and exceptionally comfortable. We only stayed one night and it was a little chilly and rainy, otherwise we would have went on a walk. The area is peaceful and the sunset was lovely. We had our suitcases and more than we needed, but for someone passing through, whether it's a random toiletrie, cup of tea or snack, everything was there making it so simple to stay overnight or longer. Much appreciated the thoughtful card made out to us. Highly suggest staying if just passing through, or wanting to get away and clear your mind. Melody has a heart to serve and offer true hospitality. We signed the guestbook which was full of raving reviews. Bring a cooler for homegrown goodies in the fridge and freezer. Mine was full already. Worth the stay!"

Chickens from one of the many coops on the property cluck and peck around, overlooked by pleasant views of the surrounding landscape. The property is located just a few minutes away from downtown, yet it feels removed enough to feel like a proper getaway. The space is well-decorated and supplied with just about everything you need to make meals, relax, and share time with loved ones. You can get out for a bit of a hike on the property or just kick back. Melody's communication is responsive, and she's willing to help make sure your visit is comfortable. The availability of fresh-laid eggs to take home is a huge plus! We'd love to return."

Stayed one night","Loved, loved, loved Melody’s place! We were taking a quick side trip to see my husband’s home town after being gone for 30 years. It was perfect. Wish we needed to go to Klamath Falls more often just so we could stay there.
It’s much better than the pictures show. We got to visit with deer during morning coffee on the deck and chickens all day long. They are very well behaved.🥰
The snacks, half and half, coffee, apples, eggs and more were much more than expected but much appreciated. We purchased meat and eggs to take back to in laws in Portland. The meat stayed frozen wrapped in paper during our flight back to Kansas City. Can’t wait to cook it!
Also, the Wi-Fi worked great in the living room and bedroom during our planned Zoom meetings.
The only thing to know is it’s a bit tricky getting onto 97 headed to town from the property’s street. Be careful.
Wonderful stay!"

This little farmhouse cottage is as clean, new, and comfortable as it is quiet, charming and quaint. The property provides solitude, dark skies, waking trail, and beautiful views and happy chickens, whose delectable eggs are available for a modest amount in the fridge (brilliant!).
The best part, though, was how conveniently situated it was not just to the gorgeous country, but to the small-town charm of Klamath Falls. The place itself is less than ten minutes from town and tucked away on a back country road, which only took us a minute to find. Our hosts were very responsive and sent us hiking suggestions and even mailed back our thermos that we forgot. We could not be more grateful for this little gem of a place! Thank you!!!"

Our stay was comfortable and peaceful which is exactly what we needed as I was traveling for work. Some of the things I really loved were the historical photos of Klamath Falls, the sweet backyard, and airy feeling in the home. But really, we loved everything about it. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in town and a great place to walk the dog. A new favorite place to stay when traveling for work or to see family."

Stayed a few nights","It is a great little house in a safe, quiet beautiful suburb of Klamath Falls and its very easy to get to. We found parking to be crowded next to a big truck in the back of the shared driveway, but actually the street parking right in front of a little lawn up to the front door was perfect and always available. It's easier to move the luggage in through the front door. The inside is extremely cute and comfortable and everything worked just fine. We used the a/c just a little bit and it was perfect. The place was very well stocked in every room, especially the kitchen and bathroom. It's all updated and it's easy to figure everything out. The bed in one room is very comfortable and feels new. The living room is small, but very cozy and warm for a few people. We made a couple suggestions to the host by email and he responded right away and was very gracious in taking constructive criticism. Also, the 4:00 pm check in/10:00 am check out could be more generous. We loved our stay here! :)"

Stayed with a pet","L's place is a beautiful little home that is even better in person than the pictures. The neighborhood that it is in is the best part of Klamath falls, and it's a beautiful place to go for a stroll and walk your dog. There are so many wonderful spaces in the house to relax, including a back patio, a beautiful front porch, and spacious living areas inside. We especially loved the kitchen and the living room. We stayed here for 3 months and wish we could have stayed longer. L is extremely responsive, and was accommodating with anything that we needed. I highly recommend staying here!"

Everything inside works perfectly, lamps, blinds, etc. and the bed and linens are super nice. It had everything I needed for meal prep and dining. The design of cupboards and well lit closets is amazing making this one of the most charming homes I’ve ever stayed in.

Stayed with a pet","Great spot for a long weekend stay for a family function. Great for the dogs with nice big fenced back yard and doggie door. Things were clean and tidy. Neighborhood was good as well. If I had a few thoughts on how to make it better I would say installing ceiling fans for air circulation, since the air conditioner seemed on the slow to cool the home, and consider placing larger bed in the master as that one was small for a 6'5"" man and his small size wife. Otherwise a fantastic place, and YES, would definitely consider again. Thank you for making my Klamath Falls stay comfortable."

We were just staying the night and moving on to Crater Lake, but it would have been fine to stay longer. The house was very clean, though maybe a bit of decor would be nice. It was free of clutter, which was good because it meant my kids couldn't break anything! Host was responsive and proactive."

The view and deck were simply amazing. Even being attached to the main house, the private walkway and entry offered seclusion and privacy. I did meet Del, and he was friendly and helpful. Thanks to the hosts for being very responsive and welcoming to my last minute reservation. Their communication was perfect, and I was pleasantly surprised by the items provided from coffee to snacks, utensils, and even paper plates. I enjoyed breakfast on the deck with the birds and that amazing view. I would highly recommend this listing for a single person or a couple looking to stay in a beautiful setting a bit away from the town."

Country Haven is a special place—clean, comfortable, private and spacious. We loved spending mornings on the front porch drinking our coffee and watching the birds. Judy and Del have put a lot of thought into it and paid attention to a details many hosts don’t. We had a nice chat with them upon our arrival and found them to be friendly, genuine hosts. We highly recommend staying here and hope we’re able to when we visit in Klamath again."

Do you know how you never know what you’re gonna get when you stay at an Airbnb?
You will not need to worry with this place! It is located outside of town in the country, and it is extremely quiet and peaceful. There is no weirdness about this place and it just feels comfortable. Everything you can need and more I will 100% stay at this place again.
It is like staying in a middle-class home, and the entire part of the home you stay in is private.
There was some things in there that I never expected, but found fun like a Rubiks cube, and two umbrellas. There was so much more to help cover any needs you might have.
Again, I strongly recommend staying at this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Going back to my hometown evoked mixed feelings….memories, and even anxiety. However, upon arriving and checking into Del and Judy’s place, I felt more at ease. Very inviting, comfortable, and clearly every detail had been thought out carefully. In the morning, when we met Del and Judy, it was like talking to old friends. Judy, surprised me with a county journal publication from the year I graduated from the local high school. Talk about an extra touch of walking down memory lane. It really meant so much.
Their place truly was one of the best places I’ve stayed and they, as the hosts, made it so special. I would whole heartedly recommend this place to anyone that is traveling to Klamath. The views were spectacular, the treats were appreciated, the wildlife was an added bonus. Extra claps for the Rooster. :O)

Del and Judy were as professional as hotel crew, they were as warm as friends and family. I'll come back again, again, and again.

The airbnb is an hour drive away from crater lake and the lava beds, which wasn’t bad at all especially since driving through the breathtaking beauty of the countryside was a lovely experience in itself. To top it all off, the stunning view we were greeted with straight from our room was the cherry on top. Our time here was so fantastic that we're seriously considering a return trip! For anyone considering a stay in the area, look no further. This place is a guaranteed 10/10, and we wholeheartedly recommend it. Thank you, Del & Judy, for an exceptional experience!

The amenities were exactly as listed, and main street is about 10-15 minutes away with sufficient food options, depending on how long your stay is. I felt so comfortable at Del & Judy's, and would absolutely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great find for the area. We used this space as a staging area to hike around Crater Lake, and it worked perfectly for that. If you're looking to vacation in the area or just passing through and don't want to deal with being in the middle of Klamath Falls, it's a great spot. While it's definitely a private space, you're within ten minutes of Klamath Falls' city center, and the view in the morning is unbeatable. The room is extraordinarily well-furnished with a fully stocked coffee nook, and Del and Judy are great hosts- we were were greeted to a blueberry muffin on arrival, making us feel right at home."

Stayed a few nights","Had a very comfortable stay. The area was beautiful and I could hear an owl near the house at night. The room was very warm and comfortable and had plenty of amenities to enjoy. I loved drinking tea and relaxing in the very comfortable bed that was provided. The one thing that could be improved would be a higher quality door between the airbnb space and the rest of the house. I could clearly hear the TV/conversation and dishes clanking next door which was unexpected. If there were a note in the listing about the noise traveling easily between the spaces then that would have been better (I did note that there were quiet hours that started at 10pm but a clearer note would be helpful). I was studying in the room in the evenings and luckily travel with a white noise machine, otherwise it would have been more of an issue. I do think a higher quality door would help to keep more of the noise out of the space. Thanks for the comfortable visit!"

We spent a night after a long drive, but would have loved to stay longer--the views are amazing, the bed was comfortable, the place was spotless, and there were so many thoughtful touches. It really felt like we had our own space, not like a room in someone's house. We didn't get to meet our hosts as we arrived late and left early, unfortunately, but they made check-in a breeze. We will definitely stay again when in the area!"

I wish we could have stayed longer and look forward to returning, maybe at a warmer time of year when the outdoor patio seating-and-scenery/wildlife-viewing-area can be a larger part of the experience! This airbnb rates an unqualified recommendation as a high-quality and excellent-value lodging option."

Stayed a few nights","I could live here. The house is well laid out, roomy, spacious for its size, comfortable - it flows nicely. The backyard is a private space, a great place to relax. The view out the front - the lake - is delightful, especially at sunset. It doesn’t feel like, “I can make this place work as a short-term rental.” Instead, it feels like a well-furnished home you just moved into.
It was hard to leave. It’s in a quiet neighborhood, easy access to the nearby parks, and a short drive to downtown spots. We had no issues at all with the house - everything worked, everything we needed, good lighting (which is surprisingly uncommon in rentals), TV was easy to work (again, not the norm), able to recycle, great showers, comfortable beds. Exceeded the expectations of all 4 of us. We felt lucky to stay there, and I looked like a genius for having booked it.
Should I stop raving now?"

The listing says that the house has AC but it is not central, they had 3 AC units that vent to the outside, so somewhat noisy and definitely not able to keep up with the heat wave. Did not keep large living space cool--very hot. House has a view of the lake but there is basically a boatyard with fencing around it between the house and the lake (this is shown in the pictures). Convenient to highways and downtown area."

The surrounding parks, wildlife refuges, and drives offer even more birding experiences. In short, this is a can't miss stay for the birding community - or for those who just want a pleasant home away from home. I will hope to return next spring."

The location’s view of the lake is only rivaled by the neighboring Harbor Isles, which means you’re really getting the full lakeside experience. Did I mention the proximity to the major trailheads or alternatively the movie theater? Actually, I’d like to mention that movie nights here were amazing. The flat screen and the sound bar were nice feature that reminded me of home, plus that view of the lake during the movie was awesome. We were blessed with 2 weeks, and without a doubt would recommend it to anyone."

The only very small downside was that you can't really walk right next to the lake without driving around it first. You can walk parallel for a bit but it's down the sidewalk in the residential neighborhood.
But we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend!"

It was wonderful to have this place to return to after 10 hour days looking for birds. The place is easy to find, spotlessly clean, and attractively decorated. It looks directly across the street to the lake so we had lovely sunset and sunrise views. The street it is on is very quiet. The kitchen is very well equipped with anything you might need. Since we wanted to get early starts in the morning, we appreciated having two bathrooms. We definitely will return to the area for more birding and photography and will absolutely book this place again. Two thumbs way up!"

There are lots of places to hang out - kitchen, dining area, living area, and the back yard where there is a great BBQ. The beds and linens are good quality and comfortable. The appliances appear to be new and work well. The overall feel is bright and homey and very comfortable. I highly recommend Erica's place and look forward to returning some day."

From the fresh ground coffee ready for us, to the views out the windows and the awesome sleigh style bed in the master bedroom, the furnishings were comfortable, clean, and classy. We showed our grandaughter around, a prospective student looking to attend Oregon Tech, using Erica's tips for food every day.
She was easy to get ahold of, and our stay at her place exactly how it was represented on line. Excellent! Thanks Erica"

We were in town to visit a sick relative and place was very cozy and perfect for visiting. I am a professional chef and the kitchen lacked nothing to make it easy to prepare meals. The entire place, including the outside, was spotless. I only had one chance to use the outdoor grill and I consider that a bonus. The property is only surpassed by the friendliness of the owners. Every question I had was answered promptly and completely. If I ever come back to Klamath Falls, I am going to make sure Valerie's place is available. I highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to enjoy a home atmosphere away from home."

The location is an hour from Crater Lake and 40 minutes away from Lava Beds National Monument in California; both great places to visit. There are also two wildlife refuges nearby.
I recommend cooking when you get to Valerie's place. There is a Fred Myer grocery store four minutes from the house, and her kitchen has all the supplies you need to make a nice home cooked meal.
The beds were comfy, and the living room has plenty of room for a family to watch something on tv together. We loved being here."

Valerie has thought of everything her guests might need, from kitchen supplies, a perfect coffee bar, a snack basket, washer and dryer with laundry pods, chilled mugs, a grill, and so much more. The location is on a busy road so it's a bit noisy, but is on a fenced lot set back a bit from the road, so that helps keep it from being too loud, and we weren'treally bothered by the noise. Valerie responded quickly to any questions we had. Nights were cold the week we were here and the furnace ran a lot, and was a bit loud, but we were very thankful for the warmth! We will definitely stay again when we return to visit family in Klamath Falls!"

There was even a spice rack. The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable. The heater worked great. I didn't have the occasion/need to use any A/C due to it being winter. There were plenty of towels for the bathroom. The shower heated up nicely and had great water pressure. Valerie communicated everything clearly from the beginning. She also messaged me the morning after the first night (at a reasonable hour) to check-in and make sure that everything was good. A main benefit for me was that it was really close to the family I was visiting. I would definitely rent from her again.

A steal of a deal! The sofa couch is more appropriate for a lightweight child. I think for adults, a nice air mattress would be more functional. It’s well worth the price though and really is a nice stay! Perfect to stay to go explore Klamath Falls and Oregon Tech. Thanks, Valerie!"

The kitchen had cooking items and utensils - everything you could need for meals (even a blender, rice cooker, crockpot - seriously, EVERYTHING). The olive oil was basically empty and we were going to replace it but a new one was provided right away. I had an early morning event on campus and Valerie brought over an ice scraper for my windshield since the parking provided is outdoors. Beds, couches, blankets, and pillows were all comfy and clean. To top it off, we even got to see some deer hopping through the snow. It was a great time!"

They communicated with us prior to our trek to their Airbnb, providing us information about possible road closures and alternates routes to take, and communicated with us to ensure our stay are comfortable. The Airbnb location is located in a residential area that feels safe and close to major shopping/eatery centers. Check in/check out was a breeze. Their clean home has multiple comfort amenities that one could call it their second home (ie washer/dryer, a kitchen stocked with amenities that would allow a family to make homemade meals, awesome supply of coffees, full size fridge, a BBQ grill, play area for kids, and most important, comfortable beds for a restful sleep). I definitely would recommend their place."

The neighborhood is quiet, there is some noise from the nearby road, mostly noticeable in the living room in the morning.

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay in Klamath Falls while we visited Crater Lake N.P. It was about a 60 minute drive to Crater Lake, but it was no problem. The house itself was a little hard to pick out from the road (every time we came back from the park or the store we would be saying to ourselves ""now which one is it?"", but that might just be us. The house itself was very convenient to the main drag and to big grocery stores and other forms of civilization. We ate all our meals at home so I cannot speak for the presence or quality of nearby restaurants -- it just wasn't on our radar.
Entry and exit via the keypad on the front door was easy. The book containing description of amenities was very clear (lots of photos) and the house rules and check-out requirements were minimal and sensible. Valerie provides some bottled water and snacks for her guests, which was a nice touch. She had plenty of pots and pans and cooking necessities. The gas grill was clean, relatively new, and easy to operate.
The house was clean and had two window-unit type air conditioners running when we got there. The temp outside was near 90, but I was a little too cool while sitting and watching the TV (in short, the A/C works!). The beds were comfortable and quiet - we had a couple in the main room, one in the second bedroom and one on the sofa bed. No complaints from anyone. The neighborhood was also quiet - no issues there.
There was one bathroom in the home that everyone shared and it was fine. Towels were soft and of good quality. Water pressure wasn't great from the sinks, but the shower was fine.
All in all, this is a great place to stay if you are in the Klamath Falls area. Highly recommended!"

Valerie is a great communicator and is prompt at responding. I fully agree with others who recommend to not be put off by this property being a trailer. The pride and attention to detail that Valerie takes is evident in her property. We did not find the road to be that ""busy,"" except for a short time in the morning and for a short time in the early evening. We look forward to staying here again on our next visit to Klamath Falls."

We had everything we needed for a nice weekend away and since it's centrally located in Klamath Falls it's very easy to get around town. The place is clean, cozy, and warm which was perfect since we stayed in the middle of winter and had all the little extra amenities you would need to make it feel like home away from home.
It is located on a busy road but both the bedrooms are in the back so you don't hear much road noise plus there is a huge front and back yard. Plenty of parking and the property was kept up nicely so when we arrived the driveway and walkway was clear of snow. Super nice touch!"

The house/guide book was very detailed with everything you need to know about the home and the area. Valerie's responses were timely. When I booked, I had inquired about the weather (thinking that there could be some snow). She let me know what she thought the weather would be and then without me asking, she was kind enough to give me an update on the weather a few days before our arrival. Now that's service, with a capital S. This is a perfect location for visiting Crater Lake National Park and exploring the quaint town of Klamath Falls. We would definitely book Valerie's place again."

We appreciated the water bottles and snacks laid out for us, and were amazed by the binder with very clear instructions and pictures of everything in the house we could possibly want to know about. The house was very close to many amenities in Klamath Falls, including a Fred Meyer and a great Thai place called Thai Orchid Cafe (where we got takeout). We also enjoyed talking to the next door neighbors who were very sweet. If you stay here, you won't be disappointed!"

There are lots of little touches that show the thoughtfulness of the host like glasses chilling in the fridge, to-go cups for my coffee, lamps with USB plugs so I don’t have to dig for an outlet, etc. This is the first place I check for availability when I’m going through Klamath Falls."

It was a 100 degree day when we were there and there was an AC in the living room and one in each of the bedrooms. When we walked in the place was perfectly cool! It had all the amenities and everything you could need. The coffee “bar” was such a thoughtful touch, lots of snacks, all the utensils and cookware you could need. Very clean too! WiFi info was easily accessible, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime etc on the TV. Pack & play with sheets for our toddler and she offered us a high chair too. Every detail was covered right down to frosty mugs in the freezer for a beer at the end of a long hot day! We would absolutely stay here again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place to anyone traveling to Klamath Falls!"

-The place was very clean, pristine and had all the amenities we could have possibly needed. It was very spacious too, nice tub and water pressure.
-Super comfy bed, great wifi, and awesome to have a washer/dryer right in the unit
-Best of all was the location! You are just a quick walk to cute little the downtown area, which has lots of cute shops, restaurants and bars. We would absolutely love to stay here the next time we're in Klamath Falls! 11/10!!!"

Only downside was lack of kitchen supplies for cooking meals, like large bowl and cooking pot, measuring cups and spoons. Would stay again."

Stayed one night","Perfect place to stay when visiting Klamath Fall, Oregon. Clean, cozy and great amenities. Bed was beyond comfortable and a very spacious home. Convenient location and more than accommodating parking. I felt right at home immediately and greatly appreciated how quiet the neighborhood is. Warmth and relaxation across the board. This airBnB is wonderful and a great host from the moment I booked my stay to the time I checked out, and beyond.
Can’t recommend enough. I visit family here and I’ll definitely be back."

When we arrived, the house was very accurate to its description. The home was perfect for two people (we only used one of the two rooms). The jack-and-jill bathroom attached both rooms, and is on the smaller side. It wasn't an issue for my girlfriend and I. The kitchen was well stocked with items to make food, and the laundry room is a huge bonus. Thank you for the amazing stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Cascadia Cottage is a comfortable place to stay. I especially appreciated the black-out curtains and the peaceful quiet of the neighborhood. Though the weather was chilly outside, the house was cozy inside and the heat was easy to adjust. I also appreciate that this Airbnb is hosted by an individual person (not a property management company), and that Luke takes the time to communicate on a personal level. As he mentioned below, the TV is brand-new, and Luke generously offers access to Netflix, Hulu, HBOMax, etc. All in all, the home is a great value, and it was a nice and easy place to stay while in Klamath.
p.s. If you're a swimmer, the Ella Redkey pool is nearby. It's a large, outdoor pool heated with geothermal energy, and it's open year-round. Swimming laps in the morning with the steam rising off the water is pretty awesome."

A big thank you to Luke for making our stay so enjoyable and we hope to be back!"

Stayed one night","This is a nice place to stay in Klamath Falls, and Luke was very responsive. Descriptions are all accurate, there was plenty of space for two people, and there were lots of extra details that travelers can appreciate (such as toiletries and kitchen essentials provided if needed). Heat works well, and there is good hot water and water pressure. The furniture is functional and laid out well for the space. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, but it wouldn't stop us from staying there again if we were in the area. Good internet. The living room TV was temporarily down, but that didn't make a difference to us during our short stay (there's a small one in the twin bedroom if this is important to you and it's still unavailable). We appreciated the easy parking, the easy check in, and there being very few steps to climb with our bags since we got in late and were tired from traveling all day. This was also a much better value than the hotel options available for the weekend."

The house was remarkably clean, all of the amenities were top notch, and it’s a quiet, safe location for all ages. I didn’t bring my whole family, but I have five kids all ages and this house would have been lovely for a family. I was really impressed that the kitchen had sharp knives (never had that before) and very functional kitchen utensils and high end appliances. I appreciate that as a family who usually does all their cooking at their airbnb. I often bring some of my own knives and things I utilize often in the kitchen, and it wouldn’t be necessary here. Great job providing for your guests! Thank you"

Stayed with a pet","Larrysa is such a great host! She was able to accommodate our early check in, and was so helpful when our dog got out of the yard while we were out. She is responsive, and great to work with. We were there for a wedding, and all six of us felt that we had plenty of space with the generous sized rooms, and were appreciative of the different amenities. We would recommend Laryssa any day, and we all very much enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with a pet",I couldn’t say anything but positive things about Larrysa’s home. It was home away from home. Never have felt so wonderful at an Airbnb honestly looking forward to coming back sooner then I thought. Larrysa went out of her way to make sure everything needed is available even went out of her way to drop off supplies to start a fire in the firepit. The backyard is beyond words my pups loved more than anything. Definitely will be staying here again

I have two young kids and it had an extra room that was great for playtime! The backyard would be perfect for a pet. It was just what we needed for the time we were there. It gave their own space to everyone, including a Roku TV in every room which was sooo nice, especially with kids. Larrysa was very friendly and always replied in record time! I would stay again! :)"

The spare room is set up for kids to play in with toys and books. The back yard with a fire pit was spacious and the fence is good. Larrysa was proactive and sent messages before I needed them with check-in/checkout information. The house was available early for check-in, and they have extra goodies in the kitchen. The location is about 15 mins from OIT which was perfect for our visit. We will use this house again in the future for visits if it is available. Thank You!!"

Stayed with kids","Larrysa was a great host, the kids toy room & the popcorn and drinks in the fridge were the little details that make your stay feel like your own home! The house was clean, and the neighborhood was quiet. Easy to check in as well! Larrysas place was accurately described on Airbnb, no surprises which helps ease travel. The master bedroom bed was very soft and seemed to dip toward the middle, which isn’t a con just not my personal favorite so I traded with the kids. There were three bedrooms to choose from so you had ample options. Thank you Larrysa for hosting us!"

Stayed with a pet","Laryssa was a fantastic host. She was very communicative and sweet, always offering help and insights. It was very apparent that she sincerely wanted us to have a comfortable stay! She accommodated us in a pinch, during the holidays, which was amazing of her! Some notable things from our stay include: it was fairly wheelchair friendly with wide hallways, an open floor plan, and wide bathroom sink entrance. It was also great having a full kitchen with pots and pans, food storage containers, and a full set of spices, as well as full laundry facilities with detergents included, a fenced in backyard for our pup, adjustable air and heat with Nest, and 3 beds to choose from! Which felt very “Goldie Locks & the Three Bears” esque as one was firm, one was soft, and one was right in the middle! This place was perfect for what we needed for the time and again, Laryssa was great!"
