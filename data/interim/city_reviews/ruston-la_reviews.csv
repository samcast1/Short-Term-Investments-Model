Stayed one night","This place is amazing and I don't think words can adequately describe it. I am so surprised we could even get a reservation because it is so fantastic. We only stayed one night but it was so cozy, and comfortable. It was quiet and so relaxing. Super clean and had everything we needed and more. Lights on when we arrived late. Muffins in the freezer for breakfast. The ambiance, character and simple charm is beyond description. The communications was over the top and all the time we were there we felt so welcomed. Sharon allowed a late check out which we really appreciated because we had arrived late and our old tired bones sometimes don't get going to quick anymore after a short night. Just can't say enough about how enjoyable this stay was for us. If you have never experienced staying in a ""dog trot"" cabin (that is what I call it), you should most certainly check this one out. It is truly a nice place to stay and visit."

We enjoyed the quiet surroundings and sat on our front porch every evening watching the fire flies dancing in the dark! Thanks for preserving a little bit of history and sharing it with the rest of us. Sharon kept in touch throughout our stay to see if we needed anything and it was such a pleasure meeting her before we left. Hoping to make it back there soon and will definitely stay at Ellie’s Place!"

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed at several Airbnb homes and this was by far the BEST one EVER. It was super clean, cozy and Sharon made sure every need she thought we might have was taken care of before we ever checked in. The linens were fresh and clean. The bed was very comfortable. We were there for my daughters wedding so I didnt have the time to sit on the porch in the rocking chairs and take in the beautiful wooded scenery! But next time I will for sure! Its in a perfect location…tucked away so it was private and peaceful but just a short 10 min drive to all kinds of restaurants and things to do. Also I have to mention all of the personal family heirlooms Sharon has in the house made it an extra special place to stay! LOVED IT!"

The room was decorated beautifully and I do plan on returning as I am seeking to attend graduate school at ULM. Sharon and her husband were so friendly and kind, the little extras and attention to detail were my favorite! The bed was super comfortable and clean and the bathroom and tub were perfect and clean as well. The access to the gathering room was great because I could use the bigger fridge for items that wouldn't fit in the small fridge in the room. I didn't use the tv but it was a great size and If I had wanted to use it I'm sure I would have been satisfied as well. Can't wait to come back!!"

Stayed one night","""Ellie's Place"" is the most quintessentially Southern experience I have ever had at an Airbnb. Sharon is the most delightful host - she went above and beyond my expectations. The home itself is an absolute beauty and harkens to a much simpler time whilst also being modern and convenient. Great WiFi and streaming TV, fantastic lighting, and a gorgeous bath! The furnishings are beautiful and the home is clean and spotless. I slept SO soundly that night, and woke to find breakfast in the fridge and plenty of coffee pods! If you value quiet time and privacy as much as I do, trust me, this is the place to stay. I highly recommend!"

Stayed one night",My husband and I stayed here one night on a trip across the south. This Dog Trot is such a fantastic experience! Not far from the interstate and close to restaurants (we ate at Flying Burger and Seafood - YUM!) and the Tech campus - but feels like a quiet spot in the country - trees and wildlife abound! The hosts' hospitality is evident everywhere - the Dog Trot is beautifully decorated and full of modern comforts while still maintaining the historic Dog Trot vibe. The place is sparkling clean and the A/C blows cold! Book it while you can -- you'll be glad you did!

Stayed a few nights","I'm not really sure where to start! The friendliness and hospitality of Sharon and Ralph are the reason we are hooked on AIR BNB instead of spending our $$ on motels! It's so obvious the love and care they have put into this cool little cabin and have decided to share their slice of heaven with all of us. The entire place is perfect: comfortable bed, plenty of hot water and great shower/tub (with bath salts), inviting outdoor spaces, antiques galore (with love), fluffy towels that smell great, little snacks, fresh fruit, coffee, bottled water, and CHOCOLATE !! Oh .. did I mention antiques that just make you feel good all over? The fact they have ""saved"" this bit of history by not destroying this cabin is really cool. We are used to staying in places with a kitchen; however, on our short 2 days stay, the microwave and refrigerator worked out just fine. If we are ever back in the Ruston area, I won't look anywhere else ... just hope it's available! I promise you will not regret booking with these guys!"

Stayed a few nights","Great new place to stay in Ruston. This place is safe, quiet, and very clean.
The place is called a dog trot. I will not call it quaint or rustic; I call it historic and a style from by gone days.
The building is separate from any other building. The owners live across the drive about 200 feet away. Easy to get in touch with if you have any questions or problems. But far enough away for privacy.
While it is on the outskirts of Ruston, it is within 2 minutes of a gas station/ convenience store. Just past the station is a great donut shop and a Dollar store. You do not have to go into Ruston if you don’t want to.
If you are there for a Ruston event, it is located about 5 minutes the other way and it is an easy drive into town.
Back to the dog trot. The building’s exterior appears to be original construction. It has a front and back porch with decent views. While you are facing the owners house, the view to the left overlooks a nice pasture with the possibility of seeing deer. The back porch faces a wooded area and you can see some houses in the distance . The houses are far enough away not to be a noise or privacy issue. The interior is updated but retains realistic construction of the original house. Wooden floors and ceiling in the bedroom and the room across the dog trot breeze way. The bathroom has wood styled linoleum floor with original walls. But the fixtures are modern the tub and shower got me in trouble with my wife. (I am going to have to get a shower like the dog trot.) The bathroom is bigger and better than most hotels we have stayed at.
There is also a walking trail on the property if you are so inclined.
Even more important is that the property is private and will not have the general traffic of a hotel. The area is very safe and secure. (If Covid is a concern for you, this is an ideal place.)
Sharon, one of the owners met us on arrival and showed us everything about the property. She was very friendly and helpful.
Personally, my wife and I live in the country with only one neighbor. This place is just as quiet. If you are looking for a quiet, clean, convenient place to stay in Ruston this is it.
We have 3 grandsons attending La. Tech so we are frequent visitors to Ruston. This is our new and favorite place to stay."

The attention to detail in the design and decor of the space was remarkable. Every corner had its own unique touch, creating an atmosphere that felt both cozy and luxurious. The bed was incredibly comfortable, guaranteeing a peaceful night's sleep after a busy day.
However, what truly made our stay unforgettable was the exceptional hospitality of our host, Brandon. From the initial communication to the final text upon checking out, he went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction.
In summary, this Airbnb experience surpassed all our expectations. The perfect place combined with the wonderful host made our stay truly exceptional."

The bed was the most comfortable we have experienced in all our AirBnB stays and the added bonus of beautiful wide open windows to look out on downtown Ruston was a nice touch. A little bit of New York feel in north Louisiana. We didn't use the kitchen much, but ordered delivery from several area restaurants. We played pool, watched some Apple TV and caught up on reading. Fabulous coffee shop diagonally across the street and the downtown area was a wonderful place to walk. Absolutely loved our stay!"

I enjoyed walking to local shops and restaurants and having a place that felt like home away from our Texas home (especially appreciated the air conditioning just like home). I was able to visit, cook and entertain with friends as we had plenty of space to sit, relax and play a few games of pool! Our friends are LA Tech football players and this is THE BEST game day/weekend place they could imagine for their families to get together!
When we had any questions whatsoever, Brandon was very helpful with quick responses and southern hospitality. I can't wait to visit again - we will definitely book Brandon's place every time!

My son was moving cross country and needed a safe place to stay for one night. I made the reservation same day and the hosts accommodated him immediately. It was a quick stay as he needed to get on the road quickly. The hosts were so kind and we hope they become a Superhost as that is what they are."

Check in could not have been easier or more clear. There is no TV if that is something you require, but we don’t watch tv so we didn’t miss it at all!

My hosts couldn’t have been more warm and accommodating, but also very respectful of my need for privacy and rest.

The location is secluded and quite yet not far from the LA Tech campus or whatever you would like to do while in Ruston. The hosts are super friendly and great communicators. While I was not there for a long period of time, the stay was great, and the space was exactly what I needed. I will certainly consider staying here again whenever I have an overnight in Ruston."

Stayed a few nights","Ashley & David were a great family of hosts! They communicated well when we had questions or concerns, they checked in on us periodically, and we even got to meet one of their friendly toddlers. This was the perfect place to stay while visiting family in town as we’d never used AirBnb while visiting home before. A pleasant surprise indeed. It was raining for the majority of the stay so the humidity did attract a few flying bugs inside, but nothing their cool running AC couldn’t fix."

Stayed one night","Cozy, clean, comfy, and all around lovely. This was a stopover for us while driving from Georgia to South of Houston, Tx. Room is plenty big for two people with a comfortable bed, great bedding, bathroom with shower (shower is a little small. For instance, no way I could’ve shaved my legs in there.) but more than adequate for getting clean. Everything was SPOTLESS. I would definitely stay here again while passing through. For a longer stay I’d want a bit more room to stretch out. But this was perfect for our needs and a price that beat local hotels. Also- the yard is GORGEOUS. I’m a birder and spent the morning identifying hawks, woodpeckers, and more on the property."

The cottage has a shiplap ceiling that makes it feel very inviting. Everything was so clean and convenient! I will definitely be looking to stay again when I am passing through the area."

That was the moment I knew we chose the right place. The cottage is 100% cozy. It had everything we needed for our short stay.

It is at the edge of a smaller town commercial area, which pretty much shuts down in the evening, so it was very quiet at night. It is a few blocks from train tracks, so we did hear a train or two in the evening. If any came through late at night, we didn't wake up to them. We would definitely return if in the Ruston area again."

The exterior and interior are so well decorated that we actually took some family photos and they turned out like a professional photo shoot. Even though the property is located in an urban setting, we enjoyed the piece and quiet. The bed was so comfortable we had a difficult time getting out of it in the morning. LOL!

Speaking of LA Tech, the house is conveniently located near the campus, making our commutes incredibly easy and stress-free.
Cleanliness was top-notch. From the sparkling bathrooms to dust-free surfaces, it's evident that the hosts prioritize a clean environment.
Amenities were well-thought-out; the fully-equipped kitchen allowed us to cook meals just like at home, and the basket of travel-sized toiletries was a considerate touch.
Lastly, the hosts were very friendly, offering useful local tips and ensuring we had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Their hospitality enhanced our experience, making it one we're eager to repeat. Highly recommended!"

From sunscreen wipes to tic tacs, coffee, and snacks, all of your needs are covered. The area itself was spacious and spotless. Items were easy to find thanks to labels, and there were more than enough towels, spare linens, and blankets. The location is great, with many walkable destinations, but feels private at the same time. We originally booked this stay as a quick stopover at the end of a long road trip, but we were so impressed that we’re planning to come back for a longer stay in the future.

The suite itself is so nice and taken care of, with a large kitchen and a Kehrig with plenty of pods to choose from. We appreciated having water bottles in the fridge and little snacks on the counter. And the extra blankets and pillows were also highly appreciated! In the morning, we enjoyed going to the Railway Cafe for some coffee and breakfast. It was the perfect place to stay for a night, but so comfortable we wish we could’ve stayed even longer :)"

Stayed a few nights","I hesitate to write this review because I’m not sure I want everyone to become aware of this secret gem, but I can’t to Brent like that, so I’m writing it. In all honesty this little house is the perfect place to retreat and relax. It is secluded, but in the center of a community. You are surrounded by lush trees and nature, and ambiance is magical. I enjoy getting up in the morning, sitting outside and just listening to the sound of peace all around me. The location is great,. There are stores and restaurants in the immediate area, so even though it feels like your far away communing with nature, you can drive down a hill an interact within the city. Brent, who is your host, is absolutely wonderful. He is attentive, professional, and accessible. This is the only Airbnb I have ever booked. I normally prefer hotels because I like the amenities like cleaning and room service, the spa, and concierge, but when I head to Ruston, Grambling, or Monroe, Louisiana, I stay at the Cedar Lounge and I love every moment of it."

It is located perfectly in Ruston for us to attend the complex, shopping and many great places to eat. It was very clean and spacious. Anyone traveling for work this place would be perfect, it has a desk area w/printer available for your use and great wifi connection. Those who love to cook more, eat out less .. this kitchen came equipped with anything and everything you'd need to do so. Although, the bathroom is small the quality showerhead is amazing. It was like having a mini massage at shower time. It was perfect after long days in the heat watching ball. The pool was lovely! It is well maintained, convenient and we enjoyed the relaxing warm water for night swims after games, daytime shopping and exploring the area. Easy access & has ample parking if needed. I recommend this cute little place to anyone wanting an comfy, like home alternative stay to a hotel when visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights",Our stay here was phenomenal! Sarah went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could ask for our stay. The house is clean and looks exactly like the photos. We were pleased to discover that we were within 10 minutes of everywhere that we wanted to go. We stayed here for baseball games at J.C. Love field and it was only 5 minutes away! Check in was very easy and as soon as we walked in we were welcomed with a snack basket and additional items that help make you feel right at home! Everything was perfect and we couldn’t have had a better experience! I highly recommend this home for your next stay to Ruston and if I am in the area again I will definitely be staying here!

Stayed with kids","We couldn't have asked for a better location. We were in town for the World Series and were less than a minute from Ruston Sportsplex. Upon check in we realized the grass was extremely high and we were unable to practice in the yard due to that. I let Gabrielle know and within a couple hours someone was there cutting the grass. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. The cleaning could be better. We found some very long fake nails that someone had popped off and left sitting in the living room on the table under the tv in plain sight. Obviously the table wasn't wiped off because there's no way someone could miss that. We washed the sheets before we slept in them because there was hair and all on them. In all, I loved the house and location just wish someone had taken more time cleaning the house and also making sure the yard was ready for someone to check in. That's why I gave 4/5 stars."

We were only in town for a night, so we didn’t spend much time there, but spent a relaxing afternoon and evening snuggled up on their comfy couch reading and watching TV. We were at the end of weeks of traveling cross country to see our children, and it was wonderful to have a cozy and immaculately clean place to lay our heads for the night. We hope to stay again when traveling north in a few months. Highly recommend."

Great communication and easy checkin was the cherry on top."

We did have a frustrating delay with accessing the house d/t the door code not being sent to us prior to our arrival. We arrived about 5pm and had to call several times before getting a response with the door code. Also the bathtub in the bedroom was slow draining, Kim was made aware and stated she'd send a plumber.
Would certainly stay again if we come back to Ruston/Grambling."

The home was very cozy and relaxing either watching the sun come up while have a cup of joe on the back porch or sitting on the couch watching any and every streaming service. My only complaint is I was only there for 2 days. We have an office in Monroe and we sometimes play baseball in the area. I will be sure to book this spot again!!

Stayed a few nights","I had a great experience at Rachel’s condo, and I felt like I was at home. It is centrally located to everything in Ruston and it is nestled in a quiet neighborhood. Most of the residents are LA Tech students.
I have four cosmetic complaints: 1) all of the white towels and wash cloths in the bathroom were dingy and some even had tiny curly hairs on them; 2) the toilet seats had crud on them; 3) there was a big ball of hair nestled in the bathroom corner, and 4) the white couch was beautiful, but I was afraid to sit on it because it had visible dark stains.
Again, the property is beautiful and well appointed. I would also like to point out that the mattress was comfortable and I slept like a baby each night!
In spite of my negative comments, I will definitely reserve Rachel’s condo again when I visit family members in North Louisiana, and you should too!"

The surrounding is very peaceful, close to restaurants as well as shopping areas. The bed was very comfortable, I usually leave with back pain after being away from home, but not this visit. Rachel was very responsive to us and met our needs when we arrived earlier than planned due to a change in our flights due to inclement weather conditions. I’d stay here again when we’re back in town."
