Stayed a few nights","Rita and i were nicely surprised with the beautiful room. The tile in the kitchen, the beautiful floor, and the nicely painted wall. Very clean, we felt right at home upon opening the door to our room. We found the kitchen very user-friendly. We really felt very comfortable in our room. One item that the hosts may consider is a full-length mirror. Since we were going out for the evening, it would have been nice to glance
into a mirror to check out how we looked. Great job Lou and family. We met Lou's daughter and she told us
that working on that room was a family affair. Thumbs up from The Badgers."

Stayed over a week",It’s easy to get a good review when everything goes as planned but earning a good review when unexpected things come up is harder. Lou and her husband earned this review. During my extended stay a couple of things came up that were completely out of the owners control. Everyone was quick to find solutions and very effectively communicated. I would absolutely recommend and stay here again.

I was in town working, so I had to come and go at all hours. I never felt unsafe leaving at 3am, and felt assured with the cameras that Lou has out. I had plenty of room to spread out. One bonus that I really appreciated, the laundry facility is right across the hall."

Stayed over a week","The only reason I gave it a 4 in one area was because the house is less than a city block from a train track where at least 4 trains pass from 10 pm to 5am—probably more during the day, but we weren’t there during the day or wouldn’t have cared. We would have brought earplugs if we had known. We stayed 10 nights or so and got used to it, but laughed it was a little like the running joke in the movie “My Cousin Vinnie.”
The river walk was near by as was the Lumber Museum. Several terrific restaurants: Rastrelli’s, Great Revival Brewery, Candlelight, plus 392 Coffee Cafe, and Homers. Oh, and just 10 minutes across the river in Fulton was not to be missed Krumpets Bakery and Cafe. We ate well.
A great find in Clinton. I’d go back. And having excellent laundry facilities was a plus. Danae anticipated guests needs. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing experience! The house was a little smaller than the photos might seem, but these don't do the place justice.
A wonderful place, the house spotless and perfect for two people. Everything was totally clean, and it had everything you could possibly need: towels, blankets, sheets, kitchen stuff, TV, even coffee and shampoo if you forget. It was just all complete, even a vacuum just in case. The ad said it didn't include hot water, but it does. The fact of not having wifi just made it an even better getaway.
The super quiet area, the views are something we will never forget. In the area you could walk 10 minutes to one of the best restaurants we have ever been.
The spotless place, the awesome house, and no problems at all. There was not much communication with the owners, but it was all windy and questions about the app answered them in a reasonable time.
We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Location, location, location. The western wall of this one room, one bath home is floor to ceiling windows looking out on the backwater of the Mississippi. Geese, seagulls, fresh water pelicans, doves, chipmunks, squirrels and the daily (but brief) flyby of an eagle drew us back to this gem. The hot water is abundant and the stocked kitchen make it easy to make up for the limited restaurants for dinner. The bedding, however, may prevent us from returning. (What's the benefit of this serene setting if you are too uncomfortable at night to sleep?) There is one full size mattress that is too soft, and one futon that is too firm (I felt the slats in the frame).
We bring our own water out of habit. We brought our own lighting source for a fire, which we learned the next day there was a warning against fires the night before... so check the Internet before having a bonfire.
While the home does not have Wi-Fi, a plus for us urbanites who wanted to unplug, we had ample Verizon reception."

Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly what I needed for a few days of peace with a great view, including a couple bald eagles soaring past along the riverfront, and beautiful sunsets. It had everything I needed for comfort and rest. The place was clean and un-cluttered. Only one minor issue that did not affect me, the pictures of the living area need updating, the furniture is not exactly as in the photos. There are not two couches, it's a comfy chair (facing river) and a couch/bed along north wall. Not a big deal for me but if you're planning to take 4 people, there are not 4 comfortable places to sit."

The cabin was clean and functional. This is the perfect spot. Bring bug spray or citronella candles…if you enjoy the deck you’ll need those. I absolutely love that we can bring our family dog. She loves it there too. :)
Note: Before arriving we ordered groceries from HyVee in Clinton IA they delivered right to the door. For one of the nights- Manny’s Pizza in Savanna delivered pizza and tacos.
Thank you! We will definitely be back again."

Stayed one night","The cabin was cute and cozy, very quiet and peaceful area. Beautiful location to watch the sunset. There was a meteor shower and it was beautiful to sit and watch next to the small campfire. We did walk down to the dock to sit and watch it as well. The deck, morning coffee, and wildlife was perfect. The only heads up I would give to other folks is the dock is a shared dock which means folks may come through to use it. I can see where they have done their best to mark a path for other folks to come through, but it was different to have someone walk through unexpected. The other people were friendly and polite so it was a non issue, just unexpected. I would recommend this location with 10 stars if I could. I cannot express enough the breath taking views. Thank you for a great stay."

On the plus side it was very bright with a wall of windows looking out on a beautiful view of the river, sunsets, and waterfowl. It could use some touch up paint but was clean and mostly quiet (a few loud boats and fireworks?), and smaller than the photos looked… like a studio apartment."

Stayed with a pet","Our third time staying in their cozy cabin, while the other two we also enjoyed a lot as well and were in the dead of winter. Our first time now in summer, and the hottest days so far this year, but the cabin kept us cool, with the most spectacular views of river life in season. Bird watchers paradise all year! Egrets, sandpipers, Canadian geese, and even a snowey owl flew by for this summer little getaway. We had regular American white pelicans keep us company the entire time too. Literally hung out in the water right in front of the house. We named them Pete and Polly. If you’re staying there soon, make sure and watch for them! And bring your binocs for added viewing. If you’re looking for a place to just chill and observe the water and wildlife out the windowed front of the cozy little house, this is the place. It’s just peace and calm. As always Julia, thank you for opening up your cabin, and sharing the beauty that surrounds it with those of us who wouldn’t have that, otherwise."

Stayed with kids","Julia's place is a small, one room house with a bathroom. There's enough room though for what you need, you're noot tripping over anything. We enjoyed our stay very much! The deck was a wonderful place for a cup of coffee in the morning, there was so much wildlife to view! Galena was close by and so was Apple River Canyon. We went fishing and just truly enjoyed the peace and quiet. If you want a place to get away whete you can relax, this is it."

It was a very quiet little neighborhood and if I’m ever in the area again I wouldn't hesitate to book this place a second time. it’s a nice little spot for a weekend get away if you’re not far from the area.

Stayed a few nights","I stayed in this cabin for 3 nights, the location makes up for a lot. The views are stunning. The cabin is clean and has everything you need for a short trip, though furnishings could use an update. I unfortunately found the bed quite uncomfortable and small (I am 5'1'', so I don't think tall people will have a great time, especially if there are two of them). I decided to sleep on the couch, which was more comfortable. Price is totally fair for 2+ people. I didn't spend much time in the cabin otherwise and did not use the kitchen.
Check-in was flexible and uncomplicated."

Stayed a few nights","Booked Julia’s place for a Valentine’s Day weekend getaway with my girlfriend. The house was cozy and clean. I appreciated how the driveway was lit up at night. But the best part was the front porch with expansive views of the Mississippi River. Every day, we saw eagles soar by. There was some drama, too! A couple young squirrels were scampering up and down trees near where an eagle had perched. I thought for sure one of those little squirrels was a goner. The previous day we had seen a hawk just as it scooped up a bunny. Circle of Life on full display here! The squirrels seemed to have escaped the attention of the eagle. Or maybe the eagle was already full. There’s a spot nearby - on the Iowa side of the bridge in the photos - where we saw dozens of eagles. That was very cool."

We were surprised how much wildlife was active on the mostly frozen river -- we watched the sunset from inside both nights.

Beautiful sunsets... didn't have to leave for wildlife viewing- EAGLES, crows, geese, woodpeckers etc lazily enjoyed from comfy couch or recliner. We would have been on the large deck or yard area with fire pit, but weather was not ideal. 18 degrees and windy! Floor to ceiling windows were amazing! Hope to book again soon!"

Stayed a few nights",The property was larger then we expected which was great. The Master Bedroom on the 2nd floor was larger than we expected along with the master bathroom. The master bath shower did not have as much water pressure as we would have liked but it is a cabin. Internet was good and fast. The view of the Mississippi River was amazing and great to watch it flow by as we drank a cup of coffee. Check out was simple and quick. It was nice to not have TVs in any of the bedrooms. The master bedroom mattress was very firm and we slept well. Would like to use this property in the future to bring some of our adult children and spouses with us. Great place to stay. Would definitely recommend to others.

Stayed a few nights","Amazing stay! Very spacious, clean and bright! Perfect home for a girls weekend with the winery just up the road! We enjoyed our complementary bottle of wine on the deck and also the complementary wine tasting at the winery.
Beautiful view on the deck overlooking the Mississippi River! We were fortunate to have great weather in November, and sat out on the deck for a while, enjoying some wine and music. We even saw a deer outside the back door while fixing breakfast one morning!
A couple tidbits. If you go during the winter months, be sure to bring a four-wheel-drive vehicle just in case there is snow. You are in a country setting. There will be some small bugs in the fall months…as again you are in the country and in a wooded setting. Its to be expected. I am from the country, so I completely understand how it is!
Overall amazing experience and comfortable place to stay! Highly recommend! ❤️"

Stayed with kids","The house was fine. Just not worth the cost. It isn't super fancy or up to date. Dishwasher is old and loud. Lots of boxelder bugs on the outside of the house and some were in. Was nice having 2 bathrooms, place was clean, dishes, plates and silverware were all in a closet in the kitchen we over looked the first day. We thought they would be in the kitchen cabinets or pull out drawers so at first I didn't think they had any. Our mistake not theirs but I just didn't see those doors to look in the first night. The driveway is VERY steep and the road leading to the place looks more like a driveway then a road but it was not hard to get to. I have stayed at nicer places for a lot cheaper. Was not a bad place to stay in my opinion just way over priced for what you get."

The house has multiple seating options inside and outside. So plenty of options for reading, relaxing, and drinking wine. Off the kitchen is an awesome space with a table and lots of sun. We did puzzles in there and went onto the deck from there. A great find and a really relaxing getaway. Wine is very good too!
One note, the driveway is steep and the airbnb is technically on the second floor (first floor is garage). Just want those with mobility needs to be aware. You’ll need to climb stairs up to airbnb from garage or go up stairs outside to the side of the house. Once inside main floor, no stairs."

Stayed with a pet","We were very happy with our stay at Cecilia’s home. While it was just myself, my husband and our dog, there is plenty of room for a larger family, and two bathrooms is a huge plus. The main bedroom was much larger than it appears in the photos. It had two closets with plenty of room to hang clothing and store luggage out of the way. There is also a dresser which is a convenient space to lay jewelry, toiletries, and other smaller items. Bathrooms are updated, and were very clean.
Our trip was in July, and the weather was very steamy, so we didn’t spend too much time outside at the house, but the view of the river is awesome, and the grassy backyard is great for taking out your pets.
After asking, we were allowed to park in the garage, which was much appreciated and made loading our vehicle much easier.
Cecelia asked for our preference in wine, and left a complimentary bottle in the fridge. This extra touch was so nice. We would definitely stay again, but bring more family next time!"

Stayed with a pet","This house is located in a beautiful setting right next to the Mississippi. The bathrooms are nicely updated, and the bedrooms are just as described/pictured. The TV is a smart TV. The internet isn't super fast, but my husband was able to have a couple of Zoom calls, and we were able to stream several shows on the TV. We found the kitchen to be fairly well stocked. A few notes: 1) There is a train track between the house and the river. If you have the windows open, the engines are somewhat loud. Other than that, the trains are mostly background noise. 2) The winery is up the hill from the house, so there is sporadic traffic going by in front of the house. 3) The property owner has a dog that may stop by. She's very friendly, but she's high energy, so she might be a bit much at first. We only saw her once in four days. 4) The living area is all on the top level, so be prepared to cart all of your stuff up a flight of steps. 5) You are on a river, so be prepared for bugs."

And the winery is just above the inn on the bluff."

Group trip","My family has stayed at the River Lodge two years in a row now. We book for three days and usually have 6-8 people. We find the lodge spacious, very clean, and with spaces indoors and out to gather. Reliable and strong Wifi signal. In the morning, we prefer the west patio, away from the sun, but then moving to the river side by mid afternoon when the sun begins to descend in the western sky. I love sitting on the deck and watching barge traffic on the Mississippi. We always spend one afternoon at the winery which makes the lodge perfect for us. We also like to cook out one night and our hosts had charcoal, lighter fluid etc waiting for us. We have tried other BnBs in the area but we are sold on this one. Book early, though, because I find that the best dates go fast!!"

The water flows past the front of the property as does the occasional freight train, flocks of birds soar about, and the winery property and local parks are fantastic for walking and enjoying nature and some spectacular views. There’s a back yard area - not fenced but great for playing with the dogs who were welcome to join us at the house . The kitchen and laundry are like home and there’s a giant game family room as well as a dining area and living room! The beds were all comfy and fresh and clean. We visited from CO and my daughter drove in from Chicago for a fall family celebration. The Wide River Winery was a delightful daily stop and a walk up the hill. For the kids to escape the city and relax this was truly a gem!"

Stayed with kids","What an amazing place for a group vacation! We had a small family reunion because we've been unable to see each other for about a year due to Covid and it was just perfect. Gorgeous view (try to catch at least one sunrise), great amenities (I'm in love with the stove), high-speed internet and a friendly cat, what more do you need? If your answer to that was ""a great winery with welcoming employees and tasty food"", then you're in luck; a short 1/2 mile walk/drive up the hill and you'll find exactly that.
My only negative the entire weekend was having to leave, we all agreed that we wished we had scheduled more time."

Unfortunately the WiFi was out the entire time we stayed there, due to an outage in the area. And there is very little cell signal at the lodge. But it turned out to be good, it forced us to unplug for the weekend. To make up for the inconvenience we got extra wine from the winery. Which is a big win in my book. The winery was charming, and the wait staff was attentive and helpful. It's very dark at night and we looked at the stars. It's quiet and secluded and romantic. I wish we'd booked a longer stay. But we'll be back again next time we want to get away."

This house was perfect. Beautiful woodwork, large beds, cute kitchen, laundry. I appreciated being in the residential part of Clinton, not out on 30 where all the hotels are, by the casino. We were a 4 minute drive from my mom’s, super easy to maximize our family time. We will definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Sara's Cottage is a beautiful, historic home nestled near the Mississippi River. The home was perfect for our short weekend trip where we celebrated a family wedding. The beds were comfortable & it's not often that a home offers two King-sized beds! Our hosts left snacks and recommendations for restaurants in town. There was a separate office room off of the kitchen that was perfect for our son's pack'n'play and gave us some extra privacy. This would be an excellent home for someone staying several days, as the location is close to all that the area has to offer, parking is on-site, and the kitchen is huge! If we venture to this area again, we will definitely make it a priority to stay here."

Stayed over a week","This is a clean and comfortable place to stay. It is about 2 blocks from the hospital and five minutes from the nearest clinic. The home is probably 5-10 minutes from eagle point park and 5-10 minutes from the bridges taking you to the other side of the Mississippi. It is 2 blocks from the train that goes by 3-4 times in the evening. The noise did not bother me at all but if you are super sensitive it is something to consider. The house is old but it is clean and well taken care of. They have upgraded where they need to (kitchen and bathroom) and left alone those things that are still great, so it allows you to enjoy some of the traditional style and beauty of the home. I visited when it was cold but there is a table and chairs outside with hanging lights as well as a large porch with comfortable seating if you are visiting in good weather."

The home is located in a quiet residential area that is fun to walk, with many old homes of architectural interest.

The only thing to note is that there is a train that runs until about 10:30 or so nearby and it blows its horn when passing through town. We didn’t hear it at night and not even early in the morning (I heard it once but not repeatedly.) but you DO hear it when it is running and you’re there. If you’re sensitive to this, it’s worth nothing."

It is an older home so expect squeaky floors and not all the outlets work the same. Also note there is a train crossing nearby so if you are audio sensitive sleep with the windows closed. Overall though a well stocked and charming home. I’m not the only one that thinks so. When we were on the porch a car stopped to tell us that “our” home was lovely and they think so every time they drive by. Walking distance to a grocery store and lots of great places to eat.

But the building itself was enchanting, very nice, and cozy. I thought that the AC ""limitation"" would be a problem, but setting it at 74 was perfect. My friend is a germaphobe, so she inspected EVERYTHING. She was so very pleasantly surprised. It was ridiculously clean! Even the windowsills were immaculate, the cabinets, and the bathroom. We were very happy with our stay. The hostess included some oatmeal bars and water bottles as a welcome gift. It was very sweet :) And the TV had like 1000 channels!
We would happily recommend this apartment to anybody."

Stayed with kids",We enjoyed our girls weekend at Lynda’s place. It was beautiful and especially the kitchen was fully stocked of anything you might need. We enjoyed all the outdoor space. It is nice and private but still close to places to get things or go out to eat. She does mentioned the train and it did come by more often and was louder than we expected. It wasn’t a huge deal but my toddler wasn’t a fan and it did wake her up a few times. So if you have littles that are easily woken up this might not be the place for you. Other than that we enjoyed our stay here and would consider it for a kid free trip in the future!

As Lynda clearly states, the home is situated between a dirt road and train tracks. The dirt road is very rarely traveled, and there wasn't much traffic from the railway, either. Trains went by probably 5-8 times a day. Truly not an issue at all, and we knew to expect that.
Lynda has equipped the home really nicely and with great thoughtfulness. It was a perfect home away from home and we had a lovely time playing games, playing in the grass areas, eating, and resting. Would recommend."

She was able to get us an earlier check-in time, and was also very flexible on check-out. The cabin itself is lovely. Everything is as pictured, and our two pups felt right at home. The best part about the stay was how quiet and calm the area is - exactly what we needed.
The space is beautifully decorated, with all the modern conveniences you need. My girlfriend had a great time making use of the fully-appointed kitchen, and I had fun using the electric grill outside. The beds are on the firmer side, if that matters to you. Trains go by fairly regularly, but you barely notice them by the end of your stay. All in all, this is a lovely, pet-friendly, quiet, relaxing option for a local stay along the Mississippi!"

Stayed a few nights","Lynda's cabin was the perfect location for our stay. As a trio of college buddies who wanted to play and sing some acoustic music, pitch washers (an outdoor game) tell stories and catch up, the location was ideal.
The little town of Princeton had a nice bar/restaurant called Go Fish, and LeClaire (six miles away) had a brewery, distillery, restaurants and shops. It was nice to spend a few hours in town. But, mostly we just enjoyed the beautifully equipped cabin, the yard and the porch nestled between the RR tracks and farmland.
One small mention of the trains...They do run semi-regularly adjacent to the property, so if you are a light sleeper, the horn and train noise may wake you early in the morning. It did not bother us at all.
Lynda was an attentive and totally transparent host."

Stayed with kids","This was our second stay at Carol’s rental and it was just as wonderful as we remembered. Her place offers all the amenities we could want or need - fenced yard, separate bedrooms, large dining room, eat-in kitchen, deep tub, plenty of seating in the living room and a very comfortable and welcoming front porch and back yard, both with seating and small tables. Carol’s place is clean and homey, with just the right touches … nothing too precious or breakable, which is perfect for our family (5 yo twins). The bedrooms are cozy and dark at night, very little ambient light coming through the blinds. Kitchen is stocked with useful small appliances - coffee maker, blender, toaster - plus Tupperware, mixing bowls, pots/pans and utensils. I can’t think of a better place: price is a steal and location is close to everything. Carol is a gracious, attentive host. We will use her fire pit & gas grill on our next visit - didn’t have time this trip, even with her thoughtful offer of s’mores! A+++++"

Stayed a few nights","Carols place was a great little home away from home. We only were there for a short while and it was only two of us. However, if you were to bring more you’d have enough space. Carol provides a ton of things for you. She is very informative & has great hospitality. She offered to drive me and my boyfriend to and from the concert we were attending just because she informed us of a wrong gate. Which I thought was so sweet of her. She also recommended local spots to eat and local things to see. The story of why Carol purchased the home is great too. Also one of the cleanest homes I’ve ever stayed in. I also seen in the garage she had tons of outdoor activities for you to use too. I would definitely go back if I were ever in Iowa again. Carol is one of the friendliest people I’ve met. The locals are also amazing here! This wasn’t a downfall for us but maybe for others that Carol lives next door. But I promise you she never once bothered us or overstepped she was nothing but amazing!"

Carol was a wonderful host and makes sure you have everything you could want -- and then some! The kitchen was the best equipped of any of the Air BnBs I've ever stayed in. The towels are lush. There's streaming on the big tv if you want to watch a movie. The little porch is a great spot for morning coffee. And there were two spots in the garage for our cars. The neighborhood isn't fancy, but was convenient to everything. Loved the Arboretum and Eagle Point Park and having dinner on the patio of the marina above the Mississippi, watching herons and pelicans. We'd also recommend the winery in LeClaire not far away, and Crumpets in Fulton just across the river is a super lunch spot."

She had toys, games and coloring books for kids which is very thoughtful of her. We loved the stay at Glens house and loved the story she shares about the history of the house. Carol waw available at the time we needed to contact her, she was very clear about everything in the house which made it easy to get around. Loved our stay."

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at Dan's home. This was our second stay; three years apart and our stay was just as nice. Having two floors was nice for anyone to sleep a little later without being disturbed by guests/noise downstairs. The kitchen is stocked with dishes, pans, cutlery, casserole dishes ... enough to make preparing meals at home easy. Beds are very comfortable: sheets are soft, pillows have various degrees of firmness so you can change around, and there are ample throw blankets. Our kids enjoyed watching a movie in the game room; the chairs made it feel like their own movie theater. The LR is very comfortable. We loved the location: two blocks to a HyVee & Walgreens, a block to a playground, a block to a park, and about a block 1/2 to The Discovery Place, an excellent play/creativity center for kids. The WIFI is strong. Dan was immediately responsive by message and quickly came over to look a minor issue with the microwave; he was also super during booking - always helpful and quick."

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful place to stay! This house is beautiful and really thoughtfully furnished and maintained. The high ceilings are quite grand, but it does mean that anyone sleeping there will need to navigate the gorgeous, but tall, staircase to the second floor. Since there is a full bathroom on both floors, that was not an obstacle for the less mobile members of our family who were joining us to eat, play games and hang out. There are only a few stairs to the front and back entrances. All of us enjoyed the comfort of the kitchen, dining room, living room and sitting room on the first (ground) floor, and appreciated the artwork, which made us feel at home and part of the community. Really delighted by the bulging folder with local information and ideas for entertainments and excursions! Our stay was already busy (Mom's 90th Birthday!!), but we are hoping to return again soon to enjoy ""our Clinton home""."

Looking forward to future visits!!

Our team stayed for business purposes and was not there often, but the house provided a clean, spacious, well-appointed environment to rest after a long day's work.
Excellent proximity to a 24-hour grocery store and some of the most comfortable beds and linens! Thank you for your hospitality."

Stayed with a pet","This was a fine house to stay in. Location was very interesting, nicely decorated and very responsive owners. The house was not well laid out and was clumsy to live in - walking through one bedroom to get to another was more of a drawback than I imagined. The kitchen had bare bones dishes for 4 of us and the light in the kitchen did not work correctly (it was a fluorescent light that flashed constantly). We just left it off but made for a dark kitchen. Also, the smoke detector seems to go off every time we turned on the oven due to the heat that came out when you opened the oven door. Overall a fine stay with cool things to do in Clinton and Fulton. Great memories! LOVED the record player and porch."

Take advantage of the terrific outdoor patio for an afternoon barbeque. It's the best seat in the house. And peruse Quinn's collection of vintage music to play on the gorgeous record player to set a great mood.
Nearby Fulton, ""downtown"" Albany and Morrison have everything you'd need to shop for plus decent restaurants. And be sure to visit the antiques store in Albany, especially if you're in the market for a great clock.
Quinn was quick to respond to any questions. We'd book this spot again anytime!"

The floors in this unit are soft and feel like they will fall through and they squeak very bad. The beds are poor quality and super uncomfortable. The thermostat can't be set below 74 and it's a 3rd floor unit so beware in the warm months. The price was low and check in was easy but overall we wouldn't stay again.

I really appreciated the motif of the apartment. Being so close to the river, had a nautical theme and was very well done. Grocery store near by so you can stock up for your stay.
During my stay, there was a weekly event on the street where the road is closed down to allow a small car show, live band and food trucks to set up. Lots of local folks setting up chairs and enjoying the evening... Super fun!
Should I find myself in the area again I would definitely stay at Lou's."

Stayed over a week","Nice little apartment, several good places to eat…the Mexican food place across the street was really good. Had to give a shout out to them. Good communication with host. Place was just as described. Parking was good with cameras watching the cars which I really like. It was mostly cold while we were there but there is a nice bike/walk path along the river close as well. Would definitely stay again if I was in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Lou and Mike are awesome hosts! The apartment is located on the 3 rd floor of a century old building, up 2 flights of stairs, with 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, living room and a kitchen! One of the bedrooms has no windows, but we got used to it. There are many places to walk along the nearby Mississippi River, or drive to other little towns that are nearby, lots of historic landmarks, small shops and many consignment stores, including one on the first floor of the building, Deja Vu Furniture, which is owned by the owners. Lots to do in the rest of the City, a few good restaurants, and the usual stores in town. Overall, we had a great experience at this Air BnB! Would probably stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",This is a great spot in Clinton! It’s very close to the river and other restaurants and shops are within walking distance. The apartment itself is very nice despite being in an older building which could use some new decoration. The apartment is near some train tracks which was a bit of a shock one night but they provided ear buds which worked great.

The pots/pans were a little limited for cooking, but we nonetheless were able to prepare some wonderful meals in the kitchen. One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms doesn't have windows. This was fine for us because it made for a quiet/dark place to sleep, but just something to note. Overall a great stay, and we'd definitely come back if we ever find ourselves in Clinton again."

The spaces they offer are old but clean, welcoming and well-furnished with eclectic pieces, perhaps a reflection of their second-hand store below the apartments. Makeup removal wipes, earplugs (I never needed them), closet space, hot water and thick, fluffy towels were plentiful."

Book it for a home away from home, or a home across the country. Enjoy the tranquility, history, character & comfort this space provides. Curl up with a good book & hold your loved ones close. Centrally located to anything you need in Morrison.
Cannot recommend booking through Mike & Colleen enough!"

From the kitchen and living room, to the comfy adjustable bed and walk-in shower. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here. NO complaints! (check out Isle of Rhodes for pizza... a block away, Original Taco... 50ft. away, and Forest Inn... 7 min. away if your hungry) 👍"

Instead I found myself in a beautiful full loft home. It was open, light, and welcoming. I used the full sized oven to prepare my part of Thanksgiving dinner. The kitchen was well equipped, the living room comfortable and spacious, and the bedroom quiet. I will stay there again and again."

I think it will be my go-to from here on out. They have really taken the time to think of every single detail - the comfort, design, and all amenities that someone could ever need. The photos do not really do it justice just how cool the layout of this space is. It is exceptionally clean and organized and feels very private despite being centrally located. I have already recommended it to others and will definitely be back. Thanks again for a great experience!"
