Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay. Was originally supposed to have 5 adults but ended up with 3 adults and 2 small pets. It was perfect size for us. Cottage was immaculately cleaned, beds were comfortable and the sofa was a comfortable relaxing place to sit and watch tv.
The area felt safe and secure. 100% would stay again."

Stayed one night","Jennifer welcomed me into her place late in the evening, on short notice. The cottage was easy to get into. It was cute and very homey. I loved all the cottage style touches. It's in a walkable distance to the downtown. There is not much to do in Deming, but Jennifer recommended me to her favorite restaurant. The neighborhood
is quiet, but the neighbors nearby were smoking weed, and it smelled. This cottage doesn't have any fridge water, so definitely bring your own water to drink. Besides the empty town, Marijuana nearby neighbors, and no drinkable water, it was a sweet little cottage. I only stayed one night, and it was just me, but the house has three beds! It didn't feel very safe due to the smoking neighbors, close to downtown, and no security cameras, but if you don't mind, just the front door dead lock, you're good. I wouldn't stay here with kids, and I wish I had someone with me for protection."

Easy to find, quiet neighbor, right off the I-10 (but super quiet!). Walking into such a warm and inviting space after our 10-hour drive was so wonderful. If you're slogging across the US on I-10 you should take advantage of this perfect layover spot."

Stayed one night","For roadtrippers who just need a place to crash overnight, there are much cheaper options. One night for us (two people and a dog) was $150. To stay at a hotel with the dog would have been less than $90. Nobody's fault other than our own, but next time I'll find a cheaper place in Deming.
Pros: Jennifer is very responsive, listing is accurate, and there's a washer/dryer combo on-site.
Cons: Very dark when you arrive and difficult to see without using a phone as your flashlight."

Stayed one night","Cutest, cleanest place we've stayed. This is a small place but has been upgraded to optimize the space to the fullest. Jennifer responded quickly and made it clear she was available for any of our needs. We didn't cook but if we chose to everything needed was available. All top of the line appliances. European washer/dryer unit was not my favorite but I'm sure if I had called Jennifer would have helped. 😁
Location was great, when we drove up we could hear activity at an establishment up the street but as soon as we were indoors we heard nothing outside. 👍
The interior is absolutely adorable. The electric fireplace in the bedroom was romantic and worked great.
Thanks Jennifer.
Hope to see you next year."

I hadn't stayed in one since I was 12 ! The RV was huge,clean and had plenty of space,even with my 3 dog crates.Martin was more of a friend than a host! I love all the animals and Martins dog,Angus !

I normally do not stay in RVs but I thought I should try one that was a little larger than the one that I had at the recent stay camping. Well, I was upgraded like I said to the Sugar shack his sugar shack was perfect. I absolutely loved the painting of the sugar skulls girl. The artwork, was unbelievably awesome and the story behind her was even better if you stay in the sugar shack or even if you don’t stay in the sugar, shack, make sure you ask Martin about the sugar skull girl"

Stayed one night","I stayed here with my best friend and her dog during a cross country trip on our way from New York to California. This air bnb was definitely the coolest one we stayed at through out the trip! Martin is a great and friendly host. He had lots of suggestions for nearby food, let us feed treats to his cows, donkeys and horses and the place was very clean and inviting! Seeing the sun set behind the mountains of the ranch was to die for. i plan on coming back to stay at Lazy KO Ranch again in the future!"

Stayed with kids","Sooo…unfortunately we weren’t able to make our stay as our road trip ran late. Martin was very accommodating in switching our stay for the next day since he had an open spot. Unfortunately we decided to stay elsewhere as we were told the spa was not working and kids wouldn’t be allowed in the spa even if it were. After a long few days in the road, we were definitely in need of a spa. I did ask when booking if kids were allowed and there wasn’t any mention of them not being allowed in the spa, so that ultimately was a deciding factor in not staying at the location. Other then that response was great and they were very friendly!"

Stayed with kids","Martin's place is more than a place to rest up, it's a fun and a great learning experience worth driving to Deming expressly for, only because he is a sort of spirit willing and able to impart so much from his rich life! You will leave definitely dusty but enriched with real social and historic awareness and knowledge. You may end up buying land out there and living out the rest of your life next to his ranch actually...not really a bad 💡"

I wish we could have stayed for a couple of days. The beds were so comfortable, the stars were so beautiful, and we had everything we needed. Martin was also super nice and accommodated us on short notice. We definitely plan to go back to see the animals and stargaze."

Stayed one night","Awesome stay!
My partner and I decided to go on a random adventure, and with Martin's quick response, a few short hours later we were staying and a quaint RV in the beautiful desert.
Upon arrival we were walked through their collection of kind and loveable animals and even got to feed them treats! The RV had all the bells and whistles! The mattress was phenomenally comfortable. Despite the fact that it was an RV, neither myself nor my partner ran out of hot water (I even had time enough to shave my legs). The water quality was also impressive. Gotta love how good well water leaves your skin and hair!
The jacuzzi area was also much better than expected. It was private and had an area to plug in tunes, relax and melt away.
Martin was very kind-showing us around and answering all of our questions, and then he gave us our space and privacy. He was always quick to respond to our needs... and after being SO relaxed from soaking in the jacuzzi and sleeping on they super comfy mattress, he was able to accommodate our delayed check-out. This place was a diamond in the rough, and will keep it in mind for future travels!"

Stayed one night",Wow! I’m going to admit- I booked this place because it was one of the few options available during this leg of my cross country road trip. I’ve been staying in a different Airbnb every night for a week and this was hands down my favorite. The bed was ultra comfortable. The animals were amazing! The stars at night were beautiful. I really enjoyed talking to Krystal. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel on a farm in the middle of nowhere as a solo female traveler (plus dog)- but I always felt comfortable. It was the perfect stop to rest up for another day of driving and adventures. If I find myself in the area again I won’t hesitate to return!

Outside area is enclosed if you have a pup. Theres also a swing, bbq, and fire pit.
Martin and family were also the friendliest hosts weve ever had the pleasure of meeting. Super quick responses via phone/app and they were nice enough to walk us around the farm upon our request.
Dont worry city people, they have great wifi and a hottub! A must stay if you are going through New Mexico."

It was an incredible value... I mean, about the cost of an economical hotel, but private with a jacuzzi room and tons of awesome farm animals to hang out with. We loved petting/feeding the critters, and also watching the giant TV in the RV. They were very gracious and accommodating, with little touches (tons of Kerig beverage choices + a soda pop/gatorade/water in the fridge). Can't wait to come back again soon."

Stayed with kids","This house was perfect for our family of 8. There are 3 bedrooms. One has a king size bed. The other a queen size bed and the third had 2 twin beds with an extra foldable twin bed in the closet. We just brought a twin size air mattress so all 6 of our kids had a bed in a room.
The layout is strange, but there is plenty of room. The master bedroom looks like it might have been an old garage on the back of the house. There is a small tv room that you walk through to get to the master. You could probably sleep someone on the couch in there. There is an open living room/dining room as well. The kitchen is off of that.
There were some essentials in the kitchen cabinets and freezer, that we were welcome to use. The kitchen had plenty of dishes, cookware and utensils, which we rarely see at airb&b’s for our family of 8. There was a blender, which our daughter appreciated, so she could have her breakfast smoothies. There were modern appliances in the kitchen. It had one of those drawer dishwashers.
The bathrooms were pretty modern. One had a big tile shower with glass enclosure. There was a normal shower head as well as a rain shower head. This bathroom also has a tub. The stackable washer and dryer are in this bathroom. The second bathroom has a tile shower that is flush with the bathroom floor. Half of the front has a tile wall and the other half a shower curtain. It is pretty modern. The kids appreciated it because they could brush their teeth while the other showered.
Parts of this house are older, but you can tell they have put a good bit of work into updating it. You do have to enter through the side door with a keypad. There is not one on the front door. Some of the houses in the neighborhood are rundown, but we felt very safe. It seems that there are many parts of Deming that have run down houses.
There is a small backyard with a grill that we did not use. It also has a covered patio with table and chairs. The entire backyard has a wall/fence around it. There is a back alley road between the houses.
We visited family in the area and would stay again in this house if we ever get to visit again.
Jennifer answered all our messages quickly. We had a lightbulb out in one of the rooms and she was sure to have that fixed immediately."

Group trip","I travel for work across the nation–and this has been HANDS DOWN my very BEST AIRBNB experience. Jennifer is top notch. She responds thoughtfully and quickly and will rest easy on comfortable beds (and knowing you’re getting a great value). You will want for nothing. The pictures don’t do the property justice, it was bigger than expected and the backyard / patio is dynamite. My family of four stayed here for over two months without a hitch and I don’t have a single complaint–only praise! Cannot recommend enough, 15/10 stars for sure. Thank you, Jennifer, for the wonderful hospitality and the amazing care you gave us throughout our stay. We’ll be back, no doubt!"

Stayed with kids","We rented this out over Thanksgiving so we could have our family's meet up and have a place to do Thanksgiving dinner with Grandpa and couldn't have asked for a more perfect place. The kitchen had everything we needed (did bring our own roaster due to a huge turkey and cooking preference). The back yard was enclosed and perfect so the kids could run around at will. Close to everything we needed and yet still had great views of the Florida mountains from the back yard, made for great coffee on the back porch table in the mornings! Thanks so much and likely will be back in the future when we visit Grandpa!"

The home was clean, with everything we needed. It was comfortable and a nice place to come back to after visiting and sight seeing each day. Erica was a great hostess and was very responsive when we had questions. One note on finding this place: The map app isn't aware that the street (Mallery) jogs. So it thinks this home is on the section of Mallery prior to the jog."

Group trip","Our group of 7 slept great at Erica's place. I honestly think it looks way better than the photos. It was clean, quiet, & easy to get in. I didn't see a description of the bed arrangements so i was worried a little before getting there but it had A LOT of space. There were 3 rooms with three bathrooms. 1 room had a queen bed, 1 had a king and two single beds, and the last room had a king bed with like its own little living room? We only needed a place to sleep for one night but it was a good experience!"

The dogs had plenty of room and one of them wanted to stay since there are horses and goats next door! Plenty of safe parking for bigger groups as well. Be sure to follow Erica’s directions as the map app probably gets it wrong. Nice secluded location, clean and well equipped."

Stayed with kids","For us, Deming is a pass through town located as the half way point on our long drives. We've struggled to find accommodations for our family of 6, where we feel our belongings are safely stored as we rest overnight. All that has changed now that we have found Cozy Cottage B.
Although the place could be described as dated, it is very clean and the beds are very comfortable (medium-firm for those who are curious). We had an excellent sleep there. Additionally, the host is responsive and kind.
This will definitely be our go-to accommodation moving forward. Thank you, Erica. ❤️"

Erica was an amazing host, she responded immediately to my questions.
We definitely recommend and we will consider for future stay’s."

We arrived late in the evening, but it was super easy to find and the instructions to get inside were spot on! Stepping inside is a cozy, yet very spacious abode with every amenity you could possibly need.
There were only three of us plus our two dogs so we didn’t use every available bed, but the ones e sampled were comfortable and we got a restful nights sleep!
The bathrooms have HOT water, which was much appreciated on such a cold night.
We used the oven to bake some frozen pizzas and made coffee in the morning. We even did a load of laundry!
The dogs appreciated the expansive lot to explore and do their business.
Erica was super friendly and responsive to every inquiry.
If you need to stay in the area, I highly recommend Erica’s place!"

Getting to have coffee automatically made for us by the coffee maker in the morning was icing on the cake. The backyard setup was beautiful as well, but unfortunately we were unable to enjoy it due to the neighbors keeping their unfriendly dogs out all day and night. It’s a shame because so much thought and care was clearly put into the backyard as well. Would 100% stay again, wish we could have stayed longer!"

The desert is fairly bleak around the property, so don't expect a resort. It's very quiet sleeping once the animals quiet down.
Be watchful for the big dog - he came running at me from behind and jumped on me."

I did not notice the any animal smell and was not woken up by animals during the night

The highway wasn’t too busy, but certainly wasn’t conducive to walks or exploring the “ranch “
All in all I was able to pivot my plan to include visiting the nearby state parks instead of just hanging out on the property"

There was one humorous moment where, during the windy evening, I discovered I hadnt latched the door to the bathroom properly, and as I walked into it in the dark, I heard a meow. When I turned on the light and looked up, I heard another meow and saw Boots the cat casually resting on top of the fresh towels. Whoops! Boots really didnt care for being put back out into the cool blustery night but I made sure to close the door properly following cat removal.
The sleeping room was comfortable and warm and we slept well. Next time I hope to spend at least 2 days to allow time for rock hunting and going to the hot springs in the mountains!"

Stayed one night","Martin’s ranch was an absolute gem, first time staying in New Mexico and I’ll never forget the experience!
He provided thorough instructions and made me feel at home on his property! He was also very well versed in the area, giving tidbits of history and recommendations on where to get a good bite!!
Unfortunately this time around I could only stay one night but I will definitely be returning with some buddies to experience it all over again!!!
Thank you so much Martin!!"

The cabin was very comfortable, and it’s only half the fun. Touring the farm was such a unique experience, and the surrounding landscape is absolutely beautiful. 10/10 if you’re looking for a stop, 11/10 if you’re a rock hunter."

Stayed with a pet","The legends are true. Martin's place is a gem. The cost was well below a lot of the run down motels in the area, and what you get is FAR beyond anything in the town. The bed was comfortable, the area serene, and Martin himself is just one of the friendliest people I have ever met.
Our only complaint was that we had to get on the road so early both mornings, that we didn't have a chance to chat with him more!
100% would book again."

The site is in the perfect place if you are driving between Tucson and Las Cruces because it’s no more than a few minutes added onto your trip. I highly recommend this stay.

Nice quarters with a couple beds, TV with satellite and internet, a fridge and microwave. Perfect for snacking and eating out. Lots of animals around, which something initialing pinged my allergies but some meds quickly handled that. You're right next to a bunch of animals but you neither hear them or have any odors. The bathroom is private but several steps away. Near an excellent cafe, Adobe grill I think. Other restaurants are further away. Not far from Rockhounds state park, beautiful in the morning!"

A couple things to note before you go, the cabins are converted sheds and so the bathroom is detached but right next to the cabin. If you are sensitive to strong smells or have accessibility needs it might not be the best option for you."

He had great dining recommendations, and was very knowledgeable about the area. My fiancé and I like unique-rustic accommodations, so this was perfect for us. If you prefer upscale and fancy this isn’t the place for you. If you want to gaze upon precious critters and beautiful views with a little “porch sittin” this is the place for you. The bathroom is separate from the unit, but just a few steps out the door. I am uneasy in the dark, but this wasn’t bad at all. I can’t tell you how many Airbnb locations we have stayed in with beds so bad we roll to the center. Martin’s place has a nice memory foam bed, so we slept great! We would definitely stay again when in the area."

Cute puppy too!!! The space was laid out really well. A/C cooled us down quickly. TV easy to operate and great WIFI. Nice ""fuller"" mid fridge. Had some snacks, water and quite the assortment for the Keurig. Yes, bathroom a few steps away but, seeing that sky on that walk is amazing (it is covered, I just looked out). Shower was wonderful. May not be a place for all, but we loved it as many have. The animals were so fun to watch and even though some noise, we couldn't hear it in the unit. Definitely a place to stay again!!!

The cabin is very well finished inside and comfortable, be aware that the main bed is a thermarest type bed which for my back isn’t great. But I know others swear by them. Bathroom is next door to the cabin which was fine for me. Martin is great, friendly and helpful. The animals were a treat to interact with as well. And the one restaurant within close proximity is well worth the visit. Food is good but the aesthetic of the place is too interesting to miss. It’s like eating in a museum. I’d definitely stay again when passing through NM."

The fended in yard was a helpful addition for the dog to get the wiggles out after a long car ride. Best of all was the beautiful views out on the wide open plain out the front porch and the tour of the ranch with all the adorable animals.

Cottage that we stayed in had detached bathroom, however, it was well lit and very, very clean and close. Unfortunately, only had one night but has outdoor seating, lighting at night, and plenty of room to roam around if you choose. Martin himself was a wealth of information and was very hospitable. For the money, it was a very enjoyable experience. We would stay again if in the area. If you are picky and an accommodation snob, keep driving, but if you want a friendly, homey, farm stay, book today! Also, don't miss the Adobe Deli, close to Martin's, great food, and friendly people."

Instead of being a stop for the night, it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Martin was a friendly and informative host. He told us so much about the local area. He was very accommodating to help us get the best possible views for sunset and star gazing.
The cabin was basic but provided everything we needed. It was clean and comfortable. Getting to know his interesting collection of animals was also a real treat. If you are traveling through this area we highly recommend a stay at Martin's place."

I basically got inside, brushed my teeth and fell right asleep. Had the best night's sleep in over a week. Got up, made coffee in my room, said hi to all the animals on the ranch and rolled on down the highway.

He makes you feel right at home, has snacks, coffee, fridge/freezer for anything you might need to keep cold, a dog run, fluffy towels and it’s always immaculately clean. EASY on-off the freeway, and of course, since we were traveling with horses, they got to get out of the trailer and run around in their own paddocks.
This place is so incredibly peaceful, quiet, and secure. We would have loved to stay longer just to relax, but had to get back on the road (again).

If a relaxing place away in the middle of several incredibly beautiful animals sounds appealing, it is. Seems the quietness and calm in the Cabin was just an added bonus amongst this cool place.

He will give you a tour of his ranch and introduce you to all his Ames he has. I have three favorites. His two donkeys and his Scottish Highland Bull. All his animals are friendly and will let you pet them for as long as you wish."

Martin was very warm and welcoming, the location was easy to find, and the cabin was perfect. Martin introduced us to most of the resident farmlife before recommending the great food (and even better decor) of the Deli down the street. The cabin had everything we needed, and even had lots of wonderful extra touches - water, soda, coffee, chewy bars, and tons of decorations! Would highly recommend to anything going through the area (or not!)"

Stayed one night","I canceled this reservation at the last minute because when I called Martin on the phone, he was aggressive and angry. I had not realized that the time change happened from AZ to NM. He had written me a message and said that he wanted to know by noon when I would be there. I called him an hour late, trying to let him know when I would be there and that I would call him 5 minutes before I got to his place. He said to me that if I didn't call him at 5 minutes exactly before I got there that he would go ballistic and then he continued to say that he wished that he'd never let me book there, after I asked if he was angry at me. He had a guy just show up at his property the night before.
Of course traveling as a single woman, I did not go, I canceled and found a hotel instead."

Visiting the animals was awesome in the morning and I was surprised that even with their closeness there was no offensive smells. The porch was awesome for relaxing and stargazing and the bed was comfortable even for my husband's bad back. They accommodated our late check in traveling on interstate 10 and were great about it. We will definitely be staying again as we frequently make the trip from CA to AR. There was a playground, a fenced secure area for our dog right outside our cabin, cold AC and jacuzzi!"

That being said, they aren't really around, after check in, unless you need them. I did see them and waved hi while enjoying the sunrise with the cutest animals. 7 day old alpaca and her momma, a baby calf, horses, donkeys, roster and yet at night, everything is so quiet. The starts were brighter each night 🌙 ✨️ They not only brought over a propane tank, bit also let us borrow a spatula and tongs for my grilling. the fun snacks and drinks my son enjoyed. I think our dogs enjoyed it as much, if not more than my 14 year old and husband.
The only thing, if you have a tall teen, (my boy is 6""3') too tall for the twin, but it was 1 week and he was fine lol. ohh, and the outhouse was fun and did I mention the sunrise and sunsets 🌄"

Our favorite animal friend was Nestle the baby cow. There's also a play set the kids enjoyed. 2 bed accommodations, full kitchen which was wonderful. Getting the hot shower/bath going was a bit challenging, and important given we were coming from a sandy, animal filled day. The kids didn't want to leave. I'm sure if we stayed longer Martin could have helped us experience the area even more!"

The cabin we stayed in was awesome, cozy feel and the mattress was the most comfortable, like memory foam.
I highly recommend this stay.

The A/C worked wonderfully well. We really enjoyed seeing all the animals too. The cat in particular hung around the whole time and even snuck into our room in the wee hours. (Bathroom was in an outside building so when my husband came back in, the cat did too.) We laughed about it. While we enjoyed our stay I don't think we'd stay there again - nothing personal - just too rustic for me. No source of water in the cabin so you had to use the bathroom for everything that required water."

Our host Martin met us at the gate and showed us to our B&B which was nestled in by the animals on the ranch. Martin offered to tour the ranch and show all the animals to us but we were a little too beat to take advantage. Bathroom/shower is located in its own building 5 feet from the bedroom.

Stayed one night","You don't have to allow a 1,000 pound cow lick your hand, but you're missing a great opportunity to get to know an iconic American farm animal a little bit better if you don't. That is also true for Tina the Alpaca gently nibbling kibble from your palm and even a trio of Rheas taking a snip at your finger. In all, the farm's rescue and bred animals are gentle giants, and as some are rescued animals they are a bit shy. In the fields beyond the farm, we enjoyed the Gambel's Quail speed-stepping across the desert with their teensy golf-ball sized chicks furiously keeping pace, while Killdeer and Cactus Wren called from somewhere out in the pasture as they sheltered from the heat. As others have noted, Martin is an incredible host: patient, knowledgeable, exuberant. The cabin is comfortable, well-stocked with snacks and beverages, and comes with a guard—Boots the house cat—who will keep post outside your door all the starry night long. Yeah, it's a nice place to sleep. But it is itself a destination that you will be very happy you discovered."
