The little shopping area it's in is great. Steps away from an ice cream shop, a coffee shop, a chocolate shop, three tap rooms, and several restaurants--all very good. Parking was also super easy. Five stars all around!"

Stayed a few nights","The loft was fun and a perfect size for the two of us to land during our whirlwind weekend. The Creamery below is an incredibly popular place but the activity was not at all disruptive to our experience, which we wondered about. The bed was comfortable and the linens nice. The ceiling fans were a welcome addition for air movement during our warm stay. Filtered water in the fridge door saved us from having to buy bottled so environmental kudos! The decor was updated and calming. The location got us quickly to all major streets so moving around town was very convenient. We had a really nice stay and would stay again instead of using a hotel!"

Even though this loft is in the south part of town, it was a short easy drive to/from the concert, and it was so nice to have a clean, quiet place to come back to. Our only regret is not having time to try the ice cream shop! We will definitely stay here again."

There's a coffee shop and an ice cream shop right next door. We were only 10 minute from downtown, and the traffic was much lighter.
It's situated in a commercial district with some shops nearby. We didn't explore much of them because we were there for an event."

Stayed one night","Great space, very convenient with wonderful restaurants in walking distance. Very clean with plenty of amenities. The only two things I didn’t love: in one of the photos it appeared there was a balcony which there is not in this particular unit, and then the other very minor thing for us was the space above the bedroom wall that opens directly into the kitchen, only because we were traveling with a toddler and like to keep the room dark when we’re up after she goes to bed… so that’s very personal to our situation and likely wouldn’t impact most people. Otherwise loved it and would stay again!"

Bonus points too for having extra travel toothbrushes and coffee supplies in the place! I only stayed for one night but it made me wish I could stay longer. And yes, the ice cream downstairs is amazing!
One thing I would mention and it has nothing to do with the loft itself: I noticed there were no Ubers to be found when I needed to get to the Haymarket for a work meeting. I had a rental car so it wasn’t an issue. Not sure if it was a fluke but just a heads up either way."

Stayed with kids","This is seriously a hidden gem. FANTASTIC for families it had everything a family could need: bibs, kid dishes, sound machine, baby monitor, bath seat and toys, even baby shampoo. They had baby bottle brush, countless toys, stroller, wagon and even a booster seat. We were blown away by this amazing place. Great location in a safe neighborhood with grocery, coffee, and restaurants in under 6 min drive. 3 families stayed 7 adults and 5 kids under the age of 5. Something for everyone big and small. All of my questions were answered quickly and there were countless little touches that made our stay. Kitchen is fully stocked with all appliances you could need. Plenty of bedding and towels with 12 people we went through so many towels and never ran out. Lots of storage areas to tuck items away. The hall closet even had a shoe rack for all the kids shoes. We could have stayed for a month but sadly all we had time for was 1 unforgettable weekend. We will be staying again!"

I feel that the host tried to think of everything you might need while you were there from infants needs to adults cooking hotdogs over the fire or playing cornhole in the backyard. The flow of the house is a little cumbersome at times, but very manageable with a little patience and effort. We had 8 adults there for three days, and overall had a really nice weekend and felt pleased with our decision to stay there."

Hot tub: amazing. Clean, and we were able to adjust the temp to be perfect for us.
Hammocks: so delightful that one in our group thinks they should be counted as beds.
Fire pit: Tucked away for quiet conversations, with the perfect furniture.
Kitchen: Most well stocked with equipment and supplies that I've ever seen. She even thought of a vegetable peeler. Lovely dishes, beautiful set of pots and pans, high quality knives, delightful coffee bar, and a lamp!
Game/party room: Just so, so well done. Great games, perfect set up.
Kids' bedroom: such an outstanding selection of furniture, toys and books. One of my favorite rooms in the house!
Hosts: Amazing! No one does it better.
Bottom line? Book it. This is THE place to stay in Lincoln. Who wouldn't want to stay in a place Pinterest is jealous of?"

We enjoyed our last dinner on the back patio with other family members grilling steaks on the grill (that is provided). AND, to put the cherry on top of everything, there is literally a BEAUTIFUL huge Cherry Tree in the backyard that Amy encouraged us to use, so with our steak dinner, we topped it off with cherries for dessert!! What stands out the most is Amy's thoughtfulness in all the details of the house and her kindness with so many things!!!"

We also appreciated that Amy was responsive at all times and added a personal touch by leaving a welcome note (and the best gummy bears I’ve ever had!) The only regret we have is not staying longer. Would definitely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","I stayed in New Nostalgia home last weekend for a reunion with frineds...4 of us total. The home is spacious and comfortable for spending time there visiting inside in the 2 living rooms and in the backyard in the hot tub, hammocks or on the deck. There are plentiful amenities in the kitchen such as coffee and teas, ziploc bags for leftovers, and just about every gadget you'd need for meal preparation. Bedroom and bath linens were soft. Laundry facility had everything too including an iron and ironing board. The garage holds outdoor games, such as corn hole and an oversized Connect 4, as well as weights and yoga mats for working out. Instructions for the TV were easy to follow as well as contact-less entry and departure. Amy responded quickly to questions ahead of our arrival and left friendly, welcoming notes for us. Expectations for cleaning up for departure were reasonable too. I'd certainly stay here again at our next return to Lincoln!"

We enjoyed our meals outside on the deck and the kids had plenty of toys and games inside and out to keep them busy. Our older kiddos enjoyed their workout in the garage gym and the hot tub was perfect! You can tell how much the host truly desires to spoil their guests. We were so thankful for the prompt delivery of a coffee press, complete with local coffee, when we discovered we left ours at home. Just amazing!!"

The weather got too cold while being there to hang out in the awesome looking hammocks and to use the fire pit but rest assure next visit to Lincoln those things will be first on the list to do!
Amy is an absolute pleasure to work with and so accommodating to any need you may have. She has also made certain the home is clean, stocked with any item you can think of needing, and provided a sweet little surpise!
We can't think of a better place to stay or better person to deal with. Until next time New Nostalgia ❤️🖤

Stayed with kids","Amy and Todd’s New Nostalgia House is the best Airbnb we have stayed at, and we have stayed at many here and overseas. Nothing is missing. Like coffee? Your options are pour-over, Keurig, expresso maker (Italian stove-top) or coffee pot. (Plenty of teas too!). Have children? The kids room downstairs is designed just for them. Babies or toddlers? Baby bath, toddler potty seat, step stool , kids plates, etc. Older kids? Games—board and Nintendo. Adults? 2 big screen tvs. And the hot tub is fantastic! It snowed so we didn’t check out the beautiful outdoor fire pit and other backyard capabilities. But they are all there. In other words , there is nothing we could have wanted that wasn’t there. The house was spotless, beds so comfortable and whole house beautifully decorated. If I could give this a 10, I would. And the next time we are in Lincoln visiting family we hope to stay here again. Great for families or small group of multiple friends. You won’t be disappointed!"

From the thoughtful extras (candy, popcorn, Christmas tree and decorations) to the amazingly comfortable beds and fully stocked kitchen Amy has thought of everything. It was the most “at home” we’ve felt while staying at an Airbnb. Amy was very responsive throughout our stay and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Although we didn’t get to enjoy the outside area (it was negative 15 when we arrived) it seemed like it would be a great place to relax when the weather is warmer. I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Lincoln-you will not be disappointed!!"

Stayed a few nights","New Nostalgia was everything I hoped it would be and Amy & Todd were over the top helpful hosts! The home lives up to the photos and even better in person. The only “problem” was that we didn’t want to leave! The house made us feel totally at home. The amenities contributed to that feeling. We come to Lincoln frequently from Texas and need a place to stay to visit our college student, son. It was an easy drive to UNL and many wonderful restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. I live in Texas now, but am a native Nebraskan and have spent a lot of time in Lincoln. New Nostalgia is perfectly located, ideal for families, staycations, Husker game weekends, etc…We can’t wait to return on our next visit! There aren’t enough words to express how much we loved New Nostalgia! Until next time…"

Communication was fantastic
The photos don’t do the home justice. Her sense of style, creativity, and attention to detail are apparent EVERYWHERE- even how she has the dishwasher pods organized.
The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you may need or want.
Bathrooms have hairdryers, toiletries, and emergency items you may have forgotten.
The hot tub works and it gets hot!
There is a gym in the refinished garage.
The basement area is huge and has games that came in handy.
There are multiple outside seating areas that really add value.
The mattresses are firm and supportive.
Access to the home was easy with the touch keypad.
This is .5 miles from Union College- easily within walking distance.
The neighborhood was safe and well established.
I would highly recommend this property and Amy! I have no doubt that whatever she touches will be high quality and beautiful.
We hope to stay here again in the future. ❤️Jeanice"

The gaming system and the hot tub were a big hit with our teens! The home is as described and pictured or better! The kitchen is also well equipped. The local treats (popcorn, licorice and coffee) were a nice surprise. The home is located in a great spot in South Lincoln, with great proximity to many awesome spots for dining or take out: Copal (Mexican), The Mill, LaMar's Donuts/Colby Ridge Popcorn & Ice Cream, Bagels and Joe, Taco Inn and Butterfly Bakery, to name a few. This Airbnb is as nice as any I've stayed at."

The hot tub, kid’s playground and hammocks makes this a standout Airbnb for families. Amy was quick to respond to all of my questions. I needed to extend my stay and Amy worked with me to make it happen. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make a gourmet meal. The house is located in a safe neighborhood. We spent a morning walking around the College View area. Discovered a good coffee shop, breakfast place and Mexican restaurant all within walking distance. We had a family emergency and Amy was able to book us a couple extra days around another family. When we moved back in, the house was just as clean as our first visit. New Nostalgia House is a 10/10 Airbnb."

Stayed with kids","The New Nostalgia House is a home away from home. Amy and Todd had everything you could think of and more to accommodate our stay here. We traveled with a 4 month old and the thought they put behind our weekend was so wonderful and shows the heart behind the owners of the home. They had a crib, monitor, toys, bottle brush, baby bath, and sound machine set out for our sweet baby. They even had a little tub of baby food for her. Knowing our baby would’ve been taken care of whether we forgot something or not is such a peace of mind for a mom traveling with her baby.
The house is beautiful and accommodating for large groups with so many gorgeous hang out areas and amenities, but the kindness and heart shown in the owners is greater than anything you could ask for. The world needs more people like them. My group cannot wait to stay here again."

Parents with littles, this stay has it all: baby monitor, baby bath, bibs, cups, toys, a play set... it was fantastic to not have to worry about whether or not we forgot something! And our large group loved the common spaces, especially on the deck. We agreed that staying at New Nostalgia was so much better than staying in a hotel where you're separated by floors, have to gather in uncomfortable common spaces, and store food in awkward situations. None of those inconveniences crossed our minds at NN!! We cannot wait to return to this beautiful and relaxing location!!!"

Group trip","This home was perfect! Best AirBnB we've ever stayed in!
Amy made us feel like family. We were in town for a family funeral. We felt so at home in Amy's house that we really relaxed and focused on being together as family.
Really, we couldn't think of anything else she could do to make the stay better. The home is beautiful, came nearly as fully stocked as our own home, and with too many attentions to detail to list.
We worked out in the garage gym space, played Cornhole & on the swing set, lounged in the hammocks, played video games on the big screen and board games at the table down stairs, we bbq'd & enjoyed the relaxing back patio, entertained the little ones with adorable toys, cooked in the well stocked kitchen with ease, and slept well on the super comfy beds.
The ONLY reason I would hesitate to give this a great review is that I'd like to be able to stay here again if we visit Lincoln -- and selfishly hope there will be ""room in Amy's inn"".
Thank you so much Amy and Todd! Hope you get much joy out of hosting!"

Daryl and Sally thought of everything that a guest would need from drinks in the fridge and snacks on the counter to instructions on how to use the higher tech items. Even a little first aid kit in the bathroom. The condo is perfectly located downtown close to Haymarket and tons of restaurants. But the location is a double-edged sword and the only section I took off one star. On the weekend, there is a lot of nightlife traffic and even though the condo is on the 5th floor, you can still hear it quite a bit. Not Daryl and Sally's fault the builder didn't use better soundproof windows. Just bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Not a huge deal, though. We do plan to rent this condo again in the fall when we stay in Lincoln."

Stayed one night","Daryl is a spectacular host! There was literally so many personal touches that just makes you feel right at home! The building was very easy to find, and nice security which is a comfort to us! My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and the hosts were kind enough to leave a personalized note and chocolates, which made our day! All in all we'd rate this condo a solid 10. The place was immaculate and it still felt so welcoming. We felt right at home in Daryls Lincoln condo. Definitely would stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to stay when visiting Lincoln! The apartment was easy to find, with readily available parking after a long drive. The flat was completely spotless, had all the amenities required and every piece of furniture was comfortable to relax on! The blackout blinds also meant I got a really full sleep.
It's within striking distance of the Haymarket and downtown areas, with an array of good restaraunts and bars. As I was in town to visit friends, it was the perfect location. During the day it was an easy walk to Memorial Stadium, the State Capitol and shopping.
Daryl was polite, friendly, and so thorough with the instructions I barely had to ask anything - but he responded quickly when I did.
Would absolutely recommend staying here if you visit Lincoln."

The building/condo was easy to access (secure) and had a very private feel as well. It was within walking distance of all sporting venues in town.
A very comfy bed, and an awesome Living space with a 75 inch TV with all the viewing options out there! Remote control blinds, fans, & lighting controls with a fully stocked and wonderful kitchen area too!
Ultra modern, fantastic furnishings, and a very, very, clean space.
Great communication and assistance was consistently provided by the owners.
This will certainly be our next stop when coming back to town!"

Everything was very clean and comfortable in the condo with all the amenities you need, plus extras. The host was very helpful with parking instructions, we didn't have any troubles parking even with a Nebraska football game going on. Although, you do not need a car to get around in this area, everything you may need is walkable. There is some traffic noise at night but that is to be expected in a busy downtown. Overall, this was an excellent experience, and we look forward to staying here again."

Stayed with kids",My family (two adults and two kids) stayed at Amy’s studio apartment for a night after a looonnng day of travel. My husband and I both agree that the bed was the most comfortable we slept in throughout our whole vacation! The location was perfect after a day of traveling. We parked the car in the overnight garage (only $11 for the night!) and we’re able to easily walk to dinner. My kid’s favorite part was the ice cream shop below the apartment!

Stayed a few nights","The location is utter perfection. Especially as a visitor from big city ... we couldn't imagine staying in other parts of Lincoln and not having some fun bars to walk to at night. The apartment is large and clean. But the halls and stairwells are dirty. If you can ignore the public areas and go quickly up to your loft, you won't have any complaints.
The coin-op dryer took our money and spun for the expected time but when the cycle finished, we had cold soggy clothes. Hopefully they get it fixed quickly and you won't have this problem.
The noise from outside is minimal, if at all. That was a treat. But, there are metal industrial doors to the stairwell and the neighbors. Neighbors were very disrespectful and even into the late hours of the night, would come and go slamming doors which literally rattled the walls in the loft and woke us up many times.
Overall, since I will only every stay in downtown Lincoln and it's important to have a kitchen to make/eat my own food, this is a GREAT option for the price. I can take the good with the bad but not everyone has their priorities in the same place as mine so wanted to put this out there for those who it might help ...."

Stayed over a week","We had a great time at Amy’s apartment, the location was great and the view was nice. The bed was comfy, the place was tastefully decorated, and within walking distance of everything in Haymarket and downtown.
However, there were a few areas for improvement. Namely some loose door hinges/door knobs and broken dining chairs. The noise level from the street and thin walls within the building were distracting at times, and parking was incredibly hard to find.
Overall, we had a great time and the location was as advertised. I would stay again, maybe just at a quieter time of the year."

LeeAnne was very accommodating across the board with shared spaces, helpful about regarding the local area, and a great host. The location wasn't too far from everything, but I preferred not to be close to the downtown area, plus it was less than a 10 minute walk to a nearby lake, so that was convenient.

Stayed one night","LeeAnn was responsive to me at my first inquiry and continued to be so through all interactions. Her profile states that she and her husband enjoy meeting new people, and this was accurate. They are warm, friendly, and conversational folks, who made us feel comfortable and welcome throughout our stay. Though it was only 1 night, I can understand the appeal to someone wanting a much longer stay. The townhouse is so easy to reach (we used our phone's GPS to get there from the interstate), and is conveniently located near through-streets for getting around Lincoln. The bedroom and bathroom were impeccably clean; the bed was very comfortable, and the temperature in the room was pleasant with a ceiling fan for use. The most obvious characteristic though, was the absence of street noise, guaranteeing a peaceful sleep. I encourage anyone looking for a well-appointed room with excellent hosts to check out this place."

The room, with private bath, was large and comfortable and spotless. We were welcomed to help ourselves to coffee or tea in the morning and invited to use any of the common spaces and to ask for anything we might need. LeeAnne was warm and gracious."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful place to get away. Our purpose was to rest and the Eden satisfied that goal perfectly. Located in the countryside, the Eden was easily accessed and was amazingly comfortable. The cottage does sit on the families property so it is not 100% secluded, but the peaceful area provided a serenity that we needed.
The amenities are wonderful. The kitchen was easily adapted to, the utensils were were clean and amazing for cooking our breakfasts and preparing our lunches. With tile floors the rugs were helpful and the bathroom floor is HEATED!!
Our interactions with Tom were sociable and friendly and he helped us feel welcome to explore the flowerbeds and green house.
Definitely worth looking into if you are in the Lincoln area!!"

Tom was quick to respond to a few issues we faced and fixed them immediately- for that we were very grateful! Also, the inside and outside were both very clean and fresh.
We found the wifi was not high speed and went in town to work on a few things online. This was not a big deal though, because we wanted the remote/secluded feeling anyway. We were disappointed, however, to find that the private residence and business were in such close proximity to the home. Some folks might love this, but as more reserved people, this was not the stay for us."

Stayed with kids","Perfect accommodations for our vacay! Our two families were in Lincoln visiting family. Crisp and Clean! Pictures and descriptions did not disappoint. The three bedrooms on three different levels were amazing. The two full private bathrooms were exactly what we needed. Comfortable couches and beds! Kitchen met our needs for food prep and meals. Great to have two different living areas. Kali & Eric were wonderful hosts, communicated well, and responded quickly. We will definitely stay here again if it isn’t booked on a return trip."

Home works very well for babies, toddlers and older children. Very comfy couch! Plenty of storage space for long visits. Uodated appliances and well worth the stay vs a hotel.

Group trip","Kali & Eric were so helpful and accommodating with an allergy to fragrances. They communicated well and quickly. The home was bright and comfortable. Our group of volunteer leaders consisted of three couples and this home gave us our own spaces as well as a place to gather together. We all agreed it was a great choice. We especially appreciated a path being shoveled in the snow to get from the driveway to the sidewalk. It meant we didn’t have to walk in the road to carry luggage and supplies in. The location doesn’t seem to have noisy weekend traffic which was awesome. We felt we could ask for things if needed. Thank you, Kali & Eric for being great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","This old farmhouse has been made over beautifully whether you look up at the ceiling or down at the floor. The kitchen is beautiful, they did a great Job. The place was spotless clean. It was great for us because we were visiting Nebraska Wesleyan University, and it was only two blocks away. The downstairs bedroom has its own living area, but it definitely still feels like you are in a basement. It is done beautifully though. The room in the attic does not have a door at the top of the steps and you have to walk with your head tilted to get to the bed. It’s kind of a fun space though. But as she mentioned, make sure you bring your own shampoo and soap. It is an overall nice place."

The house sits off a busy road but was pleasantly surprised to not hear much inside which was very nice! Gas stations are nearby and less than 10-minute drive to Walmart and Target. Kali had great communication and was very professional. :) *The only advice I have to those staying here, is that if you are a light sleeper, choose the main level bed or the upstairs bed vs the basement to avoid hearing people walk around. But even with that said, it is very cute and cozy down there!"

A lot of care was put into the directions via Airbnb, as well as the preparation of the space itself. The suite was cozy and had all the amenities we needed and wanted. It was a stormy weekend, so we also really appreciated the covered parking! Our host was attentive without being too present, which was just right for us. We’d definitely stay again next time we are in Lincoln!"

So I saw Luke’s air bnb and was like woah! This place looks sweet! Then saw the price… and instantly booked it!
The thing is when I got there, Luke was outside and we conversed for a bit and I could tell he was a very nice and trust worthy guy.
After our conversation, I went inside and I was honestly amazed by the the attention to detail that was put into that place, like by far the best bang for my buck I think I could ever ask for. Super clean and a very unique place. The bed was extremely comfortable and overall the experience of my stay was amazing. I will absolutely be staying here again if I go through the area again!
110% recommend to any going through the area!"

Stayed with a pet","This was the first time we took our two dogs to an airbnb and it was a great experience. Laura obviously knows dogs! She has dog towels and bowls and toys, and even left our pups some treats. The yard is securely fenced and easy to access from the house. But there is no 'doggy smell' in the house, and no dog hair anywhere. The house really is impeccably clean. People without pets would be comfortable here - it's sunny, nicely remodeled and decorated, but not fussy. The bathroom is roomy and the shower is a treat. There are a few nice touches that show Laura really does care about providing a welcoming experience. She's also a good communicator. The bedding is comfy but we did find the pillows to be uncomfortably over-stuffed and ended up using rolled blankets as pillows. The neighborhood is peaceful with people out walking dogs and kids walking home from school. Staying there was a nice homey Nebraska experience."

Stayed a few nights","The cutest bungalow ever and Laura was a great hostess and we communicated throughout the entire process. The place was very clean and comfortable. It was conveniently located within 10-15 minutes of almost everything. Very minimal amenities. Because of the very and dusty weather in Nebraska it would have been nice to have a washer and dryer. Especially having to take multiple baths during the day. We made it through.
We would like to recommend updating the bathroom lighting be switched to ""white"" bulbs in the vanity instead of ""soft"" lights. It's hard to get full coverage doing makeup for the events we attended. Also, you may want to consider updating the microwave - it's time.
Our stay overall was great and would definitely come back again! Thank you so much!"

Laura provided potty bags & tennis balls (so cute!) and we just thoroughly enjoyed our time at this Airbnb. We will definitely book this spot again!"

Stayed with a pet","Can't say enough positive things about Laura's stay. We rented this house over the Thanksgiving holiday and we felt right at home. Laura is very communicative--anything you need, she responds very quickly. You likely won't need to reach her, because she's already thought of everything!
Things I really appreciate about Laura's home:
1. It's sparkling clean and Laura takes COVID precautions very seriously.
2. This home isn't just dog friendly, it's dog FORWARD! She provides cloths for cleaning dog paws, poop bags, ceramic dog bowls, and instructions for covering furniture. Traveling with our pup is normally stressful, but not at those home. The sizable, fully-fenced yard saved us!
3. The house doesn't feel like a rental, it feels so cozy. We felt so welcome and at-home.
Will definitely stay again next time we're in Lincoln."

Laura has done such a good job of highlighting the original character of this quaint bungalow. It is a comfortable house to spend the night in. The beds are a good balance of soft yet firm. The sheets are so soft. The pillows are comfortable. The house heats up efficiently. You don't always find that in an older home. We slept well, and I enjoyed appreciating the beautiful wood features in this pretty house. I slept in the front bedroom, and heard no traffic noises at all. The neighborhood is quiet.

There’s a park just a block away and it’s easy to find. The home itself looks like it has the original woodwork of what appears to be quarter cut oak and oak floors. The home is immaculate, you could eat off the floors. But we chose to have breakfast outside on the patio table in the spacious and green backyard. The bathroom is lovingly and appropriately updated with a tiled walk in shower and a claw foot tub. The beds are very comfortable, too. Fragrance free and comfortable home on a tree lined street. Dog treats and chocolate made us feel welcome. Best stay ever!"

As check-in time neared, Alicia reached out to me for my ETA so she could be there to greet me. As I arrived I found it to not only be secure, but it was the most peaceful setting I could ever have imagined to recover at after two full days of driving. What an absolutely wonderful property and such gracious hosts to have found for my second overnight. Alicia’s husband, Steve, provided a thorough orientation of the guest cottage and suggested local fuel and food options. Although the property seemed so remote and removed, I was happily surprised to find a Costco gas station so conveniently close as well as an abundance of popular dining options. I wish I had more time to enjoy the area and Alicia’s guest cottage. If I ever find myself in the Lincoln, NE area and in need of lodging, Alicia’s place will be the first place I look for to stay."

Stayed one night",We were passing through Lincoln on our cross-country drive from Seattle to New York. It was only one night but we had a lovely stay. It was clean and comfortable and we woke up refreshed the next morning. It was exactly what we needed.

Stayed about a week",The Cottage was perfect for our stay. Greeted by the host and was shown around and tips for staying at the Cottage. Kitchen has everything you could need and then some. everything was comfortable and super quiet. Love the fresh air and it is close enough to downtown and yet still out of the city. The local cat greeted us everyday as we came and went. I will be booking this again if our daughter's event is back in Lincoln. It felt like home.

My only small gripe is that the shower is a small 3x3 foot space, so it may be a little difficult for taller people to comfortably shower in that space. It is not, however, enough for me to want to dock any points for the rest of the space."

The cottage is located on a beautiful property where fireflies lit up the night. A cat named Honey Bear greeted us. The beds were very comfortable and the cottage was well-lit. There was a reading light on every nightstand. The air conditioning and wifi worked great. You could hear the crickets outside. We would love to visit again!"

Stayed one night","We loved Alicia and Steve’s place!! So beautiful with the massive cottonwood trees and the acres and acres of beautiful land - we enjoyed a nice glass of wine watching the sun go down in lounge chairs provided by the hosts (thank you). The rental is more beautiful and modern than the photos, it’s clean, fully stocked and comfortable. Alicia and Steve have thought of everything!! The rental is super quiet and the king bed is sooo comfy!! The space is tranquil and just what we needed after driving for over 8 hours. We appreciated the clean filtered water and the other offerings. The living-room was really comfy and the TV was awesome and had a big picture! The shower was wonderful, with good pressure and even water temperature. The A/C was perfect and welcomed with the heat, as well as the fan overhead of the bed when we slept. Waking up listening to the birds singing their songs was wonderful!! Thanks Alicia & Steve we recommend your rental 100% & rate it full on ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️’s 🥰"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Alicia's place was terrific. We sent a message as soon as we arrived and Alicia's husband was out in just a couple of minutes to welcome us and walk us into the cottage. Everything was comfortable, clean, and just what we needed for our daughter's wedding weekend (I especially appreciated the pitcher of fresh cold water in the fridge!).
During our stay, my husband had lost his wedding ring and we looked everywhere, or so we thought. After we checked out, we received a message that they had found a ring outside by the front door and it was definitely my husband's! I was hoping it was still back at our house so I hadn't ask them to look yet.
We coordinated the exchange with one of my daughters that lives near Lincoln and had a very pleasant messaging conversation as we set that up.
Highly recommended and would come again. Many thanks to Alicia and her husband!"

Had a very clear walk through of the apartment by Steve upon arrival and as they live on an adjacent property they were always reachable.
Everything we could have wanted was there; the location is convenient for the city or countyside.
Lots of places to see in Lincoln only minutes away and parks & trails galore.
Loved our stay here as part of a 30-day road trip mainly exploring Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Wish we could have stayed longer as this is an exceptional Airbnb. Thanks for hosting us."

I really appreciated the quick overview Steve gave me upon arriving, as well as the helpful information packet that was left for me. It was also very kind of Alicia to think of me when the weather turned to make sure I would be able to get the snow removed from my car. This was everything I could ask for with my first solo Airbnb experience!"

Don’t get me wrong the views are gorgeous but the cottage is pretty close to the host’s main house. It didn’t feel quite as much as a rural escape as we were hoping. But if that aspect doesn’t matter to you this place is a great pick.

Good instructions were provided on how to use everything and it all worked flawlessly. Best equipped kitchen I have seen in a suite like this. Everything was very well maintained.

The location was good as far as being centrally located, however it was not a good neighborhood. The area and building are old and run down. Bring on the 4th floor was a bit inconvenient, but good exercise. All in all for the price it was doable."

Stayed a few nights","The room description was accurate. I appreciate Lisa’s special effort to let people know there are only stairs to access the room on the 4th floor which was not a problem for me. The condo unit was very clean. I was surprised to find out the sheet and the blanket on the bed was somehow adhere to each other and prevent any contact between the blanket and person who sleep underneath. This is not the case from my stays at other lodgings where blanket and sheet separates which lead to the concern if blankets were sanitized between guests.
The condo was dated and can have some equipment updates and new paint. Everything in the unit works, nonetheless. Bathroom light could be brighter for guests to see themselves clearer from the mirror.
Overall, Lisa was a great host. She is honest and very helpful to meet my needs."

Stayed a few nights","Do not let the outside of the building deter you! It looks a little rough on the outside, however once you get inside it is such a cute cozy place. I loved the original sink in the kitchen and the tub was amazing to soak in. We went down for the husker game and it was perfect walking distance to memorial stadium. The little extras made it feel such at home. Like the board games and little question cards. Loved how they had a fan in the bedroom as we can not sleep without the fan noise. They also had earplugs next to the bed. My only complaint being a woman is I would have loved to have had a full length mirror. Also wish they could make the parking spot number a little more visible as you have to park sideways. Would definitely stay again when we come back for another game."

Stayed a few nights","Great downtown location. Lots of stairs, good view. Place needs a little work from host but I would stay again.
I loved the place but host needs to replace AC in bedroom and address what looks like mold in bathroom around window. We got stuffy heads (mold sickness) whenever we were inside unit. Also small things like door handles were loose on a couple of doors.
With a little work this place will be amazing and I’m counting on host addressing issues as they said they would and I would love to stay again.
Other than the cons listed above the place was awesome, great views, kitchen was setup for cooking, host communicated well."

Stayed over a week","Lisa's apartment was lovely! Light, clean charmingly decorated, super comfy bed, well set-up kitchen. It had everything I needed, & lots of storage space (a huge walk-in closet). Very quiet too.Coin-operated washing machine in building's basement--I didn't use it.
Lisa is an exceptionally kind, helpful and responsive host--she even left a Pilates mat out for me :) And all instructions were very clear.
One caveat: If you are a more ""vulnerable"" traveller (I was a lone-travelling woman, no car), the neighbourhood may not be the most convenient. I needed to walk everywhere, and didn't always feel comfortable; it was quite a walk to Haymarket (groceries, restaurants, cafes, bars) but an easy walk to UNL campus, & The Mill cafe is only a 12-min. walk--but again, through not-the-most-salubrious neighbourhood. The building is not the most salubrious either--take Lisa's advice and use the external stairs to take you direct to the apt.
But the apartment was delightful. Lisa, a perfect host."

The space itself was very modern, clean, and cute. Great vibe. Even fun little (drinking) games. Perfect for a couple or small group as there’s an air mattress provided if needed. The complex was super quiet, we didn’t see anyone at all, which is great in my book. Everything we needed was provided. The bed was super comfy, too. Lisa was easy to get ahold of and super communicative and accommodating, as we did have the option to check in early and did a late checkout. Definitely 100% recommend staying here and will likely take advantage of this listing again for more concerts in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS. I learned the hard way.
We loved the interior layout of the Airbnb, but didn't realize that there was only a small window air conditioner for the entire space. It's the heat of summer, so the space was warmer than we were comfortable with.
We ended up getting a hotel room instead, because it was uncomfortably warm, and we were unsettled by the building itself. There are several flights of stairs and you have two options - interior (which is as unsettling as other reviews suggest) or the fire escape. I've recently hurt my knee and didn't realize what we were signing up for lol
I'm terrified of heights, and the ""back staircase"" was a contributing factor in our decision to not remain at the Airbnb. I didn't see anything in the listing about it, but it's on me for not reading through all of the reviews beforehand. There are also a few other reviews, regarding parking, host communication, and rodents that freaked us out."

Stayed with kids","The check-in instruction was clear, and the parking was convenient, just in front of the outside stairs. The communication with Lisa was easy, and I got quick responses.
The unit is very clean and cozy, but I developed severe contact rashes/ itchy from the comforter each time I touched it. Since it was hot and so we didn’t need it anyway. The building is old and smelly; hence, we mostly used outside stairs which was the most scary part for my son.
When we stayed in Lincoln, the weather was hot (over 100) even at night and humid (~ 60%), there was only one small window AC in the bedroom which could barely cool down the bedroom, and so the living room was hot all day long. Lisa offered to bring another window AC, but due to our crazy schedule, I didn’t see that message until the end of our stay, which was a bummer. If you are a hot intolerance person, you may want to give Lisa a heads up before you arrive."

Stayed a few nights","This is a nice condo in a great location. When you walk out of the front of the building, you are staring at the beautiful capital building and its nice lawn/gardens. The location is great for walkability, as others have pointed to. Lisa has provided all necessary accommodations, and the communication was clear and prompt. The apartment has everything you could need, and some additional nice touches (board games, nice cookware, nice furniture).
The downsides: The building itself has slight issues, and seems to be older with primarily student/young residents. It has a variety of smells throughout and does not feel very clean. Smokes smells do permeate into the condo. With young folks residing here, conversations/music persist through the night and walls are thin. There are a lot of people coming and going late into the evening, which did make me feel slightly uncomfortable."

Stayed one night","I stayed one night on a cross-country roadtrip and this was a great location for exploring Lincoln. It is right across the street from the capitol, which seems like the tallest thing in the state so it makes navigation very easy. Near bike trails, coffee shops, restaurants etc. Lisa was very communicative to make the whole process easy.
To address some of the negative comments I saw in other reviews: Parking is super simple, just look at the photos Lisa sends you. Depending on how you get into the lot it's the first spot that you see. Yes it's oriented differently than some of the other spots, but hopefully you can figure it out anyway. There also seems to be plenty of street parking.
The exterior stairs felt super safe to me. I hauled all my luggage up and down plus my bike and it was fine. If you're not used to metal exterior stairs, you can go around and use the front door. If you don't want to do four flights of stairs at all, you probably need to look elsewhere.
Some of the reviews called the unit ""run down"", which is not true at all. It's not new construction, probably from the 1920s, but the unit is well kept, nicely appointed, and 10% functional."

Stayed one night","Once you get inside the apartment it’s decent it’s actually really cute. I would say cleanliness is mediocre just because there’s nothing you can do to a building like that to make it 100% clean. I almost decided it would be safer to sleep in my car when I pulled up and walked in to a smell that I can’t even describe. It is definitely the most disgusting apartment complex I’ve been in and it comes to an Airbnb. Personally I wouldn’t pay a dollar to stay there it was so disgusting walking to the apartment itself that I felt like I needed to shower four times. Not to mention the next-door neighbors were up all night long smoking some type of drugs. I think meth. Be careful. if u need to stay there , bring mace"

Stayed a few nights","A real comfortable home base for a visit to Lincoln. It has some wonderful old-fashioned touches like a huge closet and an ironing board that folds up into its own wall cabinet (anybody else remember those?), but the kitchen and bathroom are totally updated. There was nothing I needed that wasn't there. Photos are accurate. Within 48 hours, the Lincoln temp ranged from 40s to 90s and the apartment temperature was always comfortable. Do be aware that the washer isn't in the unit."

Stayed a few nights","A clean and comfortable place. Every time I thought to myself that I needed something (a light right here, a throw blanket, a cup of coffee), it was there. Plus there were some great old-fashioned touches like a huge closet and an ironing board that folds out of a wall cabinet. (Anybody else remember those?) I was visiting friends and family in Lincoln, but the apartment would be good as a place to work too--good table and wifi. Note that the washer was not in the unit (I didn't need it, but you might)."

Stayed a few nights","I am happy to have booked the Capital Condo. Nice to be centrally located in Lincoln, and it was a good value for the space/features.
A word of warning though, you may get too hot up there (it's on the 4th floor) in the summer months, because there is only one A/C unit, which is located in the bedroom. I had trouble getting it to cool the whole place when it was 90 degrees out."

Parking issues: My car was confused with another car and got towed. So I only stayed one night.
Lisa was not helpful about the tow situation and only reimbursed for half of the tow, although it was her property managements mix up.
I would Not recommend staying here but especially if you have kids. Not a kid friendly place."

The unit is very clean and cozy. It can be a bit noisy since it's an old building and there's a heavy exterior door that will slam. Most people slowly close it though. Bed is very firm which was nice.

Stayed about a week","Upon moving into this place I started hearing noises, scratching and the sounds of fur rubbing against the walls. She has a piece of paper and painters tape seperating the outside from the inside. I go to the window unit and saw a rodents eye looking back at me, as it was scratching up against the paper. I kindly notified the host and she apologized and stated she understood and she recommended me to cancel and she will give me a full refund and have her husband take a look later. I canceled and Lisa is now playing Casper, the unfriendly deceiving ghost. The place was quaint though. I advise you to stay if you like quaint spaces, small tv and the chance rodent eye and friends may join you in your stay."

Stayed one night","I was looking for a place to put my head down during a road trip, but especially a place to do a little laundry.
I am not faulting anything for the stairs, I just missed the information, but…
The lock box is precariously hanging from a ladder over the 35 foot drop to the ground. The stairs are transparent, so anyone with a fear of heights beware! And, finally, there was no washer and dryer. I am sure there was a facility somewhere on site, but I don’t think that is what anyone is looking for when the ad says the unit has a w/d. Also, we had to use the photo of the parking spot to figure out the spot because the painting was so faded. If it were not for all the photos the host sent, we would have been lost. I was also unsure if I needed the parking pass in my car. I assumed so, so add an extra run up and down the stairs to put the pass in the car and to put the pass back in the apartment when leaving. One quick fix would be to put the lockbox at the bottom of the stairs instead of the top. Finally, a $64 room cost me over $120. I am new to Airbnb, but this is ridiculous. Am I paying resort fees or something? Hiding extra profit in “cleaning” is bad faith, like a $5 eBay auction with $30 shipping."

It is decorated mid-century, had many thoughtful touches, the bed was comfortable, and the entire condo was very clean. Lisa does a great job of communicating and even sent pictures ahead of time to make check-in a breeze. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the building, hallways, and stairs to get to the top floor. We recommend the outside stairs at the back of the building during nice weather since the condo is very near the top landing. This is a great value!"

Stayed with kids","The good: Lisa’s home was beautifully laid out and had just what we needed for our short stay. The instructions were clear, and she was fast to communicate with us when we needed assistance. No complaints.
The not so good: This isn’t on the host at all- it’s more my lack of foresight in my planning (which is why I still gave 5 stars). The apartment is on the fourth floor as is noted in the description (with no elevator)- and we were traveling cross country with a toddler- so not only did we have a few bags and things to bring in, but it was really cold with 4 flights of stairs to climb, plus fumbling in the dark over the lock box, a door that swings toward you to open, and a mostly student-occupied building which made the check in process an overwhelming one. I think if I was traveling alone or with one other person it would be fine, but this mama was at the end of her rope carrying a fussy toddler up a zillion stairs with heavy bags. We ended up leaving a lot of what we had originally planned to bring in in the car because of the stairs situation. Again, this isn’t on the host- the description was accurate. This was just my experience. I wouldn’t suggest it if you have a baby or toddler- or if you’re not a light packer, like me.
Would be happy to come back all alone though! Haha!"

Helps to think of this like a college apartment, because the place itself is super cute and clean, but the building where it is located definitely leaves something to be desired. The hallways are very dirty and smell like smoke and marijuana. I couldn’t smell that from within the apartment though (and I am super sensitive). Again, it was comfortable and cute once inside and quite comfortable! It’s not surrounded by downtown or a really cute neighborhood, but definitely able to walk to restaurants."

My wife and I stayed here for a night and had to bring bikes up to the room with us...not ideal as the room is on the top floor and there is only stair access, but the host was gracious enough to let me know about this ahead of time which made me happy. The building is a bit older and with that comes the smells of an older building. Once you're in for a bit, you get used to it and overall, it's pretty good value as far and my wife and I were concerned."

Note to future guests: if you're afraid of heights, use the front entrance!"

Stayed one night","Okay, so this was my first time using Airbnb and my goodness, this was a great first stay. I want to point out mainly the communication. Lisa provided the easiest check in with directions, photos for reference and much more. The place was so comfortable, and very clean. The bed.. omg the bed is so comfortable. The tub is deep so you can actually have a relaxing bath. The entire building is quiet.. as well as the area. No issues ❤️"

Stayed one night","So nice we stayed here twice! We used the condo as a landing pad on our way out West, and on our way back. Great location, nice place. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay at this apartment. I was in Lincoln for a week-long workshop, and I loved having this little oasis to retreat to. It was comfortable, clean and quiet, and just as adorable as in the pictures. The kitchen was well equipped, too. Other reviewers aren't kidding about the rest of the building. The halls are dingy and it looks a bit run-down. That said, I never felt unsafe, and the contrast between the sad halls and the perfectly decorated apartment was sort of entertaining to me. I would stay there again if I'm in Lincoln again!"

Stayed one night",Very cute place! Don't let the building out outside hallways fool you Lisa's place is very cozy and well decorated. I would recommend Lisa's place if you're in Lincoln.
