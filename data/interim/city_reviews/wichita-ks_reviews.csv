All the bath towels and face towels you'll need .
The beds were all very comfortable and the linen super soft . The living room has a very cool gaming table for entertainment needs. To top it off there is also a vending machine in the kitchen ! With snacks and sodas .
Would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone !"

Stayed one night",We enjoyed our stay at Tiffany and Christian's darling home in Wichita. The home is so thoughtful and they have everything you need for a nice stay. The vending machine made us laugh and is actually so practical for staying overnight if you need a quick snack or drink. We also loved the game table and that they named their plants. So cute. The beds were very comfortable and everything was very clean. Highly recommend. Thanks for a great stay.

Stayed one night","Very comfortable stay! Beds were wonderful, shower pressure was GREAT, kitchen was functional and offered everything to make a nice meal. I was not expecting a vending machine in the kitchen, lol, which I didn't use, but out of all my Airbnb's I've stayed at (one a week for 2 years) this was a first, lol. LOVED the decor and in love with the kitchen itself! I'm also a runner and was able to run a nice 3.5 mile run around the subdivision. Seemed like a very safe/nice neighborhood. I would 100% come back when I return to this area. I travel for work and use Airbnb's for all of it and this is deff one I'll be saving for future stays in this area!"

Group trip",What an amazing home for our gathering. We were meeting close friends and there was ample space for all of us to share time together. We adored the groovy decor and loved the personal touches like the turn table and records to play. Our friends’ teenager daughter and her friend were entertained with the board games and gaming table. The location was very quiet but also close to everything we wanted to do in the city. The host even accommodated us with an early check in so we could make our reservations. We are counting the days till we can return and enjoy the fire pit and backyard. Thanks again for a memorable weekend! Happy New Year!

The vending machine is very clever and great for convenience.
The deck and backyard are very peaceful and private. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy it!
Tiffany's communication was exemplary! Starting before we even booked. We had one problem during our stay that was quickly resolved because of her quick response."

Stayed with kids","Wish we could have enjoyed it longer! We got in late and there for less than 12 hours.
The video game table top board was really fun and entertained the toddler while we packed up.
The vending machine was cool but a little pricy, but you pay for conveniences. Also it would kick on and was very loud when trying to watch TV.
The beds were comfy. The master bed was a little creaky/wobbly but overall good night sleep.
Great location, right down the road from the zoo. It’s a really big and nice zoo (4+ hr experience)
Would stay here again and probably will!"

We loved all of the fun touches and the decor. We all enjoyed the game table and now my husband wants one. Even the Kleenex boxes were cute🤗.
We actually were sad not to have stayed another night to enjoy the lovely back outdoor space.
Tiffany and Christian were awesome hosts. They were very responsive and even alerted us to a potential issue from the guests before us. I appreciated that very much. It all turned out fine due to Tiffany and Christian's above and beyond effort to make our stay pleasant."

Stayed a few nights","My family and I really enjoyed this gem of a house. I really appreciate the effort they take to make their house a home for their guests. I've stayed in bigger houses but this by far has been my favorite as there is soo much to discover within this house. The oil diffuser was sooo relaxing and brought a calm to the house. The old school record player was my favorite as it makes the home so cozy and full of life. THE GAME TABLE was sooo much fun and we spent hours playing monopoly, you'll never want to play the actual board game again after playing it this way😅 The naming of their plants to all of the notes throughout the house to remind you where things are and what to do for check out, those were so helpful! The kitchen was stocked with the appliances and extras that you need. I appreciate the extra towels, cleaning supplies, trash bags and the list goes on. I greatly appreciate them opening their home for us and we would definitely stay again!! Thanks again for your accommodations!"

The location felt safe and convenient. As other reviewers mentioned there was a train that ran through late one night. I happened to be awake, so it did not wake me up and definitely did not make or break my experience.
We had a small issue with the tub and the owner was responsive within minutes.
I will definitely be back when the need arises."

We really loved the board Game In living room called (Infinity) it was very cool and brought back memories of the classic games we used to play growing up. The beds were so comfortable, the bathrooms were very stylish. I can go on and on but to sum it all up this house was just like the pictures! Thanks Tiffany & Christian 😃"

Group trip","Our stay was fabulous. The home is absolutely beautiful and comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more. We really appreciated all of the little touches and miscellaneous amenities throughout. We could not have been happier. We had many wedding activities to attend, so didn't have time to just explore too much around there. However, two places nearby that I would highly recommend to anyone staying there - Bella Vita Bistro on West Rd and Los Cabos Cantina/Grill on 13th. AUTHENTIC Mexican and most excellent! Bella Vita is where we had the rehearsal dinner, but the owners, food, atmosphere are amazing.
Tiffany & Christian were immediately responsive when I did have a small question. LOVE LOVE this place."

Tiffany was so incredibly responsive! We discovered the refrigerator was not cold after loading all of our groceries in!! Luckily we had a big cooler and they have a mini fridge so all was well. They had a new one installed by that evening! Wow! The beds were comfy. The house was darling and full of personality!! The only negative is both bathrooms were totally out of body wash! No biggie at all!! Overall…..would definitely rent again if softball brings us back to Wichita!!

The beds were super comfy, enough to where i actually reached out to the host for details on the bedding for my personal home! This place is located in a perfect spot for accessing the highways and is in a very pleasant neighborhood. I had no issues getting to where i needed to be all within just a few minutes. The cleanliness was top notch, host was extremely friendly and accommodating! We’ve stayed at a couple different places in Wichita when family events are occurring and this was by far the best one yet! I will definitely always come back to AirTrotter when in Wichita.. and will be telling our friends and family to use it for all of their Wichita stays as well!"

Stayed with kids","Very cute home.
The note about the train from the host is misleading. It’s true the train is within a mile, but it’s actually about 3 houses away, and you can see the train and its intersection from the front window. We woke up at 12:30AM to the sound of the train blowing it’s horn and traveling through. It was very loud and disturbing. I’m disappointed because the hosts’s note mentions that you wouldn’t be disrupted if inside, and it would travel during business business hours.
From the host:
“Please note - house is within 1 mile of rail road tracks. Train travels by max 2 times during business hours. This is not disruptive if inside.”
I came to this house to have a good nights rest (one night stay) and was very disappointed. I am shocked no other reviews mention this, so felt the need to let others know.
Otherwise the host communicated great, and the house is thoughtfully decorated with fun extras like the electronic game table. Because of the train, I would not stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The location is a quick drive to Delano and Old Town, and is in a relatively quiet neighborhood. It’s conveniently located near a large grocery store, and the Twin Lakes shopping area is nearby. The house has a great open floor plan for the living room, dining room, and kitchen, with lots of opportunity for natural light. The fenced backyard has a great deck area with a propane fire pit and ample seating areas. The house has a pleasing style mixed between a simple and elegant modern aesthetic, and mid-century modern flair. The house was well stocked with pots and pans, condiments, blankets, etc. Our only issues were some cleanliness issues and how they were addressed.
We arrived around midnight of the day of our scheduled check-in, having driven all day from our point of origin. We quickly put the children (a four-year old girl and five-year old girl) to bed, then went to bed ourselves. After getting up in the morning, we noticed feces smeared on the outside of the toilet bowl, near where the convex part of the bowl meets the vertical base of the toilet. We noted a few more cleanliness issues (hair, hair bands, and contacts in the bathroom, dead flies on a window sill, crumbs in the fridge, and a pile of food sitting in the back corner of the cabinet the trash can sits in). We had paid an above-average price for this Airbnb to avoid these sorts of issues, so we sent a message to the host to address it. In the meantime, we cleaned up most of these areas, as we had small children in the house, and we didn’t want them using a toilet with feces on the outside of it.
The host responded promptly, offered financial compensation, and to send out a cleaner to take care of the issues. The host attributed the cleanliness issues to using a cleaner that they usually don’t use. We declined the cleaning visit, as we already took care of most of the cleanliness issues, and we were focused on quality time with family (two of the guests in our group had flown in from overseas, and had not visited with family in the U.S. in five years).
The host wrote later that afternoon to us again. She attempted to send a video from the cleaner which would not load for us, that was purported to show a clean toilet, and asked if one of the children may have caused the feces on the outside of the bowl. The host claimed the refrigerator might have had frost built up and that what we thought were crumbs were not crumbs.
The host then stated that they did a walk through of the house after it was cleaned, which was not mentioned earlier in the message traffic. Then they said, “It’s just a tad bit suspicious that y’all wouldn’t let us come and make it right. At this point, I hope there haven’t been false accusations in hopes of getting your longer stay comped.”
We found that statement incredibly offensive and unprofessional for someone serving customers in the hospitality industry. We were spending the day with family, which included the first time an uncle had the opportunity to meet his five-year old niece who lives overseas. We preferred not to have a person in the house with us, cleaning, while we were trying to have family time.
Then the host said, “Also, we have cameras up outside for the safety of our guests and noticed y’all leaving the door open on many occasions for many minutes. Please be mindful of that. That’s how fly’s and bugs enter.” This seemed a bit petty, as a way to mention that we were being observed. And yes, we did leave the door open on a spring day when the temperature was pleasant and in the 70s.
After receiving the comments about us being suspicious and making false accusations, and that we were being watched on the security camera, we decided we had no interest in the host’s compensation offer, or continuing to support this host by staying in this house any longer than we had to. We communicated directly with Airbnb, arranged alternate lodging through Airbnb, and checked out of this house. We were refunded for the remaining days that we did not end up staying, and partially compensated for the stay where we had the cleanliness issues.
Ultimately, we were willing to resolve the cleanliness issues with the host – up until the point we felt personally offended by the host’s conduct."

We did wonder why there were no sheets on the beds? They had a fitted sheet but no top sheet, just the bedcover/comforter. We had looked forward to the local beers on tap but that wasn’t available because the owners said the keg had broken. They left some Wichita Brewing Co. cans in the fridge so that was a nice touch! We really didn’t spend much time there but it was sooooo cute and we hope to go back when the weather is a little warmer to enjoy the outside area!"

The Polaroid camera was a great idea for guests to use and share!
The kids enjoyed playing around the back yard and mural area. They made s’mores over the fire pit. The game table was a big attraction and the local beer on tap was an added bonus!
The Christmas tree was beautiful! Tiffani did a great job in decorating!!
The pack-n-play was nice to have for our 2 month old granddaughter, Evelyn!

The entire property was immaculately clean. This was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever visited. Hats off to the host 👏🏼
Kim and Brian were quick to respond to our needs. A+ customer service.
I only have one negative. This was very minor as we never felt it affected our stay. (I only mention this for couples looking for 100% exclusivity). The guest house and pool is connected to the main house. Very large windows from the main house overlook the pool. It does make one feel a bit cautious. However, the owners did a wonderful job of keeping a low profile. We never saw anyone or any movement inside the main house.
I give this listing an A+

She is so sweet, my friends and I felt right at home and ease."

Far enough away to feel like you're on vacation, but close enough to the city to be right next to anything you want to do! Loved the giant farm table and everything available that you would need. Clean linens and clean smelling home - all Norwex ❤️ overall great stay. Would like to return again!"

We enjoyed our stay in this peaceful neighborhood. Back deck was great for coffee in the morning or a glass of wine and conversation in the evening. French press and coffee beans made morning coffee special! We will def be back if our travels take us to Wichita. Thank you Tracey!!

Stayed about a week","When searching for accommodations during my stay over the Thanksgiving holiday week my biggest challenge was finding a place that had a dining area that could seat more than 4-6 people. That's basically why I chose to stay here; 2bd+, 2bath, and the large dining area. Tracey and Curtis were great hosts. They were easy to communicate with and went out of their way to accommodate our stay and our Thanksgiving gathering. Great location in a quiet area while being a few minutes away from a giant Walmart and other shopping and dining options. Felt like I was staying at an old friends place as opposed to a strangers Airbnb! I wouldn't hesitate for a second to book this place again in the future."

Stayed with kids","Oh gosh, what can I say about our stay at Tracey's lovely home? She was so helpful during while booking, and continued to reach out to welcome us prior to arrival. She ensured we knew how to check in and exactly how to get there! A delicious bonus: warm, homemade cinnamon rolls. We met with some out-of-town family, and the goal was simply to spend time together; we did just that. Tracey's home was cozy and well-stocked with everything we needed to cook every meal, the living room set-up was excellent when our toddler wanted to play with all five grown-ups, and we didn't feel crowded at all! There are several streaming options if you want to simply veg or have something on in the background, but if you want to explore the outdoors, the yard is a great place to do so. There is a FABULOUS stray cat that sometimes visits and for some on our trip, that was the highlight, haha. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and decorated beautifully, and the hot tub was GREAT! Don't wait, book NOW!"

d a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The comfortable beds ensured a restful sleep, and the cozy house exuded warmth and charm.
What truly set this place apart was the gracious host, who welcomed us with open arms and a genuine smile. Their flexibility and willingness to accommodate our needs made our stay even more enjoyable. The host's thoughtful touches were evident throughout the house, from the carefully curated decor to the little extras that made us feel truly pampered.
Staying here felt like stepping into a fairytale. We were surrounded by beauty, comfort, and a sense of belonging. If you're looking for a place that offers not just accommodation, but an experience, this Airbnb is a hidden gem. We left with our hearts full and our spirits lifted.

After our 3 day event, it was the best place we could ask for to relax. And, of course, that hot tub was so nice to have in the late evenings. Tracey was very easy to communicate with and always available. Extremely kind and thoughtful. We will be back, and we recommended it to our friends as well."

She deserves 5 stars in everything. She started communicating right the next day after booking, she made sure everything is in right place before our visit. She noticed that one of the bathrooms flush isn’t working fine, then she immediately called for a plumber to fix it and she also let me know that this isn’t working. I was impressed for her humbleness and genuine nature. Unfortunately the flush didn’t fixed but Tracey gave me an amazing offer that, she is happy to host us with full refund.
No regrets after visiting the place!
Oh, the CINNAMON ROLLS, ahhhh those were yum…. She made them of our choice and kept them in a tray by the time we visited. How lovely❤️.

Group trip","My family stayed in this home which was 7 of us. The host, Tracey, was amazing to work with!! Tracey communicated very quickly from the time we started looking at this airbnb. i sent Tracey messages from before we booked, during our stay, and when we left and she always responded promptly! This was truly a home and had absolutely everything you could possibly need from the kitchen, to games and entertainment, first aid, fans, grill, hot tub , extra blankets, pillows, washer/dryer, any condiment imaginable or spice needed, dishes and any cooking appliance you can think of. i have never been to a better equipped airbnb.
All of it was amazing, but the chemical free cleaning and norwex products used was refreshing to find and made us feel very safe. My family has lots of allergies and trouble staying at hotels with different cleaners and down type pillows . Literally every cleaner, soap, towels , and fresheners used were chemical free. This airbnb is somewhere you can know you will be safe from viruses and any chemicals that would typically bother you in a hotel.
The host was extremely accommodating and we got to visit with Tracey and her husband. They are great people ! We can’t wait to stay here again!!"

Stayed a few nights","I've had many excellent airbnb stays, and this one stands out as among the best of them.  Tracey's house is a clean, quiet, relatively secluded gem located in an older (~1940's-1950's?) low-density neighborhood in the extreme northern end of Wichita. Very close to I-135. The kitchen contained everything I needed to prepare my own food. On site laundry equipment with supplies. Everything I needed for a weeks-long stay was there. Communication with Tracey was easy, prompt, and never intrusive.
One major positive detail: With some of my past airbnb stays, descriptions & photos led to expections very different from what I arrived to find. But Tracey's house exceeded my expectations. Yes, her photos & description are accurate. But the potential disappointments I've learned to look out for never happened. No bad smells. No loud neighbors or road noises. The neighborhood is not sketchy. This is a detached house all to yourself. Lots of off-street parking.
Tracey is was a wonderful host. I very much look forward to future stays in her home."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful experience. We were there for a medical appointment for our son. We felt very safe and welcomed with the way Tracey handled everything for us. Her home was very clean, and you could tell she wanted to do everything she could to ensure our safety and comfort levels were met. We truly appreciate her helping us keep our family safe during the pandemic. Additionally, her cinnamon rolls were amazing - they were the best we’ve ever had. I’m craving more as I type. It was such a thoughtful extra benefit of staying that I think nicely sums up Tracey’s care for her guests. She wants you to feel at home, and we did."

We were greeted with homemade cinnamon rolls and a friendly smile. The home is spacious and had a home away from home feeling. Access to the highway was very convenient with a short drive to anywhere we wanted to go."

The decor was BEAUTIFUL and truly felt like a home. We did not need anything, Tracey made sure everything we could think of was there and ready for us. She even made cinnamon rolls that were delicious! We can’t wait to come back in the spring and see the gardens, but they were just as amazing in the snow. If it were possible to give 100 stars, I’d sure do it. Best stay of my life! Thanks again, Tracey!"

The couch is large and can sleep 2 more fairly easily as long as they don't mind sleeping on the couch. it is a beautifully decorated home and had everything we needed to cook and clean up after ourselves. There is an extra fride in one of the bedrooms, which is helpful for a party of 8 bringing food. The hottub was great! The host was very friendly and available for any questions. Would absolutely stay here again!"

We loved the fact that there are NO chemicals used in the house. The beds were comfy and the hot tub was just right for a cold night relaxation. She was reachable when needed and replied back to things in a hurry. We had a baby with us and she had some toys and a pack and play. This is a great house for a couple or a larger family. Anyone could stay here and be happy. We will definitely be coming back to this place more than once.

The house was clean, comfortable, and roomy. The backyard was lovely; we sat outside enjoying the spring blooms and watching the horses next door. Later, the hot tub was a perfect way to enjoy the evening. A perfect girls' getaway!"

The beds, couches, even chairs were so comfy, the whole home has a comfortable homey vibe! The backyard view, hot tub, fire pit, horses across the fence, fresh flower and food. I would recommend for couples as a weekend getaway or the house is large enough to fit a large group comfortably! I can’t say enough about our stay, our hosts and this beautiful home! The perfect location right on the outskirts of town, but close enough to food, stores, etc. Tracey & her husband were amazing, the home was more than amazing and we had such a wonderful weekend! 😊We will definitely be back again!

The house had everything we needed and more. I love that Tracey allowed us to host our family at the home and the children just loved running around the backyard, sliding down the slide, and seeing the horses across the fence on the neighbor's property. Truly a delightful place."

There is a carport to protect your vehicle from the elements. A suitable place for a few nights."

Stayed with kids","We had a family of 10 stay at Alex’s place for a weekend wedding so it was a full house. The house is exactly as it looks in the pictures and very beautiful. I love that it was close to stores and in a very accessible area with many places nearby Target was just about 5 minutes away and there was a playground that was perfect for my son not too far either. Getting on to the highway to get into downtown Wichita was so easy and a straight shot. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors that did see us were very nice and kind. Alex’s place was equipped with everything we needed in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and laundry. It really is a home away from home. A nice plus is that there were also toys for my son who easily gets bored of his toys, we ended up only packing one toy for him but the toddler toys and the little kitchen really kept my son occupied while I could get ready for the wedding. The decor is absolutely beautiful too! We drove from Illinois and got into town earlier than expected and Alex was very kind enough to accommodate us checking in sooner than expected- after a long day of driving , that was a little gesture that made a huge impact for us! It made such a difference in our rest since we had to get ready to go to a dinner 3 hours after we got into town! Alex is very responsive whenever we needed anything. I can’t say enough, THANK YOU Alex! We would definitely stay here again over and over again whenever in Kansas!"

Group trip","Alexandra is a top tier host! Her place was breathtaking and up to date. My team’s experience in Kansas one to remember because of her. We didn’t have to worry about anything while we were there. We were comfortable, safe, and at ease during our stay! Any time we needed anything she was able to accommodate to us in a timely manner and always offered to help. If we come back to Wichita, we’ll be looking forward to staying here again and we recommend you do the same!"

The kitchen worked for cooking some simple meals. Parking is covered and host is quick to communicate. A cold snap and a heating issue happened along with a loss of wifi. Host was able to respond and get a handy man to help resolve the issue.

Stayed with kids",We spent two weeks here and were very happy with our stay. The house had everything we needed and was great for a family. We have two teens and a toddler. The space for small kids was great because she could play while we were in the living room. The other rooms were far enough away that she didn’t want to go bother our teenagers and they didn’t wake her when she was sleeping. The house was larger and more spacious than I expected. It was spotless when we arrived. Alexandra was amazing at communicating with us and was quick to respond. She accommodated us in all the little extras we needed which made the stay easier. We will definitely stay here again.

The only downside was that the cost ended up being much more than was advertised, but that could have more to do with Airbnb loopholes than these specific hosts. We would consider staying here again though even with that price jump in mind. Thanks Alexandra!"

The unit is 3 blocks from the arena. So, we grabbed dinner from the BBQ restaurant downstairs and ate in the unit. Placed foosball, shuffleboard, and darts in the unit for fun. Walked to the arena through a downtown square and park that has recently been remodeled. Beautiful area. Enjoyed the concert. Walked back at midnight and felt totally safe. Grabbed a beer at the brewery across the street for a minute and then slept in a comfortable bed. The next morning walked back through the square to a highly rated brunch place and had a great time. This place helped us enjoy a great experience in Wichita."

This spot provided a great place for all of us to relax between games and slept us all comfortably - not to mention the location is unbeatable for Wichita. Really appreciated all the touches to make it feel like home and provide a unique experience - the games (darts, shuffleboard and foosball) were enjoyed by all, from my 17 year old cousin to my 79 year old grandfather!

They were very personable and pleasant to talk to in the evenings. Their dog Kumba is super friendly and a typical lab pup who just wants attention and play time but very well mannered. Their home has the charm of an old home that you don’t find much of anymore. If I make it back down to Wichita I would definitely stay with them again!

Their place is super cozy and I was able to rest and focus, and practice my instrument! The hosts are very hospitable and truly I couldn’t find a better place to stay. If I ever visit again, I’ll be happy to stay here!"

They were very good at respecting boundaries but opening their house at the same time. We weren't really at the house too much during the day because we were exploring all that Wichita has to offer. When we were there, they enjoyed listening to what we did that day and giving us recommendations for the next day. I enjoyed reading the guest book that was in the room. Aaron is a musician, so there are guitars everywhere. Some guests have enjoyed listening to his music. I was looking forward to hearing him sing, but unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short to explore more of Kansas. Overall, I'd give them a 10/10 and highly recommend them. Thank you, Laura and Aaron!"

The bed was VERY comfortable along with the linens and comforter. The house is older so creaky floors and older interior but honestly, it made the experience that much better. There was coffee readily available for us in the room and they even had water for us. Instructions that were given to us prior to checking in were clear and concise.

Upstairs bedroom was easy to access, up a staircase immediately inside the front door. Privacy was not a problem. Aaron and Laura are wonderful. I can see why they get super host status. Price was great. We'd go back without concern of any kind."

Stayed a few nights","It was more than just a comfortable bed and a warm room, I was able to make a meaningful connection with very kind people, Aaron is a musician, Laura…has a beautiful voice.
The location was just about perfect as I could ride by bicycles from their house to the Keeper of the Plains every day I was there. You’re all of 3 minutes from a very nice local coffee shop and pizzeria. It’s all there.
There’s so much history in their house as well…a Bible with written notes from the 1800’s…those little things mean a lot to me. And I got the opportunity to bond with 3 playful dogs…5 new friends in all…I say it was well worth it.
Plus I got to do a 5 minute stand-up routine for Aaron and Laura. Memories were made…thank you again, Namaste

It's maybe a 10 min drive to downtown so it's perfect if you want to be nearby but not right in the middle of things. The room itself is cozy yet spacious and has really nice touches. The only slight issue was that the bedroom doorknob can be tricky to close/ latch properly. Laura and her husband are such friendly and nice people, it was pleasure chatting with them! Lastly, the three dogs are hilarious - they are so eager to greet you and they bark at first (friendly barking) and then quickly become comfortable around you."

Conveniently located near the main road, convenience store and some restaurants. It is located near train tracks so if you're noise sensitive bring good ear plugs because the train runs consistently and throughout the night while blowing the horn. Otherwise it's very quiet area. Follow Tim's driving instructions, G00glemaps wasn't reliable. Glad he sent screenshots. Would definitely stay again when visiting Kansas."

Stayed with a pet","Get over any misconceptions you might have about staying in an RV park. Everyone we ran into & chatted with were friendly & absolutely lovely.
Tim’s tiny home is adorable and spotless. It had everything we needed for a long weekend visiting family.
Plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. Cleaning supplies are available. Tiny house, huge shower. The bathroom is surprisingly spacious and spotless. The coffee maker is a Keurig, so if you travel with your preferred blend, pack pods.
We have 3 small, blind, elderly dogs. The tiny house was a perfect size for them - they were always in sight & they didn’t have to navigate multiple rooms or stairs. There’s even a ramp from the porch to the driveway!
The RV park is close to the highway & convenient for getting anywhere in the area.
There are several small restaurants nearby. We recommend the Thai place just across 31st street.
Pro tip: leave the ceiling fan on in the winter. It circulates the warm air from the mini split."

The Tiny Home had everything I could possibly have needed, it was clean and comfortable. The Welcome Notebook included lots of helpful information. If my dog could vote... he'd give a 5-STAR rating, too! Thank you so much, Tim."

You are near train tracks which for us was not an issue, but if your a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. We would definitely stay in any of Tim and Charlotte locations again."

The unit was as advertised, extremely clean upon entry, and convenient for those passing through or working in Wichita. And you can't beat his prices!!!!"

The farmhouse has been completely renovated and the decor compliments the surroundings. The kitchen is fully stocked! I cooked every meal during my stay and didn’t need a thing. The bathroom is nicely appointed with nice fluffy towels complete with soaps, etc. The bedroom was my favorite… the bed was super comfortable, the linens were nice and soft and extra outlets for charging electronics came in handy. The host has truly thought of everything to ensure an amazing stay!
Diane is a gem! Super fast responses always. She’s helpful, kind and truly cares that her guests only have the best experience in her home! This is my 2nd visit and I already can’t wait to come back!"

She brought us over some fresh farm treats to make our stay more pleasant. I would recommend Clearview cottage toady couple looking to getaway from the Urban hustle bustle. You will be enchanted just as we were."

I had a flat tire and her husband came to help me; it was much appreciated; and even gave me local recommendations to get it fixed. Very kind people! Even though you’re surrounded by cows, you don’t really even hear them. I heard them maybe 3 times; and that’s because moms were calling for babies. Close to the highway; yet far enough out it’s peaceful. It’s about 2 hours away from the pioneer woman stuff. Close to parks for walking or place. It’s close to entertainment places. Diane really is the host with the most; she’s thought of everything! I’m definitely coming back!"

Stayed a few nights","This little cottage is amazing! The fixtures and decor are all high end, and the rooms are decorated to perfection. The kitchen is well stocked, the dining area has a gorgeous greenhouse window that provides a terrific view of the farm and cows. The cottage is a little remote, but we really like that. We were only 10 minutes away from Wichita, so we easily accessed all of our activities. I highly recommend this place, and I hope we have the opportunity to stay at another time."

The place was extremely clean and everything was comfortable. My wife made mention about how it was obvious that they go the extra mile to use good detergent for their linens, as everything smelled good. One thing I appreciated was the check out instructions were simple. I have stayed at places with a check out checklist of 25 things and this was short and sweet.
To top it all off, the game room was a big hit with my kids during our down time.
Would definitely recommend."

Quiet neighborhood, with off the street parking. Kitchen had enough dishes, but few pans. Comfortable beds and linens. Plenty of nice towels in the bathroom. Thank goodness for instructions on how to work the tub/shower! Nice to have laundry available, but washer is LOUD, as is light/fan in the half bath. Weather was not conducive to using the lovely outdoor space in the backyard or the unheated “game room” in the unfinished garage space. Not a luxury place, but comfortable and homey."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean, the furniture and beds were comfortable and the full bath and towels/linens were very nice. We really enjoyed the neighborhood as it was easy to take a good walk and there is a nice park nearby. Emily was very responsive to any of our questions and it was easy to check in and check out.
The kitchen was well furnished and having two bedrooms was a plus for us. It is a quiet, safe neighborhood with easy access to freeways and main roads and a great place to stay because it is near- but not too near- to downtown. We would love to stay again if we travel to Wichita again."

Stayed over a week","Don’t b deceived by outside, the interior is beautiful! It is a cozy townhome and is well designed. The kitchen is enough equipped! We had a long stay over there, Emily was quick to always respond. If you’re looking to stay in the center of town with Airport being few miles away, and the East shopping malls being few miles away as well.
It would be better if there is more sound proofing and if there is a better way to distinguish between two units. I would definitely come back here. Emily is a wonderful host and is thoughtful with her interiors!"

The place has everything you need, with a wonderful bed. The outside patio/garden area is terrific...relaxing, quiet and comfortable. Upon arrival we were greeted by our hosts and within minutes felt like we were chatting with friends. They were available and helpful, but allowed us our privacy. Really can't say enough positive things about the place, location, comfort and hosts. Thank you Dottie and Jerry for more things than we can count that made our long weekend amazing."

Stayed a few nights","This was by far one of the BEST Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Definitely my favorite place to stay in Wichita. The area is super safe, Dorothy & Jerry made me feel completely at home, & I was able to have my own separate space, & a much needed place to rest/recover while feeling under the weather.
The kitchen space is amazing! ANYthing you could ever think of is right there at your fingertips.
They have thought of every, single thing that elevates an Airbnb stay from being ‘just a place,’ to— “Home away from home.” For example- portable fan, plenty of extra towels/ linens, premium hand soap, Kleenex, bedside lamp, etc.
My absolute favorite part was their next-level thoughtfulness— homemade cookies/muffins, fruit, milk in the fridge, condiments, juice, hot/cold cereal, & coffee/tea.
In my 3+ years of monthly Airbnb stays around the country— It doesn’t get any better than this! :-)."

Your place was a comfortable home away from home even when we weren’t feeling well. 😏 It couldn’t be any cleaner and we appreciated the abundant gourmet treats in addition to plenty of food staples. Also, the motion sensitive lights and reflective tape on the way to the door were very necessary, at least for us. Those are just the most thoughtful & appreciated items-our whole list of pros would be much longer and include things like your availability, quiet neighborhood, plenty of pillows, blankets and towels and quickly cleared snow.

The mother-in-law apartment is spotless, has a full kitchen, baked goods thanks to Dottie that are out of this world, and a very comfortable place to be. Their back yard is like a secret garden, with a wonderful deck. Jerry even printed and wrote out special instructions for me to get around some of the construction areas! If you want to visit, Dottie and Jerry will be there. If not, they are perfectly fine with that as well. Their place is very easy to access. I truly enjoyed my stay."

Stayed a few nights","If you have any seconds thoughts about staying here, I'm telling you this is the right, and only place to stay in Wichita. Jerry and Dottie are amazing people, full of stories and knowledge of the Wichita area for first time visitors. Dottie took the time to bake delicious sweets, and the spot was stocked up with nearly everything I needed for an entire trip.
It's located in a very nice part of town, and is quiet with an amazing backyard that they are kind enough to share with travelers. Shops are very close, and easily accessible for anything you need.
The hosts are more than welcoming to spend hours chatting and having a drink, offering locations to visit. At the same time, they are aware of your time, and courteous to let you focus on your trip.
There's a reason this spot has 5 star ratings up and down. This was without a doubt, my favorite place to stay, and if the hosts had an Airbnb in every town, I'd never choose another place. Thanks Jerry and Dottie!"

Stayed a few nights","Was such a pleasure meeting with Dottie and Jerry!! They were incredible hosts!
After hearing about my delayed, sometimes scary flight (due to weather). I told them I was looking forward to relaxing with a glass of wine, Jerry asked if I liked red and I answered yes, Dottie then presented me with a nice bottle of red wine.
Their baked goods were delicious 😋
The following day I had an upset stomach and they brought homemade turkey soup. It was just what I needed.
And if that wasn’t enough after learning my husbands flight would be later than expected they allowed me to stay for a later check out.
Their hospitality far exceeded my expectations.
Bless you both!, And again thank you for everything 💜 I highly recommend staying here."

We were in town for the weekend for a convention in Wichita and we didn’t want to pay convention center hotel prices. This was the most perfect place that really felt like we were away from it all, even though the living quarters shares the same wall as the main house. Don’t let that turn you away!! We felt very safe and comfortable the whole time. Dorothy also left us a magazine with suggestions on places to go and try out. For someone who’s never been to the area, I felt like we had the best insider tips of where to eat and how to get around. We will definitely be back again :)"

Dorothy made us feel at home.
Very nice home, cozy place and everything we could need was already there.
Everything in that house was soft, from towels to carpets, the bed was a comfortable king size.
The kitchen was equipped with everything for breakfast and cooking, and in the fridge there are also several drinks, milk, water, beers.
Thank-you Dorothy !"

The house had everything you can ask for. The location was ideal and was a short drive from the malls and the restaurants.
We would love to stay here again whenever we visit Wichita again."

And it is stocked with everything you might need (a full kitchen). If you are looking for a residential location in Wichita with very respectful and accommodating hosts, look no further. You will be very satisfied."

Stayed a few nights","Dotty is an excellent host who provides everything you need without you having to ask. We came in after dark and you could see the address easily and outdoor lights came on so we could see easily. Dotty even had homemade muffins and cookies for us. She really plans ahead.
The apartment is well laid out. The bed and linens are beautiful. The backyard garden and pond are relaxing and delightful. Dotty’s Is the best value I’ve found."

Stayed a few nights","My mother celebrated her 100th birthday on October 2nd and Dottie and Jerry went so far beyond my wildest dreams of making her birthday memorable that it was way beyond my comprehension. The amenities were wonderful, the homemade treats were heavenly, the peaceful atmosphere so perfect for her. I went grocery shopping before I picked her up and was amazed to see everything that was already there for us. I wish I had looked there first but on the other hand that would have been unfair of me if I took advantage of their generosity. The only thing that I didn't find that I could have used was a needle!! The apartment was easy for her to get around, and both Jerry and Dottie went out of their way to make sure she was comfortable and were right there to help me. They made sure that I went in first to make certain that it would be the right place for her. The garden, complete with pond and beautiful waterfall, is gorgeous. Mom told me to make sure they know that she will be back on her 200th birthday! They brought her a pretty cupcake with lighted candle, a card, and sang Happy Birthday to her. Her smile was wonderful to see. I am SO GLAD that their place was the one that I chose for my first experience with Airbnb. I highly recommend their place for anyone looking for the perfect place in Wichita."

Anything you would need was available down to baggies in the kitchen! We will definitely go back when we are in Wichita.

The private entrance through a lovely backyard is very convenient and is well lit at night. Their layout exceeds anything you find at an all suite hotel. This is all topped by the fact that Dorothy and Jerry are very considerate and gracious hosts ! We will be back again !"

As a guest don't have to worry about anything really, because they provide just about everything you need or happened to forget.. even home baked goods to welcome you!
It is centrally located and has quick access to local restaurants and shopping. The place itself is quiet and private for those times you want to stay in.
Dorothy's place made a long work trip feel like a vacation! I loved it and plan to be back next year."

Stayed a few nights",Dorothy was a wonderful host and so was her husband. She bakes wonderful homemade goodies. They literally think of everything you could need. There is a TV in the kitchen. They are both smart Tv's and they really try not to bother you unless you are passing by the back door and then Dorothy just makes sure you don't need anything and she even offered us more baked goods. I couldn't get over how nice and wonderful the little house was. It was so quite and relaxing. Their host book is amazing especially the reviews they give of the places they have been to and eaten at. They even include brochures with coupons on the back. It was a wonderful relaxing weekend for my husband and myself. It was much needed for us as being dual military. The communication between was wonderful. They are a great couple and we really do look forward to coming back again.

Stayed a few nights","We spent two nights with Dottie and Jerry and enjoyed an exceptionally wonderful stay. The apartment is beautiful, comfortable, and restful. They went above and beyond anything we could have asked for in anticipating and providing for any and every need we could have had. Homemade cookies and muffins, a stocked refrigerator, and pre-measured coffee packs for the perfect cup o' java are only the beginning of a long list of amenities. They even helped me with our luggage and medical equipment, something I certainly didn't expect! We travel to Wichita occasionally to visit family and friends, and we hope we will always be able to stay with Dottie and Jerry. We only wish we had had a more relaxed schedule so we could have enjoyed more getaway time in the garden. I hope they won't change a thing...it's perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","PACK LIGHTER, STAY LONGER. That is what I'll do next time I stay at Dorothy's. There is no need to go out for breakfast as everything you need is right here, from fresh milk and cereal to fruit and yummy home-baked muffins. And plenty of coffee! There's a body wash/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower, fan in the bedroom, extra pillows and blankets, and soft bath towels. The bedroom is dark and quiet...something you will not find at most hotels. Jerry has done an amazing job with the lush, private oasis outside the entrance. Plan to linger in this courtyard. This place far exceed my expectations. Dorothy and Jerry were warm and friendly hosts. This place is a gift and blessing. I definitely want to return, with my husband next time, but will need to plan ahead, as the word is getting out about this lovely place!"
