Stayed a few nights","Our group of four loved our stay in Savannah!! Janet’s place was perfect for two couples…a beautiful living room for tv watching, huge eat-in kitchen, and it was nice we each had our own bathroom. It also had a washer and dryer, that we all used, right off of a smaller bedroom with a little library. From the front porch we could see Forsyth Park, and enjoyed watching all the activity at the park. We would definitely stay here again. The location is amazing, and very close to restaurants and things to see in Savannah. Highly recommend!!"

Group trip","The location was key, we loved being so close to the historic section of Savannah. There is alot of foot traffic in front of the house during the day, but the nights were quiet while we were there. We used the front porch every afternoon. The off street parking was very important as parking is very limited.
The house is “historic” so there are things that one must expect. We had one person in our group who was recovering from a broken foot and was using a cane. Floors were uneven in areas so she had to be wary of where those spots were! Just an observation, not a complaint.
The outdoor area in back seemed a bit winter weary so we never did hang out there. It was our first visit to Savannah and we all want to return and part of that is due to our stay at this house!"

Impeccably clean, perfectly designed and appointed; we wanted for nothing. From cooking and bathing to laundry, the place had everything we needed. From the moment we walked in it felt like home. You cannot find a better location than the Suites at Forsyth. It was convenient to everything with a trolley stop around the corner. Janet was responsive and offered great recommendations. She checked on us often. We had the most fun just sitting on the front porch and relaxing. Absolutely no complains and probably the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. 10 of of 5 stars!!!"

Stayed a few nights","My family of four had totally enjoyed our stay in Janet’s Garden Suite. The Suite is cozy, spacious and well renovated, with details well thought through for guests. The place is very well located and is easy accessible to shops, restaurants and many attractions in Savannah. If I were to make a small recommendation, it would be good to have chopsticks and porcelain spoons in the kitchen for guests from China and Asian Countries. Overall, a great place that I would recommend to my friends.
Janet's Garden Suite is cozy and meticulous, next to Forsyth Garden, which is very convenient for traveling, shopping, dining, and highly recommended.😀"

We were all school, friends, grew up together, and we always sat around our kitchen tables. Five women with adequate bathrooms as well! I would definitely return to this property in the future!"

Beds were super comfortable and the white noise machines in every room were a great touch. It was a 1-mile Uber ride to the river, so not too pricey and really a nice location."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing stay - we've been to Savannah before and being off the main drag of the historic district/river but right next to Forsyth Park was perfect...the front porch is where we spent most of our time when ""at home"". People watching fantastic but still felt private to read and enjoy the breeze. BEDS and PILLOWS heaven. Slept super well, and the noise machines in each bedroom nice touch (I listen to the ocean on my phone app usually for background noise when traveling). Kitchen well stocked (we didn't cook but could have) and spacious, 2 bathrooms fantastic & hot water always in shower! Super clean and comfortable in living room and I napped on the daybed in the side room off kitchen. Back porch private and the side gardens beautiful with several seating nooks to enjoy. Private Parking stop a bonus. Communication with Janet super easy and response time quick."

The position of this house is great, right by Forsyth Park and walking distance of all the general historic district. We highly recommend it. Janet, our host was quick to respond and available and made sure things were fine."

The home is spotless and so comfortable. The retreat in the courtyard was amazing- even in the rain- it was perfectly soothing. Having a parking space assigned to the unit made us feel at ease about being out till later in the day. We will definitely be back to Savannah soon- and we won't stay anywhere else!"

The area was good. For the most part everything else was clean & kept in order. Definitely need some upgrading Thanks"

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED the Garden Suite and had a wonderful time using it as the home base for our “girls trip” . A beautifully restored home in the perfect location right off Forsyth park. Communication with the host was OUTSTANDING especially given the potential of hurricane Elsa impacting our arrival (luckily it didn’t). Very clean with a good supply of kitchen basics and nice amenities (makeup remover cloths, basic first aid supplies, bug spray, extra paper goods). We loved coming “home” after a long day to a glass of wine and a playlist of our choosing on Alexa. Plenty of TV viewing options with the Firestick as well. The information book provided is full of helpful information for your trip. Kroger is a 3 min walk down the street and there are several options for meals and/or drinks in the neighborhood. We didn’t make it to the nearby coffee shop that looked amazing (hopefully next time ;) but the bar in The Mansion on Forsyth across the street is beautiful. The backyard is gorgeous but given the season really buggy so we weren’t able to enjoy it as much as we would have liked. I bet it’s perfect on cool fall or winter nights. We did spend several evenings just lounging on the porch enjoying a beautiful evening in a stunning city. I’ve stayed at multiple Airbnb locations and The Garden Suite is now one of my favorites. Highly recommended!"

It is roomy, with a king in one bedroom, a queen in the other and a single bed tucked away in a side room, the living room opens into a spacious kitchen and dining area. We took advantage of the front porch for morning coffee one day and the back porch dining table for breakfast another, and cocktails in the shady garden area. The location is perfect, within a block of Forsyth Park and Collins Quarter at the Park for lunch is practically out the front door! It is far enough away from the downtown traffic, but an easy walk to restaurants, shopping and all the historic sites."

Traveling with my in-laws, my husband and I still felt we had our own private place with a separate bathroom and bedroom, and my in-laws could not have been more pleased as well!

Group trip","My family and I had an amazing stay thanks to the exceptionally high quality of the home created by Janet and her team!
Everything was spotlessly clean, well organized, clearly labelled, and worked perfectly. I felt like I was staying at home, because I didn't have to go hunting for anything- there was always a helpful sign pointing the way. The apartment is also very tastefully decorated- if you like to take vacation photos you will not have anything to hide here.
The location is perfect- close enough to the riverside and other attractions to walk, but not at all in a noisy, tourist-y area. The garden is beautiful as well, and obviously gets a lot of tlc. We felt like locals, and we kept saying it was time to ""go home"" instead of ""go back to the hotel.""
Janet has done a tremendous job on the garden suite, and I can only assume her other properties are exceptional as well. I highly recommend any of her homes. Janet gives AirBNB a good name, and I look forward to staying with her whenever I return to Savannah."

Visited the local farmers market and loved the convenient location. The amenities were great and we enjoyed utilizing the beautiful yard during our stay too. We liked how the home was located within 15 -20 minute walking distance of most attractions but was in a quieter location. Would highly recommend and will definitely visit again.

Group trip","We were thoroughly impressed with the Garden Suite. It is a lovely house in the Victorian district of Savannah just steps away from the big park. The suite, itself, couldn't have been more perfect for our ""girl cousins"" weekend! The house has a nice front porch, good for people watching. The bathrooms, kitchen, living room, and bedrooms were all super clean (very important to me) and they were also very well decorated with modern touches and colors. On the other hand, the suite still managed to maintain some of it's Victorian charm with hardwood floors, and chandeliers from that time period. Janet gave us good information on where to dine, and what to do in Savannah which was extremely helpful. I will never stay anywhere else in Savannah again. Thank you, Janet. Lauren from Orlando"

Besides that I will definitely recommend This location. Janet was a great host with prompt responses to questions.

The 2 bed/2 bath set-up worked well for us and our adult daughter. All areas of the condo were comfortable and well appointed. We especially appreciated having a dedicated parking spot, as street parking is not always easy to come by. We will definitely consider staying here again on future visits."

The linen and towels were good quality and the kitchen was well stocked with glasses etc.
The only thing which we weren't
aware of was the second bedroom did not have a window which didn't really bother us. Also the main bedroom did not have a privacy blind so we had to close the curtains for privacy. Again not a big deal for us.
We would not hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend it.

The location was very close to Forsyth Park and a very nice walk to downtown and the river. We ate at a different restaurant every night and never had to drive to any of them. I just can't recommend this location highly enough.
When we arrived at the property there was another vehicle parked in our allotted spot. We drove into Savannah during the annual jazz festival at the nearby park. We could not find parking anywhere on the street ( because of the festival). I called Sarah and she directed us to another reserved spot less than a block away. her response was immediate and Michael came over to check on us and make sure we were able to find parking. I thought that was very kind of them. Two thumbs way up!!"

It was just the two of us for most of the time and there was plenty of space for us to work and relax there. They put lots of lighting in - which is good because as a garden apartment there are limited windows. Neighborhood was lovely and quiet. We were close to groceries and some restaurants and loved our early morning walks in Forsyth Park just 2 blocks away. Not even that far from Bay or Broughton Street, but it was so hot the time we were there we didn't walk that far too often. Would highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","We would definitely recommend the Amethyst Abode for a stay in Savannah. The location was great: a residential area just a few blocks from Forsyth Park and not far from all the historic sites. A Kroger grocery store and Starbucks were around the corner.
We appreciated having a dedicated parking spot in the private lot right behind the unit, but there was always plenty of free parking on the street in front. We took an Uber to River Street and other sites.
The unit was very clean and well-appointed and came with complimentary snacks, K-cups and creamers, and toiletries.
My friend and I appreciated having two King rooms with two separate bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable. One bath had a walk-in shower and the other had a shower/soaking tub with high sides.
Being on ground level made loading and unloading easy, but we could hear people walking (sometimes stomping) in the unit above us. Otherwise, the Abode was quiet. The hosts were very responsive."

Stayed a few nights","I can't begin to say enough about this GORGEOUS home, or it's FABULOUS hosts. For SCAD parents, this home is a 3 minute walk to the Deloitte Foundry and a 6 minute drive to ""The Hive."" It's a quick 2 minute walk to Kroger, a 5 minute walk to Collins Quarter at Forsyth Park where they serve a phenomenal brunch. There are lots of things to do nearby and within walking distance.
Directions to this beautiful home and entrance into it were perfectly detailed and easy to understand. Sarah was always quick to respond before, during, and after our stay. The home itself was GORGEOUS and perfect for our needs. Attention was paid to every detail to ensure our comfort during our stay. The beds were THE BEST we have ever slept in. We literally ""melted"" into bed each night. Sarah made sure that we had a little basket of goodies upon our arrival. Quiet, peaceful, and enjoyable stay was had by all 3 of us. The floors in this home are stunning. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the bottom apartment (slightly below street level) of a three-story townhouse. Another apartment is in the upper two floors.
The apartment, furnishings and appliances all seem brand new. Decor is modern. Chairs and beds are comfortable. Paint seems brand new too. The floor has been done in a faux marble sort of effect, which -- to say the least -- catches your eye when you first see it, but you get used to it quickly.
The host was very responsive and answered every message quickly.
The same host operates the upper apartment. During my week's stay there were three different families renting for a day or two each above me. Depending on the number and energy of the children there could be some foot noise from upstairs. Not really that bothersome, and it's no one's fault: It's just inherent in the way the building is constructed. Otherwise the apartment is quiet and pleasant.
Very pleasant stay."

Clean, trendy styling, comfy bed, has everything you need, and it’s in a great location right next to Forsyth Park and about a mile from the river. We pretty much walked everywhere!"

If you are a light sleeper, bring a sound machine. The windows do not block any noise, and you will hear traffic or talking on the street. Sarah provided excellent recommendations for things to do and places to eat. Breakfast at Sentient Bean(excellent and affordable) , dinner at Common Thread (beautiful and fun), as well as Cotton & Rye."

Stayed one night","The space was great. Beautiful and lots of light and very clean. You do you have to walk up a couple flights of stairs, but worth it. I would only recommend two people staying at the most. It is on the north end of Forsyth Park, so yes, you can walk anywhere in the historical district but it’s a bit more of a walk than staying centrally or closer to the River. But the park is fantastic and the walk is gorgeous. Everything was clean and beautiful in the room, and they left a bottle of wine and snacks which is an added touch. We felt safe and comfortable and it was definitely worth it. We found a parking spot exactly in front of the home. Highly recommend."

We were able to walk all over historic Savannah. Think we walked 7 miles that one day. Michael & Sarah recommended several places to eat, and enjoyed them. This was really great because my wife is gluten free. Really enjoyed our stay and Michael & Sarah responded quickly when we had questions. Wonderful place to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary."

I felt comfortable right away and definitely not skeeved out like I've felt at other places. We even joked about being single with no kids and living in a cute little place like this. I really loved all the light that shines in, making it bright and cheery during the day. No noise issues sleeping at night. Easy walk to Forsyth Park and coffee and breakfast place. Walking home from downtown is a bit of a walk after you've walked around all day. Its probably close to 2 miles. Uber is about $8 so there's that option. Parking is free on the street in front.
One small suggestion, if you like it to be cold at night while you're sleeping I would recommend bringing a small fan to aide the a/c in cooling the bedroom down a little more.
Overall, we loved this beautiful, cozy little spot and we would stay again for sure :)"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first trip to Savannah and we could not have picked a better location for our home base. Michael and Sarah’s apartment was no more than 10 minutes from everywhere we wanted to go. The proximity to Forsyth Park is especially nice. The only thing keeping me from giving five stars was the temp inside the apartment. We’re from Alabama and are used to summer heat. But we do expect to be comfortable when we’re indoors. Contacted host about temps and was told to run units at 70 and close curtains during the day. Did as told but it was still really warm. Units were blowing cold air, they just weren’t adequately cooling the rooms. We went to Lowe’s and purchased fans along with an indoor thermometer to make sure we weren’t being too sensitive. We closed all curtains, put the fans directly in front of both units to circulate cool air and let them run all day while we were gone. Thermometer consistently read between 80 and 90 inside apartment. That’s too warm for our preference."

We had already left our other air b n b and needed somewhere to sleep for the evening and to drop our bags off to during the day. We found this listing and messaged the hosts, and they were very friendly, quick to respond, and flexible with us. This location is right off of Forsyth park and walkable to many shops and restaurants! We loved the little extra touches the hosts had in place in the apartment and it helped make our extra night a little more enjoyable! Great stay!"

I think it needs tightened though because in some spots, you’d get pelted with giant drops of water. There is a water purifier in the fridge, but it was not full upon our arrival. The bed was extremely comfortable and my girlfriend drifted to sleep quickly.
Michael & Sarah are great communicators and were able to help us navigate street parking on a very busy Saturday night.
Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay at Sarah’s place. The apartment was bright and airy. Plenty of towels, which was good because we stayed several days and there is no washer/dryer. Stairs getting to third floor were a little tricky as it is an old house, but that didn’t take away from the cuteness of the apartment. There was a minor problem at check in (didn’t affect our stay) but I notified Sarah and she responded and took care of it right away. Was also very communicative about a water pipe issue being fixed downstairs (due to the extreme cold of that weekend). Neither of these issues affected us very much but I appreciated her reaching out. Only one block from Forsyth park. We cooked breakfast one morning and had everything we needed. Great stay!"

The neighborhood is wonderful - a very reasonable walk to all the things in Savannah while being far enough from the bar scene to be quiet and peaceful when you want to rest.

Our rental was so quaint, with tons of character and had everything we needed.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I booked this airbnb for our first trip to Savannah (4 nights). We only stayed one night as we were very disappointed in the reality of the apartment upon arrival. While it is mentioned in the listing, I want to reitterate that this place is on the third floor and there are stairs only - no elevator. I am very surprised that this listing is for an airbnb ""plus."" It fell way below our standards of comfort and cleanliness. Positives first: It is decorated somewhat modern, but also cheap (everything appears to have been purchased from Ross). Second, the location is right across from the South end of Forsyth Park, but to get to the main downtown area is about a 10-15 minute walk. After one night of sitting on the incredibly uncomfortable green couch and sleeping in the noisy, hot, and light filled room, we made arrangements to move to The Perry Hotel the next day and I am so glad we did! The curtains are definitely NOT blackout, light floods into the room in the early morning hours. We arrived Memorial Day weekend, so some of the noise from fireworks and such may have been out of the host's control, but we barely slept our first night there. It was incredibly noisy all night long and we also noticed that at least two of the windows in the living room do not even lock (locks are totally broken). There was also dust and lint all over the couch and floors, hairs in the bed - just generally unclean, as well as a giant stain on the white couch in the bedroom. We were so hot all night long and the next day looked at the air conditioning unit's air filters which were completely caked with dust and overdue to be changed. I am so glad we were able to make other accomodations and enjoy the remainder of our stay. Had we had to spend all 4 nights here, it would have been a very unenjoyable experience. If you want anything resembling ""modern"" or ""luxury"", this is not the place for you."

The location is amazing and everything in Savannah is within walking distance- we started every day walking through Forsyth Park. Parking was off street but abundant. The apartment which extremely cozy and cute and the gift basket was extremely thoughtful. All new updated appliances and the bathroom was so picturesque! I would definitely recommend and would love to come back.

Stayed a few nights","I would definitely stay here again. The style and decor was beautiful and thoughtful yet minimal. It is an older home which I prefer, you have a ton of character but you also have sloped floors. The bed was huge and super comfortable. The couch was beautiful and good for short sits as you get ready to head out into the city. It was great to be able to get up walk out the door, grab a coffee and walk through Foryth park into the different areas of historic Savannah. The home is located at the south end of the park where historic and victorian Savannah. As others have mentioned in their reviews, be sure you okay with stairs before booking. They also rent out the floor unit so look for that if you cannot do narrowish stairs. Sarah was super responsive, the unit was really clean and I felt very welcome. The complimentary bottle of pinot grigio was a nice touch. A wonderful stay for my first visit to Savannah!"

The condo is well-equipped, but don’t plan on binging Netflix while you nurse a hangover—the tv didn’t seem to have any “smart” features like Netflix, etc. but it did have a good variety of standard tv channels. The bed was on the firm side, but comfortable. I slept like a baby! I highly recommend this condo for a long weekend in Savannah."

Maybe not the best spot for someone looking to bring a new partner or something because the bathroom is right off the bedroom and there’s no fan (that I noticed). Also the bathroom door is frosted glass so if the bathroom is being used during the night it lights up the bedroom.

One thing to keep in mind if you have any heart issues- It is a third floor apartment with somewhat steep stairs (no elevator). The description does say third floor but it bears repeating. If you have any heart troubles, this could be an issue."

Beautiful master suite, large clean kitchen, balcony overlooking the river, and not to mention the awesome roof top patio overlooking the river with nice comfortable lounge furniture! Our beds were so comfortable and were made up with fresh white linen. This place is walking distance to almost everything which was great!

We walked our feet off each day and especially enjoyed the proximity to Forsyth Park. The park has a basketball court, playground, and if you walk around in the early evening you can see the owls fly about. After exploring the city, it was so nice to come back to a comfortable spot to rest and recharge."

Before our stay, the hosts were extremely helpful, providing plenty of information and details about checking in, where to park, etc. A keypad lock made checking in and accessing the home extremely easy.
The house itself was exactly as pictured and described, very comfortable and clean. Street parking was not too hard to find, and it was a very short walk right around the block to the center of Forsyth Park. Inside, we were pleased to find a clean historical home with tasteful updates... and lots of PINK."

- The master bedroom is stunning; the bed was comfortable and the linens were nice.
- The king bed + twin + pull out trundle was perfect for our four kids to share in the guest room.
- The whole home felt super clean and well cared for. We also loved the special treats that were waiting for us on check-in.
- Parking was super easy and the location is fantastic; one block from Forsyth. One morning I walked to The Sentiment Bean for a cup of coffee...it's just a 6 minute walk.
- Sarah was super friendly and helpful; even going so far as to meet a delivery person at the house earlier than our check-in to receive a wheelchair that we had ordered for my husband, who was on crutches. We so appreciated this above and beyond gesture.
Highly recommend!"

Megan did a beautiful job designing everything and we had all we needed for our stay. The beds were so comfortable and even though we had six adults the sleeping arrangement worked perfectly. Having one bathroom was fine as well. We all really enjoyed the walk to the riverfront and proximity to all that Savannah has to offer. We found it the perfect distance to really be able to launch from throughout the weekend. We brought our bikes and were able to park our car and walk or hike everywhere for the whole trip (aside from our Tybee Island day). Thanks so much Megan for helping us create such wonderful memories with our family! We would absolutely stay here again.

With a love for old homes we were completely charmed by many well maintained original features, complimented by modern upgrades, and it felt like such a treat to feel the authenticity of historic Savannah through this home. As a family of five we were very comfortable in the space - the rooms are spacious, beds are ample, the area was safe, and temps well controlled. The home was so well prepared and had everything we needed. In spite of some rainy weather we were still excited to stroll out into town thanks to the pretty matching umbrellas available for each of us. We appreciated all the things that were done to make our stay special - including the very sweet Valentine’s decorations. Can’t think of a better place to have stayed for the occasion!"

The host is super communicative and answered any questions I had very quickly. One night the Airbnb next door was super loud until 4am. I let the owner know and she responded right away and told us if it happens again to call the cops, as they are super responsive and there is a noise ordinance.

Group trip","Booked this place for a Bachelorette Party and it was the cutest place! It looked just like the pictures. We didn't need too many decorations because the place was so adorable already. It was in a great location, far enough from too many people so it was peaceful but close enough for a 5 min. drive to all the entertainment. (10 min. walk). So cute for a girls weekend."

It’s just a short 5min walk to Forsyth Park and a very short drive to anywhere in the Historic District. Everything was clean in the house and very comfortable. We loved the swanky decor and fun, vibrant feel! We’d definitely stay here again when visiting Savannah!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home! We would definitely stay here again. We did not use the kitchen for cooking but there was a bottle of Rose waiting for us in the fridge -- great touch! The house was spotless and the beds were comfortable. We could hear the dog barking above us but we brought a white noise machine anyway so the barking didn't disturb anyone's sleep -- it was just something we noticed. Great location, walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. The park across the street was very convenient as well. We felt safe in the neighborhood. It was very easy to find street parking."

The place was clean, beds were comfortable and the snacks and bottle of Rose in the refrigerator were nice bonuses. I appreciated having separate spaces for my family to hang out to unwind after long days of sight seeing. This is a bottom unit and from the upstairs a dog resides. For a few hours on our last night we could hear barking. It didn’t impact sleep but might be bothersome for some."

The homeowner let us check out a little late the next day which came in very handy for us. The house was very clean and comfortable. Loved the big rain shower head!

Stayed a few nights","This was an adorable comfy place to stay when visiting Savannah. The decor is so thoughtful and creative. Little touches everywhere. It’s in a prime location to Forsyth Park. Safe neighborhood vibe. From the second you pull up to this Barbie dream house you are submerged in photo ops. Bring some pink outfits! Lots of care went into decorating this place. Just lovely design.
The cons: only one bathroom was tight for us. The king mattresses were not comfy. Kinda hard and had a crinkle sound when you moved. One of our guests opted for the trundle bed because she felt it was much more comfortable than her king. A simple pillow top could solve this problem. Don’t let these drawbacks keep you from booking here. It’s an experience."

My only complaint is that there was a lot of noise from upstairs. We could hear most things clearly including the dog. So if you are sensitive to those types of sounds, it’s something to think about.

The decorations are adorable. So much thought and love was put into the whole space. It is about a 15 minute walk to get to downtown, and it is a lovely stroll through beautiful streets with shopping along the way. We loved one fish two fish - it’s a local
Savannah store with lots of cool and unique things. We recommend checking it out."

Group trip","I had booked the pink house for my friends bachelorette party and was a bit disappointed with the stay. When we arrived the dog walker met us at the door and had to help us in because the lock was really hard to turn. She told us that we would have a great stay and that the 3 dogs they have are usually really quiet because we walked in and they were going a bit crazy upstairs. We all own dogs ourselves so we can handle a little barking. But unfortunately we had a few incidents where they were not home upstairs and the dogs would not stop barking and we could hear them over the tv and music. I did message Megan and she apologized and said the situation would be handled. She did have it taken care of but it was still a bit much to deal with a few times. Plus, when you walk into the main hall it does smell like wet dog. But the condo itself was fine.
As we entered the Airbnb and settled in we were super excited by the decor. It was very nicely placed and the pictures are endless! But as we went to go to bed we noticed that the bed with the lower pull out had a big yellow stain on it from someone else and all the beds had random black specs on it. All the knives in the drawer were heavily used and not cleaned either. We understand things can happen but we are disappointed that we paid so much for a weekend and a lot of small thing kept happening and we weren’t even there that much. The place is beautiful but the cleaning needs to be more thorough and the dogs should be disclosed in the listing."

The sheets and surfaces were clean. And there were snacks for us as well! My fam really enjoyed our stay! It was the cutest house on the block and we def took pics in front of it! You do smell their dogs in the main entry area but thankfully once you enter your part of them home you do not. It is also very close to city market and Forsyth park and other destinations!

Stayed a few nights","Place was as described in listing and reviews: great location and space. Clearly care has been taken to make it homey, appointed with stuff a person needs when traveling. And while the photos are accurate, we were pleasantly surprised by the ceiling height - high! The place has great natural light and energy; combined with smart design and location, it’s a place you want to be.
Nitpicks (note I rate this place a 5/5, and would return, so these are small):
1 - would like a door lock other than the smart lock, kinda like a hotel room chain lock. It’s unclear if the code changes for each guest; regardless would like something only I can unlock when there.
2 - couch faces wrong direction. Feels like a shame the 6 or so big beautiful windows with a view are behind the couch.
3 - internet was spotty. I spoke to Ross about this and he said he’d investigate; it may have been isolated to us as there was a rainstorm. Was frustrating that couch faced a big TV that often didn’t work."

Ross was very responsive and friendly when there was a miscommunication about how to lock the front door. Only negative is that there is essentially no water pressure from the shower, which is a shame bc it’s a very nice bathroom. Parking is also completely a hassle but alas don’t rent just Uber bc it’s all walking distance anyway."

Every single part of the space is well thought out, comfortable and convenient--it definitely feels like a home, not a rental, with live plants, books, great artwork, lighting, etc. It was quiet and we felt safe. We just loved it!
It would be nice to add a street number on the doorway--I located the house by referring to photo #17 (white planters in front of the bookstore beside the black doors).
Note: the stairs are steep, as expected in a historic building. This may be problematic for older guests.
Will definitely book again next time we visit Savannah. Thank you for making our visit splendid!"

It was a bit hard to see where place was at first as the address numbers were hard to locate at night but we eventually found it and it was smooth sailing from there. Learned so much about Savannah and the haunted ghouls as well. It was definitely a place I would recommend to others. You don’t want to miss out on this charming place. Also rainwater shower is amazing. Thanks for the great stay and look forward to visit GA again soon :)

The inside is spacious and breathable with lots of natural light and beautifully decorated. The bed is plush and comfy. Let’s. talk. about. the. bathroom. Probably the nicest bathroom I’ve been in in an Airbnb and very spacious. Location is great- about a 20 min walk to River St. Due to the location, it was a bit noisy at night with pedestrians walking close by and talking loudly but we just used a white noise machine to help drown it out.

The bed was super comfortable with soft, lightweight sheets. And the bathrooms made you feel as if you were staying at a 5 star hotel. Ross saved the day! The location is wonderful. Just a 10 minute walk to get to my favorite resturant in Savannah. I had a last minute business trip and was planning on just booking a hotel. But after calling a few places and dealing with rude staff with major attitudes or overseas call centers where I couldn'teven have a conversation, I was ready to give up. Then I remembered Air B&B and found beautiful home and he was very willing to accept a last minute booking with no hassle. Honestly, I'd rather give my money to someone local who truly cares about their guests experience than a corporate hotel with employees who couldn't care less about the experience of their customers. When I'm in SAV I'm booking with Ross!"

The bathroom was probably the nicest bathroom I've ever used in an Airbnb, couldve thrown a mattress in the shower and had plenty of room leftover! A bit noisy at times with the street activity outside, but thats what you get in exchange for some incredible corner windows and light. Kitchen and living room were beautiful and spacious, and the bed comfort was perfect. Would definitely stay here again."

Ross was there when we arrived (we were a little early, & he was finishing getting it ready for us.) He showed us the layout, explaining things as we walked around, answered questions & gave recommendations. The apartment is so well laid out, & I could easily live there full-time! The living area is very conducive to relaxing, the kitchen is fully stocked, (including ground coffee & Kcups!) the marble-floored bathroom is pristine, & if you don’t have a rainfall showerhead at home, you’ll want one after you stay in this apartment! The bed is quite comfortable, & the windows have blackout shades. The area is also perfect for walking to Forsyth Park , historic homes, many of the squares, restaurants, & shops. We parked the car on arrival & didn’t move it until we (sadly) had to leave Savannah."

Of all the wonderful AIBNB locations we've experienced over the years this one truly stands out. At our age we opted to use the sofa bed on the ground level rather than navigate the ladder to the loft and found it to be very comfortable. Spending time on the dock by the fast - flowing river was absolutely mesmerizing. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 !

Stayed a few nights","This was exactly what we were looking for after a week in OBX with twenty other people. It was secluded, cozy, and the view was gorgeous. Michael thought of everything from fresh eggs in the fridge to snacks for the dog (we didn't bring her but she would have felt welcomed and very happy here). Everything was immaculate and you can tell he takes pride in this property. The town of Hardeeville is small, right off I-95 and close to Savannah and HHI. There isn't a lot to do in town so you'll have to drive to just about everything. We truly enjoyed our stay. The only negative I experienced was the bed being in the loft up a ladder. There are no pictures of the ladder, just a one line caveat in the House Manual asking you to be careful, so once we got there it became clear that I wouldn't be using the loft for several personal reasons. We ended up sleeping on the pull-out couch for our stay. The pull-out is not at all comfortable, but we didn't let it ruin our stay."

We really enjoyed the screened in porch where we spent most of our time while at the cottage. Our dogs loved the yard and porch! The cottage was very clean and well kept. Michael’s personal touches made it feel like home! The small details from personal hygiene items to doggy treats, to breakfast items were so thoughtful! Of all the places we’ve stayed, this is by far our favorite place! The only struggle was getting my 6’4 husband up the loft LOL! Once up there the King size bed is very comfortable and cozy. This cottage is a short drive (about 20 minutes) to Savannah and a little under an hour to Tybee Island! We traveled back and forth with no problem at all! Thank you for such a beautiful and peaceful place!"

The place was clean and exactly as described. There were many small touches they thought of. The wi-fi was fast, we were able to find things to watch on the tv, but we would have been fine without it. A great place to disconnect and unwind.
We did not need to contact Michael for any issues, there weren’t any. But from booking to checking in/out Michael made everything easy. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","The place is very cute. great setting, super peaceful and quiet. Host provided many helpful things such as shampoo, conditioner, face wash, etc. There were only a few things I would change. The house is made mostly of windows but the blinds only cover two, leaving most of windows uncovered which can be unsetting at night. There also weren’t many functional lights on the dock or deck which made reading/sitting outside at night slightly difficult. Lastly, there wasn’t 2 acres of woods. The property was pretty small but gorgeous nonetheless. My friend and I had a great time and would definitely come again."

This meant the fence was not up when we got there. I messaged the host, and he had a crew out there the next day to build an entire fence so our dogs could run around! So all that to say, he is very responsive and will get any problems solved. Clean, secluded, sweet neighbors. Perfect for a getaway near Savannah, Hilton Head, Beaufort. Easy drive to good restaurants. We enjoyed fishing off the dock, reading on the screened-in porch, and playing in the yard with our pups. Will keep this one in mind for future quick getaways!"

Stayed with a pet","Due to an opening with a contractor and an opportunity to do some work on the cottage, the host offered to allow us to stay at different property a few minutes away. I cannot review this specific location but I can provide some relevant info:
The host was very communicative and easy to work with. The property we stayed at was well maintained and spotlessly clean. The kitchen had thoughtful supplies like cooking oil, seasonings, and paper products. They also provided some breakfast supplies.
This area of the river is peaceful and beautiful. We spent many hours by the water enjoying it. The drive into Savannah was a pretty easy, approx 25 minute drive.
I wouldn't hesitate to book with this host at any one of his properties in the future."

Perfect contactless instructions on checking in and out. Michael even provides photo instructions on using the key box.
We are both 60 and had no trouble navigating the ladder to the loft. All essentials provided- bonus points for sun screen, which we needed & forgot. Wi-Fi is excellent. GPS drops you to the door and the peace sets in.
When renting make sure to check out Michael’s local guide in the confirmation email. It was super helpful, giving lots of local tips and recommendations.
Hardeeville restaurant tip: Seafood & Soulfood. Not on Yelp or Trip Advisor but so very worth visiting. It is located on White Hardee Blvd."

The river being right there and view in the morning was really nice. There is chopped fire wood and a fire pit and a BBQ grill that we would have loved to have used (unfortunately it was raining our whole stay). One thing to note for safety planning, the river has a STRONG current. Definitely heed the hosts advice about kids. We brought our dog and thankfully she’s kind of afraid of water…. but if you bring a pet, them jumping in would be a terrifying ordeal. Speaking of pets. They have doggie bowls there as well as some treats 😍. They also provided a complimentary scoop of food just in case you forgot your pups chow."

Do note: there are no curtains or drapes at the many windows, and boats on the river may be able to see in, so bring appropriate loungewear 😉. We loved this place and 10/10 would stay again."

It’s definitely in nature - saw a fox, heard owls and other critters at night. But it’s also close enough to Bluffton, Hilton Head etc if you want to go out for a day. I really loved it and was sad to leave."

Stayed a few nights","Great little spot right on the water! Everything was perfect, and the house was pretty well stocked with necessities, including the fridge stocked with eggs, oj, and bagels. The dock is awesome and there’s plenty of places to sit and enjoy nature.
The only two things I would add is there are two houses on either side of the property that are closer than pictures show/at least that I could tell. But it was still very secluded and nice!! The second was the water heater was definitely touchy - it would get scolding hot and then ice cold so it was just difficult washing dishes etc.
Other than those two minor things it was a great stay! Grocery stores are close by, savannah is about a 30 min easy drive so you can enjoy that but also just being away. Would definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I booked through Michael for a quiet 13th anniversary. We desired our own piece of serenity while maintaining only a short drive to all Savannah has to offer. It was a homerun. Beautiful views during our very quiet riverfront mornings drinking coffee on the dock. Within 20 minutes we were downtown Savannah eating brunch. The house had every amenity you could ask for during a short stay. Michael created a very welcoming basket of goodies for our arrival, had fully stocked kitchen, linens, instructions, and even shampoo/conditioner among many other items. In conclusion, because of the intimate size and natural setting, The loft cabin also had a fun feel to it. We often found ourselves laughing as we climbed the loft ladder or looked out over the river from the bed. Thank you again for the experience Michael."

Being right on the River was stunning and soothing - The property is awesome and out dogs loved every second of exploring and chasing each other - Coffee or wine of the dock was perfect and waking up in the loft with that beautiful view was just so beautiful! One of the best places we have ever stayed in and we have frequented many places - You will not regret it! Ladder to loft is a bit steep but you get used to it after the first try or two! Absolutely will return here on our trips down to Florida to see my parents"

Not sure there could be anything more perfect than sipping wine on the dock, watching my pup play in the large fenced in yard, and being secluded and surrounded by nature. So lovely!!!

There was coffee, sugar and creamer. Also, treats for us and a dog if you bring one. This is a very small but well thought out cabin. There is no place to hang clothes --no closets--but its still so enjoyable to be right on the Savannah river. Its not a place to swim, but a great place to hang out and get away from it all. We were completely satisfied."

Good variety of snacks & warm beverages. Was a bit disappointed with the cleanliness, but we spent most the time outdoors, luckily the weather cooperated & the river view is beyond beautiful!

Great view and outdoor atmosphere, just getting away from everything and disconnecting. space enough for 2, but would be a bit tight with more (not sure where you'd put all your stuff with 4 people). Nice touch of some breakfast food (coffee, tea, cocoa, orange juice, eggs, bread, little Debbie coffee cakes) and snacks (popcorn and trail mix). I recommend you bring some mostly prepped food, as the town doesn't have much beyond far food and the kitchen is too small to do much prep work in (I pre-chopped and cooked some stuff so I just had o saute on the stove). Nice spot to just hang a few days playing games inside or in the yard and sitting on the water!"

Micheal was a good host who very quickly dealt with a plumbing issue that came up for us. The main issue we had was that the grill on the deck of the house didn’t start at all, and there was no barbecue lighter. When I purchased a lighter and attempted to start it manually, it still would not light, there must be an issue with the grill. The grill down by the river only lit one of the flames and also was falling apart, we grilled on it and there were specks of rusty metal on our food."

The location was simply beautiful. Loved the walk over the swamp as you approach the Savannah River. The setup at the river was perfect - looked like something you might find at a resort - but it was just for us! The screened in gazebo was another plus.
Excellent place to get away from it all and simply enjoy the beauty of nature."

Stayed with a pet","Michael's cabin was absolutely pristine. The kitchen was well stocked, the cabin was spotless, furniture and bed were comfortable and such a bonus that it was pet friendly. It was unseasonably chilly during our weekend stay so we did not get to take full advantage of the river side gazebo and swing but what a hidden gem if you get the chance to visit. The snacks and breakfast fix-ins' were a wonderful extra treat. It was an easy 30-minute drive to Savannah to visit Back in the Day Bakery and Forsyth Park. Definitely don't pass this one up if you are in the area."

Stayed with a pet","Pros: Cute cabin as pictured, private/well-lit property with walk to nice river view. Cabin was cozy and equipped with necessities. Clear instructions. Allows dogs, that was nice.
Cons: Cabin had relatively pungent odor of stain or some off- gassing. No ability to open windows, no screens on any door or window. The cabin was warm, even with 2 large ceiling fans going at high speeds and a wall A/C upstairs in loft, just didnt cool the cabin. The stairs to loft were slippery, use handrail! The surrounding area was run-down and next to a graveyard. I received no response to my texts directly addressed to Michael, found that unusual, especially since a superhost. Received only the canned automated messages for reservation & check in/check out instructions. We left a day early because of smell and warm temp inside."

Stayed with a pet","The cabin was a perfect staycation for us from Savannah. It was a close enough for us to get there quickly on the weekend and nestled away so we felt like we were further away on a vacation. The cabin is dreamy and cozy. The dock was so perfect to relax on in the evening and the morning of our stay. The cabin was so well stocked with snacks, towels and, toiletries. I loved that he had all the switches labeled so you knew exactly where everything was and felt right at home. The shower and the changing light was so dreamy, I truly appreciated the thought put into EVERYTHING! I only wish we had stayed longer. I can imagine this is the perfect setup if you work remote and want a change of scenery. I think its important to note that there is another cabin on the property and other homes on the other end. This is not a big deal as things are very well spaced out and while we were there, we never really even ran into the other guests. Overall beautiful experience. SO glad I found this place"

However for us the real draw is the area by the river with swinging chairs, shade trees and a gazebo. We loved being able to relax by the river in the mornings and head into Savannah in the afternoons for dinner and drinks. Downtown Savannah is an easy 30 minute drive from this cabin. Our dogs also loved staying here and chasing the lizards on the deck. We would book again if we were returning to Savannah!"

Bathroom is downstairs and was very clean. There was a mixup at the start and Michael was on top of it and got it fixed! The location was close to Beaufort, Savannah and Hilton Head Island.

We knew we were going to be driving into Savannah so there was plenty to do, but we had a bit of a drive for restaurants or groceries."

I was surprise visiting my mom for her 70th birthday. I live in Los Angeles and she’s in Savannah, about 30 miles from there. She brought her little dog Coco and we felt like we were on vacation in natures paradise. Beautiful dragonflies!
I wanted something special where we could relax and catch up, without noise and other people, this was perfect. Front porch rocking chairs! Great AC unit and ceiling fans. Everything’s wood and super cute. We cooked several meals in the kitchen and they have a generous set up. You can walk down to a lake with bench swings and enclosed spaces.
We drove to a local market a couple miles into town, and went to beaches and a restaurant nearby, so fun.
The hosts were always super responsive, fast, and resourceful. They were patient and kind whenever we had questions. They really wanted us to enjoy our stay and we did. I wish them great success! :)"

The detail of the cabin was gorgeous and comforting. The kitchen was stocked and we even had items to make breakfast and coffee! A great touch! Our children loved playing outside and the best thing was, it was pet friendly and we were able to have our family dog with us!

Stayed with a pet","This cabin was absolutely stunning! It was so peaceful and relaxing. I felt safe and I loved the gated entrance. We took our French bulldog with us and I felt safe enough to leave him at the cabin while we did things that wasn’t dog friendly. It’s about 40-50 min commute to either Hilton head or tybee. We visited both places while we stayed. We brought our own boat, and the boat ramp was super convenient, like 3 mins down the road. The small neighborhood to the left of the cabin is super quiet. And again, felt safe. Micheal was a great host and on top of things to make sure our stay was the absolute best. The only thing I wish they had was a washer and dryer inside the cabin. The dock has really nice swings to sit on and enjoy the river. And the front porch has rocking chairs that we liked to sit on in the mornings and drink coffee. Everything was super clean and up to date. LOVED this place!"

Two giant ceiling fans were perfect for the hot summer. The location is so private and peaceful. The docks are amazing. Between the screened in gazebo and the pergola with swings, all overlooking the river, the whole place is just dreamy. The supplied breakfast was wonderful, the AC unit was crisp and cold, and the back porch was perfect for grilling. It was a perfect stay! We would LOVE to come back during another season too, maybe this fall. 10/10 definitely recommend this special place!"

Stayed a few nights","where to begin...renovated with being sterile or cold. A great mix of old classic Savannah with new and modern amenities. Random width hardwood floors (original?), coal fireplace, large beautiful marble bathroom, all lights dimmed to set any mood, tastefully decorated (appreciated the antique hutch and armoire).
Location?? Quiet, on a square, a block from Forsyth Park and a block, block and half from other squares. 20 minute walk to the river through, guess what, more beautiful squares! Parked my vehicle and moved it once for street cleaning. My vehicle sat for 3.5 days straight and free! I believe this trip was off season but that being said it was a great value and I will definitely look to book here again when I come back to Savannah (which is regular). Beautiful unit in a fun (liver may disagree) walkable and gorgeous city. It really is just as nice if not nicer than the pictures. Great soaking tub for 2! 😂
A great place, enough said."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay in the garden apartment at Ross’s. We chose this Airbnb because we could tell it was a higher end unit in a safe, walkable area. We own many new construction Airbnb’s ourselves in other states, so when we look to stay in one when we are traveling, we choose units that are either newer or newly refurbished and appear clean and nicely appointed. We actually thought about getting two separate hotel rooms (treated son and wife to mini vacation in Savannah), but having a living room to relax in at night was something we would have lacked in a hotel. We were very happy here. Ross was extremely responsive and runs a very nice Airbnb. I highly recommend it."

Beds and pillows super comfortable (coming from someone with neck and back issues) The neighborhood is super quiet, only few steps away from John street. There's also an iconic local restaurant that we highly recommend for breakfast right across the street. Walking to Forsyth park is closer than to the River front, but if you like walking it's not that bad either. Ross is an awesome host, very quick to respond to messages. At 1st I was hesitant to stay there because it's a lower unit. With most historic/restore buildings in Savannah you'll hear a lot of noisy floors, not the case at this place. We hardly noticed any noice from the unit above us. Also, there's plenty parking spots on the streets for those that bring a car."

We were traveling as two adult couples and it was just right, a great layout for friends or family who want to share a space but want a little privacy.
Also: this place was gorgeous! Thoughtfully restored apartment in a historic home, super comfortable, tastefully decorated with a lot of attention to detail. It was our friends' first time in Savannah and I think it was fun to stay somewhere that felt so authentic to the city's historic district.
Also loved the linens, live plants and Aesop toiletries. Posh vibes!"

Stayed with kids",Wonderfully clean and well-appointed home. The only thing easier than check in was checking out! The house layout is perfect with big living space and kitchen downstairs and two primary suites upstairs. We were traveling with an infant and it was perfect being close to the park and home on a quiet street and grocery store so close by. Lovely coffee / tea spot a block away as well. Private parking space was perfect. Loved the place!

Walking distance to Kroger, which was very convenient. We got married while in Savannah and had getting ready photos taken here. It is the most beautiful backdrop hosts were very easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend this place."

The 2 master bedrooms and baths were bright and welcoming after a long day of exploring Savannah. The king size beds enveloped you in cozy comfort. Sarah was quick to respond to the few questions we had regarding local restaurants and events. Quiet neighborhood located a short walk to Forseyth Park & cafes. Loved it! PS thanks for the snacks & wine!"

Beautiful interior and exterior, beautiful location, extremely clean and the best part - they said because we are on vacation there were no specific checkout “chores” like so many others.
If you are in Savannah stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","This is officially the most beautiful residence we have stayed in on Airbnb - straight out of architectural Digest! Lovely quiet residential neighborhood stone’s throw from Kroger if needed, delightful coffee shop Mate Factor and wine shop Le Chai. Comfortable beds and roomy living room seating and dining room - we didn’t cook this trip but modern, equipped kitchen. 15 minute walk to all the sights! 5 minutes to Forsyth Park. Off street parking easy access. We also walked to Cotton and Rye (15 minutes towards midtown) for most delicious dinner. Visited Bonaventure Cemetery (don’t miss this!) on way into town and then didn’t need car until departure. We are two couples over 60-70 and this was our favorite rental over a three-week road trip - rent it if you can!"

We loved the spacious kitchen, the luxurious bathrooms, and that everything was tastefully decorated.
If you prefer firm beds, you may not find these mattresses so comfortable, but that’s the only thing that did not work out perfectly for us. I recommend booking this airbnb if you want to walk everywhere, feel like you’re a local. and still enjoy peace and quiet."

The hosts were super responsive and gave great recommendations. I'd definitely recommend! It was a perfect getaway.

The location is fantastic, walkable and perfect to anyone looking to take a scenic stroll through the historic streets to admire the gorgeous architecture around, so close to the park and grocery store. The outdoor patio was great to enjoy the crisp night and as a family we enjoyed some quiet adult time while my toddler went to sleep upstairs.
The hosts were extremely attentive and so fast to respond with any questions we had, even providing a welcome bottle of wine and some sweets . The private parking made it so easy to carry our luggage in through the back.
Highly recommend for anyone looking for some quiet luxury! Would love to stay again in the future !"

Very comfortable and spacious with lots of amenities. The place is so close to Forsyth Park and extremely walkable to sites, restaurants, Kroger grocery (2 blocks) and not far from the waterfront. Sarah was very communicative and offered tons of fabulous suggestions for restaurants, bars, sightseeing and coffee shops, several of which we checked out (Mrs. Wilkes was outstanding - arrive early there's a line an hour ahead!!). We parked our vehicle (parking pass was appreciated) and never once moved it due to the convenient location of this rental. 10/10 would stay here again!"

There's an adorable coffee shop literally around the corner, as well as a grocery store for any of your needs. This was our 3rd or 4th trip to Savannah, and this was by far the BEST place we've stayed! We never had a need to reach out to Sarah or Michael for assistance, but I'm sure the response would have been immediate, as the communication was great throughout the whole process before arrival. If you're looking at other rentals in the historical district, stop. This is truly the place you want to be!"

This was the most idyllic way to spend our first time in Savannah! It is Incredibly comfortable and beautiful - the details of the extra plush down throw pillows throughout and welcome snacks made us feel right at home. We also really appreciated the high-end bath products!
This does not feel like an “AirBnB business” home, but rather it was designed with such lovely features and hardware it felt like a home you’d dream to buy and live in.
The location is absolutely wonderful - perfect for our first-time visit to the charming city! SUPER quick walk to the park, trolley stop and restaurants. The private and close parking gave us awesome peace of mind especially being on a road trip with a lot in tow.
Lastly, the fact that the host recognizes folks are in vacation and doesn’t have a list of checkout chores is very meaningful because it really does allow especially Type A folks to relax a bit more and not stress if you forgot to start the dishwasher!"

The condo is in a good location to walk to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and any activities such as bike riding tours or segway tours. We even walked to river street!

If we ever go back to Savannah we will defiantly be staying here again.
BTW the history is Savannah is amazing. Do a bike tour if your able."

The kitchen was fully stocked with anything that that we may have needed from coffee to wine glasses and everything in between. Everything is beautifully decorated and very clean. My favorite was the balcony we had coffee every morning and drinks every night on it. The location was great within walking distance to all the restaurants and clubs. The beds and pillows were very comfortable also which is normally not the case when staying at most places. All in all we would stay there again.

Their home is amazing and exactly as described -- plenty of space for our family of 4, very clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable beds and the location is perfect for exploring Savannah's historic district. The directions for getting into the home and parking in the neighboring garage are detailed and clear, but the garage is not the easiest to get in and out of. We only used our car once while we were there so this was not a big deal for us. The communication with Brandon & Chase was excellent as well. We highly recommend staying here!"

I mean the only place you won't want to walk to is a grocery store, everything else is right there. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked. And for myself, the best thing about this place was that it was SPOTLESS! Not just clean but REALLY CLEAN! I wish they were all like this beautiful place. Thanks guys. We'll absolutely be back!"

The balcony was a lovely place to sit in the evening and once back inside the place is so very quiet. You really cannot miss this place if you are looking for a rental in Savannah! It is perfectly located in the old district with everything in close walking distance! We certainly will rent this place again should our future travels include Savannah. Cheers!"

There is some noise from the main street but it’s not more than what is typical for a city location. Brandon and Chase were great hosts and checked in to make sure everything was going well.

The unit itself was clean and beautifully decorated. It was a great location and we were able to walk around Savannah and enjoy the restaurants and the history.
The only slight negative was that we were not prepared for the Monday morning city sounds that woke us up at 5:30 AM. If you are a light sleeper and are there during the week, you may want to get ear plugs. Other than that, it was the perfect place!"

The decor, cleanliness, comfort, and closeness to EVERYTHING was worth every penny! They communicated quickly and efficiently. Bonus points for having fun games! I literally spent hours playing the Hunt A Killer game and loved it! Of course it’s in a very busy district so there are some outside surrounding noises so ear plugs would be a welcome addition to have provide or bring with you. Would rent from these hosts anytime. Also accommodated a last minute rental after our previous plans was canceled with only 1 hour before arriving- just so happy we found them! Thank you"

It is located right in the historic district just a block from the river. Everything is within walking distance. Brandon’s communications were thorough, timely and very helpful. We enjoyed the lovely balcony off of the living room when we needed a break from sight seeing. The check in process was very easy. The parking pass provided with this rental is a big bonus! The parking garage is next door to the condo so packing/unpacking the car was easy. The condo itself is very clean, and nicely decorated. The beds and bed linens are very comfortable. We did not use the kitchen but it looked ready for cooking. We did not find the condo overly noisy as many can be in a city as it is situated away from the street. Checking out was the easiest experience I have had with an Airbnb rental. My sister and I loved our stay and I will not hesitate to book here again when I next visit this charming city. Thank you Brandon and Chase for a wonderful experience!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I have rented Airbnb's all over (Barcelona, Seville, Granada, Bermuda, Chile, Argentina, Edinburgh, Tuscany, etc.) and this was by far, the most beautiful of all the Airbnb's. It's a huge apartment/condo which is very tastefully decorated. It has everything you could need/want and right in the center of historic Savannah. It was SO nice to come home to this condo every day after being out all day. TONS of closet space; kitchen had everything you could/would need/want to cook, bake, etc. A nice touch is the JBL speaker to hook up to your phone, iPad, etc. for music. If you don't mind eating out 3 meals/day, then you do not need a car as we ""walked"" the City numerous times over 4 days. We did rent a car as we wanted to access to supermarkets which are not close by. We did not need any assistance from Brandon or Chase but they checked in several times to see if we needed anything. SUPER responsive. I would rent this Airbnb over and over again. It's a 5 out of 5."

Stayed a few nights","Had a wonderful stay at Alyssa’s property! Amazing location, very clear instructions, great communication throughout my stay and the unit was even better in person! Loved that there was not a laundry list of items to do upon checking out, made for a relaxing check out morning. My only suggestion would be to buy more wine glasses as there was not enough for our group of 4."

Alyssa was super responsive throughout the entire process. The location was great but because it is so centralized, there is a bit of outside noise, although that did not detract from our stay. Would highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Alyssa was a great host and the space was perfect for a small family or traveling with another couple. Plenty of space with amenities that allow you to ""live"" in her place vs. always having to go out for food or entertainment. One thing to note: This place is near the heart of Savannah's nightlife. There's an outdoor karaoke bar that is active on the weekends and can be heard from the living room and one of the bedrooms. Loud cars & people can be heard driving or walking by, but it didn't make or break our trip. Having a noise machine to sleep was helpful. Would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay! The entire process from booking to checking in to departing was super easy, and Alyssa was always quick to respond. The location is great and super walkable to almost everything we wanted. Quick ~15 minute Uber trip to Enmarket Arena! The recommended parking garage was very helpful since we didn’t want to deal with managing street parking during our stay. The provided games were a nice touch when we didn’t want to leave the place! The other couple didn’t mind not having a window in their room, but I guess none of us paid attention during looking at photos/booking. Only thing we really needed was ice. The ice trays can only make so much and the Walgreen’s on the corner didn’t always have it available. Other than that, everything was perfect & we will definitely book Alyssa’s place again!"

Stayed a few nights","Condo was clean, comfortable and just as beautiful as shown in pictures. Plenty of room for 4 with great views and the perfect location. Within walking distance of food, activities, market, shopping, riverwalk and nightlife.
Well appointed, with comfortable beds, and high end touches throughout.
Lots of extras, coffee, toiletries, games, etc. Many bonuses we didn’t expect, but really appreciated.
Both entrances were convenient, but we preferred the “side” entrance closer to the park & market.
Parking was easy and was only $ 35 for 3 days at the parking garage 1 block away.
Host was very responsive, provided great instructions, was pleasant and helpful.
If you are sensitive to noise, I would recommend the middle bedroom instead of the bedroom on the street. The location was absolutely perfect and we enjoyed gorgeous views day and night.
This was my favorite of a dozen or more stays in Savannah and this will be our preferred place to stay for future visits."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this AirBnB was wonderful! One of the best things about it was communication with Allan; he was quick to respond and available. He was very accommodating in letting us leave our luggage in the room while the cleaners were there, and we went to lunch and we were able to check in early. The attention to detail in the design and decor of the space was clean and impeccable; but we did notice areas that could use attention. It didn't significantly impact our stay, but it's something the host may want to address for future guests. The fireplace did not work. And, there was a large carpet stain to the entrance of the primary suite. The condo is on Bay St, convenient and yet it could be very noisy. The amenities provided were top-notch, exceeding our expectations. The kitchen was fully equipped, and the living area was cozy. In summary, our stay was positive, and we would consider returning. Our stay at this AirBnB met most expectations."

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing place to stay! So beautifully appointed and BETTER than the photos and the description. An ideal location with safe and convenient access. The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in -
Thank you to Allan and Rebecca who responded to any and all questions within minutes -
Although it was initially confusing about where to unload and parking, once we figured it out (with Allan’s kind patience) it was easy and safe.
We’ll be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at a lot of places during my travels. I must say, that Allan, was one of the best host, I have ever encountered. He communicated clearly and promptly to ensure the property met our needs. He was helpful, and a joy to work with. I am looking forward to booking my next trip back to his property.
This experience, is what an Airbnb host should aspire to have their guest have and feel at their property. The property was wonderful, it was decorative, it was modern and slick, it was perfectly stocked with everything we needed for our stay. We parked and never moved our car again until it was time to leave. 5 STARS only scratch the surface for our experience. Great job Allan, it was our pleasure working with you."

Stayed one night","One of the top places I have ever stayed with on Airbnb. Spotless apartment and beautifully furnished. Perfect place to call home with so much natural light and VERY spacious. It was difficult locating the unit from the parking garage, but we were so thankful once settled in. Great location with plenty to do in walking distance."

Stayed a few nights","Had a fabulous stay! The condo is gorgeous, exactly as described and seen in the pictures. Fantastic location- right in the heart of City Market and across from River Street. Walkable to great restaurants and attractions.
Allan was responsive and we would definitely choose to stay here again next time we visit Savannah!!"

Stayed with kids","Allan and Rebecca’s place was the perfect choice for my family’s weekend getaway! My son picked this place and it was perfect! From the cleanliness of the home (it’s immaculate), how spacious it is, the beautiful balcony, the proximity to EVERYTHING that you desire to do in Savannah, and the short drive to Tybee, this place is a dream!
The beds were super comfy, the water was hot, and Allan checked in everyday to ensure we were good! There’s literally nothing bad to say about our stay at this beautiful home! My husband and my son have already deemed this our go to place anytime we travel to and stay in Savannah!
Thanks Allan and Rebecca for being such phenomenal hosts!! We can’t wait to return again 🤍"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is beautiful and very spacious. The bathrooms and bedrooms were spotlessly clean. The bathrooms were luxurious and completely new. The location was near everything and 1 block from the beautiful river walk. We loved being able to walk to everything. Of course being so centrally located can mean more street noise. But the morning traffic noise was not bad for the two nights we stayed. The most difficult part was parking to unload our bags and accessing the reserved parking space. However, Allan was incredibly responsive to my questions and very helpful with making the parking space work. A small point for me was I found the beds to be rather soft but everyone has different tastes. Overall, this place is a Savannah gem!!"
