Stayed a few nights",Listing is exactly as like the photos. Home feelings very inviting and easily makes you feel at home. Nice size rooms and bathrooms with plenty of storage space. The neighborhood is very quiet and not too far of a drive to LSU. The breakfast was a great and appreciated touch. I recommend this home to anyone that’s respectful of those property and I would definitely stay here again without a doubt.

Stayed with kids",Joshua was great but the power was knocked out by a storm on our first day there and didn't come back on until the morning of check out we only got 1 night out of our 3 night stay. I think we should have been reimbursed for the cleaning fees because we didn't have anything that needed to be cleaned we wasn't there long enough to mess anything up. He actually reimbursed us for 2 days and like I said he was a good host and I know he has to make money but due to circumstances outside of his or our control I think we should've been reimbursed for cleaning fee also.

The house was very nicely decorated, very clean, it had everything we needed for our stay which was five days. The House is close to Walmart and other convenience stores. We were very comfortable there the house had a very warm welcoming feel to it they even had games for my family and I to play while we’re there like Uno and family feud. We had an amazing stay I highly recommend booking with Joshua and look forward to booking with him in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Home interior was nice, decorated, and clean, host is very responsive and provides welcome snacks and even breakfast items. Plenty of towels, general toiletries, kitchen appliances for cooking and eating. Easy to get to campus and casino from location. Instructions for home were clear. Neighborhood was quiet, but home location is in older neighborhood adjacent to low income area so many people walking around and cars parked in the front yard of many homes. Home has a garage so you can park car in a secure location which was is good. 3 Large TV’s in the home, TV package provided in home could not get local channels so we couldn’t watch local news, couldn’t watch Sunday night football and could only watch items streamed from any services we already had accounts to like Netflix or Prime. No problem with streaming from our accounts, just wanted the ability to watch standard ABC, NBC, CBS, etc. content when gathered with family as there was no streaming option for those."

Group trip",The house was as explained !!! But we were accused of smoking in the house and trying to charge a extra $300 for carpet cleaning and smoking when I KNOW NEITHER WAS DONE!! I book HOMES ON A REGULAR NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN ! And I feel like they are out of extra funding ! Also they stated we smoked in the home. But was told that everything in the home we could use so I’m guessing firing up the fireplace & having the closed chimney smoking because it doesn’t open was considered smoking in the house ! I don’t like to be scammed and I know a scam when I see it ! Selfish enough to lie like we smoked in the house knowing you saw the burnt wood in the fire place ! And the surrounding neighborhood is the GHETTO

Group trip","Our family of 5 adults was very comfortable in Brenda's cottage. The well equipped kitchen suited our needs perfectly. Our coffee drinkers very much appreciated having the k cups and easy to use coffee maker. We were in town for a wedding, so the iron and ironing board were used to remove travel creases from our dress clothing.The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and blankets.
The cottage is nicely decorated with comfortable furniture. The decor reflects the heritage of the area. There was a nice assortment of books for anyone who had time to browse.
We would definitely stay with Brenda again!"

The beds are super comfy and the kitchen is well-stocked.

Group trip","We enjoyed our stay in quaint mid- city cottage by Ms. Brenda. It was well decorated and spotlessly clean. We had everything that we needed from kitchen and toilet essentials to fun card/board games for entertainment. We spent some fun times eating and playing card games and scrabble at the cozy kitchen nook. We slept good on fresh linens and comfortable beds. The outside of the house was very well kept. There was an outside seating great for bbq-ing while listening to the relaxing sound of the little pond beside it. The cottage was very well thought out and fits perfect for families visiting the town. The location of the cottage is easy to find and close to everything. There are restaurants (fast food/local resto/starbucks) and grocery stores (whole foods/trader joes/albertsons) within minutes. The host, Ms. Brenda is one of the kindest. She is quick to respond to any questions and willing to go above and beyond. We left some personal items at the cottage and without hesitations, she mailed it to us the next day. She is awesome! My family and I would definitely recommend this cottage. 10 stars out 5."

The hostess, Brenda, was very responsive to every question we had and made us feel very welcome. Many small touches like a jar full of biscottis, a drawer filled with Kuerig k-cups and many other little, thoughtful things made us feel at home. We also used the outdoor grill (which was very clean) for a great evening of food and fun. The outhouse where the laundry is located is a nice, cozy addition to the main house. The neighborhood was fantastic- residential, quiet and safe and yet with easy access to main roads to anywhere in the city. I highly recommend this place and would rent again if I went back to Baton Rouge."

Group trip","This Mid-City Cottage is absolutely charming! It is the perfect house for a family visiting town. Great for all ages with the room off the patio with a doll house for kids that they will absolutely love hanging out in, to the lovely remodeled kitchen, to the comfortable beds and bedrooms. And the big back yard is perfect to play a game in or have the kids run around in.
Brenda went well out of her way to make our stay a very fun and satisfying one. She was nice enough to leave us a cooler as we had our son graduating from LSU and had a cookout the night before. She even hung a LSU flag for the occasion! Very nice touch! Geaux Tigers!
The house is well appointed with games, many cooking pots, pans, utensils, scissors tape, you name it - just about anything you would ever need. Never have we been so comfortable in a house that was not ours, although it sure felt so homey and comfortable. Truly, a home away from home! Coming all the way from Colorado, it was so pleasant and is the perfect location for everything Baton Rouge. We hope we can come back for a game in the future. We certainly will check with Brenda to see if her cottage is available!
To close, Brenda was so understanding when I booked - well over a year ago. Our older son was set to graduate in 2020 until the pandemic hit and canceled his graduation. I had booked a place for his graduation and it was painful to try and get a refund! Brenda was so understanding about my hesitancy and made me feel so secure with the process. After communicating with her, I had absolutely no hesitation booking. And cannot wait to book again.
Take care Brenda! John and Carrie
Thanks again Brenda! It was certainly our pleasure!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is located in a quiet neighborhood and had such a cute and comfortable feel. It really felt like a charming home rather than just a rented house. You pull into a driveway for off street parking and walk through a gate to a lovely patio with outdoor table/chairs, a grill, and a swing! The entire house was very clean, well organized, and nicely decorated. This house is stocked with so many books....so maybe instead of packing your own, enjoy the selection while you visit. There is a dining nook with bench and chair seating able to accommodate quite a few people. The kitchen appears to be newly remodeled. One of the most impressive things about this place was the amount of cooking supplies. There were more than enough pots/pans/knives/plate/etc to make cooking a large meal easy. There are three bedrooms (two with queen beds and the third with two twins) all with very comfortable mattresses. One of the bedrooms has an attached bathroom and there is a second bathroom off the hallway. There were more than enough towels for everyone and bars of soap should you need it. Next to the house, off the patio is a charming little Free-standing studio room. There is a washer/dryer for guest use which was very helpful. This room also seems to be furnished for kids that may be traveling with you to have a separate space to play.
Overall, we were extremely impressed with the quality of this home, it’s amenities, and the comfortable feel. The host is very responsive to communication."

This is the perfect location in a quiet neighborhood to relax and recharge. Such a sweet cottage with a warm and welcoming vibe the moment you pull in the driveway. Thank you, Brenda, for the perfect accommodations!"

As we prepared for Thanksgiving and we loved every “extra” in her house from preparing in the gourmet spotless kitchen to game night at the breakfast nook. Brenda even offered to bring us extra towels to make sure we were comfortable.
I would (and have) recommended this vacation home over and over. We can’t wait for our next trip to Brenda’s as we visit family in Baton Rouge!"

Stayed a few nights","Look no further!!! My husband and another couple came to stay here for a weekend and to go to an LSU game. The house is immaculate, super cozy, and gorgeous. We enjoyed that the kitchen is open to the living room and breakfast table so that we can all visit while cooking, watching tv, or sitting at the table. The house is stocked with cook ware, cable, coffee maker, cards, games, and even a grill outside. It was truly a home away from home. The kitchen and bathrooms are redone and very clean with beautiful finishings. Checkin and check out was a breeze. We will stay again and will suggest it to everyone we know that stays in Baton Rouge. Don’t hesitate to book!!"

When we told danielle that we were college students looking for some affordable she didn’t hesitate to help. The area is great and we never felt unsafe. Close too many places and was very nice to have a grocery store right downstairs. The place was also very clean and had all the extra things you would forget like paper towels ice and even laundry soap. Danielle even messaged back when i would reach out super nice! I would recommend this place to anyone.

Stayed with kids","Danielle’s place was perfect for me and my 3 year old daughter. I appreciated the minimal decor; very clean and open space. The beds were comfy and amenities were perfect. Check in instructions were very easy. We really felt like we were at home.
The only downside (and this has nothing to do with Danielle) was the downstairs grocery store. I purchased some bread which I learned was expired past its shelf date as well as a frozen kid’s dinner which also was well expired beyond its date. Luckily the clerks let me switch out the frozen dinner for another bag of chicken nuggets. So my advice is if you’re going to purchase something from the market, look at the dates on the food. Other than that, the hosts were very responsive and helpful."

When we arrived we immediately fell in love with the home. It is so perfectly decorated & peaceful, with everything one would need on vacation. Coffee, huge soaking bathtub with epsom salt for relaxing baths, air purifier, I mean you name it, she had it. She was also wonderful to converse with & never seemed annoyed if we needed anything. If we ever go back to Baton Rouge we will only book this home again. This was possibly the best vacation we’d ever took! I even left a book that I bought in town at 2nd & Charles & she offered to mail it to me! Don’t have enough characters to describe how wonderful the entire experience was<3"

Stayed a few nights","This is my favorite place to stay in Baton Rouge. I've booked it whenever I could while my child attended LSU. This cottage is comfy and feels like home. The owners have furnished it with cozy items without cluttering the space, as the pictures show. It's their special touches that really set this AirBnB apart -- like the Christmas decorations this month. They added a wreath on the door, plus a red throw and pillow on the porch chairs, and a mini christmas tree on the porch table. The living room mantle was decked in evergreen. A lighted Christmas tree lent a festive feel. In my arrival email, I happened to mention we were coming for LSU graduation ceremonies. There was an LSU balloon on the dining table and a congratulatory bottle of Prosecco in the refrigerator. Classy folk.
Cross the street to Zeeland St. Market for homemade breakfast, lunch and dinner. My favorite is the pecan smoked brisket or one of their unique salads. Dinner is elevated soul food!"

The house is thoughtfully equipped - not fancy but comfortably. If you are a noise-sensitive person this house is close enough to Perkins and also (less close) to Interstate 10 that there is a moderate level of traffic noise. I enjoyed my stay at Kasey's and so did my dogs.

Our 3 year old and 18 month old kids were so comfortable there - we used the crib that was provided and they got such a big kick out of the cool toys and books available for them. The home itself is beautiful and peaceful with unique style and furnishings. The location was perfect for accessing great restaurants and coffee nearby. Of course when you travel with small kids you have to be ready to change gears and eat takeout at home instead of out at the restaurant - depending on the circumstances. The kitchen was well outfitted with all that we needed for an enjoyable takeout dinner at home from Chow Yum. We all left feeling happy and refreshed. Thanks again for the lovely stay, Kasey!"

Kasey was a great host; immediately responding to our questions and making our stay with a toddler as comfortable and pain-free as possible! We will be staying here any time we visit family in Baton Rouge."

The house was very clean, comfortable, and absolutely adorable! My daughter even commented that this is exactly how she wants her house to look when she’s grown up - teenager approval is worth everything!! Kasey was incredibly helpful and very responsive to messages. There were very charming local places to eat within walking distance, with the loveliest people! Highly recommend breakfast right across the street! Even more local spots were just a short drive down the street. We felt like part of the neighborhood family for the few days we were there. It was also a very easy drive to LSU’s campus each day for camp. We will definitely be staying here again when my daughter goes to camp again next year."

The house was extremely clean and well decorated with lots of beautiful natural light. It felt airy and homey. Lots of great amenities (including a wonderful large bathtub) and a well-stocked kitchen that made cooking a pleasure. The house is well-situated in the neighborhood. My husband was particularly excited about being a very short walk from his favorite Baton Rouge coffee shop.
We came to visit my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and the hosts were very kind and accommodating to our needs. Nice outdoor areas as well. All in all, can't say enough good things about this place. We had a lovely stay."

Anne Marie provides a fully stocked kitchen, extra upon extra towels, wash cloths, shampoo, conditioner…everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. The home is in an older neighborhood, but directly across the street is The Zeeland Street Café- a nice little restaurant that serves a healthy sized breakfast and lunch & some very good service. You can sit outside or inside. I don’t think they are open on Sundays, though.
The home is very clean, beds are comfortable, the air conditioner works very well, and the bathroom is a little dreamy. The shower is spectacular! Ann Marie has added some of the cutest decor to this home- it’s a little boho and a little contemporary mixed in with some Louisiana flare. We were visiting my daughter who attends LSU & this was the perfect spot for us to get to and from campus easily. Geaux Tigers!"

Stayed with kids",Anne’s place was wonderful. The location couldn’t be more perfect. It had a lot of charm and was very beautifully updated for being an older house. It’s very close to the neighbors and in the morning when the restaurant next door was opened we almost could not get out of the driveway because of people parking in the yard/on the road but that’s not something she could help. Overall you really can’t beat the value for what we paid.

It it beautifully restored and feels more spacious than one might expect from the exterior. Annemarie has thoughtfully furnished the house in such a way that it makes you feel at home immediately. The kitchen was well stocked and the beds were very comfortable. Though we didn’t need them ourselves I appreciated that there was a crib, umbrella stroller, and some toddler books and toys available. It is in a great location - walkable to a coffee shop, restaurants and parks. We will definitely be returning."

Anne Marie was a great host, the place was extremely clean, and the feel of the house is exactly like the pictures look - a bungalow-style house updated with modern furnishings and appliances! There's a good breakfast place about 100 feet from the front door, and a good coffee shop about 100 feet in a different direction.
Definitely recommend!"

It is very stylishly decorated and comfortable. In my opinion and from what I have seen, it's one of the best Airbnbs in Baton Rouge for a party of 2-4. I haven't seen anything better and that's why I booked it--and I wasn't disappointed. Anne Marie is also a good communicator and check-in was a breeze. I definitely recommend and will use this cottage again next time I am in town!"

Stayed a few nights","BLUF: This is the best AirB&B location you will ever rent.
The house itself is so beautiful and has a wonderfully calming aesthetic. You will feel welcome and comfortable as soon as you walk through the door. On top of that, the whole home is very thoughtful in what it provides and where it is placed. I was impressed by the inclusion of a First Aid Kit in the kids' room, for example. The pictures posted are 100% accurate all the way down to the sheets on the bed and where the couch pillows are placed. This is a dream house.
Also, the house is perfectly located for having an authentic LSU-Baton Rouge experience. I earned both my Bachelor's and Law Degrees from LSU and was in town for an Alumni Tailgate event. So, I was already familiar with great places to get food and drink. This house is right across the street from Zeeland Cafe which is a great place to have a home-style breakfast or lunch, and is within walking distance of Garden District Coffee. Also, there are great restaurants and bars just over the Perkins overpass literally no more than three minutes away. It is also a five minute drive to campus, or cheap ride if you don't like to drive and park around campus like me. You are also close to Government Street that also has a lot of great restaurants and bars (like the new beer garden).
The cute little black kitten running around was also a nice bonus but not a part of the house.
Overall, it was an amazing experience. As soon as LSU puts out its 2022 football schedule I will immediately book this location again."

Stayed a few nights","Anne Marie was a terrific host all-around. Although we did not have the chance to meet her, she was accommodating before, during, and after our trip. The check-in process was seamless, and she helped with catering suggestions, delivered a food cooler to the house when we asked for help providing food to an outdoor event, and was incredibly quick to respond to all our communication. The house is adorable, with beautiful artwork throughout the home. It is full of many thoughtful niceties such as laundry soap, coffee, and extra towels. We utilized the appliances (stove, fridge, washer/dryer), and all were clean and new. We found the location in a nice neighborhood and very close to a restaurant hub that kept us off the busy freeways at night. We didn't use the backyard, but it is enormous and has a nice outdoor seating area. The grandparents decided to join us last minute, and Anne Marie had no problem with that. There was also off-street parking for two cars. If we ever travel to Baton Rouge again, we will try to stay at Anne Marie's house."

Annie Marie has creatively decorated each room along with providing ample supplies: i.e. dishes, silverware, glasses, towels etc. The floors are beautifully restored in this over one hundred year old house. Due to its age the floors slope to the point that older people can trip over the transitions into other rooms (you must step down or up slightly). Overall, we would recommend Annie Marie's home to anyone."

She explained to me where all the flash lights were and talked me how to get inside because everything was in complete darkness.

As soon as you walk in, the aroma was great, the decor was fabulous in a very modern and minimalist way. The bed was very comfy (better than my Sleep Number) and the place was immaculately clean. 😊
Our hosts were very communicative from the beginning (pre/check in) giving clear instructions on everything, including parking (3rd floor - garage) to the very end (post check out); the follow up phone call) was huge.
The community was extremely nice and safe with gate access, restaurants and shopping nearby. Erika (has definitely set the bar on what to expect from an Airbnb host who is very in-tune with her client’s needs for a great stay. I’ll 💯 percent book again and highly recommend to others."

Stayed a few nights","PERFECTION! Wow! I absolutely LOVED Jennifer’s place. I’m a BR native & visit often since moving away 30+ years ago. With limited updated and luxury hotel options in Baton Rouge, I often choose to stay in an AirBnB. This one is the best so far!
The attention to detail is incredible - the decor (so very tasteful yet still very Louisiana), the amenities (the coffee bar w/ Community Coffee & go-cups, an air fryer, the clawfoot tub, ample towels and linens), the bed was so comfortable it’s addictive! And the ‘pièce de résistance’ - the outdoor space! I love and look for welcoming outdoor spaces when I book an AirBnB — ALL of it was simply awesome!"

It’s in a perfect location to explore the downtown area, be close to LSU’s campus, and have easy access to the interstate. It was also perfect because it was spotless, beautiful, and had every thing we could possibly need (loved all the details and the outdoor space!). And a huge thank you to Jennifer for making it so easy and comfortable! We didn’t want to leave, which means we will definitely be back!"

She was extremely flexible about accommodating our daughters nap schedule, even though it was a big inconvenience to her. Her place is beautiful, and was ideal for us (couple with a baby). Loves the bathroom, big bed, well-stocked kitchen, and incredible backyard. The place was five stars, but wish I could give an extra one for the host."

Beautifully decorated, clean, and a mattress that didn’t hurt when I slept! While this place was amazing, my favorite thing has nothing to do with the actual AirBnb, but instead with Jennifer herself! She was very responsive and went as far to send me pictures of where I could find items similar to what she used in her AirBnb. She definitely raised the host “bar” up several notches because she went above and beyond when I asked her questions. If you have any hesitations about staying at Jennifer’s AirBnb, let me save you the time and tell you to just book it now! I promise, you won’t regret it!"

We have been on a week long road trip and our vintage camper sprung a leak in the middle of a rainstorm! The hosts graciously accepted our request to book late in the day and were happy to let us park our camper in their driveway while we explored Baton Rouge for a bit before continuing on our way. A hot shower and comfy bed were a much needed respite for our road weary selves and we have decided to make intermittent AirBNB stops a regular part of our road trips based on this experience, alone! we will definitely be back next time we decide to come through Baton Rouge!"

I would definitely recommend staying here.

Wonderful thick bath towels, and a super comfy bed... I didnt want to go home! The neighborhood is safe, and we were able to walk to a bus stop so we didnt have to fight traffic driving to the stadium. If we ever travel to Baton Rouge again, we will definitely stay with Morgan."

Stayed with kids","My family and I spent the last weekend of our Spring Break in Baton Rouge for a baseball tournament and The Retreat was perfection.
Melissa was the easiest host to deal with, from early questions before booking to making sure we checked out with ease.
The home was absolutely beautiful and so spacious which was important for my larger family. The pool area was perfect for the crawfish we ate (suggested by Melissa) and watching our kids swim and enjoy the time in our space. The neighborhood was so quiet and for it to be a larger neighborhood traffic was light. Centrally located and close to interstate access was also a huge plus.
We will 1000000% book again with Melissa if and when we return to Baton Rouge."

I am 6 months pregnant and the bed was pretty comfortable but definitely could use help. I probably wouldn’t recommend a longer than 2 night stay if you are pregnant just due to the bed but if that gets fixed then I’d recommend to anyone. Very nice host. They live right behind you but they give you privacy. In a great centralized location that’s far enough down that game day traffic to interstate won’t be as terrible. But very close to LSU. FHA ms for hosting us.

Stayed a few nights","Two sides to this review:
First, the place was perfect. Great neighborhood. Great location. Adorable set up. We loved it.
Second, Kirsten was slow to respond if she responded at all. As of six hours after checkout, she still hasn't answered my question from our first night. (We stayed for the weekend.) I also had questions about some confusion concerning checkout that have gone unanswered.
Overall I recommend this place. 5 stars on everything except communication. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that something important came up that she needed to focus on. We still had a lovely stay nevertheless."

I will definitely recommend this place for any of my out of town guests that come back to visit. Only real issue was with Waze having the location about 2 houses down, but my other guests used Apple and found it just fine! Also, definitely going to buy a set of those sheets and pillows for my home - so comfortable!"

Stayed with kids","Located in a beautiful area, the first impression of Owen’s place will blow you way. Let’s start with the mechanical gate that makes you feel like you paid way more than asking price, then the impeccably clean home with decor that’s simply an inspiration.
The layout of the house is perfect with the bedrooms perfectly designed with a family in mind. The backyard is fenced with room to roam. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to grill or take advantage of the bikes that were included… next time. The primary suite was perfect for my wife and I, and speaking of wife, I heard the words that every husband wants to hear after booking an Airbnb.. “Wow! Babe you did good!”
Thanks Owen for a great stay."

The bedrooms were all really comfortable and this host goes the extra mile providing you with things you may need during your stay such as toothbrushes, floss and so forth. Wine bottle in the fridge and snacks for the kiddos. Perfect stay. Thanks for having us and we will definitely be back if ever visiting the area again."

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay at Mid City Haven! It had everything we needed. This was such a comfortable place for us to work from and to come rest while we were in the midst of closing on our home. We didn’t want to have to board our dogs all week while we were moving, so we really appreciated this space. Our pups enjoyed the huge yard, and although the home is located on a main street with through traffic, we felt confident our pups were safe & secured in the yard. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet and peaceful this area was too once the brief work/school rush hour died down. The horseshoe driveway made it a breeze to close the gate & then exit on to the main road. In one direction, you are close to many of Baton Rouge’s unique & delicious restaurants all around the Mid City area, but turn another direction, and you can easily get to Towne Center shopping & a Whole Foods. The home is absolutely beautiful, comfortable, & welcoming. We look forward to staying at Owen’s place again!"

When you’re at the kitchen table there’s a phone charger, if you forget your toothbrush, there’s an extra, there’s coffee in the morning and, laundry detergent if you forgot to bring yours. Lots of good restaurants nearby and grocery stores close. We were there for a baseball tournament and hope to return next year! We had a fantastic time and loved the house!

We were booked to stay one night but the home and property felt like such an oasis we asked to extend our stay! The entire property was pristine, comfortable, thoughtful, and caters to travelers of every kind. We were pulling a 4x8 trailer behind our Forester and both fit perfectly in the gated drive. We slept so well knowing all of our belongings were safe. The yard was even bigger and better than pictures show. Owen was a great and attentive host who made our entire stay a breeze. We can't wait to make our way to this home again one day!"

Jeff was flexible with our check- in, as we arrived later than expected. I appreciate his timely responses and written instructions for everything even once we arrived!
I loved that the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful!
The cottage was quaint and best off of all clean! It truly felt like home away from home! I only wished I had found this gem sooner, as I plan to return for a few more home games this season, and it is already booked!"

Place was immaculately clean; neighborhood was quiet, almost bucolic, yet not too far from 1-10 so it was easy to get anywhere. Shops and restaurants nearby. Cozy house with everything we needed. The owner, Jeff, could not have been nicer. He rolled out a Weber grill for us from his own house the night we got there. Easy off street parking. Ideal if you're doing anything at LSU. We stay at a lot of Airbnb's playing tennis tournaments across the country-this was among the top 2 or 3 we've stayed at, possibly the best value."

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The owner lives right next door and they are so helpful. He helped us bring our luggage in which was a godsend as we were particularly tired that day. We can't speak highly enough of our experience here. It helped that there is a Trader Joes and other stores just a block away on Perkins St which has a whole slew of interesting stores and restaurants. Downtown is a close drive as well. Book here for a lovely vacation!"

The location is PRIME — about a block from the LSU lakes (and some of the most insane mansions on the lake), and is a short walk to everything the Overpass has to offer (mainly bars and restaurants).
It's a small space, but I was seriously nerding out over how effectively everything was laid out. I'm thinking of eventually building my own ADU and was taking notes.
My family no longer lives in Baton Rouge, so this is definitely where I'll be staying for future trips."

Highlight of my trip all of the beautiful trees in the neighborhood and on LSU campus!

The location is wonderful - a block from the LSU lake, which a beautiful walk for as long or as short as you'd like. We did not use the bicycles offered, but it seems that many others have. We were very happy with the guesthouse & would be happy to return for another stay in the future. Thanks so much."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely awesome location. Just a block’s walk to the University Lake which has the most gorgeous homes and azalea-filled gardens and lots of majestic live oak trees. Loved having access to Carl’s bikes as it was a perfect way to explore the lakes. Also amazing to be walking distance to a highly recommended Seafood restaurant (Parrains), juice bar, Mexican food, pizza, etc. The home itself was cozy, clean and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend!"

We were just passing through on a road trip, so we didn't really get to explore the area or any suggestions in their binder, but it looked like Carl had thought of everything. Absolutely no complaints. We would definitely stay again!"

The place is small, but very well laid out and was nice for my daughter and me. It had some really nice touches (like a personalized welcome sign), quality furniture, etc. The owner, Eric, made check in and everything completely seamless and smooth. Great communication and attention to details.
I highly recommend it for just a couple of people."
