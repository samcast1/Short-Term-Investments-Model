Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved the place! It was spacious yet cozy. It had most everything you could need - including being stocked with quality toilet paper (weird, I know, but it was a nice touch). We wouldn't have minded a blanket or two, but we could pull the comforter if we needed and the thermostat was readily accessible and responsive."

He responded to my message within just a minute or two and went out of his way to arrange for the home to be cleaned immediately after I spoke with him and allowed us to check in before the usual time. We were super grateful for his quick communication and helpfulness with accommodating us - an excellent host!

Stayed one night","It was a good place. Easy to find and comfortable. Very clean. Overall a great stay.
The only problem was that we were charged $85 for a cleaning fee but then asked to do a bunch of chores on the way out. Paying $85 for cleaning for a
one night is annoying, but it's not the end of the world. But if we pay that, we shouldn't have to be the ones to strip the beds. What was the 85 dollar fee for?
Overall, pretty good place. One annoying thing but it was still a good stay."

Group trip","We had a group of 5 stay here for an ice fishing trip, it was our second time staying here. The house was a great place for our crew to unwind, make a meal, and sleep after a long day on the ice. You can park close to the door which made loading and unloading gear easy. Also plenty of space to hang up bibs and coats. We definitely wouldn't hesitate to book it for a third time."

Stayed with a pet","Notes for other guests: the house is located on the west side of m35 and is situated directly next to the highway, which the photos in the listing don’t make clear. (It is also correct that google maps will absolutely send you to the wrong location). Host also requires you to put your bedding in a hamper and to remove trash bags upon checkout despite having a cleaning crew. Host also requests you to leave the key on table and door unlocked upon checkout, which I personally find to be a risk for any guests if something were to happen in the in-between time and the guest gets blamed for it (I also think just one key is a bit inconvenient for multiple guests and that a key code system would be better anyway). The furnace that warms the place up is very loud and may affect your sleep, and the house cools quickly, causing the furnace to kick on frequently (which also reheats quickly, however). The furniture, furnishings, media set up, bathroom, and decor are very mediocre. (Just as an example, the queen bed in one of the rooms was on a slant and gives you the feeling that you’re falling off of it). I think the place needs to be updated in many ways. These things may not bother most, but I felt the need to mention them for those whom it may bother. (A side note: my cell phone, which uses the T-Mobile network, didn’t always have service at this location). The thing that may bother most, however, is that the entire place also has a very, very strong mildew smell, so much so that one can even smell it from outside if the front door is open.
On the positive side, Russell communicates well and is very accommodating if you have any needs. The living room was spacious and had plenty of seating. I give it 3/5 (although other guests in my party would have given it less and would not stay again)."

Clean spot, three beds worked great for three friends traveling together. Internet worked really well. We didn’t use the back porch, but there are chairs, a bbq and fire pit that would make for great summer nights. Good enough kitchen for us to make dinners, and the shower had good water pressure. Easy checkin process."

Stayed with kids","This is a clean, nice roof-over-the-head site near the heart of town. A little pricey for what it is, but the host does describe everything in detail, so shame on us if we miss it (I missed that there's no access to the lake across the street, and someone else apparently missed the cleaning fee). The host is right, won't find the place using a GPS (Google Maps, Wayz, etc) and I made the mistake of thinking there must be more than one Airport in this lil U.P. town when I passed ""Delta County Airport"" and continued looking for ""Escanaba Airport""... oops. Not far from the local beaches, I'd recommend Ludington Park. I stopped and grabbed some beer from Upper Hand Brewing, hidden behind the Airport, and we ate a few miles away at Freshwater Tavern. My son and I also had a nice night by the fire put. He keeps a stock of firewood, the yard is nice enough, and you can still see the lake across the road."

Beds were comfy, fans to drown out the traffic noise was very effective. It’s like they thought of all the little things!! Wish we could have Had a fire since there is wood provided, but it was too dry and fire was not recommended. Thank Mother Nature for that one. Other than that it was a wonderful amazing stay.

Stayed one night","My boyfriend and I stayed here at the end of a week long road trip, mainly camping, around the UP. It is a bit on the pricier side for just two people, but since we booked out only a month prior on Labor Day weekend, it was the only reasonable place we could find in the area. It was a clean and cozy place to recharge, shower, and sleep in a comfortable bed after days of camping. I think this would be ideal for a group of people looking for a home base for a week/weekend of fishing. Very close to boat ramp access at the river mouth, Upper Hand brewery, and bars/restaurants in town."

This would be a great spot for a few couples or for a family with kids. It’s close to grocery stores, some chain restaurants, and a few pasty shops. We took several day trips— Iron Mountain, Pictured Rocks, etc. and the drives were not bad."

Stayed about a week","Great little clean & classy Airbnb in a good location, right downtown Escanaba. Definitely worth the trip and price! I'm so glad I stayed here instead of a local hotel, especially after reading some of the reviews lol. It has everything you need, the hosts are great people and very accommodating. Not to mention walking distance to the local businesses and also a chocolate/candy shop? right next door in the same hallway as the Airbnb with great chocolate covered oreos. I give it 5 stars.
The only negative things I could say is the seagulls seemed to be having a little party during my stay in the AM., squawking it up outside lmao!
The police are all over that main street pulling everybody over for the stupidest reasons all hours of the day, flat out harassing people and also hiding & waiting for them to leave the local bars on that street then pulling them over... That's clearly harassment... but hey who knows what goes on around there?
I still give it five stars because the negatives are out of the Airbnb hosts control and it is a great place and location to stay regardless! If you're not a drunk driver and don't mind a little potential seagull action in the a.m., your good to go!"

It was very quiet, both in the house and in the neighborhood and the place is within walking distance of both downtown and the park and lake. Both of the air conditioners worked (I visited in summer) and the water pressure and temperature in the shower was excellent. I worked for three days during my stay and I am on Zoom video meetings for 8+ hours a day and I had no problems with the Wifi connection, which means I was able to stay connected all day long with no dropped meetings."

The unit is extremely clean and offers everything a traveller would need. For us access to a washer and dryer was an added bonus. Escanaba is a lovely town and this location is only a couple blocks from Lake Michigan. We walked and/or biked every day through Ludington Park. Couldn’t have been a better location.

It was well appointed and had all the kitchen stuff we look for in our stays. I also really liked the windows. Sounds weird, but good windows (sound blocking, easy to open, clean, etc) and lots of them are one of my favorite things about any house. I also appreciated having multiple spare pillows to choose from.
Escanaba is a decent launching point for UP adventures if staying for more than a couple of days."

The surroundings are beautiful (across the street from Little Bay De Noc, Ludington Park and hotel, and great walk to Sand Point Lighthouse and boat docks), and it's only a 10-15 min walk to the beach areas. Plenty of restaurants down Ludington St, and plenty of areas to explore. I'll stay here again in a heartbeat."

Quick walk into the downtown district, shops and restaurants, and easy walk or bike to beaches. There are lake views from the Living Room and the yard! Nice neighborhood to walk around, also. The house is very comfortable, has all that I needed and just as described. Kate was very helpful and accommodating throughout the process. Parking is easy on the street or on their grass area off their alley-way. Lots of thoughtful provisions (beach towels, beach chairs) and the kitchen is well supplied with plenty of dishes. Nice bathroom and comfortable (albeit cozy!) bedroom. Bring your own bath soap/gel. A very good stay and would highly recommend for a couple, a small family (there's a pull-out couch also) and might work for two very friendly couples also. I was here for work so didn't get to see as much of the area as I would have liked, but lots!"

Beautiful flooring, new Anderson windows, fixtures in kitchen and bath look new, nicely decorated, comfortable furniture. Great view from living room picture windows of the bay. Escanaba is a small town, so house is not far from anything. Waterfront and park are walking distance. (Most guests would want/need a vehicle for going to restaurants.). Hosts have put a lot of thought into helpful, small kitchen items, such as the toaster oven and blender. Also, hosts provide beach towels and a large new washer & dryer. We would definitely stay here again."

Before booking our stay here I had read a comment about hallway traffic up & down the stairs. Yes, there is quite a bit of foot traffic although it did not whatsoever interfere with our stay. Met all our needs.

The kitchen was equipped with everything needed to prepare meals -- all sizes pots and pans, baking trays and dishes, mixing bowls, measuring glass, cups, and spoons -- and all the linens and oven gloves, too. Comfy couch and bed. Everything was nice and clean. The shower stall was on the small size, so do prepare for that if you're a bit tall or wide. Fantastic location, with so many diners and restaurants downtown (a block from Mueller's Pizza, a particular favorite of mine since childhood). I thought I'd hear a lot of noise from the busy intersection, but the walls are thick and the windows must be great, because it didn't bother me. There was quite a bit of foot traffic on the stairs to the upper apartments, both night and day; if you're a light sleeper, you may want to plan with some earplugs or noise cancelling (I found a phone app did the trick just fine)."

Stayed one night","THis is a lovely little place. It's an odd location but that's the nature of Escanaba. Everything seems to be on the main street and the highly running north of the town. The beautiful parts are all residential.
If you're an early riser, the place is fine. Because it's next to the stairway, you hear everyone coming down the stairs who are leaving at an early hour. And you're right at street level so there is some traffic but that's minimal at least when I was there.
But you can't beat the price and again the little place is very cozy."

The hosts were very informative about everything and messaged back quickly with responses. It was everything we needed for our stay in Esky and i know if we needed anything else or had questions we could ask our hosts. It was very quiet also, the other tenants are considerate of everyone else. I appreciate the closeness to the stores, restaurants and a nice park at the end if you drive through town. Thankyou for the beautiful and quaint place for us to lay our heads at night and chill for a bit. I will highly recommend this place to everyone. God bless!!"

During this time of virus restrictions we wanted a place where we could prepare meals and eat in comfort, but still be in a great location for shopping, visiting the local tourist places, and especially be within easy driving distance of the state parks in the area. The cupboards were full of all the dishes, pots, pans and silverware that we needed to prepare food and eat in comfort, even luxury. The apartment was clean, tidy and well apportioned. Response to questions via text messages came within minutes. We felt free to come and go as we pleased and felt that our gear was secure in the apartment as we went out for day trips. We stayed for almost two weeks and when we left we felt as though we were leaving a place we had come to think of as home."

Stayed a few nights","This stay was nothing short of amazing. I have soooooo much to say, but I’ll keep this review brief! I was in contact with the hosts from the very beginning, and they were extremely responsive from day one. They even provide a number for you to call/text when you have an issue. I texted them late Saturday evening about something that was not urgent and they still got back to me. The place is exactly as you see in the pictures and more. They are fully stocked with all the kitchen items you may need (even a grater and veggie peeler)! We were allowed access to everything in there, and clean up after was minimal. Sheets and towels were clean, and the whole unit was sparkling. I loved the bed so much I asked for details on the mattress. I had two awesome nights of rest! We got great local suggestions, and they provided magazines that helped us find a couple more activities. You stay right in the heart of downtown, super close to the water, parks, art gallery, and popular spots in town. The unit is literally on the street and the walls are fairly thin. However, at no point did we feel unsafe, and we were the only ones located where we were on the first floor. Getting in was very easy, instructions were clear, and check out was a breeze. 5/5 stay. Would definitely recommend, would absolutely stay again."

Stayed over a week","We had a terrific month long stay with Tony! We went up for easier access to snowmobiling, but that didn’t pan out with Mother Nature this year. Location was great for working remotely - great WiFi connection and having the extra bedrooms were perfect for office space. Meijer is 8 minutes away and it was super handy being close to town since we were there for an extended trip. At the same time, Tony’s place felt so private and calm even though it was only a few minutes away. Snowmobiling-wise, we trailered to the trailhead about 15 mins away and had easy access to the Bay de Noc grooming club trails - which are likely well-maintained when we have actual snow! With Tony and the pups living upstairs, we were definitely expecting that it may be noisy - I can happily report that any noises were much less noticeable than in our own home with no upstairs tenants. Props to a well-built home and respectful host!! We will hopefully be back next winter, with more snow! 🤞🏼"

Very responsive and respectful. 6 of us friends stayed comfortably and are looking forward to returning and recommending to our family and friends. Home is beautiful inside and love all the smallest details in the decor. The welcoming book was fantastic ! Home was easy to clean and loved the washer/dryer use. Gas grill with propane tank. ☆☆☆☆☆ Parking was plentiful! Fenced in backyard is much appreciated. We didnt bring pets this time but you had dog beds, treats and even bowls ready for their use. Thank You !!!

Tony’s place is a very short drive down the road from The Freshwater Tavern- know for its delicious food and breathtaking view. A drive through Bigby is also right down the road. Tony provides a fridge and freezer full of breakfast items which made mornings a breeze. He is proactive in messaging a few days prior, and always available by phone for questions or problems if they arise. We look forward to staying at Tony’s place again hopefully in the spring!"

Stayed with a pet","Very friendly and accomodating. Tony seriously thought of everything. I forgot to pack my reading glasses - he had a couple of extras. Fully stocked kitchen - clean and comfortable home. And "" pet friendly "" means just that. We've stayed at a couple places in the past where that was just a label until the barking started. But our three little monsters were safe and comfortable here. Although they were over stimulated and a little loud at times, Tony and his next door neighbor were really okay with it and set us at ease - which made the trip all the more relaxing.
Very easy host to work with. Had a couple of concerns on our first night - he got right back to us with an answer.
Awesome view of the lake. I understand there are some amazing sunrise views from the deck - sadly the weather didn't cooperate with us this time around. We'll definitely be planning another visit in the future."

Anything you would want, including coffee, juice, milk, eggs, breads, cereals and more! We really appreciated this after a long day of driving. It was also interesting to read where many pieces of the furnishings came from. Be sure to notice the beautiful dining table! The large fenced yard was great for our 2 dogs and us to enjoy. My husband especially loved sitting outside and building a fire with the provided wood. All the furniture was very comfortable. There’s a beautiful view of the lake from a patio off the main bedroom. We would definitely love to stay at Tony’s again."

Stayed one night","i've been staying at airbnb's for 8 years now and this one has really topped it! i stayed on my way from ontario to southern wisconsin and tony's place was the perfect place to relax and get re-oriented with driving. this place has all the amenities and more with green/eco driven touches--fish cleaning station, boot brushes outdoors, water softeners, and wood-industrial touches throughout. the northwoods has always been a second home & this place has all the charm you could ever want and more. also, they had breakfast options galore, FRESH 🐔&🦆 eggs, and cooking essentials. the space was very quiet & i kept mostly to myself.
i hope to come back & stay for a longer time soon!"

Nice backyard where we had a fire. I could hear the chickens clucking next-door, and I ate some of their eggs from our fridge for breakfast. It was nice to get up in the morning and sit on the front deck with a cup of coffee and watch the sun come up over Lake Michigan. For sure the best part for me was having all of that easy to snack on food available so many options and my kids were thrilled."

Hotels can’t accommodate us comfortably both psychically and financially. Highbanks was perfect. Clean. Full kitchen with all the kitchen tools needed. Local coffee was a great touch. We loved being able to do laundry. Beautiful view. A lot of places to charge devices. The details were fun to find and read about. We will definitely be back. We will definitely be back!

When our dog boarding fell through, I reached out to see if we could bring them with us. Tony was so incredibly kind and even encouraged us to bring them! He even left treats for them upon arrival.
The kitchen was FULLY stocked. The pictures you see are what you get and then some! The kids were so excited about the cereal and granola bars and we were thrilled with the fresh duck and chicken eggs.
The house was so comfortable we felt like we fit right in and when we had questions, Tony responded at record speed with helpful advice and recommendations.
Highly recommend! We've already told several people about this place and can't wait to return!"

He has thought of everything to make the stay more accommodating. My husband got his shoes soaking wet and it just so happened that Tony had a boot dryer in the apt! We forgot our pups water bowl but he had that too! I decided to cook a little and Tony's place had the things I needed so I wouldn't have to run to the grocery store. I love the master bedroom's view. And I love the comfy couch in the livingroom. It's like coming home when I'm on vacation-without the added responsibilities of home.

Our dog had been acting pretty anxious being in a new environment, so we asked Tony if he knew of a place to purchase a calming aid for her. He actually picked something up for us while he was out and about!
Our favorite places that we visited were Pictured Rocks, Fayette Historic State Park, and downtown Escanaba (hit up Yao’s Spa if you’re looking for a massage)!
We will definitely be back when the weather is a little warmer. Thank you Tony!!!

We loved seeing all of the craftsmanship and special touches he made to his place. The serve yourself bed and breakfast is a unique feature- something that sets his place apart from the rest. It was spacious, affordable, and in a great location for those visiting Escanaba or surrounding areas. It was a great space for myself, my mom, and my toddler daughter. The view of the lake from the primary bedroom was gorgeous- we even watched a sunrise complete with 7 deer crossing! We hope to return in the summer when our whole family can join and we can utilize the backyard more!"

The beds are comfortable and Lake Michigan is only a stone throw away. I found it to be the perfect place to rest my head before wandering East to visit Fayette Ghost Town and Kitch-iti-kipper! I highly recommend this Airbnb. Tony was very attentive and made sure we were comfortable."

Stayed one night","Airbnb at its absolute best! I have stayed in enough Airbnbs to know that Tony raises the this experience to a new level. I'd like to say that Tony's was a home away from home, but it's not. His set up is much better than my own place! He provides snacks, adult beverages, fruit, breakfast items, juices, spices and a fridge stocked with condiments. The freezer is filled with frozen waffles and frosted mugs! My two motorcycle buddies and I enjoyed the decor and accommodations. The outside is just as impressive. Grill, patio set, corn hole game, fire pit, a fish cleaning station, guest bicycles and a deck that overlooks the lake. What else can one ask for!? Well, one thing...what's the story with the mannequin? Airbnbers, this place is top notch! You may never experience this amount of ammenities anywhere else."

The place was huge, amazing and tasteful decor, spacious rooms, and even balcony with seating and backyard. It has everything I could ask for, if you happened to forget something at home, they probably have it for you just in case. Fully stocked kitchen as well, although we didn’t get a chance to use it. As a host myself, I can really tell the host thought everything through in terms of the guest experience, and it gave me some good ideas. If I ever come back to this area, I would 100% book again and recommend to others."

We especially loved all the food & drinks in the fridge and cupboards we were able to use. Saved us a lot of money not having to get breakfast the next day!

The kitchen is full of food and utensils/cooking tools, there is some beautiful yard space with a fire pit (which we regrettably didn’t make use of this time), free laundry machines, AND in such a lovely location (all aspects we seriously appreciated after a week of camping in the cold and rain)! The “green-friendly” policy here was also seriously appreciated!

You are close to many trails for hiking and biking, plus Pictured Rocks is an easy day trip away. I work remotely and the internet was always fast and reliable. The furniture was comfortable and the house held temperature well. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make meals, with groceries less than 20 minutes away. If you don't feel like cooking, Escanaba is close and has plenty of restaurant options. I enjoyed the fire pit out back. All in all this was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone passing through the area."

Stayed with kids","This location had a deal so it was extremely affordable. The home is set out in the country a bit, which was very quiet and extremely peaceful.
The home was spacious, and we liked the layout.
There was a pretty strong musty smell to the home, and it wasn't as clean as I would have liked. There were many cobwebs and spiders, along with lots of hair in the bathrooms and on furniture. There were also dirty dishes in the cabinets. The living room furniture should be updated and was quite uncomfortable. The kitchen drawers practically fall out when being opened.
I did not like that the home did not have a lockbox as stated on the listing. Instead, the home was left unlocked for several hours until we arrived.
Jesse, the host, was very friendly, proactive, and easy to communicate with. The Yooper bars (chocolate) were a nice touch. Overall, we had a nice trip and even purchased wood so we could use the pit. Thanks for hosting!"

We enjoyed the sandy beach, wonderful facilities and playground. At the house, we had all we needed to make breakfasts and lunches before going out to explore the shops, restaurants, beaches, parks and lighthouses in the Escanaba area. 5 stars for a wonderful summer vacation experience!

Fully modern and spotless bathroom. The property summons up days of old and had us curious about the original family that built and lived in the home. Brian, even though traveling in Europe, communicated promptly and was very helpful, offering information about local places of interest and expressed concern about our travels on the heels of a giant winter storm. We intend to return to Escanaba in the future; and our first check will be to arrange for Apartment #1 with Brian. Highly RECOMMEND this property and Brian's hospitality. —Michael"

Stayed over a week","From the very moment you walk in you feel welcomed. I stayed at the Ogden Manor for a little less than 2 months. Jeanne and Terry go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and like a true guest. A basket filled with treats was awaiting my arrival. They have everything you could possibly need while staying here - including some great reads, Netflix, cable, puzzles, game books, local magazines, and suggestions on great restaurants. I travel for work - I have been to many hotels or short term rentals, the thing that is always the highest on my list is cleanliness. This place is SPOTLESS!!! Like blow you out of the water clean - sparkling (literally) bathroom, floors so clean that you can slide across, sheets crisp and fresh, and not a speck of dust in the place. Thank you to Margie the FANTASTIC cleaning lady. There is a very comfy bed and two-pull out couches that turn to twin size beds. Plenty of towels/washcloths/hand towels. Extra set of fresh clean linens and extra blankets/pillows. Laundry is located in the basement and is $2/load. Jeanne and Terry introduced themselves and Jeanne gave me a tour of the other units. They have done so much work and have done a wonderful job keeping the charm and many original pieces in the home. It's super close to downtown, a great neighborhood to walk and close to Ludington Park (would be a GORGEOUS park in the summer/fall and so much to do there). I hadn't been to Escanaba prior to this and staying here definitely made me feel like I was ""living here"" . If I ever return I will be coming back here without a doubt. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!!!"

Felt safe with the windows open all night. Most remarkable to me was how quiet it was during my entire stay. There is a lovely park a block or so away. Meeting the hosts was icing on an already satisfying cake. I will be back. And you should come stay."

Stayed a few nights",Terry and Jeanne were great hosts. The appartment was lovingly restored part of a historical house in Escanaba. We had everything we needed and a nice gift basket to boot. The location is about 2 and a half blocks from Little Bay De Noc and a beautiful park. Many of the homes in the area are historical and most are well cared for. Jeanne and Terry stopped in as we were finding our way around to introduce themselves and showed us around. We had a parking area and entrance from the rear of the building. This was a great place to stay for a few days or longer. It was our first time in Escanaba and had a great time touring the area to celebrate our wedding anniversary. My wife and I highly recommend this property for a couple getting away.

Stayed a few nights","A girlfriend and I booked one of the units for Labor Day weekend and to be honest, we were just super excited to get away and plan our first trip together in the U.P., that we didn't fully vet this place out. We thought it looked cute, the price was reasonable, and the location was nice. That said, we weren't 100% sure of what to expect of the space, because there weren't a ton of pictures in the listing. Well, let me tell you - her and I were PLEASANTLY surprised when we checked in.
As soon as we walked into our home for the weekend, we immediately got excited. It was homey, and a lot roomier than we imagined. Comfy bed and couches + a nice bathroom that's equipped with towels and toiletries. Loved the personal touches, like the handwritten note, a welcome basket of Yooper-made goodies, and even surgical gloves (who wouldn't appreciate gratis PPE in this pandemic?!?!).
We did a lot of outdoorsy stuff throughout our stay, and coming back to the Airbnb felt like a nice warm hug perfect for closing out the day. I would totally recommend! Thank you, Terry and Jeanne :)"

Their place was quiet, large, and had on street as well as parking in the back. I highly recommend choosing Terry and Jeanne if you ever stay in Escanaba."

Stayed a few nights","Jeanne and Terry's place was great! Just a couple blocks from Ludington Park and downtown Escanaba in a pretty neighborhood. The space was clean and had everything we needed. Since it's a house divided up into five apartments, the layout is a little wonky, but nothing too crazy. They supplied a bunch of snacks and drinks that were very thoughtful and helpful for our long drives and hikes as we explored around the UP, and for the price, this was an amazing value!"

Stayed with kids","Terry and Jeanne could not have been better hosts- from the welcome basket full of goodies including a gift certificate to a local restaurant to the little touches like Chinese checkers to make you feel at home. It is extremely close to a HUGE PARK with beach access. The place was SPARKLING CLEAN and they provided baggies with gloves and masks during this crazy Covid-19 era. Jeanne gave us a tour of the whole house and their current progress on the historic restoration with modern touches. It will be absolutely breathtaking. However, the best part about the place was even in my error of mixing up my checkout date they completely understood and despite my profound embarrassment due to my pregnancy brain, assured me it was ok and threw in the night for free. You just can’t find KINDNESS like that very many places anymore. Thank you both so much!"

The bedroom is charming, bed comfortable, and the living room has two couches each that open up into extra beds. There is a full kitchen and the bathroom had a nice big bar of lavender soap for the tub/shower and good shampoo and conditioner. There were even locally sourced welcoming treats in the kitchen.

Lots of nice touches like a fully loaded picnic basket (blanket and plates, cups, utensils). Very comfortable living room, kitchen and bedroom. Gorgeous restored woodwork, etc, I could go on. The front porch is lovely to sit on day or night. Escanaba is about an hour and 20 min drive to both Pictured Rocks and Marquette. A great launching point with some good downtown restaurants and a brewery and wine tasting shop. Also the town has a 24 hour grocery store. Jeanne and Terry are good people with genuine hospitality. Stay here. I would do it again."

Stayed a few nights","Phenomenal! This is the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in and we always use Airbnb when traveling.
Ogden View Manor is a gorgeous historic house just a few blocks away from the Lake Michigan, restaurants and shopping. The house is split into a few units that are all accessed from the foyer. The private rear entrance adjoins your off street parking. If Jeanne hadn’t told us that there were other people staying in the house, we would have never known - we didn’t encountered anyone or hear any noise in the house at all during our three day stay. It was very private.
Our suite was spacious and felt much more like a high end bed and breakfast than the average Airbnb. Literally everything that we needed (and more) was all there from the fully equipped kitchen down to the organic handmade soap in the bathroom. The house is decorated with a mixture of lovely antiques and modern fixtures making it beyond comfortable. Great bed and an even better front porch complete with rocking chairs!
Jeanne is wonderful! She showed us around the place and made herself available as little or as much as we would like during our stay. She made great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area.
Stay here! It’s as simple as that. You will be glad you did. We will be returning to Ogden View Manor during our next trip to the UP."

Lisa has put a lot of thought into the amenities and decor! I am highly sensitive to scents/detergents so I especially appreciated no air fresheners and free & clear detergent being used. Comfy beds/linens, spotless bathroom, great shower, TV, well stocked kitchen. As mentioned, it is downtown across the street from a bar which was a little too lively for our liking Friday night but the noise from that was much better Saturday night. It was a holiday weekend so it’s understandable, but I would recommend bringing a white noise machine or fan to help block some of that out if staying during a weekend. Walkable to a handful of restaurants plus a chocolate shop/gift shop and the Swedish Pantry. We really enjoyed our time here!"

This is probably due to the age of the building & windows. If you turn on the ceiling fans, that helps. Overall, the apartment is a great stay and walkable to several restaurants and shops."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED our stay here. We stayed here for our honeymoon and this was our first Airbnb experience… it did not disappoint! My husband and I both despise hotels (due to lack of cleanliness, etc.,) and we will only rent Airbnb’s from now on! This place was SPOTLESS, I was SO impressed with how clean it was. Whoever does the cleaning truly does a wonderful job! We loved staying right downtown and we really enjoyed the cafe’s near by. Applewood Eatery & Espresso Bar is right downstairs (great food, great coffee) and across the street was Stone Cup Coffee House & Stone’s Deli (amazing coffee, the scones & bakery items are so good, and the food is amazing). Highly recommend checking out these two places. Only thing we could complain about was the noise of cars driving by, people revving their cars down the street, and drunk people walking home late at night from the bar next door. Being right downtown, the noise was expected though. I’m sure if you used a fan, it would help block it out!"

Parking was easy for us and we never had a problem finding a spot to park on the side street. Also, we could look out the kitchen window and see our car anytime we wanted to check on it.

Stayed with kids","The good: the unit is immaculate (clean and updated), the kitchen ware is adequate, the faucets water heats up fast, 4-5 minutes from Meijer/Walmart, good cell service.
the bad: outside the unit is less well kept including active spider webs(wife hates bugs with a passion), noticable road noise (although the street had much less traffic than I expected), it's less kid friendly than other options, 18"" dishwasher with oversized plates/bowls
for us we'd probably rate it 3/5, but gave it a 4 because I figure not everyone will care about a few spiders in the corner of outside hallway and even though I didn't see the warning about it not being kid friendly, it does indeed give that warning. We made it work with a 4/2 year old, but another place may have been less worrisome."

Stayed a few nights","We appreciated the functional space with a working kitchen and comfortable TV/living room. Beds were comfortable and individual air-conditioning allowed for personal temperature preferences.
Apartment is located up 21 stairs through a musty smelling staircase in an old downtown building with a bar across the street. The entry door did not lock which is a safety issue as downtown was pretty desolate at night.
Spotty WiFi.
Feel bad to say this, but is was a bit of disappointment."

Stayed a few nights","When we opened the door to the stairway which lead to the apartment, we were a little worried, but the second we opened the actual apartment door we were BLOWN AWAY! Lisa's place is incredible! I think I liked it more than my own home! It is beautifully decorated and had everything you could ever want or need. We didn't spend much time in the apartment because we were on the go during our 3 night stay, but if we wanted to stay home and cook instead of dining out, this would be the place. Appreciated having coffee and creamer in the fridge as I must have my caffeine first thing. Great bed/bedding, comfy sofa, nice tv, lovely bathroom and soaker tub. We had luxury at a bargain price! Better than any hotel!
Sidenote: If you want an authentic diner experience, head to Rosy's a couple doors down! Owner is a gem!
Another great spot to hit in Escanaba is the Upper Hand Brewery."

She had food for the first morning so we didn’t have to go to the store right away.
She is upgrading the house. There is new siding, and a new patio - too bad we were not here during nicer weather.
We enjoyed our time here and would consider returning."

It wasn’t clear to me from the description and photos that the only bath/shower is in the upstairs bathroom. Not a big deal for me, but I could see that being an issue for some. Lots of personal touches, like toys and books for kids, fans in the bedrooms, and water bottles in the fridge. Host is VERY responsive, which was great. The neighborhood seems okay, though the homes are quite close together. The house was easy enough to find, even at night. Overall, it was a good stay."

We absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom and the gorgeous updated bathroom. That walk in shower was great!
Everything was very clean. The dining room was perfect for enjoying our coffee and meals. Our first night we got in at dinner time so we grabed Pasties from Dobbers, but we also prepared foods on the nice stove as well. Lori has thought of everything when it comes to the kitchen and has all the basics for cooking stocked in the fridge and cabinets.
The living room area was comfy and the smart TV with all the go-to streaming apps available was a great addition.
Overall we loved our stay and would definitely book with Lori again."

Everything is set up to make you feel at home. There is a binder of what to do and see in the area. Around the house are little notes to help you along the way.

Great mattresses and bedding. We loved that we could walk to both the bay as well as downtown restaurants and shopping (those that were open). Escanaba is a great home base for UP adventures. Julia was wonderful to work with!! Would definitely stay here again."

The fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer and bathroom were a pleasant surprise. The welcome basket was phenomenally filled with local chocolates, coffee and nuts. Nice and relaxing location within walking distance from library (even a a free little library) beach, park, light house and museum, shopping (book, antique, arts, candy/cupcake specialty shops, thrift store…) and restaurants. Also, the WiFi in the apartment was excellent."

Bought some amazing coffee, went to the DeYoung Family Zoo which is only an hour away and their is local shopping for groceries..Meijer/Walmart.
Overall, it was a quiet neighborhood with views from both sides of the apartment. One being the lake in the back.
Definitely would rent again without a doubt."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment above the coffee shop is great! It’s in such a good location in town and you’re able to walk to anywhere up and down the main st.
There are 3 windows facing the Main Street that allow you to lookout into the town of Escanaba. The light traffic and handful of people walking along the side walk gave me a sense of comfort and warmth. Occasionally, I would hear a distant and feint horn from a ship in the harbor. Another pleasant comfort.
The bathroom/shower is very nice and clean. Water pressure is great and gets hot!
Their was a cute welcome basket that contained some gourmet coffee made by the hosts. I enjoyed the Hunters Brew.
I had my two children visiting with me and they enjoyed the puzzles and games that were also in the home.
The couches are very comfortable and the lighting is cozy.
I would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Julia did a great job in the description of her AirBnB. Then through the whole process, she was very responsive and did a great job in communicating and answering any questions that we have.
It is a great apartment in a great location. I think that you can tell from the photos and descriptions, but getting into the apartment could pose a problem if an individual had mobility issue. Steps up (both outside and inside) could be challenging for some.
Lights On and SUPER Clean made the entrance into the apartment AFTER dark a great start to our 3 night trip. THANKS!!"

Great walking distance to the park, library, and other local businesses.
We traveled with young kids and loved our 7 night stay here. We used the high chair and the AC was nice to cut the hot/humid air. There were fans to help move the air and a ceiling fan.
Many days we had the windows open to allow the lake breeze in. Parking in the back with a new staircase and a small table and chairs to enjoy the fresh air.
We WILL stay here again!"

It was a great jumping off point for us to explore the UP the next day (Pictured Rocks in Munising and dinner in Marquette)."

The living room is spacious, with large windows and two large sofas. The bathroom is good-sized, with retro black-and-white floor tile. Body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and hand soap are all provided. The stacked washer and dryer was a nice convenience, with even a couple of laundry pods thrown in. Finally, parking in the rear of the unit was easy. Don't be deterred by the wooden steps. They are well-built and rock solid. If you love coffee, you'll love the smell that permeates the unit."
