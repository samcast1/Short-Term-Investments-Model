Group trip","The home was clean, cozy, and had everything that we needed. It was located in a quaint neighborhood that felt safe and provided some quiet. There was a point that we heard some vehicle noise from a nearby city street, but nothing too disturbing. We enjoyed the comfort of the place and were so grateful we had a quiet place to stay, instead of a cramped hotel room. There was a railroad track beside the house, but we figured out that it was no longer in use. Comfy back porch with plenty of room to just hang out. And it was close to places to eat and get the things that we needed. Thank you for a home away from home. We truly enjoyed our stay."

Everything you could need is supplied in the kitchen: dishes glasses, utensils, pots and pans as well as a blender and coffee with the Keurig which carafe and pod capable. We loved that there were 3 bedrooms along with 3 full baths 2 of which were on-suites! The outside area is also set up nicely with a bbq pit, fire pit, and seating. The decor is very nice as well. And lastly it is a great location so close to restaurants and campus. We would definitely stay here again."

Group trip","While in Starkville for a wedding, we enjoyed a weekend stay in this lovely home. Prior to arrival, Heather provided all necessary information concerning check in and other useful information regarding the home. Upon arrival we found this home to be exceptionally clean and even better than photos depicted. Plenty of room both inside and outside on the back deck. It was well equipped with any necessities that you would need such as laundry detergent, dish detergent, paper products, and coffee essentials. Plenty of linens were provided, and the beds were comfy. Our group felt right at home. The location was perfect, near to all the best Starkville has to offer but quiet at night. Heather checked on us during our stay to ensure that all our needs were met. They were! I’m so glad that we chose to stay here over a hotel! If in Starkville, we will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",We were very happy with our stay at the Cowbell Condo. We were visiting MSU as the family of a perspective student and we wanted to be close to campus so our son could really get a feel for college life. The condo was in a quiet apartment complex. The space was comfortable and perfect for our family to relax and hang out throughout the weekend. Debra was attentive. She checked in periodically to make sure we were able to check in easily and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","Definitely do yourself a favor and request to rent Marisol's airbnb!! It was our last weekend in Starkville as a family and I am so happy Marisol allowed for us to stay at her home!! IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!
My niece graduated w/ her masters as well as finishing up her softball career at MSU and having a home that we were able to gather & fellowship was AWESOME.
House has a great open concept. Rooms are huge beds comfy each room has a bathroom either as an en suite or right next to it. Patio is a great place to hang - watch TV - and with the outdoor sink & grill can enjoy bbq'ing-plenty of parking - well thought out floor plan.

Marisol is a FABULOUS host. She's well stocked on ALL essentials- she even has snacks/coffee pods/condiments/etc
We accidentally locked ourselves out and it was late at night, she sent help over to rescue us - 5 minutes tops!
If I can give this place a 10 STAR rating I would - stay here - YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!
THANKS MARISOL FOR EVERYTHING!"

The neighborhood was also a quiet street, very convenient to any additional items we needed. Can't thank her enough. Hope the house is open when we return to visit family or an MSU game."

Parking is very specific, but not bad once you understand the instructions (Tyler clearly spells these out). The pool is shallow- only 3.5' at it's deepest point - but perfect for little ones to play in and the gym key is provided in the condo. The beds are comfortable and it doesn't feel like Tyler used cheap furnishings as some AirBNB hosts do - this feels like Tyler takes pride in his place and cares about his guest's comfort."

Stayed a few nights","We visited Starkville for our granddaughter’s graduation and stayed in this charming cottage. Everything was wonderful, from the comfortable bed, luxurious linens, great location, and well-stocked kitchen, to the beautiful bathroom. Mississippi-themed items were found throughout, from books, puzzles, and games to wall decor! So much history and so much fun! We also greatly appreciated the K-cups for our first morning there. We have stayed in many BnBs, and we have the highest recommendation for this cottage. It is the perfect respite for one or two people."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay here! While small, the space was exactly what we needed with a comfortable seating area, internet connected TV and well-equipped kitchen. The hosts were very responsive and clearly communicated the location, how to get in the place for check-in, etc.
We also loved the convenience of the location and walked several places. It should be no surprise that late night weekend music from the District can be loud enough to hear clearly, and not everyone walking home at the wee hours are at their quietest. But that didn’t detract from our overall appreciation of the experience and we would definitely return and recommend it."

I immediately felt at home and relaxed, especially with all of the clean spaces and cozy furnishings. The value was exceptional, especially with the proximity to campus and cool neighborhood restaurants, etc. It was also great to be able to wake up and make coffee that was provided (after a late night arrival). As an artist, I appreciated the carefully designed interior elements, cultural books, and local craft and artwork. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Mississippi State University, and I would absolutely return."

Stayed a few nights","This cottage was lovely! It is small, as advertised, but not cramped. My husband and I were very comfortable during our stay. The design is well thought out and the finishes are high end. The location is great as well. It’s located in a nice neighborhood and is an easy walk or drive to campus or downtown. Communication and check is was excellent and the snacks and drinks left by the host were awesome after a long day of traveling."

It’s the PERFECT place to stay when visiting Starkvegas! Close enough to walk to everything! The host always makes us feel if we are her personal friends/family with those extra touches like plenty of coffee/teas, etc! A welcome tray with notes about the town and cute snacks/treats! The furniture is all so comfortable and cozy! That bed is truly like sleeping on a cloud! The kitchen has everything you’d need to cook a meal if you felt like it, but the restaurants in Starkville are too good so we never eat in! BUT a cup of coffee watching highlights of an MSU and Brave’s win is pretty sweet in the comforts of the Cottage!!"

Everything was perfect when we arrived and clean.
Frances is very kind and welcoming. He was very responsive and respectful to our questions and needs.

Stayed one night","Frances was great. I had to book last minute due to an emergency situation and I had booking info within 10-15 minutes and was able to be at the BNB right as I got the info. Due to the situation (had a pet getting an emergency surgery at the Vet school), she accommodated great due to my needs. I requested a late checkout and she replied instantly and accommodated. I booked during a very high stress moment and she made it so easy. I am not sure I have ever had this smooth of an experience. Also, since I wasn’t planning on staying overnight in Starkville I did not have all my necessities but the studio had everything! (Detergent pods, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and all personal hygiene necessities). Also, after a very stressful day, we went to map the nearest restaurant & found out we were within walking distance of all the top rated restaurants! Will definitely be booking again when in Starkville. Made it such a stress free experience during such a stressful time."

Stayed one night","My husband and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this cozy studio apartment in the heart of Starkville, and it was fantastic! The location is perfect, right in the lively college town atmosphere. The studio is well-designed and makes excellent use of space. It's equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay, from a fully stocked kitchenette to a comfortable bed. The decor is modern and inviting, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Frances made sure the apartment was warm upon our arrival. One of the highlights is the proximity to the college campus and local attractions. Whether you're a student, visiting for a game day, or just exploring Starkville, this place is ideal. The host was incredibly responsive and accommodating, making the check-in/check-out process seamless. I would recommend backing in the parking spot vs pulling in, just makes things easier if the parking lot is full. Overall, I highly recommend this studio for anyone visiting Starkville."

Stayed a few nights","When arriving in the dark, it can a little tricky to find the entrance to the apt door. I don't think there is much more detail that could be added in their description, just have to work through and would suggest having a flashlight handy once you go through the iron gate into the covered breezeway. If the light in that area is off, it's very dark to find the steps. Slight hiccups in alloted parking spot being available but host was responsive in alternatives. It's a shared apt building so neighboring units could be heard relatively easily. Might be something to be considered if light sleeper. All in all, very good value and responsive hosts were much appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","This home was perfect for our trip and family of 4. The home is tucked away in a little loop of houses and is very private. No noisy neighborhood!!!! The home is actually much larger than the pictures show. We loved the open floor plan and I especially loved the decor. It was very nice and also very homey and old timey (some decor) at the same time. My 19 year old said his bed was the best one he has ever slept in, and that the wifi was excellent. He would watch YouTube on his phone all night and we all know how important that is. Haha.
The master shower was AMAZING!! We are so jealous that we didn’t do that same shower head style on our home!
The location was ideal. We went for MSU orientation and we were only 1.5 miles from the student union. We went out to eat each night and only drove 1.5 miles out for either place!! Umi (?) habachi and then Georgia Blue. Both were very easy to get to, get into, and the food was great!
We would definitely book here again!"

The Cottage has the home feel you want when staying at an Airbnb - so comfortable - relaxing - soothing. And Heather is hands down the best host!

We could get to campus in about ten minutes for women's basketball at The Hump and the amazing Mississippi State cheese at MAFES. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook full meals. The back yard was ideal for Augie Doggie to run around and play. He even made friends with the dogs behind the back fence. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, and we are looking very forward to coming back for an extended stay. Thanks, Heather, and Hail State!"

To get to the condo, you will need to turn in-between two brick buildings/condos. It is not on the main road like the nav system will try to navigate you to it. There are also two condos in front of it that has a walkway to this one. It was quiet, and also walking distance to different restaurants. We were happy with the accommodations.

They provide everything that you need from soaps and shampoos to coffee pods in the kitchen. There is a list of great spots to visit and restaurants. We tried two of the recommendations and they were really good.
If we're lucky enough to get into MSU - this will be our regular place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","This place was great, but the bells from the church next door woke us up at 7am sharp each morning, which was a bummer since this was a trip for pleasure. I think they stopped ringing at 9pm and started right back up at 7am. Bells ring on the hour, every hour, with many rings in between. The church is literally next door, so it’s loud.
I know the bells are out of Jarrod’s control, but it would make me not stay here again. It’s disappointing because my son is a freshman, so I see us making many trips to Starkville over the next few years, and I’d love to stay here again.
Otherwise, the house was great! It’s walkable to anything in the Cotton District, has great amenities that make it feel like home, and the outdoor space was enjoyed due to nice weather while we were there."

Stayed a few nights","Overall our stay was great!
Pros: Jarrod was very responsive and provided good information about check-in/check-out and the area, including recommendations for restaurants, etc. The bedrooms were very comfortable, and there was lots of space. Being tucked away from the street, it's very quiet while still being super close to the Cotton District restaurants. There are some really nice updates in the home (counters, linens, furniture, etc.).
Cons: It was very humid when we were in town (not surprising for MS), and the air conditioning seemed to have trouble keeping the humidity inside the house at bay. The half bath is tucked under the stairs and may not be comfortable for taller guests (my kids loved it). Some minor repairs/updates would make this 5 stars!
Overall, it was a very good value for the cost!"

Outdoor lighting at night needs work, would make one feel more secure & easier to fine the unit.
You may consider turning down the temp in hit water heater to 125° to conserve energy while still providing ample hot water for showers.
Minor ant issue that should be addressed by monthly pest control.
Minor HVAC maintenance would resolve odor issue.
All in all nice place & we enjoyed our stay."

The place itself was incredible - the kitchen was of my dreams, and the details throughout the whole place were spectacular. There is a super cute patio off the kitchen that offers complete privacy for outdoor hangs. This will definitely be my go-to spot for any Starkville trip moving forward. Can't say enough about how great it was!"

The unit itself was an older unit that's had some refurbishing done.
If you're looking for a quiet stay, this is not the place for you. Lots of noise on the street until late at night because you're surrounded by college kids. If you can live with that, it's a good place in a great location.
Only complaint that I have really is that there were two parking places assigned to this unit, but nobody respects reserved parking spaces apparently, because both of my spots were parked in by kids hanging out in local apartments."

In fact, he kept in contact with us periodically to make sure there were no questions or any additional services he could provide for us during our stay. Bryan went above and beyond as I had made a mistake when I originally booked the property. He contacted Air BnB for me and got the issue straighten out in less than 2 hours. A great stay.

Stayed a few nights","SO HAPPY that we stumbled upon this wonderful little place for our mini vacay in Starkville!!!
Easy to find and access, absolutely ADORABLE decor, stocked with everything we could need! Beds were super comfy and even had peppermints on our pillows! :D It was definitely the perfect atmosphere that allowed us to really relax and unwind for a couple of days!
Bryan went absolutely above and beyond to make sure that we felt right at home! He checked on us frequently throughout our stay and made sure we knew he was only a text away if we needed anything!
Would 110% recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to call home for a few days! Will definitely be booking here again! :)"

Stayed a few nights",Very nice apartment. Bryan was an outstanding host who went above and beyond a normal host. From leaving harpy’s for our kiddos to having tons of board games to play every bit of it was outstanding. The apartment was very spacious and up to date. It had a very homey feel and everything we needed for cooking was provided.

Stayed a few nights","The personal touches during our visit were what meant the most to our family. Prior to our visit, the host was very gracious about making an unexpected change to our reservation. There was clear communication about location and check-in. The host was friendly and touched base a few times during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed and were not having any problems. We were pleased with how close the condo was to MSU's campus. The place itself was sparkling clean when we arrived. Also, there was cold water in the fridge, goodies on the coffee table, and mints on our pillows (!) waiting for us. We highly recommend this Airbnb and definitely want stay there again on our next trip to Starkville."
