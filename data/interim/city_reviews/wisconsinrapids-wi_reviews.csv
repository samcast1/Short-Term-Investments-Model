With multiple areas for gathering, a beautiful grill and patio, fire pit patio, and an almost magical hot tub room! There was plenty of firewood for the fireplace and the fire pit (a big deal for my husband), and everything we needed to feel right at home. I am looking forward to utilizing this for a future retreat! Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Good location, near everything. Very spacious and bright. Sofas in TV room very comfortable - unusual for an Airbnb. Outdoor space was extremely nice and private, though we only could enjoy it a little bit due to weather. I would have liked to see just a bit more on convenience items. There was no coffee grounds for the drip coffee maker, and I didn't want to buy a whole bag at the store because I don't use them at home. I also had to hunt for some soap for the shower, though there was plenty of shampoo. Also, although there were streaming services on the TV, you had to use your own log ins (which I didn't remember). It would have been nice if a couple were complimentary. But, since we were gone most of the time, it was fine."

Stayed a few nights","We got just what we expected - a very pleasant stay in a cute, inexpensive home that fit our vacation budget. The home was very clean and nicely appointed, and Susan was very responsive to our questions. We appreciated the signs around the house that anticipated our FAQs. The home was very clean, terrific main bed, and the property is next to a walking/riding path that my wife used for a pleasant 1/2 day stroll. It was an easy run between the area golf courses (Lake Arrowhead, Sand Valley) and I can imagine more people could enjoy this property for golf getaways.
My only real regret would be that there is no outside space to really speak of. On nice summer evenings, stepping out to enjoy a cocktail would be welcomed! The bath is also tiny- could challenge more than 2 guests. But everything Susan could fix to make the place accommodating seemed to be there."

The house was extremely clean. The rooms are on the small side, but functional. The bed was comfortable. Nice TV setup in family room.
There are plenty of kitchen and dining items. Everything worked as it should.
Hothome has notes and explanations all over the house to make your stay easier. If you are a fan of visual management, you will love this house. All her notes and signs do make the stay much easier.
Communication was A+.
This is the 2nd house in Wisconsin Rapids we really liked. I would stay here again. I will stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","This AirBnb was by far the best we have stayed in. The moment we walked in, we felt at home. What stood out most was the attention to detail by the host to ensure their guest felt comfortable. We were greeted with doggie treats for our pup, a snack bucket filled with chips and granola bars, a complementary coffee and hot coco bar, phone chargers by the bedside, the most comfortable beds ever and so many board games which came in handy on a rainy day! The house itself is incredible, spacious and clean. We loved to sit on the large porch each morning, watch the sunrise and listen as the birds chirp. Most mornings, we also could catch a deer or turkey walk through the yard. Renting over a holiday, we found that the host took extra time to decorate by adding some simple yet elegant home decor, which was noted by our family and helped set the tone and get us into the holiday spirit for the weekend. We will be back for sure as this was one of the most memorable weekends we’ve had!"

Stayed over a week","Excellent 2-storey house, with 2 bedrooms with king and queen beds, bathroom and toilet, well-equipped American kitchen, washer and dryer, BBQ, pingpong table, back patio... Highlight the views and sunsets over the lake, almost no neighbors, very quiet and a 7 minute drive to Nekoosa (supermarket and McDonalds) and 15 to Wis Rapids (Walmart and many restaurants). You can fish in the lake but there is not excessive activity either. It's worth a lot to spend 1-2 weeks relaxing. Very good value for money and Brandon helped us at all times and even made it easier for us to check out so we could wait for a postal package. We would undoubtedly repeat! We would only improve the ability to have a sofa with head rest, but it's something salvageable with the outdoor rocking chairs."

The dozen fresh eggs and 6 pack of spotted cow beer were such a special touch! The bed was so comfortable and plenty of towels for showers! Our 4 legged family members appreciated the duck jerky! Awesome experience renting with Nicole and would rent again when in the area! Highly recommended!!"

There were board games, plenty of tea, water and coffee, and fresh eggs. There were a lot of thoughtful touches (spices, cookware, instructions, toiletries, etc.) and everything seemed pretty new."

Stayed with kids","First time AirBnB'er. Had an important family event in the Rapids. Family lives there but not the room for us. Looked for the hotels in the area. I am not a fan of shady hotels, I'll pay for cleanliness and piece of mind. The Hotel cost and fees were way past my budget. Ventured into the Airbnb and a couple properties popped up. After a lot of review this one stayed in my mind. I had a couple questions for the owner and she WAS VERY accommodating. The place felt like a second home. Neighbors didn't look at you crossed eyed because you were someone new. just said hello and carried on their way. For less than the local Higher end hotels, this property had SO much more. Clean, Quiet, Comfortable, Accommodating, Private, and Relaxing. I WILL every time I am in the Rapids plan on staying here. If you want a pool then head to the hotel. Want a home a way then book here. GREAT PLACE AND GREAT OWNER"

Also, the same mentioned lock stopped accepting our code and also wouldn’t lock when leaving. Had to contact host twice and she was able to fix it on her end.
Neighbor has a loud diesel also, but not the hosts fault."

Stayed a few nights","My dad, daughter and I stayed here for a family reunion at the park next door! From the start Julie was amazing and ensured we were able to find the cabin, and check in with ease. Julie and her family made sure to make our comfort a priority. We loved our stay! The cabin is so cozy and cute. It is in a prime location, easy walking trails, an ice cream shop, close shopping, friendly neighbors, fishing, and a bonfire to boot! The wifi was WAY better than we have at home :-) Many, many thanks for the kindness and hospitality. What a find! If we are ever back to WR we would stay again in a heartbeat! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","This was such a great little cottage and once you've drive there, and found it (LOL) , was in the perfect place for everywhere you need to be. So many things to do just a short walk away. Very quiet community. The screened in porch was great to sit out in the morning and evenings. To get to the lake it is on quite a slant like bowl, but worth it. Beds and couches were very comfortable to sleep on. Bathroom is a bit small for someone of bigger stature. Shower was very clean and refreshing after a hot humid day out. Only thing we were missing there were toiletries such as shampoo and conditioner. The towels were excellently soft, loved them. Lol The smart TV was a great surprise. The window A/C was very sufficient to cool down the whole cottage and it was quite hot when we had our stay. If we are ever in the area again, I will definitely look this up to stay again. Julie was great to respond when we had questions about the area and things to do. Highly recommend this Air bnb"

Stayed with kids","This couple really bent over backward for us. When we first arrived Julie's husband Al, offered to help us launch our boat so he drove with me to the boat launch so I wouldnt get lost trying to find it and then he drove my truck back to the house, while I drove the boat back. Then he offered his dock to tie up to for the entire stay. Consequently, we didn't have to put the boat in and out every day, just in once and out once. By the way, he helped me get it out at the end of the trip too. This fact alone made the trip so much more enjoyable for my family. The fishing at the lake was good too and the house is only a hundred feet away from the waters edge. The cabin was fairly priced and I feel like we definitely got our money's worth. Also, the place was freshly remodeled by Al himself and he did a fine job. Nothing extra fancy but very nice. This is the best Airbnb experience we've ever had and we've done quite a few. Best wishes to Julie and Al. They're good people and deserve your business. If you stay here, I don't think you will be disappointed!"

Stayed with a pet","We love staying at Nita’s place. It is the best stocked Airbnb I have ever visited. The kitchen has everything you need. The bathrooms have tons of towels and showers are stocked with shampoo and soaps. There are also extra blankets in the bedroom closets. The house was decorated for Christmas so we felt right at home.
The neighborhood is great for walking and was very quiet during our stay. There is also a very well maintained 8 acre dog park a 5 minute drive away if you are traveling with pets.
Nita was very responsive to any questions we had. This is truly a 5 star stay."

We have 4 small children and a Pup and Our family was able to try new things like paddle boarding and Kayaking. This place is stocked! If you simply showed up with clothes and groceries you’d be set! Every size life jackets, all the Sand toys so many areas on the property to just sit and visit or explore are just a few things that really stood out! The entire cottage has a warm vibe and all the decor is beautiful and perfect for a lake home! We hope to be back soon! I bet it’s beautiful in the winter too! Nita was very attentive and quick to respond truly a joy to rent from!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is absolutely awesome. We were a little hesitant at first booking since it was a new place for our family but we loved it. We went with several adults and 2 little kids. When we say this place is kids friendly we mean it. Private bunk room for the kids, incredibly safe, tons of activities, private well kept beach, and just a lot of room to explore. No one felt like they were on top of each other during our trip and had plenty of room to spread out and relax. We ended up having our vacation during the hottest day of the year and it was still enjoyable. Plenty of shade and a cool lake but when it got too hot there were a lot of activities indoors. We can't say enough good things about this place."

Awesome access to lake, sandy beach, and nice fishing & dock. Very peaceful & relaxing. Plus, many things to do in Rome: mini golf, splash pad, gift stores, Rome Country Meats & Deli (yum!), Market Boutique, Slice of Heaven Bakery (yum!), fun dinner at Hoozels Bar with trivia night, and we took the granddaughters horseback riding at Big Horn Ranch 15 min away. Definitely on our radar for another stay."

It is cozy, superbly stocked and has 3 floors of bedrooms, two very spacious bathrooms and 2 living room areas - one on the main floor and one on the lower level. It was perfect for the four of us and our dogs but would also accommodate a larger group. The street and area are great for walking. It is also just a few miles from a wonderful dog park.
Nita is also excellent at communicating. We received check in instructions exactly when she said she would, check in was easy and she made sure we had every thing we needed once we arrived. But we didn't have to ask for anything as we were well taken care of.
We definitely plan to stay again. This is a five star stay!!"

If travelling with littles, plan on brining dishes/utensils as needed. Lots of sand toys for young ones and the older kids loved the kayaks/paddleboards. We rented the pontoon and thoroughly enjoyed our time outdoors, we had the most perfect summer weather!
The layout of the house is excellent for having the kids upstairs in their own room together for a cousin sleep over, a bit cramped on the main level with the group, but we spent a ton of time outdoors so it was not a big deal. We didn't leave the property during our stay, so no suggestions on local attractions. Time went too fast, should have stayed a couple more nights!"

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful time here. The place was well decorated with all the amenities you could need. Nita messaged us with all the information well before our trip so I was able to pack appropriately. The beach was private which is so nice and the space was very quiet. I loved the touch of the binoculars and telescope in the house - there were so many birds to watch!
We took a vacation here as a small family with our almost 3 year old. There were toys he could play with and a bed in the loft bedroom with rails which made us feel easier at night! The only thing I would mention if you are bringing small children is that the stairs to the lower level is open so bringba baby gate if you are concerned about that. The rails around the loft area (not the loft bedroom) have quite a bit of space between them so you'll want to keep an eye on small children when up there as well. This wasn't a drawback at all, just a reminder to be aware of if you do bring small children (and if there are any that tend to be more of daredevils like mine!).
We definitely will consider staying here again if we get the opportunity!"

Stayed a few nights","Our family spent 4 days at the Smith Family Cabin for a quiet lake family getaway. The cabin was well equipped with everything you need as if it were your own home. The pictures capture their home and lake well, but we were even more impressed once we arrived. The home was welcoming and super comfy. The directions and notebook left by the Smith’s had clear instructions to where everything was within their home, how to respectfully maintain their home during your stay and how to check out. The notebook also included recommendations for local restaurants, grocery stores and miniature golf. Upon entering the home there was a very thoughtful welcome basket and the home was clean and smelled good. What our family found most enjoyable were the amenities from a gas grill, 2 kayak boats, fishing polls, paddle board, bikes and more. There was no need drive anywhere. The home sits at the end of a quiet cull-de-sac on Lake Camelot. We spent our days relaxing on their private sandy beachfront, kayaking, paddle boarding, swimming, fished from the dock, grilled and had a campfire every night. It was the perfect quiet family lake getaway that exceeded our expectations in their wonderful home. 5+ stars! Thank you Smith Family!"

We had an amazing trip staying at the Smith Family Cabin. The owner, Nita, had everything prepared for us, including an adorable welcome basket, complete with her family’s favorite Wisconsin snacks! The home was spotless and had absolutely everything we could need, including extra towels, all kitchen/grill utensils, plenty of dishes and silverware, sharp knives, and even a gas can that we could use when we ran low on fuel for our boat. Our first night we visited Branding Iron Supper Club, from the recommendation provided in the arrival binder. The lakefront beach was absolutely gorgeous and the location at the end of a cul-de-sac, makes it a peaceful escape. We had so much fun on the lake and exploring the channel on our way to “Camelot on the Lake” (recommended by the owner). Nita was extremely helpful and when her next reservation canceled, she even offered to allow us to stay later because the weather wasn’t great at the start of our stay. We loved our time at the Smith Cabin and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful Wisconsin getaway!"

Being on the canal made accessing our kayaks so much easier because the water is calm. You can choose a lake in either direction and it was fun to site sea all the houses on the way to the lake. We sat on the back porch watching the boats go past. You can launch your jet ski at the private launch and keep it at Kara's dock.

Stayed a few nights","Tim’s communication was quick and helpful from before we booked his place to check out. We really appreciated the helpful information and some additional knowledge about the area and canal/river outside his property. If you plan on bringing a boat, I suggest checking in with him on the canal depth. In the time of our stay the water did drop a few feet and we were unable to get to the dock with our fishing boat. Obviously, no hosts have control over the water level, just helpful information for your stay to check in with him. Tim’s place is only a few miles from 2 boat launches so it wasn’t a big deal. We had plenty of room for the boat and truck at this property. Everything as described. We really enjoyed our time here!"

Stayed a few nights","We three women stayed at Tim's for a ""Girls Getaway"" weekend. The home was clean, had all of the amenities we needed, smelled fresh, and the beds were comfortable. We enjoyed coffee on the upper deck, did a little fishing from the lower deck, went for a walk, sat outside at the patio table most of the evening and had a fire. With the drought the water was very low, but we still enjoyed ourselves. The home is located on a quiet road, not desolate but no neighbor right on top of you. The only recommendation would be to bring some bottled water for drinking. Tim is a great host! He recommended things to do and is very friendly. Thanks Tim!"

Stayed with kids","Tim is an awesome host! He was very attentive, met us at check in to give us ideas of area restaurants, show us the house and boat situation. He even brought us another canoe for our stay. The house was clean and very roomy. Used the lower level for our teenage boys to hang out (3 boys) with plenty of room upstairs for the adults. There is a door to the lower level. We shut that at night and could not hear them and slept in the comfortable beds all night.
The outside area is awesome with some outside toys for our granddaughter to use, she is 3. A lot of room in the yard for her to play and keep busy without having to worry about her by the water/stairs. The fishing off the pier was fun for the teenagers. Having a boat was nice to go out further to fish. We had a fire all the nights we were there and Tim even brought us more firewood!
The kitchen is well supplied with tons of condiments, dishes, pots/pans and COFFEE! We truly enjoyed the air fryer. Tim has drinking water (Culligan) which was SO nice as we did not have to keep buying bottle water.
We will all be back to enjoy another long weekend! Thanks TIm!"

Everything you can think of, and more! Our whole family (2 adults, 4 kids) enjoyed every minute of our stay.
The best part though, was our host, Tim, waiting for our arrival and walked us through the property, making sure we were all set before he left. Great welcoming conversation that made us feel right at home away from home. Awesome experience, would highly recommend for anyone looking for a laid back, nature oriented vacation."

This is a peaceful, quiet place along the Wisconsin River. The deck system descend to a gentle channel of the River where a person could kayak or fish. Ask Tim about renting the boats. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to take them out.
I can imagine staying here at any time during the year.

Our stay was in winter season and if you are an ice fisherman or a snow mobiler this location is the perfect location. Note that there is only 1 full bathroom which was fine to accommodate 4 of us but might be an issue if you have more in your group. We will rent again for sure in the summer season to take advantage of the boating and campfires. There are a couple diners in town (less than a 5 minute drive) that were wonderful. We really recommend this home for your getaway!

Stayed with kids","Really fantastic location on a channel off the Wisconsin River. Can't say enough good things about the owner Tim--truly a gem of a guy!!! He is spending lots of money and time toward improving the cottage--when we were there, the flooring was all new and the bathroom had just been redone to incorporate a new shower. Tim provided us with use of his pedal boat and kayaks, plus gave us lots of fishing tips and even had ton of firewood on hand for our bonfires. He'd also just upgraded the downstairs family room by replacing the two twin beds with one larger one (not sure if it's queen or full). He's so sweet and really proud of his accomplishments, as he should be--the updates are definite improvements! Tim is very communicative, so if you're hesitating about anything in the listing, reach out to him and you'll hear back quickly!"

Extra tackle was available if you needed it, poles prepared for use in case you didn’t bring yours. Several little touches that were noticed.

Janet and Tim made us feel so welcome and came by to personally check us in and out. They haven't missed a detail, big or small- coffee and snacks in the kitchen, fishing gear, wood in the firepit outside... you name it, they've thought of it. They've built a stunning patio on the river beneath a large oak tree, and spending our morning out there was an absolute dream. We are already planning our next visit! Thank you so much, Janet and Tim."

Stayed a few nights","Where to start?! Janet was an EXCELLENT host. She went out of her way to make sure that we had a comfortable and fun time at the property. She absolutely the sweetest! The home had gorgeous views of the river and sipping your coffee on the deck was the perfect way to start the day. Also sitting at the deck at night looking up at the stars was a truly peaceful way to end the day.
The location was perfect. It’s close enough to the dells area to spend a day trip there(we went River tubing, which was so fun). It’s super close to Petenwell Lake, we were able to rent a boat for a full day from Petenwell Pub for a very fair price. The lake is HUGE so it was easy to spend 8 hours out there :)
The house was very cute and very clean. You can tell how much the home is loved. There were lots of condiments and they had both a regular coffee pot and a kcup brewer. There were plenty of towels. Beds were also very comfortable.
Can’t wait to come back!!!"

Stayed with kids","Very quint cabin, right on the water! The hosts are very welcoming, friendly and gracious. The cabin is not ON the Wisconsin River proper, rather it's on a back channel that is situated between the main river and an island, which was nice because the boats weren't quite so loud, the water traffic not quite so busy, and bonus - water to play and fish in! The channel does have access to the river for those needing river access, and our hosts said people have docked their boat at their small dock. The water was shallow enough for us to have a blast just wading and playing in it. We also fished off their small dock both morning and evening. It's really only big enough for 2 people to fish comfortably, but was a lot of fun to have. Bonus, they have a small upper deck with a table and chairs up on the ridge overlooking the canal that is quite a peaceful spot to sit and enjoy the weather! The mosquitoes were horrendous our second night at the cabin, but not the owner's fault. They do have a bug zapper and a very nice fire pit. The owners were gracious enough to let our son borrow a life vest, and let us all borrow fishing equipment. The cabin is situated off a main road back in a small ""subdivision"" that is just a small collection of homes/cabins. The property is mostly wooded and very peaceful. We felt very safe and cozy. The house itself is very nice, and the owners are actively updating it! There are 2 small bedrooms upstairs with double beds. The bathroom is also small and would be cramped and crowded if too many people are staying at the house. There is a small table right off the kitchen. The kitchen is quaint and cozy and well-stocked with misc pantry items that the owners encouraged us to use. They even have fixings for spaghetti for road-weary travelers to have their first night! Plus, there were a few beer and wine offerings available had we not stopped ahead of time. Everything was clean and well-maintained. The living room was a decent size with a Roku stick for TV/movies and there are 2 couches and several games available to play. There is just a window unit for A/C upstairs. Downstairs was a pretty good size and would fit a small family on 2 twin beds and a pull-out couch. The downstairs is all one room, combining sleeping and lounging in one, and a glass sliding-door going out to the backyard. This space was a little musty-smelling and the owners said they're still working on fixing up this space. We easily fit our family of 3 in the cabin, and we think it'd easily fit another small family or a group of 4 adults.
The cabin is within 5 minutes of the small town of Nekoosa. There is no laundry at the cabin, but a laundromat in town. There was a wonderful ice cream shop in town, and a Dollar General and Piggly Wiggly for necessaries. Nekoosa is quite close to several other towns, and the municipal zoo in Wisconsin Rapids was charming. The cabin has easy access to the Wisconsin River or the two huge lakes just slightly further south. All in all we very much enjoyed our stay, and will definitely be returning when we're in the area!"

Group trip","My family had a pleasant Thanksgiving gathering at the White House in Wisconsin Rapids. The location worked well for multiple family members to converge on a location roughly the same travel time for all parties, and the house was one of the only ones I have seen on Airbnb that offered five real bedrooms--not bunk beds or sofa sleepers or air mattresses, but five real bedrooms and three full baths (not to mention two half baths). We were grateful for the seemingly endless supply of plates and glasses, the generous counter space in the kitchen, and the festive atmosphere of the house--electric fireplaces, the beautiful pool table, the gorgeous stained glass windows on the main staircase. Though the home is historic and most of the features point to a different time (shiny brass fixtures, Tiffany-style lamps, high ceilings), the home is also comfortably warm and updated where it counts (in the kitchen). We were pleased to have had the opportunity to stay in this lovely, spacious house."

Stayed a few nights",This note goes to anyone who might be heading to Wisconsin Rapids or Stevens Point for golf or work. You have to stay at the White House in the Rapids. It is not only a very well maintained and manicured home and yard the history is wonderful. I will not elaborate on the history part but you really need to treat yourself and or friends to one of the coolest places i have ever stayed at and that covers a few continents. You can literally spend hours looking at everything that Patrick and his wife have put on display for others to enjoy. We had a year end golf outing with 5 men and on the last night 2 of the wives joined their husbands. Everyone just could not get enough of this house and how it is presented for others to enjoy at a very good value. Again a Thank you to Patrick and his wife and sister for sharing this with all of us. Jeff Schultz Menomonee Falls Wi.

Group trip","The White House is an incredible place to stay for many reasons. Its beauty in every room and the amazing story each room tells is very appealing to someone who loves art, beauty, and just to be amazed by the timeless craftsmanship of talented people. This was no easy house to build or maintain, yet it is incredibly impressive in all ways.
The beds were very comfortable, as well, and the memories my family made on a very big weekend for all of us were made more special by staying here! For kitchen space, we had a lot planned so we didn't need to use this space a lot, but it's an amazing kitchen--one most people would appreciate for function and socializing both.
When it came to all the common rooms, all of us found that spending most of our time in the billiards room and the library was ideal--all 8 of us could be here at once and have space.
In the end, if we have a need to stay in Wisconsin Rapids again this is definitely the space we'd stay in. Everyone enjoyed it from the check-in process all the way through the weekend. Thank you, Patrick!"

The amenities offered by the house made for a wonderful stay for us and our adlut children. We prepared several meals, enjoying the well appointed kitchen and lovely dining room. The billiards room was a great way to keep everyone entertained and interacting. The house offers many distinct areas, so people can have the opportunity spread out and enjoy various activities such as watching TV, hanging out in the kitchen, playing pool, or finding a quiet place to read. Patrick operates an extremely well run and unique Airbnb experience. Thank you, Patrick and family for sharing your truly historical home with us."

Stayed a few nights","This house was very nice, and very old. We had plenty of room. We mostly hung out on the porch after playing golf. Didn't use any rooms but kitchen and dining room. Besides the bedrooms.
Most of us didn't sleep well for the 5 nights, as we found out the house used to be a mortuary for over 60 years. It was a bit creepy. There was no washer and dryer to use which we thought there was. The air conditioning wasn't working good, it was hot inside for 3 full days, temp was 76 degrees and was told the air conditioning guys were going to fix it, but in the mean time we were asked to keep the temp at 74 so it didnt keep running. The caretaker Darlene was a bit pushy with sending me messages at 1245 AM, stating goodmorning and how's the air conditioning. I'm sleeping! Then sent at least 3 messages asking when we were checking out. Check out time is 11. House is cool if your not creeped out. We paid a lot to stay, and wish the air would have been better."

Stayed a few nights","Pictures and description do not do this place justice. The home is amazing and feels like your stepping back in time from the moment you enter. It's a perfect setup for groups with both private rooms, plenty of baths, and common areas that are beyond amazing. If you want to cook, the gourmet kitchen awaits. Try playing pool in the most elegant billiards room you’ll ever see (even more fun with a glass of wine or your favorite pint). And if you can actually leave the house (it’s hard to really want to go anywhere), you’re mere blocks from resturants, taverns, theater…. Location is outstanding. If it couldn’t get any better, it does with the incredible service and communication Patrick and his team provide. The caretaker Darlene was super informative, very helpful and made our stay effortless. Anything we needed, both Patrick and Darlene were a call away. You don’t find that care and commitment very often these days. The next time we’re in Wisconsin Rapids there’s only one place we hope to stay! Thank you!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This ""White House"" was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Because the house was impeccably kept and updated while keeping original decor and old world charm we really felt like it was a mini vacation. The woodwork and craftsmanship was surely indicative of a lumbar baron. The bedrooms fit all of our needs with our two families and beds were very comfortable.
One surprise was the fun our ""boys"" (ages 17, 20, 21) had playing pool in the beautiful library/parlor room and then basketball around back while my sister and I watched from the back porch in the comfort of rocking chairs provided.
The setting is tranquil and well maintained while still being very close to restaurants and/or places to grab libations.
I can't say enough about the ""white house"" and we are sure to return for a stay."

Stayed with a pet","This tiny dome home was the perfect place to unwind and cut the noise. We enjoyed the fire, hammocks, and grilling. We didn’t end up kayaking because the lake was a bit choppy the day we had planned. The home was very clean and came equipped with everything we needed to prepare our meals. The shower was nice. Bathroom and bidet were clean. Bed was a little stiff but not uncomfortable. One thing to be sure of is the bring bug spray! This time of year is very buggy, being in the woods entails large spiders and mosquitoes. The home was dog friendly which helped us travel along with our companion. Not too many bars/ stores nearby. You’re really kinda off the grid. But it feels peaceful. All in all a great quick getaway to cut out the noise for a bit."

Stayed with a pet","I spent four days and three nights at Matt's Dome and I cannot emphasize enough how remarkable this trip was. From booking to check out, Matt was proactive in messaging me with thorough instructions on how to get to the property, how to get the dome set up for running use, and several recommendations of activities to do. The dome was perfect and looked just like the photos - though I think it's better in person - and he truly went above and beyond to make sure that my stay went off without a hitch. There were kayaks available for use on a private dock with a footpath through the woods that was well-maintained. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, we went swimming in the lake with our dogs. Yesterday, we took them to the Juneau Wilderness Park nearby and hiked a bit. While the first half of my life I almost exclusively camped in rustic campgrounds with a tent, and this was the next step up! If you're looking for an added level of comfort, you're in luck - book now! You won't regret it!"

I had complete privacy and couldn’t hear anything from upstairs. The only thing that might prevent me from staying again is that the bed is too high and soft for me. It was difficult to climb into with a bad back and hip injury. Other than that, everything was perfect! Mischelle was always quick to respond to communication before, during, and after my stay. She also went above and beyond to accommodate my change in plans due to winter weather, for which I am so grateful. Because of my need to change my reservation, I was only there overnight and unable to enjoy the numerous amenities. I highly recommend making sure you have time to take advantage of everything during your stay!"

There was a beautiful wooded view looking out the patio window that I enjoyed watching the squirrels. Everything was thought out extremely well to make your stay the best that it can be. The details and welcoming feel is beyond anything I've experienced at any other Airbnb. Mischelle and her husband were so nice and welcoming, it was like chatting with friends that I haven't seen in awhile. I had privacy and all of my own space and full bathroom to myself. Mischelle was very accommodating, proactive, and always quick to respond when I messaged her.

Stayed a few nights","amazing. the experience was greater than what I expected. First, when you arrive, the place is beautiful to rest. It is beautiful, the house is immense. Second, Michelle is the kindest person I've ever met, she gave us an incredible tour, suggestions, she treated us as if we were acquaintances. then the space is big everything is completely independent for you, very clean, it has everything to make you spend several days without problem, it has a large movie theater that is for you, it has a coffee machine cereal bars water for your stay You better have a fridge to store your things. We were able to cook in Michelle's area without any problem. The view towards the forest is spectacular, also when you leave the lake and the landscapes are beautiful, perfect for going for a walk in the safe neighborhood, it also has places to buy things a few minutes away. T he best experience in the world. I will definitely return. thanks to Michelle and her husband she was amazing!"
