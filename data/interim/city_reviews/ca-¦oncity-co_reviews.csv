Group trip","Cannot say enough good things about the view. I was in awe the entire time.
The only thing I would suggest is adding more items in the kitchen. We could have used sandwich bags, foil, plastic wrap. It comes in handy when trying to pack lunches etc. A cooler would also be a nice addition. Mixing bowls and serving bowls were also needed .
I would definitely stay here again . We loved it so much ."

Stayed with kids","My family and I traveled to CO from NY and weren’t planning a stop in Cañon City but saw this house and had to change our route! The house looks exactly as portrayed and is very clean. Some staples are available like basic coffee and salt/pepper, but otherwise I would pack paper towels and laundry detergent, etc. The free entry to the park was a bonus, we walked the bridge and rode the gondola although some of the other attractions were closed when we visited. The once in a lifetime view alone was worth the trip!"

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing stay at the Bighorn Lodge. It’s centrally located not far from Denver so the drive was easy and communication was great. Its private surroundings, patio and security combined with Mountain View’s; majestic. All the photos definitely speak true to the rustic Lodge feel and it is beautifully maintained with an enormous gas fireplace that kept me toasty while I visited. There aren’t any curtains covering the southwest views so sunrise and sunsets are gorgeous as well as seeing the weather rolling through. We had a bit of a snowstorm on my second night come through, which was amazing to watch. my only critique is, the windows were pretty dusty and spotty, so Photography through them was challenging with lots of glare, but I don’t think that something that can be rectified as the windows face the gorge side and I’m sure are very difficult to clean outside of the weather doing its job. Other than that, lots of amenities everything is fully stocked. Loved every minute. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","We traveled to The Royal Gorge from Texas. The first day / night we were gifted the most incredible views of the Gorge from the absolutely stunning cabin. We were warned about an incoming snowstorm upon arrival and decided to stick it out & make the best of it. We ended up losing power and the pipes froze overnight. The park Ranger was prompt in snowplowing his way to us first thing in the morning to check on us to make sure we were ok. He said he understand if we wanted to leave but it was just too beautiful for us to even think of it. He came back without us asking to bring water & help us get the fireplace going. He continually plowed our roads throughout the day so we could get out if need be. I cannot say enough about the amazing hospitality & friendliness of the staff at the park. This could’ve easily been a fiasco of a vacation but the amazing cabin, the views and the staff made it one of the best places we have ever stayed. We can’t wait to come back with better weather! :)"

Views for days and the house itself is so clean and comfortable! If you bring a dog with you be sure to bring them booties because there are cactus all around the grounds and the trails.
Check in and check out is so easy! Plus you have free entry to the park. A+ stay. We can’t wait to return. Wow!!!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a must visit. The views are priceless, the hikes were invigorating, the bridge was amazing to walk in the daytime and to see lit up at night from the dwelling. The Park Rangers and staff were so accommodating, helpful and friendly. I truly appreciated the pricing being affordable for so many to experience not just the elite. Canon City was a short drive to be able to dine and explore. The railroad train tracks you could view if you looked straight down from the cabin/dwelling windows train boarded in Canon City and known as the Royal Gorge Route Railroad. This was a pleasant experience as well, but not cheap for the 2 hour ride, they did have different price levels to choose. I can not thank the Royal Gorge Park team enough for this experience to share with my family and future son-in-law. The memories of this visit will always be ones I will cherish. Thank you from Boonville, Missouri"

Stayed with a pet","We fell in love with this lodge about 7 years ago when my bf/now husband booked it for my birthday. We recently moved to Colorado and have been wanting to book the place and share with relatives. Since our last stay, they've renovated one of the bathrooms and the septic smell that once existed is gone. The price has gone up considerable, but I guess that's expected with inflation over the past few years. We hosted Thanksgiving dinner at the place and there was plenty of cookware and room to do so. Our only suggestion is that the table is a bit small! We had the same thought years ago. With the amount of room supplied, they could buy a real showstopping table that allows more of a view during dinner. Wonderful accommodations!"

We did go in October which was “out of season” for the area, so certain restaurants were closed, but we loved that access to the Royal Gorge Park & Bridge was included with our stay. We highly recommend doing the zip line over the gorge! The views are incredible and will be hard to beat from future stays anywhere else. We checked in after the park was closed and that was very easy. Arnie, the Park Ranger on duty, was extremely friendly and welcoming. We will be back 😃"

Stayed a few nights","When we arrived was really too late to see the park ( 530 pm ) so went straight to house . Thus this was the 1st time to see the view . Pictures don’t do it justice. It’s over the top .
Very PRIVATE …… clean , new bathrooms that we did not see till arrival . ( pics have been updated since then )
Efficient heat and cool ( heat is central in every room, whereas the cooling unit is one large unit coming from the ceiling, which is industrial which even cools the bedrooms. . )
Very spacious, although we were only a party of two .
Outdoor eating areas were wonderful although we couldn’t enjoy them because it was a little too cool .
Definitely want to come back and stay five or six days. .
The place was so breathtaking that we wanted to extend our stay another day, but unfortunately it was already booked .
Only issue was that the Beds We’re not as comfortable as they should be.
Thanks . Luke"

Group trip","This is a very private home with incredible scenery. The only sound you might hear at night would be a coyote and during the day an occasional distant scream from the zip line and the train in the bottom of the gorge. The house was stocked with everything we needed, especially the kitchen. The host responds quickly to any question. The included park admission fee is an added plus. I would definitely stay here again if looking for a home in the area. The park closes at night but the provided keys allow entry/exit at all hours."

Stayed with kids","Loved the mid century modern style with the huge great room, massive fireplace and floor to ceiling windows. The view and location can’t be beat. We loved having a house in the middle of our week of vacation to do laundry and save some money by making our own meals. We used the grill which was nice and new. Speaking of saving money, a huge perk is the fact that everyone staying at the house gets free admission to the park for every day of their stay — including check in and check out day."

Stayed with a pet","The Royal Gorge Park owns this lodge, so we dealt w/ park staff during our stay. After check-in we received a key to the Bighorn Lodge and a remote to the park gate for after hours exit/entry. All the staff were great and easy to deal with. The lodge is walking distance from the visitors center (main entry to the park & attractions), but it is a consistent uphill walk back to the lodge. It's a 2 minute or less drive. The views are amazing. There a lots of birds, lizards, and bighorn sheep that frequent the area. You can see the skycoaster, gondola, zipliners, and even the train and folks rafting on the river below. With binoculars you can watch people climbing the Via Ferrata. The air conditioner was working very well the whole time, but the south facing rooms still get a bit warm in the evening (in August). There are lots of fans, so we managed well. Overall, the value for this place was amazing. If you want to chill or if you want a lot of activity, this place has what you want."

There was no mention of the coach pulling out into a bed so not sure where the 8 comes from. The place was so nice and clean with a well stocked kitchen. Having free access to the park is a nice perk too.

So many things to do and see during our 3 day stay. We loved being able to walk to the visitors center and get in to the park as guests of the lodge. Thank you for that!

Stayed a few nights","Loved this house! It’s a phenomenal location and the views were amazing, even impressing my 17 and 21 year old sons, which is rare. The complimentary park tickets and ease of proximity allowed us to enjoy the Royal Gorge Bridge and activities everyday. Plenty of hiking and wildlife (bighorn, rabbits, and birds) literally in the back yard. The large patio allowed us to play our own games (we brought ladder ball) but board games were also provided in the house. I cooked meals everyday using the provided kitchen supplies and outdoor gas grill. Tons of seating, inside and out. Lots of activities in the area. We participated in: helicopter tour, white water rafting, train ride, and bowling. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids",Gorgeous home and amazing location! Owner very helpful when needed and communicated quickly. Nice updates to furnishings and decor. My only complaint--and to me this is significant--is that the home lists 3 Queen beds but in reality it has 3 Full size beds (significantly smaller than Queen size--and I did measure them after a not-so-great night of sleep). This was fine for our kids sharing a bed but not for 2 adults. I think the listing should be updated to accurately state that these are not Queen beds. Otherwise we absolutely loved this home and our stay there!

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place to stay! The lodge is walking distance to the park entrance, but still feels secluded. The windows overlook the gorge and the windows opened to get a nice breeze through the house. This was really needed the first evening, as it was quite warm inside. The view was the best part, once we got over our fear to look out the windows down into the gorge. We really enjoyed watching the zip liners & gondolas crossing the gorge, & the rafters fighting the rapids down in the river. The place was really spacious for our family of 4. Free tickets to the park were just icing on the cake. This is definitely one not to miss!
You may not want to keep the windows opened unattended. My teen was eating her leftovers near the opened windows the last day of our stay and almost had a mouse in her lap. It ran in the window and almost hopped in her lap to try get a bite of her dinner. We closed them, after her screams scared it out. It did make me nervous about what else might’ve gotten in."

Easy 5 minute walk to the Royal Gorge Bridge and all of it’s activities (bridge admission, gondola ride, and children’s play area is included in price of the rental). Despite it’s proximity to the bridge, you feel so secluded and private while at the home. I would highly recommend this home!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was outstanding. The views from the lodge were stunning. It was well stocked so my wife, two teen grandchildren and I had everything we needed at our fingertips. Even the teens were in awe of the location and, as many of you know, teens can be a tough age to please. The Big Horn Lodge was far better than any photos can ever depict. The only down side is I am aware the rental price has risen substantially since we rented it back in January, 2023, for our June, 2023, stay. The new pricing has pushed it out of our affordable range now. That is disappointing because we have more grandchildren we'd love to bring with us on a return trip."

But the main thing we loved about the Lodge was its view - it was simply incredible. If we're ever back in the Cañon City area, we will absolutely stay here again!"

Group trip","For several years, my hiking group has booked a stay at the Royal Gorge Bighorn Lodge. Although the Lodge has changed into an Airbnb, Gail still takes care of the bookings, communicates well, & if you are in need of something special, will arrange it for you if she can. Currently, renovations are being made to the building, but this doesn't interfere with your stay. New electrical outlets have been added in the room with the large exquisite picture windows. Beds are very comfortable, & extra blankets, sheets, etc. are available in the room with carpet. The kitchen is nicely equipped, though know that the oven takes quite a while to preheat :) The carpeted bedroom is a little colder at night than the rest, but has an amazing amount of space as well as a small built-in desk. The large fireplace is magnificent, easy to light, and adds to the ambiance of the Lodge. We will continue to book this magnificent place every year, for as long as we are able! Thanks for a fabulous stay!"

Stayed with kids",the place is beautiful and such great access to the park. It's only 15/20 min to the train and town so easy. all the rooms are large and 2 and big enough to easily fit pack n play for kids and not be cramped. Gail was quick to respond when we had questions. we checked in after the park closed and we're still able to quickly get keys and into the place. the views alone are gorgeous and the house is well stocked so you don't have to ever leave. there is also a market within 5min of you need a few groceries.

There is tons of open space with windows everywhere. You will not regret booking this rental. The large open gas fireplace is breathtaking as well. Gail couldn't have been more responsive. The check-in is a bit different as you will either gain access to the home via the Royal Gorge Visitor Center or Ranger post but everyone is super nice and Gail does a wonderful job answering any questions you have to ensure you are clear about where to go. She was communicative before, during and after our stay. You are only 20 minutes from town. The Florence Brewery (a bit further) and Winery at Holy Cross Abbey are super cute and fun."

Stayed a few nights","I don't really know what to say about this place but WOW. There are those Air BnB's that no matter how impressive the photos, they just do not do it justice. Wait until you walk in and get the parallax vertigo that is walking to the huge windows overlooking the gorge. Like no place I've ever stayed. You should know it's an older cabin so if you're an Air BnB snob it may not be for you. But what else would you want on the rim of a canyon such as this? Also know you will be totally isolated (except for a ranger on duty during the evening) after the park closes and you will be the ONLY people in the area after dark. So if you have some sort of The Shining fear go in knowing. We were not able to get fast WIFI, nor consistent connect speeds so working from here is a bit difficult. But Gail was very helpful in trying to get it resolved. It just didn't work out for us. But it was the excuse we needed to disconnect anyway. We LOVED it. Truly one of the most unique places I've stayed in all my Air BnB travels.
We didn't know much about Royal Gorge and it quickly became of of our favorite stops in Colorado. I highly recommend for the more hard core adventurers trying the Via Verrata course. Life-changing. For me, facing my fear of cliff-climbing. If you're already a hard core free climber it might seem pedestrian I imagine. In Canon City we really enjoyed the Mexican at El Caporal. Hike the Canyon Rim Trail to Far Out to Le View. Just do it. Also do not miss the opportunity to set your alarm for sunrise and go out on the deck and watch the rising sun paint the canyon walls in brilliant colors.
Thank you, Gail, for sharing such an amazing place, in such an amazing location."

Beyond the incredible view, we loved the following: this house is very well maintained, the kitchen was perfect for cooking family meals, the bathrooms are in great shape, the house is well stocked with everything you could need, the living and sleeping spaces are comfortable, the outdoor patio is sizable and a great spot for stargazing, the house and Royal Gorge park are dog friendly, and check-in and out were beyond easy.
Finally, we had a toddler and 6 month old with us and this location could not have been better! It made it so easy to visit the Royal Gorge Park multiple times in a day and come home for naps."

Kitchen was well stocked with pans and everything for cooking but we did run out of coffee and paper towels during our stay. I loved that there were plenty of bath towels bc i often find that is not the case at an air bnb. The bedrooms were a little warm but there were fans in each room and opening the windows at night felt amazing with the evening breeze. would recommend this place to anyone and would love to stay again!

The house is roomy and has plenty of seating and viewing areas. The fireplace is huge and kitchen is easy to work in for meals. I could see why people come back regularly to stay here.

Someone else said in their review that if this cabin is available then jump on it and don’t second guess your decision. Not only is the cabin great, the park is very nice and fun for everyone. The park employees were all great too. My recommendations if you plan to stay here: bring groceries (the gas grill and fully equipped kitchen make cooking easy), visit Canon City (it’s a short drive), reserve a ride in advance (maybe lunch or dinner) on the train that goes through the gorge, raft or kayak the Arkansas river, and drive the Skyline Drive (scary but amazing!)"

1. The VIEWS! 😍 I have never been so content, sitting without distraction and staring out a window as I did at this house.
2. The FIRE! 🔥 this fireplace is a thing of dreams. It’s huge and mesmerizing, and so cozy.
3. The access to the park! This was a HUGE added bonus. And every single person we spoke to at the park (rangers, the technicians working the gondola, the bartender at the cafe, the gift shop attendee, and the person at the ticket desk) were all SO kind.
4. The beds! Very comfortable mattresses, and the bedding was so soft and clean.
5. The kitchen had everything we needed for all of our cooking, and the bathrooms were updated and super clean!
Also, as silly as it is - we felt like VIPs having our own gate opener to the park, an exclusive experience for sure!
We have already discussed when we will be returning. 100% would recommend!!"

Group trip","Our 2 night/3 day stay at the Bighorn Lodge was superb! They have redecorated, and although we preferred the more rustic furniture (our 4th stay at the Lodge) the new beds and couches were extremely comfortable - we were all well rested and took advantage of hiking a new trail on a bright sunny day after a recent snow. Gorgeous! Upon our return to the Lodge, we made some delicious meals, as the kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies, full range/oven, large refrigerator with ice maker, lots of counter space, and many electrical outlets. With all the picture windows, we enjoyed spectacular sunrises & sunsets. The large gas fireplace in the living room just turns on/off with a switch! During the winter months, If you park in the lot right behind the lodge the downhill walk to the Lodge can be a little icy - just tread carefully. Also, if you leave at night, bring a flashlight so you can see your way up to the car. There is an outside light but not in the parking area itself. Check-in and check out is easy and fast; also if offered, take advantage of getting into the Park and walking the Bridge and/or riding the Gondolas for free! We were able to walk across the Bridge & explore the park, even though the Gondolas were not operating that day. It was a fabulous trip and we hope to do it again at least once a year, and for many years to come!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect getaway. The house had amazing views. It was very private, peaceful, and quiet. It had everything we needed to feel at home for a few days.
We visited in January. It is off season at the park, so many of the park attractions were closed. We were still able to enjoy the gondola and the theater. The upside to off season was being able to enjoy the park with few visitors.
Bring your binoculars to get a better view of the bighorn sheep in the area."

This is also a great value especially if you take advantage of going to the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. With tickets included in the house rental, you can save hundreds each day on admission."

You can even see the train on the tracks along the river's edge from the dining room windows! The beds were comfortable, as was the furniture, and it has a lovely fireplace. It was a bonus to also receive free passes to the bridge and park as part of our rental. I was told that it was formerly the bridge caretaker's home, so the proximity to the park is close for walking but still far enough away for privacy."

Something we never would have seen during the busy public times at the bridge. I am recommending this place to all of my friends. Such a unique place and memories that will last forever!

We were in town for a couple of races down in the Royal Gorge and it was fantastic to be able to have a full kitchen to cook and a cozy place to relax. Would stay again if we ended up back around here!"

It was very clean, and we also had plenty of towels for both of us for the few days we were there. it is close to town if you want to go out to eat or has a perfect kitchen if you want to bring your food in and cook your own meals it was a very good space to sit and relax and have time to myself. Definitely would stay again, and there's enough room for a few more young adults or younger children to stay with you at this cozy loft."

Stayed a few nights","This was the 4th time I have stayed in this loft. I travel to Canon City weekly for work. Canon is small and especially during winter, there’s not much to do. Restaurants close by 8 or 8:30. The loft has a good kitchen and overall, it’s very comfortable. Another remote HVAC unit needs to be installed in the bedroom as it was routinely kind of chilly with only one in the living area. I bet it’s rather warm in there in the summer but just a guess. I felt at home here and Andrew was quick to respond to questions. The electric fireplace provided nice ambiance. Ill be back."

The kids slept on the pull out mattress and hideaway bed and we had the bedroom - all were clean and comfortable. Andrew was helpful and kind. We had a nice stay and would even stay again!"

There were even blocks provided that kept my toddler entertained for hours. So glad we were able to stay here during an otherwise hectic trip 😊

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for a trip to canon city to visit the railroad and the royal gorge bridge park. This place is in a great location in canon city, close to supermarkets, parks, the railroad and the highway to drive out to the gorge. We really appreciated the kids blocks and books in the space for our son to play with. Our son, who is 3.5 years, slept in the hideaway bed and he loved it. The air-conditioning was a welcome respite from the scorching heat the area was experiencing at the time. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking and really had everything you need to make meals while staying there. You can tell that the owners have a real eye for design and detail. It would have been nice to be able to use the outside area even just a little, as our toddler can get restless inside, but I understand their hesitation since they also live on the property. We found a playground about 5 minutes away that helped when he got restless. If we are in the area again in the future, we would feel good about staying here again."

If you plan to cook meals at the property, I would suggest grabbing your condiments from a fast food joint (for shorter stays) or buying condiment bottles from the grocery store (for longer stays). Oh, the heating system isn't sufficient enough to cover the entire sq.ft of the property; so plan to bring extra blankets & slippers to keep warm if you're not used to the Colorado climate during the winter months."

I would agree with previous comments regarding a later than usual check-in & early check-out, feeling cooped up by not being able to use any outside facilities, and the run-&- empty-the-dishwasher-before- you -go rule. There are few Airbnb options in the area, two cancelled on us. This was a clean & conveniently located 3rd option."

The cottage is very nice and clean, cozy and has a great floor plan. The outside covered patio is quite nice to relax under. Loved having a wahser and dryer there. All amenities were provided both kitchen and bath. One thing I would suggest is turning up the hot water temp on the hot water heater, or updating for hotter wate durring showers.
This is a cool spot with great vibes and access for climbers. Would stay again."

The bedding and pillows were comfortable. The kitchen was a perfect size for us to cook a few meals while we were there. The televisions were a great size with great features. The air conditioners kept it very cool. I cannot say enough good about this place. It’s well worth the cost. If I did have one complaint, it’s that in the instructions, it mentioned a local bear. We never saw a bear. LOL. I’m kidding about that. I mean we never saw the bear, but that’s probably for the best. I highly highly recommend Claire’s cottage to any travelers."

The kitchen had a lot of things I needed including salt, pepper, some pots to cook with, coffee, even small individual containers of half and half with to go cups and lids. There were some condiments in the fridge.
Many of the properties in Canon City are older and the house did not feel well insulated. I could feel air leaking in around the doors and windows. Normally this would not be a concern but my husband and I stayed here when it was SUPER cold outside, like below 0. We woke up the first morning and felt like we were in an igloo! We had the heaters on 88 degrees but it was frigid outside, and probably due to lack of insulation, the heaters could not keep up. I messaged the host and a woman who helps host the house and lives down the street was there in 20 minutes. She brought a rockin’ space heater and checked on my husband later in the day. Way to go Brooke! We’ll be back"

There was also a nice TV with a selection of channels including netflix, which were nice to have in the evenings. The bed and futon weren't amazingly comfortable, but were good enough."

Stayed one night","You know when you book an AIRBNB and the photos look much better than reality? Well...this is the exact opposite. I booked Kevin's place for a special trip. I had stayed at The Hampton Inn down the street a few times prior to this and finally realized, wait...there's gotta be something better than this dump. Duh...AIRBNB.
When we showed up to meet Kevin, he casually mentioned a remodel. When we walked in I think none of us expected the level of craftsmanship that went into this place. Comfort top to bottom. The beds, the couch, the kitchen, easy access to everything in Cañon City. I honestly felt like I was at home and not
I'll say that Kevin's place and hospitality have made me re-think how I review other AIRBNB's. If I could rate it 10 stars, I certainly would."

Hot tub is nice to have always at an airbnb. The kitchen appliances, stove, all very nice and made me feel at ease cooking there- unlike some airbnbs where it is bare bones and old pots and pans. Kevin is proud of this place and he should be because it is STUNNING. The only downsides were personal preference issues. We prefer contactless check-in and a bit more privacy. The exterior cam at the hot tub made it a little awkward, but understand that hosts have this option at their discretion. We also didn't prefer to have the host outside sweeping the sidewalk while we were packing up (before check-out time), but, overall, I've really never seen a more thoughtfully decorated home and the place was lovely."

The entire house is designed beautifully and we enjoyed the comfy beds, fireplace, large fully equipped kitchen and the hot tub. We were only a family of 3 but the house can comfortably hold a large group without feeling crowded.
Kevin met us for check in and gave us a helpful tour of his home with some easy check out rules as well as offered great recommendations on places to eat.
If we were back in the area we would stay here again 10 out of 10."

The sheets, towels, and hand soap are some of our honorable mentions. We came for a girls trip and everyone was able to have a separate room to stay in. This is truly my favorite Airbnb I have stayed in. Come and stay and you won’t be disappointed!"

Group trip","The pictures do not do this property justice. Kevin, the owner, has impeccable taste and I wish I could hire him to help decorate my own house. He met us at the house for a tour when we checked in, and beside the fact that I was simply stunned at how beautiful everything was, he was extremely friendly. He had decorated the house for the holidays and it couldn't have been more festive. The kitchen is a dream for anyone who loves to cook and is well appointed. Beds are comfortable, the house was sparkling clean, and every effort has been made to make your stay a comfortable one. We spent Christmas here with our grown children and their spouses. Everyone had their own private space and bathroom, and the communal spaces in the house were perfect for opening gifts, playing games, and eating as a family. We would not hesitate to stay here again. (Thanks, Kevin!)"

The kitchen is unbelievably gorgeous, and the high ceilings remind us so much of the old houses in Europe.

We were in town for a funeral and Kevin really helped make are stay as easy and pleasant as possible. We had many questions and request and Kevin was quick to respond and patient . His place provided the space we needed and it was greatly appreciated. Thanks for opening your beautiful place to travelers!!"

There is a private hot tub with a mini bar in the back of the home which is great for lounging. The kitchen is huge with plenty of cooking utensils, pots, pans, the works. Plenty of towels especially for the hot tub. We had 3 adults and 3 kids and the kids loved every moment in the house. There's space to rest, lounge, and just enjoy. Kevin was very responsive with all communication, the home felt safe, it's right up the road from the Royal Gorge Train. Overall, this space is amazing. I told my husband if we're ever in the area again, we're staying at this home! Thank you to the owners for such a comfortable stay."

Kevin was communicative and readily available to address questions when we had them but that was few and far between - the clearly laid out check in/out instructions and info about the property made our stay a breeze! Aesthetically the vintage yet modern design of the interior made it feel like we were truly at home. Additionally, every amenity you could possibly need was available from baking sheets to makeup towels in the bathroom - if you forgot it don’t worry, they had it! The location itself was incredibly convenient - literally around the corner from a beautiful park, the Royal Gorge railroad (which did not interfere with sleep at all!!), and 5 minutes away from many shopping options! We would absolutely love to stay again!"

Only a few blocks from downtown and Centennial Park - where we took advantage of the public loaner life jackets and floated the river. The house itself has been designed and decorated to make you feel cozy and right at home, but with a touch of luxury as well. The house was very clean and included nice special touches like goats milk soaps/lotions/shampoos and premium linens. We cooked several meals and found the kitchen to be well stocked. We loved the outdoor space as well - from the large outdoor table and hot tub in the back, to the rocking chairs in the front. Kevin was a fantastic host. He met us at the property at check-in and gave us a tour, along with several recommendations for local trails and restaurants. We would 100% stay here again!"

The family room, dining room, and kitchen were spacious and exceeded our expectations. The bedrooms and bathrooms were cozy and so inviting. Kevin and Rich are the most gracious hosts and even gave our curious group a tour of the properties they are fixing up to be future airbnbs. During our stay, we were able to walk downtown, along the river walk, and directly connect to the Tunnel Drive trail without even getting in our vehicle.

The neighbor even shared some fresh chicken and duck eggs with us which were delicious. The park is very close. We spent time at the park feeding peas and lettuce to the ducks, geese and swans (I don’t ever feed them bread, it’s not good for them). I hated to leave because it was so nice and relaxing. Kevin recommended great restaurants and we even ate at the German restaurant which had really good food. Lots of shopping close by so no need to bring in all your groceries, you can get everything nearby. This is well worth the money.

It was really cozy and beautifully appointed, but it had a lot of smart home features with the lighting, electronics, kitchen faucet, etc., making it very it very modern too. We really felt at home there. We were lucky and got to see it decorated for the holidays, which was a very nice touch. The Wi-Fi was really strong and we were able to work remotely from the home. Kevin is a fantastic host! He was really quick in responding to questions we had and also helped us understand some local options for eating and other activities nearby. We would not hesitate to stay there again or one of Kevin‘s other properties."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time we have had the privilege of renting this beautiful home from Kevin! We have been coming to Canon City 4 years in a row to visit our Aunt. I rented last year to bring my Dad to see his Sister and the home was a godsend for both of them to have a place to visit all day instead of the carehome.
The home is more than you expect!
Such an amazing remodel of a historical home. Perfect for several couples if needed but we only had 3-4 people stay in the two times we rented.
We enjoyed the hot tub this time, wonderful!
The kitchen is to die for, so stocked and everything you could imagine!
The beds, bedding, and towels are comfortable and the bathroom amenities are wonderful!
The location is very close to the main town but not far from the whole town. The park near by is fun to see all the geese and the train station to the gorge is very close.
This is the place to stay if you ever visit Canon City!"

Group trip","There are absolutely no bad things to say about our experience with Kevin's air bnb. The house was STUNNING, the kitchen was large and had everything we needed. It fit all six of us comfortably as there was not an uncomfortable place in the house and we never had to drive more than 5 minutes to any destination- we even walked most places because of the beautiful weather and views.
Kevin was able to come over late in the evening to help us get the fire pit going in the back and gave us a tour at check in- something I didn't know I was missing from our Air BnB experiences until now.
The price, the stay, the tips and guidebook... nothing about our stay was less than wonderful. Thank you Kevin!!!"

Stayed with kids","This place is beautiful! I was in awe of all the beautiful details all week. I just kept noticing more detail that inspired me to want to decorate my house like that. It was very clean! We couldn’t even tell if there had been other guests because it was so tidy and I know it is booked pretty much every week. There was plenty of room for our family of 5, a huge kitchen with everything you could want, a washer and dryer, games in the game cabinet and a specific cornhole area outside. The rest of the backyard was fabulous with so much seating, a hot tub and very nice landscaping. Everything locks up easily with a code and there is a carport out back. We were sad to leave. It felt like home away from home. The only recommendation I would make is for the host to make sure it is finished being cleaned when guests arrive. We waited for a short time on the front porch because they were still cleaning when we got there. We stated we would arrive between 4-5 and got there at 3:50, but did wait about 30 minutes get in. Other than that, I would highly recommend this place! I would definitely go back. Kevin is a great and very attentive host. I appreciated it!"

There’s even a pot filler on the stove. The weather was a little chilly and wet so we did not get to spend as much time in the backyard area as we had hoped, but it is also fabulous and just as pictured. As other reviews have mentioned, the bedroom linens are top notch.

Not just beds/bedding but high end bedding. Not just TV's in every room, but custom frame wrapped, mounted TVs in every room. Not just a back yard with pavers, a back yard with antique reclaimed bricks, stamped with the royal gorge. Not just a kitchen, a true chef's kitchen with Viking stove and custom counter tops. The attention to detail is amazing. Great place to stay. Add more days. You won't regret it."

Stayed with kids","They’ve thought of everything! This house was just perfect for our group. The inside of the house is so well decorated and Kevin cut no corners in remodeling it. We were all very impressed by the decor, the the furnishings, and the quality of the amenities. All the small things from the toiletries being stocked to the actual Teflon pans in the kitchen to cook with, to the Keurig and bar, they seemed to ensure everything had been thought of and covered. Only one note of clarification from the description, a crib is not included. It is actually a pack n play, which may make a difference to parents with climbers, since those are much easier to get out of for 1-2 year olds.
Outside of everyone wanting to go home and remodel their own kitchens because they were so in love with the design of this house, we had no complaints at all!
Walking distance to a park, the river and pond to feed ducks, we also were able to walk to downtown for lunch and to poke around the shops. Loved the house and appreciated the host!"

The pictures online don't do it enough justice, it's even more beautiful in person. It's location is in a quiet neighborhood right down from a beautiful park and downtown. Easy drives to lots of activities. We even saw deer in the back alley every night. This property is well worth every penny. Thank you Kevin for a great stay for my son's destination wedding. We will definitely be coming back! 😊"

Stayed a few nights","BEYOND!!! The pictures are so fabulous and STILL they really don't even do the home justice. Sooooo many little details you get to uncover as your stay progresses. So tasteful, so impeccable.... you can tell they put LOTS of blood, sweat, tears and HEART into this 18 month reno. WOW. Check out all the drawers... there are fab nuggets everywhere. Kevin was such a fabulous host, too! We had an issue (operator error) but he was very responsive through the AirBnB site and even came over to set us straight. Can't wait to go back. Worth every penny. Best AIRBNB EVER. Thanks, Kevin!!!! (Oh, and it was my mother's 70th birthday and that did not go unnoticed... thanks for the bubbly.)"

Group trip","Hello, the visit to Canon City was fun and the house is nice. Upon arrival we met with Liz and she did a tour of the home. Everything was amazing but will make some suggestions. The outside needs to be wiped down or even hosed down as there are many spider webs on the house and on the outdoor lights and by the hot tub. I did attempt to clean it up but stopped as it's not my job to do. Did run into a very creepy spider but made sure to keep our distance. We did miss a communication with one another about the outdoor grill but we figured it out. A response was provided but that was after the fact. No biggie and thanks. I really recommend to stay here as you will enjoy. Thanks again Liz and Kevin and we look forward to making another reservation at your home again."

Kara, the owner, reached out and ensured that we had everything we needed. The cabin is also well supplied with dry non perishables, pots and pans, cutlery, spices and a lot of hot chocolate, perfect for the winter! Surrounded by aspens and evergreens I imagine the place would be gorgeous in all seasons. The bird feeders around bring a whole lot of jays and chickadees and other birds, fun to watch too! Curling up with a book, going for a little walk on the property, watching the birds, a bit of board games in between and a beautiful warm fireplace. Couldn't ask for more! Would love to return in another season and experience it all over again!"

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed at many airbnbs around the globe and the Muddy Moose was by far the best provisioned. Every cabinet door revealed more practical and useful items that made our stay simple and relaxing. Each day we returned from a demanding hike we found all that we needed quickly and it made our stay simply enjoyable. Initially concerned that the location was a bit remote and removed from activities; we found that anything we desired was within an hours drive and came to love the central hub the Muddy Moose provided. We hit hot springs twice, climbed Mt. Yale and caught beautiful trout. Kara was attentive and available without being intrusive. Hole in the wall Hartsel provided surprisingly delicious pizzas and Miss Amy and her staff were the highlight of the trip. My brother and I agreed that Amy's sweet treats were well worth the drive from Tennessee. All in all a 10/10 experience."

Stayed with kids","Our stay was great! Kara, was extremely responsive and accommodating when we were in the area earlier than anticipated. She also communicated with us throughout our stay which was incredibly helpful. She allowed us to check in early which was perfect. We had a fresh layer of snow when we came in making the cabin beautiful! The day before we left we received a winter storm making the cabin even more beautiful with the active snowfall. The indoor fire made this so much fun while we made s’mores and played games after a day in Breckinridge or Colorado Springs.
The beds were very uncomfortable and hard, making our 6 day long stay very rough. While this is okay for short 1-2 day stays, anything longer makes this worth mentioning.
Overall our stay was great! It was definitely a memorable stay. Thanks, Muddy Moose!"

I ADORE her beautiful, pollinator friendly yard and that you can sit outside your room and enjoy it. I'm a cat person and had hoped that I would see her sweet calico cat again this trip and I did. That alone gave me a bit of joy!

Tried to reach out after check in about something very casual, but never heard back, but ultimately it wasn’t a big deal at all. We had a great time overall and the rental space was everything we could have needed.
Thanks Bee!"

I have stayed at Bee’s Haven 3 times now but this is the first time in unit 1. Unit 2 is equally great, but this unit is larger.
This unit was spotlessly clean, had lots of space, a wonderful shower and is a great value. The attention to detail is so nice, matching kitchenette items, plush towels. I really appreciated it. And the adorable kitty who greets you in the morning is a great bonus. I will no doubt stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",We stayed at Deborah's Airbnb and really enjoyed our stay. The place was beautiful and had plenty of space. Easiest check in and check out! She checked on us after check in to make sure we had all we needed. We had relatives in town also who commented that our place was nicer and the same price as staying in a hotel. They plan to stay at her place next time they are in Canon City! Nice outside sitting area as well. She brought us extra towels when we requested them. Great location. We walked to dinner! I would definitely recommend this place!

The space is larger, no frills, communication was prompt, and although Deborah wasn't able to accommodate a late check-out for us, we enjoyed our stay overall. We opted to stay here because it was close to the Royal Gorge Railroad (7 minute walk, 4 minute drive).
Kindly note: this home is relatively close to the prison; so although we never felt unsafe, it's something to keep in mind."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot say enough positive things about IDLEWILD cabin. The setting was exactly what we were looking for and the cabin was beautiful and very clean. But it was all the little details that made it an over-the-top experience. From the mini-bar (didn’t partake, but was completely unexpected) to the fully stocked kitchen, including spices and an expresso machine, to the board games, and every possible little thing you may need in a mountain cabin (including emergency oxygen - which for us flat landers was quite the novelty).
Stephanie was so detailed in her instructions and gave great suggestions for local restaurants and things to do in the area.
If you are looking for a secluded mountain cabin with exceptional scenery, that has all the comforts of home and then some, IDLEWILD is the place for you.
Thank you Stephanie!"

The host instructions and insight is important to make your trip smooth! Lastly, be well hydrated and prepared for the high altitude and weather change. It took us a full day to get accustomed!

She has thoughtfully decorated each room and the cabin is engineered for peaceful relaxation. The windows in the main level living room allow for a front row view outside at all times. We saw a family of deer, an elk, a jack rabbit and enjoyed constant chipmunk and bird activity. Stephanie is very responsive to your messages and more than happy to provide information to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. She provided information on great spots to fish and it's the first time I have ever heard my husband say he was worn out from catching so many fish. The cabin is a short drive to tons of beautiful areas of Colorado with great things to do. We ventured to Salida, did Monarch pass, Leadville, did Mosquito pass through an ATV tour group, did Independence pass to Aspen and finally Breckinridge. We left with our souls restored and will return again!"

The view in the mornings, just memorizing. We loved being able to see various Colorado birds and mule deer on the property. As well as amazing wildlife nearby, and throughout Colorado! Stephanie was also very informative throughout our entire time and gave us very helpful tips to catch fish!

A super comfortable, clean & organized cabin with everything you need in your surroundings. It is very well equipped & Stephanie always friendly & aware of everything. I had concern for my 5-year-old girl as the cabin is very high but however it was the opposite, she was very well. I could say it gave me some chest pain & headache but I was able to control it. Since I was ready because Stephanie let me know before & one is ready mentally . I also recommend a 4x4 & vehicle with snow tires as the road is a bit complicated but inside that I would still stay in this cabin again because it is worth it. She is so incredibly beautiful & recommend it totally."

Stayed a few nights","Selfishly, I'd like to say this place is terrible just so I can have more availability for myself for the return trips again and again! Honestly, this is the most wonderful cabin I have ever booked. I have had this cabin bookmarked for two years, just trying to work out a time to get to it, and it was more than worth the wait. The place was perfect and had everything you could want. The mountain views are stunning. There aren't enough words to describe how much we enjoyed our stay here. If you're booking in the winter months, a 4-wheel drive is highly recommended. We needed it for the last couple of miles, but that just added to the fun! You'll feel like you are ""off the grid"" in this high-altitude paradise, but with all the comforts like great wifi, cell service and a super comfortable TV room with all the streaming services. Highly, highly recommend!"

We spent time AT up the road and saw incredible wilderness views. Breckenridge was about 40 minutes away, Fairplay had a convenient grocery store and the best tamales north of the border!
Stephanie was super responsive and flexible due to an incoming storm that could have affected our stay. (Beware the altitude!). She was also helpful with avoiding altitude sickness and had supplies if needed.
We considered this area and cabin a once-in-a-lifetime trip because of the accommodations and pristine surroundings. Please enjoy it soon!"

Stayed with kids","Cabin review:
So many extras were provided but not listed. Snow shoes w/ the walking sticks, sled, binoculars, eco friendly supplies (soaps/shampoo/ dish soap etc.), snow boots, rainfall walk-in shower, gourmet cookware, coffee thermos x2, travel tumblers, great spice rack and much more. We wanted nor needed anything else and could have packed a lot less. I'm unsure if airbnb limits descriptions or Stephanie assumes everyone else is as detail oriented as she is but for the first time in years, I felt someone took the wheel and let me finally relax for a bit.
Stephanie review:
When I first spoke to Stephanie regarding my wife's disabilities, Stephanie didn't give me the normal ""sorry to hear that"" response like others. Instead, she gathered new detailed pictures of areas I had concerns with so I had a clear understanding of the cabin (steps, flooring, handrails, rugs). My next vacation will be planned around Stephanie's availability. She is as much a gem as the cabin. We'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie was a phenomenal host and Idlewild was an amazing property. My stay was just the getaway I needed. Every finish you could ask for at 11,000 ft. was present.
A word of caution to sedan drivers: you can make it! But you will need to go slow and be patient. The roads were generally well-maintained but a sedan is a sedan and rain can really change these mountain roads."

Stayed a few nights","Great cabin, super cozy and well decorated. We spent 5 days there and even though it was Summer we used the wood stove everyday as temperatures were cold (we live in Florida) and we loved it. Stephanie is a great host, she was extremely accommodating and always responded promptly to any questions.
The cabin is a perfect mountain getaway, way up the mountain on a well maintained dirt road. There are a couple of trails very close to the cabin with amazing views.
The town of Fairplay is quirky and fun. We would recommend the South Park Museum to get a glimpse of the life of the first settlers in the area.
Loved our stay and definitely recommend this cabin : )"

Stayed a few nights","Cabin is amazing. Quality, decor, design, look and feel are picture-perfect. It’s even better than the pictures in real life. Equipment and amenities are five star. It is really a three-bed and offers plenty of space and privacy. Location is wild and feels remote but is actually very easy to reach. Surrounding towns are lovely. Stephanie is a gracious and responsive host. Just be mindful it’s 11,500ft above sea level, so you may feel a little dizzy! Highly recommended."

Make sure you properly prepare for the altitude the home is located at, as it took me 3 days to acclimate. I recommend a 4 wheel drive vehicle as it is 5 miles up a dirt road. Cars can make it, but you'll be more comfortable."

We would love to see this place in winter!"

The place is warm and cozy, tastefully decorated, clean, and had everything we needed to stay in and cook. The views from the kitchen and back deck once the storm cleared are incredible. Stephanie was great with communication and her recommendations like trying Otto's food truck in Alma were spot on. Loved our stay and can't wait to come back when we can enjoy a bit more outdoor time as well. My husband was able to summit Pennsylvania mountain during our weekend which was a great adventure just down the street. The cabin is absolute heaven."

We were lucky enough to get a bunch of fresh snow and had a visit from a neighboring hybrid Wolf who was very friendly and helped me shovel the walk. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this AMAZING cabin!!! Stephanie, the home owner, was beyond helpful in Every Way! My daughter got altitude sickness for a day and Stephanie had complimentary O2 canisters and advice for us which helped tremendously. We met some of the neighbors who were beyond nice and very friendly. I cannot say enough nice things about this Spectacular place and it's Amazing owner! Don't hesitate to book this cabin!!!"

As for the road in snowy weather, a 4x4 or 4wd is definitely needed.
First time in Colorado, and thanks to Stephanie, her attentions and recommendations we had a spectacular time. Recommended 100%"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was perfect! Stephanie went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The location is fairly secluded, and has excellent views. There are a couple of minor drawbacks to the location, and Stephanie was quick to point them out and confirm that we were aware. The cabin is at close to 11,400 feet, so there is a real possibility of altitude sickness, especially in the mornings. In addition, there are some steeper inclines on gravel roads to get there, so it may be a more challenging drive without 4 wheel drive, depending on the weather, as gravel roads tend to stay icy longer. Overall, our stay was spectacular! Just a few small things to keep in mind when booking."

Group trip","Such a nice place! Perfect getaway from everything. Quiet and secluded. Elevation is very high! We came from Texas and we adapted well about a day in. Keep that in mind. Driveway is a bit steep and in the winter can be a little hard to get up in most vehicles. 4x4 won’t have any issues or if you have chains. We had to get some. The road to get there is very well maintained and every vehicle should be able to get down without issues. Saw many cars driving through the roads.
This is the place for our family and we love it!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed for a week at this perfect cabin and never wanted to leave! The views are spectacular, the peace and quiet are heavenly, the trees and fresh air priceless. Inside is the coziest place to spend time, wood and gas burning stoves for extra warmth and ambience, the cutest log construction with great windows, super comfy bed and a coffee setup I missed when I left. There’s so much to do in the area, but I didn’t feel at all guilty for doing nothing sometimes to sit on the deck, soak up the sunshine and watch the clouds float past. Just walking around the neighborhood is a treat and there’s also a trailhead within walking distance. It was one of the most relaxing weeks I have ever enjoyed. I have 4WD which was needed to get to the cabin in a pretty big snow storm, but the dirt roads to the cabin are well maintained (graded and plowed), so it was no problem. Even the driveway was plowed and waiting for us. Stephanie couldn’t be any more helpful and friendly. Great from beginning to end. I hope I’m able to return soon!"

The decor is stylish, comfy sleeping/lounging arrangements and the place is equipped with everything needed for a short or long stay. The kitchen is fully equipped and it was easy to pick up groceries in Fairplay at Prather's (try the tamales at Dorothy's if you get a chance as well!). Stephanie was supremely responsive/flexible, allowing us to add an extra day to our stay and offering hiking recommendations. Pennsylvania Mountain was a nice hike up the road and we also ventured out to Limber Grove (beautiful ancient limber and bristlecone pines) and Mohawk Lakes (which was the busier of the three). All really beautiful and special in their own ways. Would highly recommend staying here!"

Colorado had a really early snow right before our stay, and even before we arrived, Stephanie reached out to make sure we were equipped to make the trip in the snow and was incredibly thoughtful about ways to make the trip wonderful despite the unexpected weather. The cabin is artfully decorated, so cozy, and equipped with everything you might need (we cooked all meals at the cabin, and all the tools we needed were provided!) The cabin was extremely clean, something very important to us during these unpredictable Covid times. Stephanie was quick to respond to any questions we had throughout the weekend, and provided excellent hiking recommendations once the weather warmed up a little towards the end of our stay. We certainly hope to be back!"

This is all in addition to the beautiful well-appointed cabin. The pictures do not do it justice. The wrap around porch was perfect for handing out in the evenings. There were even blankets in the chest in the living room to keep our laps warm.

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie's cabin was absolutely perfect! We made a last minute decision to head further west after a couple of days in Boulder because we wanted to be somewhere a little more quiet and uncrowded. Stephanie replied quickly to the last minute booking request and the cabin was completely ready in a short time. The drive up to the cabin was fun, dirt roads up the mountain, but nothing too rough. The main road leading out there was regraded the day after we arrived and this made the first couple miles of dirt road very smooth. The location is perfect if you are seeking some solitude and quiet without being far from conveniences. Fairplay is about 15 minutes away if you need groceries, restaurants, gas, etc. This was a great base for several day trips as we were able to drive to several different mountains within 30-60 minutes and spend the day running and hiking. We were even able to drive to Mt. Elbert in less than 2 hours and spend the day hiking up to the top. Breckenridge is also not far away if that's your thing. We were also able to hike to the top of Pennsylvania Mountain right from the cabin without having to drive anywhere. That's a great option to have if you want to get one more mountain in for the day, but its a bit too late to drive somewhere.
The cabin itself has plenty of room to spread out in with a nice family room on the lower level as well as a bedroom and full bathroom. There is plenty of wood for the wood burning stove on the upper level and plenty of games located in the large chest near the stove. I wasn't traveling with kids, but there certainly would have been plenty for them to do at the cabin. There are even horseshoe pits outside. The best part for me was the large loft. At night, you can see tons of stars between the silhouettes if the tall pine trees. I did learn to close the curtains on the back windows as the sun can be quite bright in the morning. Make sure to do that if you are sleeping in the loft and want to sleep in.
I would definitely stay in Stephanie's cabin again. I wasn't sure how I would fare sleeping at that elevation since it was over 10K feet higher than where I live, but it didn't bother me much at all and I didn't notice anything after a couple of days. Just remember to slow down when needed if you are coming from a much lower altitude. :)"
