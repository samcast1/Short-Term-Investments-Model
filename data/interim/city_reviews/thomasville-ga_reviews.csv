Stayed one night","Zachary was a great host. My husband and I were in town for a fundraiser was decided last minute to book an air bnb. Zachary’s was close to the downtown area we were in so it was the perfect choice. He responded back almost immediately and accepted. His check in instructions were simple and easy. We had no problem finding the place and checking in. It was just what we were looking for. Super clean. Had a tv, sitting area and a variety of coffee and chocolates. Bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The pillows were perfect. If we are ever back in the area we will definitely book with him again. 10/10"

His place was exactly what I needed. Very well kept, pretty decor and central to shopping and eating out. I would say that walking to downtown Thomasville would be a little bit of a hike, but is doable. Overall, I would highly recommend his place to anyone. I will be staying there again my next trip!"

Stayed one night","Absolutely fabulous stay!
Zachary's place is definitely a 5star+!!
What a great experience for our first Airbnb!
We would highly recommend.
Zachary has excellent communication,
easy to chat with and answered all our questions promptly.
Upon entering neighborhood we felt safe.
Smooth, easy driveway and walk path lined with rocks so no muddy feet... Lower entry had a door overhang which again beneficial since it was raining.
Immediately from opening the door,we were so impressed with the accommodations.
Everything was extremely clean, well placed and truly everything we needed for our short stay . Super comfortable bed and probably the best pillow I've ever put my head on. Slept like a baby.
Property location was ideal for attending our wedding event at South Eden plantation.
Don't hesitate to book this one. You will be very pleased!!
Thank you again Zachary for such a wonderful experience!"

I stopped in Thomasville to visit the independent bookstore called The Bookshelf. I adore the podcast by the owner of The Bookshelf called From The Front Porch and just had to come and check out Thomasville. The charm of Thomasville and The Bookshelf did not disappoint! I recommend stopping in Thomasville when in the area!

Stayed a few nights","Although not a very large accommodation, this little bungalow was perfect for my weekend stay and was exactly as advertised.I felt the location of the property was in a very nice quiet neighborhood. Traveling alone as a single older female, this meant a lot to me. I felt very secure while there. It's modern updating gives it wonderful eye appeal and it had everything I needed for a clean and comfortable stay. I did have a minor problem with the lock on the door to the private entrance, but Zachary, the perfect host, was there within a few minutes to quickly resolve the problem. I will definitely reserve this little place again for future visits to the area, and I highly recommend this place to others who might be seeking comfort and privacy during their stay in Thomasville."

The patio area was so cute and beautiful at night when you turn on the patio lights that are hanging around the table. We ended up losing power because the storm turned and came up towards Thomasville. We decided to come home a day early and Mindy was very helpful, responsive, and accommodating.

We were also very close to beautiful downtown Thomasville and were able to easily walk to shops, coffee houses, restaurants, etc. It also happened to be my daughter's birthday and, not knowing the area, Mindy helped me get just the right cake for her (thanks to Pam!).

We had a great little welcome basket upon our arrival. There are multiple parks in close walking distance in case you have littles. Not too far of a walk to downtown either. Everything was fully stocked and really clean. Would highly recommend Mindy and this property!

The cottage was an excellent fit that felt like it was off the beaten path, but was quite in the middle of it all."

It is exactly as pictured. Just adorable! There were 3 of us and we had plenty of room. I also appreciated the responsive communication. Thank you for such a lovely home away from home.

Stayed one night","I just don’t even have the words to describe how cool our experience was here. This place was a DREAM! Just like the pictures! We were elated when we got there after a last minute decision to stop half way from our vacation in Florida and it was such a reasonable price for the entire place. Joanna even accommodated an early check in early within only a couple hours of notice from our reservation. She was super friendly, quick to respond and this place is somewhere we will definitely revisit in the future! You will be glad you found it, just like us!"

Great refrigerator and laundry facilities. Comfortable bed. Amazing lighting and authentic wood floors. Firewood ready to use in the fire pit outside. Although the host’s house was nearby, we had complete privacy. Very safe area surrounded by trees, birds and squirrels. Five minutes to shopping and restaurants. Don’t miss Cherokee Lake nearby. It’s a gorgeous walking trail that is beautifully maintained and worth the drive ( less than ten minutes away). I would love to come back for another visit!"

Stayed one night","Sometimes the expectations of city life cause one to pause when looking into ""countryside"" airbnb's. Don't be deceived! The Shack is everything an airbnb is supposed to be. Clean and modern...and a piano!?! Urban with that wonderful country indifference too polished showmanship. The Shack celebrates rest and light. It invites you in with spaciousness and thoughtful decorating touches. I was instantly home and when it came time to leave I realized I had not planned enough time to stay.
Don't rush if you stay at the Shack. Plan for 3 nights if you can. Enjoy the restfulness and the clean, white spaces filled with light. You wont be sorry."

It is a converted shed that has been done up with premium furnishings and wonderful touches of class and style. Large and spacious, immaculately clean, and a full kitchen. Amazing."

The place felt very spacious and homey and one of the more unique places we have stayed. Thomasville is adorable and has a wonderful little downtown with some excellent and unique shopping and dining. Whether passing through and need a place to put up for the night like us or staying a few days, this is a great place to call home while you're away from yours. : )"

Stayed a few nights","Shaunna's place is better than we expected, even after reading all the reviews. Yes the place is super clean and super adorable and comfortable, but here is what really stood out. We have stayed at many AIRB&B and VRBOs for many years. We have noticed that little by little more hosts have gotten chintzy with what they provide i.e. amount of toilet paper, paper towels, bath towels, shampoo, soaps etc. I get it, supplies can get expensive if you have to replace them so often. So we have come not to expect much. We usually always stop by a drugstore and make sure we get water bottles and back up supplies. Well we were shocked to see that Shaunna had already provided those little things that have disappeared. Drinks in the fridge, cute new toothbrushes (that matched the decor :) and mini toothpaste. All the streaming services were logged in and available, we usually have to log into our personal accounts and remember to log out before we leave). Thomasville was fine, but our stay in this cute AirBNB is what we will remember. Thank you Shaunna."

This truly is a spacious home with plenty of room for everyone to comfortably have their own space and yet have ample opportunity to gather for meals, campfires, games, assembling puzzles and to watch football, all of which we did. The home is lovely and well appointed with comfortable beds and furnishings, a well stocked kitchen for cooks, and various cozy indoor and outdoor spaces. Thomasville's historic spots, unique shops and great restaurants are close by, as are grocery stores. We highly recommend Raina's Thomasville home."

Our selection was based on the beautifully decorated pictures shown online, and we were not disappointed. It was furnished nicely and had many little extras (e.g , coffee, filters, full kitchen utensils, extra blankets, throws, etc.). There was even a swing on the front porch and we enjoyed sipping our coffee there in the mornings.
Although the cottage is only one bedroom, it lives much larger with many quaint sitting areas.
We highly recommend Cottage 308, especially for couples.

The kitchen was well equipped and had a great coffee bar. My husband enjoyed sitting on the front porch during a light rain one afternoon. It was easy to check in and off street parking was a plus. I would not hesitate to stay again when we visit the area."

This cottage is perfection! Joanna and Shaunna were so kind as to let us have an early arrival when I reached out. Everything was spotless clean! There were sweet little touches throughout their cottage that made you feel like you were home. The shower was everything. And the cherry on top is the swing on the front porch.

The front porch has this very nice porch swing but it was messy, cobwebs, etc. Would've been nice if it was clean & had pillows (since the swing was metal). The area looks a little rough, but we didn't feel scared or anything. Couches & beds were comfortable. There was no winekey although Joanna said she would get one for the next renter. Joanna was very responsive, usually got a text back in a few minutes. Easy walk to downtown."

We had a small leak from one of the bath tubs upstairs, and Rendall was quick to respond when we reached out to him.

Spacious, well designed, bedrooms and bathrooms are perfect. Tons of sitting and private spots throughout the house. Absolute beauty.
We encounter a water break and Rendall and plumber responded and corrected issue immediately. Some may think this is a bit so good thing to state; however things happen beyond our control and for me it shows the issue being addressed immediately.
Thanks Rendall for a warm and welcome place to call home away from home. Nice walk into town. Great historical scenery and some. This was a last minute booking that was well worth it! We will see you again soon."

Stayed a few nights","This loft is beautiful! Located in downtown Thomasville above His Daughter boutique. We parked our cars upon arrival and didn’t get back in them until we checked out. We were able to walk everywhere! The loft itself was shockingly quiet for being on Broad St. The original floors were gorgeous and the furnishings were perfect for the space. We also loved there was plenty of seating!
One note for future guests, I would not recommend this loft for those with mobility issues. There was a flight of wood deck stairs to get up to the entrance and the original floors are sometimes uneven. It didn’t bother us - we liked the original features! - but may be troublesome for some. If you want something downtown, walkable, historic and beautiful, This is your place!"

If you’re looking for a stay that's as sweet as a Georgia peach, where every little touch is thought of, this darling apartment is the epitome of comfort. I'm simply smitten!"

She stocked the loft with plenty of towels, toiletries, drinks, snacks, kitchenware, anything you could possibly need was there! The location was fantastic, easy parking, and you could walk to everything downtown. There were plenty of cute restaurants and shops within 1-2 blocks of the loft. I am trying to find a reason to stay here again soon! It truly was an amazing rental experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"

If you were a bookish young person, or if love the feeling of stepping back in time, (while still having a luxury mattress and fluffy towels and coffee maker) we could not more highly recommend the Jerger. The host was also extremely kind, available, and welcoming. She left our little boy a Christmas gift! This was the perfect place to stay in one of America’s most perfect small towns. We will be back. (To give you some additional sense of our stay my wife insisted she write the review because it was that great!)"

Stayed a few nights","Thomasville, GA, was featured in a 6-page spread in the May issue of Southern Living magazine. Since the three of us had never been there before, and it was only a 4-hour drive from our home, we decided to take a road trip for a 3-night stay and explore this charming Southern town. Next, we needed a place to stay … Once The Jerger popped up, we needed to look no farther. Host Diane’s condo is truly magnificent. It is even more wonderful and spacious than the online photos portray. Every attention to detail is carefully thought out: the tasteful furnishings, plentiful amenities, and quality craftsmanship are on display throughout. Everything is immaculate and comfortable and makes you feel right at home. The location can’t be beat, as it’s just around the corner from practically all the shops, restaurants and charming downtown area, all in a very secure spot. We loved it! Diane, too, is a gem and was quick to respond to all our communications. Thank you for sharing your home with us."

The Jerger is in the middle of the best shopping in Thomasville and directly across the street from the amphitheater.

The house was clean, well appointed, and plenty of private, off-street parking. Wendy and Ron were communicative before arrival with clear instructions about check in, information for our stay, and check out. The layout of the house would probably be more ideal for couples, but we found everything to be totally adequate and enjoyable! They obviously have pet owners in mind when they advertise the listing as dog friendly, as everything was designed with them in mind- down to a jar of treats for our pups! Would definitely recommend this location."

It had a beautiful rustic decor that was very inviting for the nature lover! I visit Thomasville often and I will definitely be back to stay with Wendy the next time because my first impression was just awesome. She is amazing and the house was beautiful."

Stayed with a pet","This place was perfect for a quick get away from the city. My dog absolutely loved the open space and the view while working inside was relaxing. The porch was beautiful and there were plenty of spots to sit at. Inside was super cute and had everything you would need for yourself as well as for your pet (dog bowls, treats, baggies). No issues with bugs or anything like that, in fact a gentleman was on site spraying at the time of my stay. It felt super safe at night which was huge for me as I was traveling alone. Would 100% stay again. Thank you again for everything!"

Stayed with a pet","This rustic yet modern cabin is such a wonderful find! It lives so much larger than its square footage, and the finishes are so upscale and interesting. Classic Southern elegance. The view from the front porch is lovely and the setting is peaceful without being totally isolated...on the edge of town but one can easily be in downtown Thomasville in a few minutes. The kitchen was very well stocked and there were lots of thoughtful touches throughout. Wendy and Ron are extremely hospital and accommodating. Not a single complaint and one of the best Airbnb experiences ever! Thanks so much!"

She provided bottled water, coffee, and toiletries which were greatly appreciated as we’d already packed everything up for our flight home. The house is spacious. With it being a pet friendly Airbnb, we didn’t get that typical “gross, a dog has been here” feeling that we’ve felt in other places. The home was free of dog hair and normal pet smell. The yard was clean and fenced, wonderful for my sister’s two small pups that were longing for a good run after being cooped in the car for multiple hours. The location is perfect for walking to the beautiful downtown area. The home also had a massive parking area, not normally found in homes in such close proximity to downtown. We will definitely stay here again and recommend to all of our friends needing a place to stay in Thomasville."

Lauren was very responsive and even left a small welcome gift for us. For our three days there, we had enough starter soap, shampoo, and conditioner. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, and spices; and the TV had all the apps we needed for a quiet night in.

Stayed with a pet","Oh my word what a home! Fell in love from the moment I drove up to this beautifully restored property. Corner lot with gorgeous outdoor sitting area, oak trees, azaleas and well kept landscaping. Huge kitchen, equipped with all the essentials for our stay. Tastefully decorated with plenty of space for our family and pup. We enjoyed all the card games and local Thomasville magazines Lauren left for us. Office space was used during our stay for my remote work meetings, and couldn’t be happier with how quaint and quiet the neighborhood was. The home is filled with so many lovely windows in every room. Rooms/beds/pillows were super comfortable and sheets were so soft. Lauren did a great job picking out the best linens and towels. Everything was wonderful. Weather was perfect for day trips to Cherokee Park with our Pup, and walks through the historic downtown and streets to admire the Victorian homes. Plenty of shops and restaurants near by. We never drove more than 15 min to reach a destination. Lauren was a reliable host and was always available during our stay and offered plenty of information to help guide us through the villa. We had snacks and water waiting for us when we arrived, which was a nice treat! Overall, the place was a 10/10. I would highly recommend Lauren’s home and can’t wait to come back to Thomasville for another visit with my family!"

The location was excellent. I actually liked how the shower was in a separate space from the rest of the bathroom. This would seem to be especially beneficial for a couple. Moon’s Pizza - what a place! - was just around the corner and all of downtown was easy to get to on foot. The Thomasville History Museum, which I really enjoyed, was a few blocks down the street. Walking past all the beautiful homes to get there was a bonus. Thomasville is such an attractive city with more than enough to keep a person happily engaged for at least a few days. I would love to stay at Wendy and Ron’s place again."

I will say this is probably on our end but didn't realize that the gated yard had no access from inside so we had to leash our dog walk to the gared yard unleash and unfortunately the gate wasn't secure so we couldn't leave our dog out there alone ,even like while unpacking the car, the bed is extremely high off the ground which made life with a toddler very difficult and we left early however other than that great and was walking distance from ALL of downtown Thomasville."

But I didn’t want to go “glamping”. Went on Airbnb & VRBO. Found the Dawson St Cottage (converted garage) and it was perfect! Great location, we walked just about everywhere. Spent one cloudy day driving around and heading across the Florida / Georgia line. Although our Aussie went with us except to dinners, he was cozy in his kennel that we brought. However, we noticed a kennel under the bed that we could have used. Wendy thought of everything! Excellent host, cute place, great location!

Stayed a few nights","I stayed three nights in April, and it was just the cozy, relaxing environment I needed. This location is the best of both worlds that I was looking for: a quiet residential neighborhood only a few blocks from the lovely downtown area with lots of locally owned shops, an independent bookstore, bakeries, coffeeshops and restaurants. Super easy and safe to walk (or drive) into the downtown area to get food. If you need a grocery store, a Publix supermarket is just a few miles down the road. Thomasville's ""big oak,"" which is a huge lovely tree that dates back to 1680, is only a few blocks away too. (It sounds corny, but that tree is a thing of beauty.)
This Airbnb was very clean and cozy; the bed was super comfy; it was very quiet (I slept great); the window AC worked well; there was plenty of hot water in the shower; and I felt safe and secure as a woman staying by herself. I would highly recommend this place."

When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised with the property - the amount of hospitable details is probably better than any AirBnB we've yet to stay at. They left such a lovely welcome gift, had the coffee bar set up so nicely, the place was super clean and we really appreciated the extra cleaning products available too! The wifi works great and we even loved that they had a Firestick TV (which made accessing movies for our toddler so easy). Like I said, we would highly recommend, you will not be disappointed :-)"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was perfect for what we needed! The location was perfect and within walking distance to downtown. Check in and check out was quick and easy. We loved all of the little thoughtful touches, like the local coffee and honeybuns. Would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to be close to downtown."

Everyone must know too it’s located in a very historical area, walkable, peaceful, beautiful.......just can’t say enough positive about this location."

Stayed a few nights","This cottage is adorable and a must stay! It is in a perfect location to downtown Thomasville, yet quiet and quaint for a quiet stay away from the hustle and bustle. The cottage was bigger than expected and the side yard was perfect for our pup! We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","Loved it~. Minimal but just what needed. A little outdoor seating area. Comfortable. The bed was good, and even a stool under it for us short girls! Air conditioner worked great. And you can't beat being 2 blocks from town and surrounded by beautiful homes where you can just get out and walk. I will definitely come again!"

The bed is extremely comfortable (I'd love to know the mattress brand, lol). Space is very clean and decorated tastefully. Private parking (not on the street). Would definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful, albeit too short, weekend at the cottage. The space was better than we expected - cleaner, plenty of space for a couple, and the weather was perfect so we even got to sit outside at the little patio table and enjoy it. I saw other reviews about the shower being off the kitchen but it was no trouble for us at all. Actually nice because one could be showering while another could be using the sink/toilet in other space.
We really appreciated all the thoughtful little touches... snacks, drinks, and coffee were provided which was not expected and really really nice. A cute little basket of items that may be needed under the sink in the bathroom (band aids, toiletries, etc). The bed was extremely comfy and we found ourselves wanting to sleep in. One of the main attractions was that it was walking distance from the downtown, where we did a little shopping and had a nice lunch. Cute little town.
We would definitley stay at this cottage again if we come back to town!"
