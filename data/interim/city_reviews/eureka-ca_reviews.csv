Stayed with a pet",Kristie went above and beyond- we only stayed for one night and wish we could have spent more time here. Down to every little detail she made the home feel so cozy and welcoming. When we come back to eureka this will always be where we go.

Stayed one night","The house is very cozy with a truly livable feel. it is a perfect balance of historic old house with modern amenities with fun art everywhere.
Before visiting I wasn’t keen on the shower/bathtub setup but the shower was fabulous and if you like a deep
Bath you’ll certainly love the tub.
The recommendations for things to do in Eureka made me wish we were staying longer!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I along with our 2 dogs stayed for a few nights during my husband's 50th birthday road trip. The house had anything you could wish for! My husband loved making himself some coffee and he spent a lot of time on the back deck. In the evenings, I generally sat inside and worked on my cross stitches. The neighborhood is quiet with some older run down houses but we enjoyed walking around and taking note of the kept up houses and the architecture they provide. The house is across the street from a community center but the entrance is on the opposite street so you dont get that activity. We would definitely stay again!"

We were there to run a marathon and there was nothing better than coming home to this beautiful space.
Thank you and hope to stay again next year!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Kristie's place was more than we
had hoped for! She even let us know the house was available for early check-in. Once there, we felt welcomed and at home. The amenities were all as stated in the description, but the kitchen amenities were above and beyond. The bed and pillows were super comfy. We loved the bathroom (the shower in the clawfoot tub rocks)!
I think the best word describing the home is ""charming"". It was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. We even drove out to Ferndale, had a wonderful lunch, and enjoyed a walk through town enjoying the shops and architecture.
We both agree it was the nicest place we've had the pleasure to stay at! I am in Eureka a few times a year and hope to be able to stay at Kristie's again."

The host has decorated this house tastefully and stocked it up with generosity and thoughtfulness with everything you need to feel at home immediately.
The renovation preserved historic integrity and offered modern amenities; light fixtures, switch plates (buttons) window coverings, to appliances, super comfortable bed… Gotta try the shower!!!
A sun lover’s delight! The sun flooded the living room in the morning, and I watched the sunset on the back deck. Meandered my short walk to the restaurants and shops through the area for a taste of old California. Can’t wait to go back!
Thank you Kristie 👏🏼"

Stayed with a pet","Immaculate in every way. Traveling for business and it met every need. I brought my puppy and it was perfect, enclosed kitchen with hardwood floors, with a great backyard that offered lots of privacy. Owners provided older towels for the dog to dry off after a walk in the rain. Human towels were soft and big. The bathroom was accommodating and taking a long bath after driving from Portland, OR was sublime. Clean, close to the downtown area, yet also private, and off the main road. Fast wifi and I was able to order MOD PIZZA via UBER EATS while I did work and watched TV. Lastly, from the couch to the bed, all the furniture was well kept and comfortable. I will look for this booking again when I come through next month, thank you! Loved it!"

To get to the house the neighborhoods are a little run down, but the actual street for Chan's place is new and very nice. There is a huge walk in closet in the main bedroom which served us as an extra sleeping area. The house is definitely a rental, has no character. Would stay again."

Chan's home was a recently built and beautifully furnished modern home.
It had all of the amenities that we needed. Three bedrooms and 2 and half bathrooms were great for a family of four. Communication from Chan was terrific and very responsive. Chan's house was about a ten minute drive to the waterfront district with shops and food.
The record player with Beach Boys and Janet Jackson albums were a bonus!
We would highly recommend Chan's home to anyone who needs a place in Eureka."

Stayed with kids","The airbnb was very clean, Chan had great communication, and everything was as described. My only gripe is it's a 100% airbnb house. There's no sense of this being a comforting home, it's very sterile. The main living room is lacking furniture, or anything on the wall, rubs etc so it's very loud. The best bed by far is the guest bedroom, it's the only bed with a box spring. The primary bed is larger, but is super hard."

Stayed with kids","If you are visiting Eureka this is the place to stay!!
This house seemed almost too good to be true! We thought there would be a catch, but everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Chan is the most thoughtful and gracious host.
He provided us with all of the information we needed. He went above and beyond to make our week long stay comfortable and memorable.
He had excellent restaurant recommendations like Annie’s Cambodian Cuisine, which was one of our favorite parts of the trip.
There was so much to do and see in and around Eureka that coming back to this house made it so very relaxing after a long afternoon out.
Thanks Chan and Eureka, CA for an amazing week!!
We will be back!!

The space was clean but also felt homey and comfortable. Pat was prepared and there were so many thoughtful things available things - that I would have never thought of but were helpful (I’m speaking to you, bananas!) My trip was a quick one, but my down time was spent at Pat’s and it was the perfect place to lay my head and unwind. I’ve already started planning my next trip out, hopefully for a longer stay!

The bed, linens & pillows were comfortable and warm. The space is perfect with plenty of room for 2 people - a couple, best friends or family (we were a mother & daughter traveling together).
Pat’s place has so many helpful amenities: a Keurig selection, snacks, toiletries, dishes…really anything you can think of or may forget. She even had a custom welcome sign hanging outside for us! Local recommendations, visitors info and a guest book to sign.
Pat was friendly, helpful & responsive. We cannot wait to stay there again. Highly recommend!!"

Had everything I needed for my short stay. Would definitely stay here again when I’m back in the area :)

Pat could not have been any nicer, as a matter of fact, I'd have to say that she was one of the nicest Airbnb hosts I've ever encountered. Pat gives a lot of attention to ALL of the little details that make your stay with her so enjoyable, right down to the new tooth brush you'll find, among the other thoughtful offerings in her toiletries basket. All in all, Pat's studio is a definite ""find"" in Eureka! Highly recommend!"

My flights ended up getting delayed so I showed up later than I had origianlly thought. Pat was there to great me with a smile and a warm welcome. She even had a little welcome sign along the path to the door for me and a little chocolate candy on my bed. I had complete control over the temperature in my room which was awesome! I like it cold when I sleep and I never heard a peep while trying to sleep at night. There was a little patio with a beautiful setting for me to sit on in the moring and enjoy my coffee before I started my day. This is the place to stay if you ever venture this way. I will definitely be back! Thank you Pat."

Stayed a few nights","Loved our time here. It was a small, cute little find. Pat was very flexible with us as we had initially said we would arrive an hour after check-in time but ended up arriving right at check-in. Her place was spotless, felt safe and secluded. I enjoyed our stay with ample things to do in the surrounding area, and plenty of recommendations that Pat had put pamphlets of in the space.
I feel as though it was very worth the price and great to have Pat so close and responsive on messages when needed. The bed for myself (being a little bit tall) and my partner was a slightly crammed and a little worn, but we still slept quite soundly and stay very warm on the quite cold nights while we stayed. The space heater within the room really helped out and warmed us up quickly. After not seeing a cat throughout the entire stay, we did end up seeing a cat on our very last morning there which we were very happy about.
Many thanks Pat and hope to see you and the cats again in the future!"

Check-in was easy - self check-in with a keypad and checkout was straightforward too. There was plenty of parking on the street.
We got to chat with Pat in person for a bit and she was very sweet. She let us know about a local event - the Christmas truck parade, which was awesome!

Pat was there to greet me when I arrived, and neighbors were friendly and smiling.
I was lucky enough to visit near Halloween, so I got to enjoy the fun Halloween decorations.
Pat has put her artistry into creating this treasure. I kept discovering charming new details that made the visit pleasant.
The bed was a comfy cozy nest, the bathroom was nicely arranged. There were plenty of supplies available. I found myself smiling again and again as I noticed the colors and playful details. I felt pampered.
Pat has made this a place of joy. It is inspirational.
I would have liked to have been there for a longer visit and taken the skywalk in the redwoods. I will plan that for next time."

Pat paid attention to all the little details from small Dixie cups to rinse with in the bathroom, emergency travel supplies, small snacks and beverages and fancy hand soaps. She customized a greeting sign in the backyard and included sparkling wine for my birthday. Very sweet gesture. The location was close to the sequoia park zoo and was about a 5 minute drive to everywhere within Eureka. She had a list of great suggestions on local restaurants. The motion sensor lights and the cats did not bother us at all. The neighborhood felt safe and peaceful with a nice view of the eureka water tower in the distance. There was ample parking in front of the house. All in all, wonderful stay and a wonderful host! I would definitely return! Thanks!"

Stayed one night","My daughter and her husband stayed at Pat’s place, which I booked for them. Pat’s responses were quick and kind. She had her place ready and available for them before the check-in time and they had a fun welcome sign upon arrival. They reported that Pat was very friendly and available if needed. The room felt safe, was very comfortable and colorful as well as SPOTLESS. Plenty of snacks, tea and coffee available upon arrival. Based on their review I expect I’ll be looking to stay at Pat’s place the next time we’re in the Eureka area. I know they will the next time they are in the area as well.
Thank you Pat!"

Stayed one night","I stayed in the Green Room at Vadas and really enjoyed her minimalist style and thoughtful layout. Also I liked the water craft with yummy water and coffee pot for fresh coffee in the morning. There is a boiler or furnace thing that clangs at night but didn't bother me. Also regarding Eureka in general, the edges of town are much nicer than the center. The center of Eureka they have ""let that go"" as the expression goes. The edges of Eureka like where Vada lives are nice victorians and good restaurants and (oddly enough) there are quite a few sequias and redwoods right in town to admire! Anyway if you're looking for a place to stay in Eureka, which obviously you are if you are reading this, then I recommend Vadas Green Room."

Bed is comfortable and nights are extremely quiet. Numerous windows makes the space bright and happy—along with many gorgeous houseplants. It felt very private and safe. Parking is easy and close. The apartment has been updated with obvious love and care. Owners are responsive but not hovering. The very best host notebook I have seen—with every bit of information you may need while visiting.

I appreciated the locked gate to access the side yard and the stairs to this 2nd floor unit. Felt very private and safe. Once you enter, you’ll then realize that you have found the best AirBnb in Eureka at this price point. It was cozy and warm and felt like a home. It was immaculately clean and well provisioned with furnishings, linens and plants that really contributed to the comfortable cozy feel of their place. Loved the couch to watch TV at night, the shower was a dream, the bed and pillows very comfortable. I enjoyed making my coffee each morning in their bright and well designed kitchen and looking out to their impressive garden. Shin and Tony were kind and helpful as well. This might be my favorite AirBnb yet! Thank you Shin & Tony!"

They provided a binder full of helpful information and suggestions for local eats and activities. The couch and bed were very clean and comfy so it was easy to relax after a day of exploring. The bedroom had a nice view of the sunset with a peek of the bay. The window shades were nice because you can adjust open the top and block the bottom of the window to allow sunlight into the room during the morning without feeling exposed to the outside neighborhood. The location was walking distance to local eats and drinks, and a short drive away to the market and Costco I needed anything.
Shin and Tony were very responsive when I messages them and even recommended a local event that was happening during my stay. They provided clear instructions which made checking in and out effortless. I would definitely stay here again when visiting the area, it’s well worth the stay."

""Walking distance"" to Old Town is maybe a bit optimistic, and Eureka itself is a rather depressed city right now, with more homeless people than tourists. But hopefully that will turn around.
We enjoyed Redwood National Park."

The property felt safe and entrance to the guest suite was very accessible. No trouble with parking during our stay. Spent time chatting with Tony who was very welcoming and friendly—he even gifted us with fresh crab that he caught himself! Their dogs are adorable as well. Highly recommend staying here, especially at such a reasonable price!

We’ve never stayed in a Airbnb before but due to it being Labor Day weekend all hotel rooms were sold out. Shin & Tony’s place was perfect for what we needed for the weekend. The apartment was close by to restaurants, gas and quick fast food joints. Also close to a Dutch Brother’s which was wonderful since we don’t have any in the Bay Area. The apartment was clean, well taken care of and getting into the apartment was easy through Shin’s directions which was great since we were coming in late at night and didn’t want to bother anyone checking in if we needed. That being said both Shin & Tony were available if we needed anything or had any questions. Lovely stay and they absolutely deserve the high scores they receive."

Stayed a few nights","We were delighted to meet Shin & Tony and stay at their adorable place. They've restored it beautifully.
The esthetics were wonderful. It's obvious they put considerable time and attention to detail decorating and filling the place with beautiful mid century modern furniture, sweet hand picked pieces, and a well stocked kitchen and bathroom. It was comfortable, inviting and we felt quite at home. Tony's choice of plants is lovely and ads a feeling of aliveness.
Their openness and easy accessibility were appreciated and endearing, lending itself to an intimate experience. We really enjoyed connecting.
The dogs have individual personalities and we enjoyed them too.
The full fledged vegetable garden was overflowing in greenness. It was
kind of them to offer to share it's goodness (and asian pears).
There's a nice health food store just down the street.
It's easy to stay in Eureka and visit the Redwoods. So rejuvenating. Reverence to be with beauty, more space and trees than people, and listening to wind in the trees. A deep serenity and stillness."

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect home base for exploring the Redwoods! We stayed for six days and the apartment was just right for the two of us. The kitchen is well-stocked and the fridge was large enough to hold all of our food (due to COVID we of course brought all of our meals); the gas stove and oven take time getting used to if you don't normally cook with gas, but the pots and pans were solid and dependable and easy to clean. The shower takes a bit to heat up, but since it was just the two of us we didn't run out of hot water, even when we took showers back to back. The internet is lightning fast! We spent our evenings continuing our pandemic binges, and during the week I had a few Zoom meetings and there were no problems connecting. We didn't get a chance to check out most of the local spots, because we've been very COVID-conscious, but we went to the Cafe Marina and Woodley's Bar on the marina and we felt comfortable. It was the first bar we've been to in over a year! We sat outside and kept our masks on, and the staff did an excellent job of making us feel safe. If you're looking for a cozy place to stay and relax during quarantine (and after!) look no further."

Stayed a few nights","I wish I could put ten stars on value. This was my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever been to. Maybe it was all the beautiful and happy house plants. Or the coffee beans and grinder with other basics and pukka tea. The art was pretty and interesting and I got to learn about some native plants. Everything was very clean, and I basically wanted to move in. The dogs were cute, and Shin and Tonys backyard vegetable
garden was a treat to see from the window. We brought our own wireless speaker so we were vibing out. :)
Just great energy all around. A+"

Stayed about a week","Chez Shony was a great place to stay - the perfect size, very cozy, comfortable and warm, and has a full kitchen complete with an electric water kettle, French press, full spice rack, cooking utensils, pots of many sizes, aluminum foil, and much more. The full kitchen made it very economical and is rare when traveling. It was also very clean. There are many nice details like the beautiful wood kitchen table and the art on the walls. We wouldn’t mind having a place like Chez Shony ourselves.
FYI the kitchen has a pocket door, so if two people are working from home, one can sit in the living room and one at the kitchen table and have some noise separation.
Shin and Tony have a very cool food garden which the place looks out on. Downtown Eureka was a short walk away, and we also biked to Sequoia park, hiked Arcata Community Forest and went to Luftenholtz beach for tidepooling 20-30 min north, all of which we recommend."

The kitchen has everything you'd need to have a home cooked meal (including sharp knives), and there were little details everywhere that made the space feel very comfortable. The heater in the bathroom was a nice touch, and expect plenty of light coming through the windows on sunny days. Also gnomes! Ninja gnomes, lil gnomes, shy gnomes, outdoor gnomes. They felt just as welcoming as all the vibrant house plants."

They have plants in every room and a few gnomes around the apartment too. It made the place feel so much more homey. The towels were super soft and nice and there was a heater in the bathroom!! Shin and Tony even provided their Netflix account so you can watch tv and movies during your down time on their very comfortable couch! I loved the place and eureka and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again.

The location is perfect and In easy walking distance to down town and old town, as well as short drives to visit the beach or take a hike in the redwoods. Our host was immediately responsive and thoughtful."

Stayed a few nights","So this is like a one-bedroom apartment over a garage, and that 1 car garage is empty for your use and it would probably fit a large truck.fit I'm not sure if the garage is attached to the main house but I never heard anybody else. The place was clean, the bed+pillows+sheets were comfortable, the Wi-Fi was top notch, the shower had plenty of hot water, and everything worked as it should. Heather was a great host and always responsive. As noted in other reviews, the main entrance is down a short semi-paved driveway, alleyway, which could probably be easy to miss at night if it was your first time there. Overall I thought it was a great value and if I'm in Eureka again I'm going to see if it's available."

The neighbors across the alley have several security lights and the curtains let some of this light through, so bring a sleep mask if you need total darkness to sleep."

However it is not wheel chair accessible. I’m not sure if the other spots are on the farm are. Lovely stay. Lifted our spirits high!

It was cozy, quiet, private, close to town, close to the Redwoods National Park, and the animals were all so friendly! The hosts went above & beyond to make our stay memorable. We ""highly"" recommend this place!"

Stayed one night","My husband and I just stayed here for one night of our California road trip honeymoon, and let me tell you, I wish we were able to stay the entire trip here! We are very introverted/private people, so the simple and contact-free check-in was super convenient. We also received ample instructions from booking to check-in and out, so we always knew what to expect and never had any issues getting in and out. It was so peaceful and private and we wished we would have had longer to spend here.
I came across the Airbnb listing a few years ago when it went ""viral"" and I saved the screenshot, knowing I wanted to visit one day. Now that it has happened, we were even more impressed than we anticipated. I can't rate highly enough!"

Stayed a few nights","Peaceful and unique airbnb to stay at if you are in the Eureka area. You definitely need a car to get around but that was no problem for us because we rented a car to drive up to Redwood National and State Parks anyway (~1hr drive north). The surrounding land for this airbnb was very pleasant and it was nice to see the goats and dogs and cat =) Even though the studio is on a property shared with other inhabitants (another airbnb and the hosts' residence), it still felt like we had a private space and didn't have to worry about being ""bothered"" by anyone else there. I wish we were able to get a tour but we had plenty to do in Eureka and up at the redwood forests, and otherwise we just spent the time relaxing in the outdoor chairs or watching TV in the studio. The town of Eureka is a 10-15min drive away but there were lots of restaurants and grocery stores in there, which was convenient. Definitely would recommend this spot as a home-base if you are going to be in Northern California!"

The piece de resistance was the private stocktank tub & fireplace. The PERRRRFECT way to unwind after a 10 hour drive: the warm water, a crackling fire and some goooood weed = HEAVEN!!!

The outdoor tub was fun to use as well, and very relaxing. We also got welcomed by Rat the cat every time we came back at the end of the day. He was very sweet and cute.

The check-in instructions were extremely clear and easy to follow. I was helpfully accommodated on a farm tour the morning of my arrival day but long before check-in, which was great help. The tour was very informative and Emilio quite a character!
When I did check in the place was clean, the welcome gifts much appreciated and of great quality, the bed was comfortable and the decor and literature around the cabin fascinating.
I would not hesitate to return, preferably with my family.
Please support these invaluable local farmers' businesses!"

Stayed about a week","The house is very suitable for a short stay.
The path, from the parking to the cabin, is really a bit too long and completely unlit at night.
It leads in the middle of a sloping slope, with a meadow. Is not well solved, neither to transport the luggage, nor to come back to the cabin at night, accident-free. The outdoor lighting in the cabin is also too dark. You can't see enough or sit outside. It's just too dark. The other buildings on the farm have significantly better outdoor lighting and safe paths.
Unfortunately, there were no animals on site, the enclosures were empty and abandoned.
The hosts are very kind and you can always find a point of contact. Overall nice, for a weekend."

It’d be easy to spend a couple days just chilling here if you bring in your groceries, or use this as a base to visit Eureka or for day trips around the region. I briefly met the host, but this is still a farm so there’s always work to be done. The tour is nice too, really neat to learn a bit about the region and this farm’s operation. It may be one of the more unique stays I’ve had given the setting, but the hospitality is all here. Don’t miss it!"

Definitely check out Karobi stables for horseback riding! And the soaking tub is a real pleasure morning and night!

Stayed a few nights",We had such a wonderful weekend in the Studio! We had everything we needed and more (thanks to some complimentary cannabis samples). We appreciated being in such a scenic location within a short driving distance to/from both Eureka and Arcata. The 3 Corners Market just down the road came in handy (we picked up some locally made ravioli for dinner from there one night). I’d definitely recommend making use of the outdoor tub! It’s awesome at sunset! We hope to be back!

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay here! Stoners dream for sure, they give you a ton of samples and you’re really in the middle of the weed farm. Hosts were super responsive and sweet, and everything was extremely clean! I felt very comfortable smoking out of the pieces there and they also provide you with rolling papers. I prefer firmer beds so had a bit of a hard time with my back on the bed provided especially after a weekend of hiking, but my little sister loved the bed so could just be me lol. The patio areas also directly face the open space of the other units but we didn’t mind at all. Will definitely stay here again next time we’re up north :) thank you!"

The studio and the farm itself was beautiful to say the least. We used it as a homebase for exploring Redwood National Park. The samples were a great added bonus as well. Only thing we wish is we would have had time for the full tour. I reccomend this place to anyone staying in the area who is looking for a tranquil and relaxing setting with the added bonus of a working farm. Loved it all! Please do yourself a favor and book this place or one of their other 3 locations on the same farm. Till next time! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",A beautiful place to stay in a very central location in the emerald triangle. Michalea & Jonathan were excellent hosts and the company of Rat the Cat and Greta the Goat as well as her chicken roomates gave us the exact expirience we were hoping for out of staying on a farm. We went before grow season had started but Jonathan was so kind in accommodating a tour of the farm for us anyway and it was a great tour he was happy to answer all of our questions and let us take pictures it was everything! The trek from the car the actual studio was our least favourite part but it was worth it to get to see Greta the goat each time we walked by.

Finding the location was a bit tricky in the dark with the one way streets, but shouldn’t be an issue during the day. There were some restaurants within a 15 min walk but with how dark the neighboring streets were it was better to drive. Andrew was friendly and proactive in his communication.

It’s exactly as it appears in photos, spotlessly clean, and comfortable, with a well equipped kitchen, spacious shower, plenty of thick high-quality towels, and an excellent bed. Andrew has provided additional thoughtful touches like toothbrushes and toothpaste for those who might have forgotten theirs and a fleece throw for relaxing on the sofa. The property is in a quiet residential neighborhood that’s about a 15-minute walk from the Old Town district packed with restaurants and stores, and in general, we found we could get wherever we were going in Eureka within a few minutes drive time. Communication was great; Andrew is very friendly, responded promptly to inquiries and offered his help if needed on a few occasions. We would not hesitate to stay with him again if we return to the North Coast area in the future"

We really enjoyed our stay, thanks Andrew!"

home- he had coffee pods, cream and sugar. Plenty of pods for the washer . If you forgot your toothbrush and paste he had it for you! It was and is a great place for two people to stay! Andrew was also very responsive to his guests needs. We have family there so didn’t need much from him, but he was there to offer places to see and eat, etc. Will stay there again!!"

I will absolutely stay again if I have the opportunity and definitely recommend it!!"

Andrew went above and beyond by providing thoughtful extras such as zip lock bags, laundry pods, a loofah, and a range of toiletries, including a toothbrush, toothpaste, and Q-tips. I also slept great during my stay, as the bed was comfortable and provided a peaceful night's rest.

Was in a not busy area and felt safe! The place had a lot of natural light along with bright lights in the unit as well. The AC units worked great, the bed was comfortable, everything was really perfect. Can’t wait to be a returning guest.
The only con for the place was that you couldn’t open a window for a breeze in the living room. Only the bedroom and shower window opened."

There when you climb the suspended bridges, you realize the mighty height of the Redwoods. Not far from Heather's house. We enjoyed the place every day during our 4 days trip. Located between Humboldt Redwoods Park and Redwoods State and National Park. We also visited some fabulous farms in the area for eggs and fresh milk. We liked Blue Blossom farm. At night we enjoyed our sleep. The area is quiet and the neighbors respectful."

The kitchen is also well-stocked. On colder days, the newer central heating is efficient & quiet. There are plenty of towels, in each bathroom. There are also board games & cards, for adults & kids. The backyard is fenced in & there is a small deck, with outdoor seating & a grill. This is a great house, for a family with children or a group of friends or for business travelers. The house is close to Hwy 101, if you are driving North or South, to explore the Redwoods or just visiting the general area. The neighborhood felt safe, & there is also plenty of shopping nearby. Most importantly, the host is very kind & proactive, to ensure your stay is relaxing & enjoyable."

It was in a nice quiet neighborhood with other nice houses around it. I highly recommend staying there it checked all the boxes.

Stayed with kids","This was our first time staying at an Airbnb. We really had no idea what to expect.
Turns out everything was great. All communication was done via e-mail. Our host was always responsive and very accommodating. We had a last-minute change which she handled perfectly.
When we arrived, the place looked brand new. The house was definitely just remodeled and was very inviting. The key was in a lock box just like was described. Once we walked in the front door, we noticed everything was brand new. All new flooring, doors, windows, moldings, fresh paint, cabinets, furniture, and appliances. The bathrooms were also remodeled and spotless! Everything we needed was supplied. The kitchen was stocked with silverware, pots, pans, mixing bowels utensils. All of it. We needed nothing! There were plenty of towels and toiletries in the bathrooms. They also have two washers and two dryers.
To sum our stay up, everything was great! Based on this experience, we will definitely try and Airbnb again!"

It's a great place to come home to at the end of the day. The home is warm, newly renovated, and very clean. We even picked up some of the decor that we liked. We had everything we needed including two sets of washers/dryers to wash all our clothes before we came home. There was plenty of space and it felt like we were at home. Heather was great communicating and everything went really smooth. We would definitely come back. We even got a visit from one of the neighbors who gave us some good pointers on things to do and visit on our drive home."

There was wine, water, food, snacks - even gluten & lactose free options. She provided a guide for attractions in the surrounding areas and travel time. This in centrally located to a LOT.
The furnishings, decorations and personal touches were fantastic. I loved the bed, especially the sheets. I had to check the label to see where she bought them. I bought a set before I came home.
I'd love to come back with my daughters, son or a friend.
I highly recommend this AIRBNB.

First off, Kristine greeted us when we arrived and gave us some additional tips for 'must sees' in the area. There were many nice touches in the suite, starting with it smelled good! The space is well laid out with the lounging space with a view of the back yard and trees, the well stocked kitchen and large bedroom and bathroom. The bed was comfortable with nice bedding. There were candles, throw blankets, food essentials and snacks, and books and games. The Forest Suite was so cozy! We had morning coffee on the deck, soaking in the country-like neighborhood. I would 100% come back to stay and 100% recommend this place to family, friends, and basically anyone visiting the Eureka/Arcata area. It would be an excellent option for visiting parents of Cal Poly Humboldt students or anyone staying for a little bit in the area. Thank you for creating this amazing space."

The place was magic. It was detail on top of detail. 💫
There was a wonderful surprise in every corner of the apartment you looked. 💖
There was wine, high quality organic food and a deer who came visit daily. 🦌
I meditated daily in the redwoods on the property. 🧘🏾‍♀️
It was a rebirth. 🧚🏾‍♀️
I felt, loved, cared for safe and secure.
These are excellent examples of human beings and I am grateful our paths crossed. 🦄

Kristine went above and beyond to be accommodating to my ever changing schedule- allowing me to cancel and rebook with a days notice. In addition to the outdoor beauty- the home was wonderfully equipped, clean and cozy with the best provided snacks!! When we overcooked our dinner after a full day of driving, we were so grateful to find a box of pasta and sauce provided for us that saved us another trip to the store. Kristine even left us a bottle of wine, and allowed us the pleasure of picking our own apples and blueberries in the backyard…YUM! I have stayed in several air bnbs and this was by far my best experience. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this to everyone. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you Kristine!!"

Sitting on the porch every morning to start the day with a tall drink of nature really sets the mood for the many redwood trails we would hike later in the day. The home has everything you need in the kitchen, bed and bath, definitely a home away from home. Amy was very quick to respond with answers to my questions and we never actually saw a neighbor, so very also very private. There was a mixup with our rental car, so the first day we spent on foot and there was a little grocery within walking distance and the next day we walked to town for breakfast at a local bagel shop and then to the car rental place. Great weather for walking and anything else you might want to do. Loved it and would absolutely stay again! Highly recommend."

Amy’s house is so comfortable and clean……with a well stocked kitchen and her beautiful artwork on the walls made this stay absolutely wonderful.
Highly recommend to anyone visiting this area."

Stayed a few nights","This house is perfect in both location and vibe. The beds are so comfy and soft, and the back room with the view into the forest is beautiful. The only thing I would say is that the bathrooms really reverberate sound, so perhaps not the best for a new shy couple ;)
The location was amazing, 5min from Sequoia Park (which is an actual park with a playground) where my mom and I spent the day taking photos. The house is very close to the freeway if you want to (duh!) drive into the Redwoods, and the stove is great to cook on."

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely home! We thoroughly enjoyed our four-day stay. We would have our morning coffee in the tree room looking at the redwoods, make breakfast in the well-stocked kitchen, and spend the days exploring the redwoods north and south. Eureka’s central location was perfect for that. We also were able to easily get groceries at Safeway to cook dinners to enjoy in the house, and eat out at Brick & Fire the night we didn’t cook. The living room was comfortable and well set-up for evening movies. And the beds were comfortable and having two bathrooms was very convenient.
Any travelers this summer should read up on the Last Chance Grade construction project between Klamath and Crescent City and plan travel accordingly. We avoided the area as much as possible because it takes a long time to get through even during the “open” hours.
The host’s communication and directions were excellent. A true gem."

Lots of closet space. There's also a kitchen/breakfast room, a full living room, and an additional ""tree room"" with wrap-around windows and views into the redwoods. Our family of three had more space than we needed for the week. The location is quiet and private, with beautiful forest views. We spent most of our time around the kitchen table, or doing ""family art time"" in the ""tree room"". Communication was completely smooth. Thank you Amy for such a great stay!"

You feel like you’re out in the middle of the woods, yet you’re still very close to town and all those amenities. It was great snuggling up in the window seat with a cup of tea and just enjoying the view. Only negative aspect was that one of the bathrooms appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned (some debris in the sink, etc.), but the other bathroom and the rest of the house was spotless, so we just stuck to the other bathroom to be safe."

Cons- the heater is really, really loud in the master bedroom and it kicks on several times so the first two nights we were there I got hardly any sleep.

Every evening we spent hours on the peaceful back patio enjoying a glass of wine & nibbling on local charcuterie we bought during our sightseeing trips. Amy’s house is tastefully decorated, minimalistic & cozy. Amy’s artwork hangs on the walls & it’s beautiful.
As a testament to the homeowner ~ we had an unfortunate and unforeseen situation that popped up a few days before we were to arrive. Amy was amazing working with us, she was understanding of our situation and was quick & professional in communication with us. We absolutely loved our stay & would highly recommend staying here!!

The rooms are well furnished and your artwork is amazing; going perfectly with the beautiful setting of redwoods and forest. The neighborhood is quite and peaceful.

These accommodations are top-notch. Everything is thoughtfully decorated, and the entire space is as tidy as it comes. I’ve stayed in Airbnbs all over and this one was my favorite—hands down.
There are cute shops downstairs and restaurants within blocks. The bay is a few hundred yards away. Redwood National Park (the reason for our visit to Eureka) wasn’t too far of a drive.
Sarah was an incredibly friendly and responsive host—even providing us with some impromptu recommendations for seeing tide pools in the area.
I assure you, reader, that if you book your stay at Sarah’s penthouse, you will not be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Another amazing Penthouse experience. I’m making a bold statement…but it’s truth you AirB&B all stars. I want it to remain affordable and available to me so I would prefer to keep a secret but this is the coolest, most historic, walkable, AirBnB on the Westcoast. It’s a three minute walk to the ocean, two minutes to an ice cream parlor, and everything imaginable in between is at your doorstep. If you were trying to become Yelp Elite you could knock it out on a weekend trip to this historic penthouse. If a sale sign went up I’d be there! I’ll be back again next year! - Chris
Thank you again Sarah another really enjoyable experience. Thanks for being kind and responsive. Hope to return next year :) - Emily"

Sarah was incredibly responsive and very helpful with everything we needed to check-in. If you want a fantastic dinner, check out Tavern 1888 just a few blocks down 2nd street. The food was fantastic and Mr. Ben behind the bar made amazing cocktails. We will book the Penthouse anytime we are in the area and it's available. Thank you for everything, Sarah!"

I wish I had such an eye for decorating my own home! Location is super central, and we happened to be there on a Friday in the summer during the street market. Had a great time finding food for dinner and so nice to be able to pop right back up to the place which was central to it all. This place made our trip. Sarah was so responsive and welcoming. She even left us snacks & drinks. Access to laundry facilities (soap provided!) was a plus. Nice shampoos, hair dryer, everything you need to be comfortable. Highly recommend this beautiful unique spot!"

The large and spacious rooms that are beautifully decorated and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped with large frig, cupboard space and appliances. The beds were really comfy and pillows plentiful. Sarah provided so much information in her house manual - list of restaurants by type, a listing and description of the historic buildings in the area, entertainment and many brochures for tourist sites. Sarah provided so many thoughtful additions - toiletries, paper products, even first aid supplies and analgesics!! We appreciated that laundry facilities including all needed products. Any requests we made were met promptly. We could not have been more pleased with the penthouse and our hostess. We only hope that when we visit Eureka again this space will be available to us. Thank you for the personalized touches - the wine and snacks."

Stayed a few nights","The Penthouse was perfect for us. It is located within eyesight of the water front, across from a small park, in the heart of the restored historic section of Eureka, and is within walking distance of quaint shops and nice restaurants. All our meals at local establishments were very good served by friendly, welcoming staff. Eureka is also centrally located for those who, like us, want to hike through and explore the Redwood forests. An added bonus was the local skywalk in Sequoia Zoo and a walking ghost tour that shared Eureka history in a fun way. We always felt safe wherever we went. The unit itself was clean and well appointed, quite ample in size, with a historic theme as Sarah created the space by renovating the top floor of one of Eureka’s historic buildings. The renovation is a blend of the old and new. Access was easy with a convenient elevator. Sarah was always friendly, knowledgeable, quick to respond, and is clearly fastidious and organized. Perfect."

Stayed a few nights","Ideally located in the heart of Victorian Old Town with unobstructed views of Woodley Island, The Penthouse is the iconic place to stay when in Eureka. The Penthouse occupies the entire 4th floor of a historic 1884 building and is on the National Register of Historic Places. This historic beauty is on full display in The Penthouse with exquisitely preserved wood floors, doors, ceiling beams and brick. It is spacious with luxe accommodations throughout. True to its online description. Huge windows provide direct views of the bay. We enjoyed watching daily activity of commercial fishing boats, crew boats, and a variety of shore birds. We appreciated being in the Old Town core with walking ease to all it has to offer. Sarah is a proactive, highly responsive and gracious host. She made us feel prepared, welcome and pampered in every way. The Penthouse is an extraordinary gem and will be the ONLY place for us to stay when visiting the Redwood coast!"

It is extremely clean, has comfy beds, lovely linens, soft pillows, nice furnishings, tastefully decorated, quiet, fully stocked with a necessities and all around perfect.
Sarah is the sweetest, most thoughtful, kind and considerate host I have ever had. She communicated every step of the way. At one point the power went out in the whole town and she made sure to check in on us to make sure we were okay.
The town was very cute has good bars, restaurants and shops.

Sarah was very responsive and accommodating. When we had an issue with the shower, she came up right away and was able to solve it.
We were surprised by the unusual request to strip beds and wash linens before our departure, since we already payed $125 for cleaning. We are hosting an apartment in a big city, but would not think to ask our guests to launder linens. Other than that, our stay was really lovely."

The Humboldt Penthouse is of elite level grandeur. As sailing ships come to port you can be there overlooking their entry into harbor. A quick walk with a loved one in any direction you will find great food and/or that sweet treat you’ve been craving.
After staying in Air B&Bs from coast to coast this Penthouse is one of my favorites. Beautifully decorated to inspire the timeframe of this historic building you will find yourself yearning for extra nights here. Don’t miss this stay, it’s historic.

The building was charming and we loved the detail and decor Sarah put into the Penthouse. When we walked into the flat, it immediately felt intimate and inviting. We enjoyed the view of the waterfront. When we had questions, Sarah responded promptly and was helpful. It all added up to a great stay in Eureka."

Stayed with kids","We had such an incredible stay! I am still so lucky this place was available because it was a GEM. The historical building was super cool, we could not have been in a better location (seriously) and we enjoyed every little charm of this home. 4th floor. Swanky elevator. Laundry steps from the Penthouse door. Tuesday, we stepped out of the building right into the Farmers Market. Gazebo fountains across the street. Coffee shops, ice cream, gifts and fun shops surround the building - so easy to walk around with our 3 year old. Designated parking spot made it easy to come and go as we ventured out. Would highly recommend this place!!!"

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our week staying at the Penthouse. The ocean breeze kept the whole place comfortable the entire time and the unit was clean and comfortable and very well provisioned. We walked around Eureka, shopped at the farmer's market and dined all around the area (Oberon steak house was a favorite).
The evenings were peaceful and Eureka worked great for a hub for us to explore the Redwoods spending days north in Arcata and surrounding and driving south to Miranda the travel the Avenue of the Giants and visit Fernwood. Our entire trip was relaxing and enjoyable."

Stayed a few nights",This is a beautiful apartment with high ceilings and lots of space. It's on the top floor of a historic building. It's been fully renovated so it has modern amenities but still has all the charm of its history with exposed brick everywhere even in the shower. The couch is a big sectional that is great for lounging. It's right in the middle of the historic downtown area so there's plenty to walk to. Overall a wonderful stay!

Stayed with kids","The Penthouse was even more wonderful
than the pictures appeared. Sarah was
incredibly hospitable and the space was
immaculate. My family and I thoroughly
enjoyed coming back after some long
hikes, knowing that we'd have a
comfortable home waiting for us with
great beds, a fully-stocked kitchen, the
best living room couch ever, and washer/
dryer to take care of our hiking clothes. I
cannot recommend The Penthouse more
highly."

Stayed about a week","The penthouse is perfectly located in downtown Eureka, close to shopping and great restaurants. The view of the bay is just about unbeatable. We found it very easy to get down to the bay and the marsh for birdwatching and to hop on the highway to go north or south to see the sights - botanical gardens, redwoods, Woodly Island docks for fresh crab, farmer's market, etc. The unit was perfectly stocked - both kitchen and bathroom - with nice touches throughout. The upper floor location enables the great view and my husband and I took the stairs while my 82 year old mother-in-law used the neat old elevator. What a fantastic find, we loved it!"

The place was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed (towels, pots/pans, nice kitchenware, even spices and sugar!). It was super quiet at night and was a great base for exploring the redwoods and the coast. The in-building laundry was a big help. We enjoyed getting to know the town as well!"

Stayed one night","Best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at! The location is perfect with restaurants across the street, a cute little town on the corner you can shop at & an dock at the end of the block.
Parking & checking in was a breeze. There was an elevator to get to the penthouse. The communication with the host was also stellar. They went above & beyond to provide everything we needed.
Once we got inside, we were so wow’ed by the tall ceilings, decor & warm wood floors. Beautifully furnished & incredibly clean!
I recommend this stay & urge you to book this oasis if it’s still available! Cheers!"

Stayed a few nights","Hands down the most memorable Air Bnb I’ve stayed at so far. Parking and access to the penthouse was well explained, making it a breeze to find and enter.
We arrived later in the night and upon entering the space, we were welcomed in by a lit (electric) fireplace, ambiance lighting throughout the apartment, a bottle of red wine and locally sourced chocolates. The apartment reflects and compliments the town’s unique history so naturally. The attention to detail in the design and in the little house warming favors the hosts provided we’re thoughtful and delicious; making this experience feel unique and personalized.
I highly recommend visiting the town of Eureka, and it’s surrounding neighbors Arcata and Trinidad. Especially if you love the outdoors, live music, art, great food, good people, and of course you MUST stay at this Air BnB!
10/10 will absolutely be returning!"

Stayed a few nights","Sarah & Tim’s penthouse is one of kind and so charming. They really put their heart and soul into making it comfortable and welcoming for their guests. We stayed for 3 nights and felt at home. The living space was warm thanks to the electric fireplace, and very spacious. Lots of natural light and beautiful views of the bay during daytime. We really appreciated the attention to detail with all the decor too, everything was so tasteful. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked with all the essentials. The penthouse is located in a historic building which had cute shops on the ground floor. Very convenient location, super close to cafes, shops and restaurants in downtown. Parking and check-in was super easy. We really enjoyed our stay, and will definitely come again! I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Eureka."

The hosts were so sweet and even left some personalized birthday goodies for my mom. It was right in Old Town so it was nice and close to everything. You could easily go out but we stayed in mostly just to enjoy the space. I would recommend the Penthouse to anyone!
