Paris coffee right across the street great atmosphere and local business and they knew about the lofts. We had a great weekend here."

Stayed one night",We felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel in France! Beautiful accommodations! The bathroom is a real show-stopper! It was an amazing little weekend getaway with shops and restaurants and Paris Bakery within a short walking distance. Lovely! I might recommend dimmer lights in the main hallway as they shone around the cracks in the door and the transom window into the room and kept me awake. That seems like an easy fix though. Look forward to our next visit!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed the weekend in the efficiency loft and it was perfect for two! The lofts are easy to find, beautifully decorated, on the main square and within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. The large windows were wonderful and really opened up the space. Wally was incredibly responsive and very accommodating. While cleaning the day prior to our departure, we were able to get a peek at the one bedroom, which is definitely what we will book when traveling with my daughter. When next in Paris, 1st Street Lofts will be our location of choice!"

Stayed one night","The place is charming and very comfortable. Our only challenge was the water heater. Ended up in a cold shower. Owner was very responsive. The water heater breaker had tripped, so they reset it and we had hot water. Unfortunately, the hot water lasted all of 5 minutes, which led to another cold shower. I could be staying in Paris 1 night per week for business for the next 2 months or so, so I called a week later to see if the water heater issue had been resolved. They said they had it looked at and no issue could be found. That's great, however not reassuring for a confirmed follow up stay. Not saying I won't, since this is the nicest place to stay in town and it is very well located (right in the town square). The price is a bit much though. $186 for my one night stay in this efficiency. But when I need to, I will pay for quality (vs. the option of many 2-star hotels in town, which I won't entertain). Overall, I would recommend this place."

Stayed about a week","I had a great time at the loft. It is a loft, so it’s not the largest place, but for being the only one in there it was the perfect size. The appliances and utilities were update and very nice. I had to stay for over a week, and Maryann and her team were extremely helpful and accommodating for the extended time. Anytime I had questions or requests I could message her and someone would respond within 30 minutes.
The loft was beautiful and in nearly the perfect spot. Parking could be a little tight sometimes, but there was never a time I couldn’t find somewhere nearby to park and get to the loft. You could walk most of downtown, and there were plenty of shops, coffee shops, and restaurants all within walking distance.
If you are visiting Paris I would highly recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","great space, cozy place. any and all complaints would be extremely minor and nitpicky.
in the spirit of full disclosure here we go. beds are thin spring mattresses, shower head is quite short (I'm 6'1""), there was existing damage to the kitchen light, countertop molding, several tiles, and the front door paint. The bedroom TV's were fairly low end and incorrectly set up for the Roku devices so it took some troubleshooting. The laundry instructions were not entirely clear and lastly, the snacks that were present were expired and stale.
now for the good! the owner was very friendly. the place was a contact free stay. it was incredibly clean, mostly basic but modern renovations. despite the tile floors, it was not very echoey thanks to the good rug placements. the seating in the living room is very cozy. overall it was a great fit for the three of us to stay in. there's also parking on the street where we were able to fit our truck and trailer while we parked the smaller truck out back."

The home is adorable, cozy and clean; and the host thought of all the little things- like snacks and extra towels. Parking was easy, entry was simple; and Rebecca made sure to follow-up with detailed instructions prior to our arrival. We were attending a wedding in Powderly and Paris was the closest town with accommodations—so I was thrilled to find a two bedroom home with a full kitchen and washer/dryer that cost the same as local two star hotels!
There isn’t much to do In Paris but the Local downtown area has a few up-and-coming eateries that we enjoyed. If you’ll be there for any reason, I would absolutely recommend Rebecca’s home."

The troubling experience was not only the false alarm, but a lady with her camera phone recording my family like we didn't belong in the area. Though I haven't lived in Paris in over 23 yrs, the micro-agression, and passive racism lives on.
Under better personal circumstances/ conditions we would have really enjoyed the place. Everything was beautifully decorated. I would recommend to others."

We are the most relaxed that we’ve been in a while and will most definitely be doing this again. We were able to walk to multiple restaurants and boutiques and also relax at the cigar & whiskey lounge. If you live here, or don’t, this is a great place to stay."

The loft is just around the corner from historic town center complete with a fountain and cute shops, a local grocery store, and restaurants. The host included suggestions of what was local and nearby! Paris is such a charming town with a lot of history and efforts to revitalize their town center! Our host and the people we encountered in Paris were kind, helpful and welcoming! Perfect spot to spend a weekend away from busy city life!

It's a truly gorgeous spot with high ceilings, tall windows, and great window dressings. The beds and pillows are comfortable (not too soft), and the communication with the hosts is always top-notch.

Keep in mind that you’ll be climbing stairs to reach the lofts—no elevator. I wouldn’t recommend for elders with hip and knee issues. Parking is on the street with no reserved spots. We were able to park right outside the entrance in the evening but found ourselves parking a block or so away during the day (we stayed over a holiday weekend so likely more people downtown.) This lovely host has put a lot of thought into the comfort of her guests. You are likely to be wowed.

Stayed with kids","This loft is absolutely STUNNING. I was amazed at the details of this loft. From the tile work to the appliances, you could tell Shelby took the time to make it perfect. The windows are so big which makes this loft feel huge. It was so roomy and cozy. The bathroom was my favorite part of the loft and my grandchildren loved it too. They loved walking in the huge showers and bathing in the big tub. The hospitality shown by Shelby was superb. The only thing I would suggest is a sleep machine or box fan since it’s downtown and right next to the road, it can be a little loud. But overall, that didn’t even keep me from sleeping bc the bed and pillows were so comfortable. This place is beautiful and I’ll definitely be staying here again while staying in Paris. ♥️"

The kids loves the furnishings- the colors, the art…
Ease of check in and out is better than most. We really appreciate not having to worry about losing keys. And Shelby doesn’t ask you to do all the cleaning upon check out (as many hosts do that still charge a cleaning fee).
There’s a desk, TVs in each room. Extra blankets and pillows. And a closet full of an assortment of luxurious robes. What a great touch to really help us feel like we are on vacation!
I did have to communicate with Shelby a few times and she was great."

We were traveling for the eclipse and she (unprompted) offered/ suggested that we have groceries delivered so that we wouldn’t have any issues and not only did she stay there and wait for them, she placed them in the kitchen properly and sent pictures to verify items. She also left a sweet little eclipse package for us to use while we were there. Our stay was great and Kristina was the main reason."

There are so many thoughtfully considered details, from the availability of both coffee and espresso machines to help start your morning, to the fully equipped kitchen with all the necessary utensils and cookware. The bathrooms were well-stocked with towels and soaps, and even the laundry room was ready with all essentials.
These small, thoughtful touches throughout the home significantly enhanced our daily comfort and convenience, reducing the need to purchase additional supplies.
This property stands out for its homey feel, enriched with practical amenities and a host's attention to detail. I highly recommend this Airbnb for a comfortable, well-equipped stay. This blend of comfort and convenience makes it an ideal choice."

So great that this building was converted to residential! A 2-car garage with one bedroom on the first floor directly off the garage, and the rest of the living quarters on the other side, mostly upstairs. Miles is very responsive, and our stay went without a hitch.
It's right downtown so you can walk to everything, and the Trail de Paris is a pleasant few minutes' bike ride away. Despite its central location, the area is generally very quiet, which is nice. Downtown Paris is pretty, and has everything you need for a nice long weekend: great coffee shop, bakery, restaurants, museums, ice cream, lovely old buildings, and a few fun shops."

Stayed with kids","We chose this place even though it was out of our budget because it was so convenient for the event we were attending just a block away! When arriving to the home we learned the air conditioning was not working in the upstairs bedroom and it was hot! We called Miles right away and he returned our call soon after and had someone there to remedy the situation within a couple hours while we stepped out for dinner and they had it fixed within an hour of arriving! After we got unpacked and situated I did realize there were a few things not really clean, like the left over toilet paper was dirty and black gloves left in the bathroom and a few other things here and there. I think this is a fairly new rental so I believe there is plenty of room for improvement and we will certainly be booking a stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","PROS: The cabin is clean, quaint, and quiet. The upstairs is very welcoming and the bed is comfortable.
CONS: Living area is small-we had to move some things around to sit at the high-top table and maneuver around more easily. I was disappointed that the gas fireplace is not available, but instead an electric heater. There are hanging lights that you may hit your head on when getting out of bed. The ceiling fan upstairs needs service - when on low, it makes a loud grinding noise and the fan is out of balance in general. For males who stand to urinate, you may have to duck your head; the stairs are above you and headspace is limited. The shower/hot water are very sensitive (it is noted that hot water is on an 'as needed' basis). The copper line that brings the water down in the shower gets very hot to the touch. Both the kitchen sink and bathroom sink are rusted (creative cabin decor, but feels dirty). The bathroom sink handle has severe lime build-up. Cooking options are slim."

The one thing that was a little concerning was one of our guests getting bit by a yellow jacket, but that’s part of the experience of being in the woods ! The host did say they will take care of that so the yellow jackets don’t find there way inside the cabin !"

Stayed a few nights","This is a really great place to stay. It is close enough to the city that you can easily go to town for whatever your needs are, but you’re a few miles in the country so it is quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. The cabin is cute and cozy. We really enjoyed sitting on the upstairs deck watching the stars while the heater kept us warm. Don’t miss out on the cows, pigs, and goats! They were a lot of fun to watch and feed as well. We highly recommend this getaway spot!"

The hot water in the shower will give you a disco strobe light effect if used. It made my husband laugh.
The pigs are also hilarious, just be mindful when wearing open toe shoes 😂
They will try to eat them
& tiny little hands, even though our 4yo smelt like French fries
…so who could blame them for wanting them as a snack
Host is super responsive & very helpful!

Ended up being great to check out from the internet and engage with each other through board games. It was pouring rain, so I hate that we didn't get to use the patio areas more, but we will just have to come back! Loved seeing all of the animals around the property.

Stayed with a pet","10/10 would recommend! My husband and I had a family reunion near Paris and opted to stay at the cabin instead of a hotel for the weekend. We’re so glad we did! What a comfortable, cozy, and relaxing place to stay! Stacy was great with communication and check in/out was easy. You’re surrounded by trees, and it was so quiet. My favorite part was sitting on the upstairs balcony with our coffee and watching the hummingbirds in the mornings! Plus, the cabin inside is lovely. They have everything I could think you’d need for cooking (hot plate and toaster oven, which do the job!). We hope to come back for another stay and spend some time at the Caddo grasslands. Thank you for a wonderful weekend at this cabin!"

Stacy, co-owner/manager of the ranch, was amicable and available.
The cabin felt secluded and I look forward to a return visit in the early Winter, in order to enjoy the outdoor fire pit(s), bbq, and indoor fireplace."

The location was great and there was plenty of space for everyone to visit comfortably. The modern updates were impressive but keep in mind it’s still a very old building (ie: some rooms were drafty, some rooms smelled musty occasionally). Having a private gym to ourselves was certainly the highlight (even though I lost a game of Horse to my father-in-law). The gym and apartment were well stocked, the beds and pull-out sofas were all very comfortable, and communication was great. The hosts were kind and responsive when we had a minor plumbing issue and a few questions during our stay."

We never left the property during our stay, so complete was the furnishings & accessories."

Stayed a few nights","A lonely cabin in the woods, nobody around, pristine surroundings, quiet. Three (3) beautiful nights and foggy mornings...
Photos cannot do the cabin justice, it is so well put-together (the space is larger than the photos portray).
Every little detail put into creating this space makes this, certainly, the most thoughtful AirBnB accommodations I've ever experienced...and it's a whole lot of ""thought"" that went into it. ""The GREATEST bathtub EVAH!""
My thanx to hosts for all considerations. Their pride beams forth."

Stayed a few nights","After a difficult several months, my spouse and I needed a quick getaway. I was looking for something in the country, peaceful and quiet, and that's what we got. The cottage was cute, well-decorated, and clean; the bed was comfortable and firm; and the location was just what I was looking for. I had zero problems with the reservation or the check-in/check-out--flawless. One thing I didn't allow for was a winter storm that came through on our second night. Temperatures plummeted and I feared that we would be cold, but the cottage was well-built and we both stayed warm and as snug as bugs. I fully recommend Kenneth's place to anyone needing a quiet country getaway, and I hope we can schedule a weekend there again."

We felt at home and didn’t want to leave! Kenneth and Kelly were kind enough to take us around and give us a tour of their property. We saw deer and got to watch, stand with, and pet the cows while they got fed. We very much enjoyed watching the fish come up to the surface to nibble on the fish food we threw into the pond. Mornings on the porch were relaxing and divine and we saw several deer grazing in the near distance. Downtown Paris is only about a 20min drive away with some yummy places to eat and cute shops. Kenneth and Kelly were incredible. Super sweet couple, enjoyable to chat with, and very warm and inviting. We LOVED our visit here!!!"

The property is quiet and provides the stillness of nature and wildlife to soothe the soul. We made a friend with the donkey in the paddock across the street. He was sweet and friendly. Our first night afforded the eerie call of the coyote along with deer sightings the following evening. I identified nine aviary species while enjoying a cup of coffee on the side porch one morning.
This will be a standard favorite of ours for future extended and short-term home-away-from-home."

But not too far from Paris for easy shopping and dining. The king bed was extremely comfortable and, coupled with the quiet surroundings, made for a perfect night's sleep. Excellent Keurig coffees and snacks of all varieties were much appreciated to take the edge off after a long drive. We wish our stay could have been longer to better enjoy the expansive property. This is exactly what Airbnb's were intended to be, and not some profit-driven corporate-owned non-caring entity. Many kudos to the hosts."

Group trip","The house was nice, but we did almost trip a few times, because of the edge of the flooring that was sticking up in places. The main thing I didnt like was not being able to park in the driveway. The house being on a corner, we also had to be away from the sidewalk that goes up to the house. It made you have to walk thru the grass to carry all your things to get to the sidewalk that went to the front door. We had to park far enough behind the mailbox (to not block it), and not park in front of the mailbox, it would put us to close to the stop sign, with the house being a corner house. We did not like the idea of being on the side street either. Again making you have to walk thru the grass to carry all your things to the door. Other then that the house was nice and comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","We were on a girls trip to see the total eclipse. The house location was perfect. A 2 mile walk via the NorthEast Texas Trail to the Eiffel Tower/Love Civic Center. We went to a free outdoor concert the evening before and walked home after dark. We felt completely safe (you do need a headlamp/flashlight). Paris is such a nice small town. Friendly people - the restaurants are good and the prices are even better! We went to the Paris Bakery, Jaxx Burgers and Casa Del Mare Italian Restaurant. We would highly recommend all three. Fun shopping in the historic downtown area.
The house itself was very clean and comfortable. We had plenty of room. If we had wanted to cook instead of eating out, the kitchen was well equipped. I would definitely stay here again!"

They made us feel right at home and very welcomed. They even provided us with water bottles in the fridge. We went walking through the town and there were several little boutiques to shop at. Everyone was so friendly and really helped turn our weekend of sorrow into joy. Very grateful to have found this gem!

The property is spacious- both the living quarters and the land all around. Especially great for an extended stay if you have reason to be in the Paris area for a period of time. The girls (cows) are certainly friendly and make for great friends. The path in the woods is a definite perk for running the dogs! We will be back! ;)

If you like off the beaten path, quiet and peaceful with high end amenities, you'll love this place. The bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing.
It's a little bit of a windy road to get there which for us added to the appeal. Once you get there you will not want to leave, so my recommendation is grab a bottle of wine and some groceries so you can 100% enjoy this slice of paradise.
My only regret is that we were just passing through and only had 1 night to stay. I could easily have stayed a week or more."

One of the best Airbb we have ever stayed in.
Me and my wife were passing through the area on a road trip out west, this place was very dialed in. We stayed in the red building
if you have kids: the property has a paved drive and a huge yard and even a massive indoor covered area for kids to ride bikes and play in. There is also a fishing pond and fire pit.
Yard is fenced so you can sit out and watch the cows and donkey do their thing on a cool patio with a ceiling fan and good furniture.
The house itself is very comfortable and practical. This is not a commercial rental, this is their pride and joy.
Very quite, pics legit.
If you don’t have kids : it’s even better.
No neighbors in your face. Their second small Airbb house aprx 100 yards plus away. Never saw or heard them. Place legit.
Bring food and libations and you’re good to go.
Idk anything about the town. Tower is funny small."

The place itself was very clean and welcoming. The breathtaking view is incredible and definitely a plus. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a weekend getaway with a spouse, friends, or family. It really can be a great place to stay no matter what the reason. It is family friendly, but also a great place for a romantic night away. Thank you Kenneth for sharing your wonderful place with us."

Him and his wife have a very nice ranch and are very nice people who actually live in the area (unlike some airbnb hosts)… they’re property is very well prepared with everything you will need and very organized and clean. They even have a real tv with real local channels so you can get the local news. Close enough to the beautiful town of Paris to go out and eat and shop but far enough from town to have a peaceful, quiet, relaxing stay and see ALL the stars in the sky. This property is one of the best, if not, the best airbnb I have stayed at. Oh and I got the best nights sleep I’ve ever gotten in the bed and don’t forget the whirlpool tub what a plus! 5 stars isn’t enough for Kenneth’s place this place deserves all the stars in the sky!"

We fed the cows, went fishing, and explored the woods in property. The girls favorite part was feeding the cows. We did that several times. It was also very peaceful there so we just relaxed on the patio. The house is beautiful inside and had everything listed on the posting. The kids toys and play area was a nice perk, especially if weather is bad. We had perfect weather. Kenneth was very responsive and even came by and answered all our questions about the cows. We would definitely stay here again and have already had several friends say they want to go for a stay. The best part was how close it was to home (North Dallas). Only a 1.5 hour drive. Can’t beat that. Overall, fun weekend get away."

When I say everything was great, I mean talking with the cows at the back fence while enjoying my morning cup of coffee, feeding the fish in the pond and seeing a handful or 2 catfish come up to eat the food provided, letting my kids play in the playroom/shop while I cooked dinner, and watching the birds during the early hours through the big windows in the living room! Everything was exactly what we were looking for in a quiet weekend getaway. I almost forgot the oversized master bathtub and ridiculously glamorous shower! So relaxing!"

We fished at the pond, took a long walk around their huge property, played basketball out on the driveway, enjoyed corn hole, made s’mores on the fire pit, and relaxed on the bench swings while watching the cows!
These hosts were amazing and had details everywhere that made our stay very special! The beds and pillows were all very comfortable! My boys were thrilled to find a large play area with toys, popcorn, hot chocolate with mini marshmallows, and tons of snacks! They also enjoyed taking bubble baths at night in the HUGE tub with a tv! My husband and I were surprised and happy to find the fire pit already perfectly set up with paper, twigs, and logs, along with a lighter, all we had to do was light it! These hosts were very responsive and amazing! If you’re looking for a relaxing get away, you’ll love this place!"

The property is so pretty and we loved walking around pond and visiting the cows. Even got a visit from some deer.
Unfortunately we had extreme weather the second day of our stay which cut power to the area and we had to cut our visit short
During the storms, Kenneth drove to the house to check on us and made sure we were safe and we had essentials to weather through the storm. He even offered to bring us food since we couldn't use the stove.
We highly recommend this place and
we plan to return very soon.

Stayed one night","These hosts put their heart and soul into building a great barn! It’s decorated with style.
We booked it because of the farm animal photos we saw on air b n b so the kids could see cows, and unfortunately the cows weren’t there. We were surrounded by a lot of lush green pastures, and were able to walk through the tall grass.
The hosts were very very very communicative. We saw them 3 times in the 12 hours we were at the barn! They left us candy which we ate. We are also seasoned hosts and take care of the properties we stay in. We have goats and cows and understand they have to be visible when guests expect it.
Overall we relaxed, played basketball 🏀 and enjoyed our time together! The bonus is that you can walk their acreage and we did. Call ahead to ask if you’ll see cows /animals if you’re looking for a farm experience."

Stayed a few nights",Fun and wonderful loft stay! Kelly and Kenneth were exceptional hosts. A few of us stayed for business and we celebrated a week's hard work with a bonfire and s'mores. We really enjoyed seeing the stars at night. Highly recommend the stay!

Stayed with kids","Great place. We wanted to be away from the city and this was perfect. The space is big enough for a family of 4. They had plenty of space to play, run and fish. Their grandkids are great! They helped my city boys catch some fish, played basketball, made s’mores and made great memories. We will definitely be back. Communication was great, place was clean, comfortable beds, the jetted tub was a big plus. Totally worth it."

Stayed a few nights","If you want a place to let your hair down, away from traffic and city lights, this is the place to come. With the kids or a couple friends, this place offers several amenities that will make lovely memories for years to come. And the owners are very nice, concerned people dedicated to making sure you have as nice a stay as possible.
Thank you Circle M!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful place on a quiet 65 acres that they let you explore all of! The living area was cute and functional and had everything we needed for our stay. There’s a pond that has catfish they let you feed and fish in, cows right by the house that you can pet, a basketball hoop, a treehouse, and more.
The hosts were more than kind and even went out of their way to help jump our car battery and found a way to get my kid a part for his paintball gun so that he could play with it and even let him shoot it out on their property.
I would highly recommend this place for a relaxing trip and especially for anyone looking to rent long term."
