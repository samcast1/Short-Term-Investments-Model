Group trip","We appreciated Jennifer's place so much the first time, we returned for our second stay! Great location. Easy and flexible check-in. I greatly appreciated the ample vanity spaces, plus 2 1/2 baths for ease of our family getting ready at the same time, and easy check out! Quiet neighborhood; clean; and just what we needed for our stay! We will definitely be returning in the future!"

Cool little things like the “Macomb-opoly” board game (Macomb has ties to creator of Monopoly) and leaving coupons for the Leathernecks game.
Definitely booking here for future trips to Forgottonia!"

A GREAT time was had by all. Conveniently located near the college. Noel is an absolute amazing host! He was quick to respond with any questions. Although we didn’t have many… everything is there! He was happy to see us enjoy his home. We will never stay anywhere else when visiting Macomb.

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely love this house! The vintage charm is a dream! For a one hundred and ten year old house, it has many stunning, original architectural features and is in great shape. Everything you need has been provided. Everything is super clean. We felt perfectly safe with the electronic locks on both doors.
The location is close to downtown and the university. It’s a beautiful, small town so necessities are close by. Restaurants are plentiful. Lots of history to check out. The area is very walkable.
Noel was super friendly and more than willing to accommodate. Kept in touch the whole week.
We would love to stay again when we return each year to visit family in the area. I’m sure my out of town family would love to stay in the house as well because I will highly recommend it to them."

Stayed one night","This place was very nice. Newly remodeled. The beds were some of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. I did appreciate that Kevin wanted to make sure that we got in without any problems too.
3 things that I think people should be aware of:
1. Right next to Amtrak. Like the place shakes when the train goes by.
2. Because it's right next to the Amtrak track, you hear them blow the horn at all hours.
3. There is a huge outdoor staircase to get into here. This didn't effect us, but it's not someplace I could stay with my parents due to their mobility issues.
Overall though, we had a great overnight stay for the son's college visit."

We definitely saved money by not needing 2 hotel rooms and a dog sitter. It’s so much better than a hotel having spaces to hang out and a yard for our dog. The home is beautiful and clean, the neighborhood is inviting and quiet, and sleeping was wonderful with cozy beds and a great temperature setting. We all had an amazing weekend and a big part of that was having a glorious place to stay.

Stayed a few nights","The house was exactly like the pictures -- no surprises. Everything was clean and neat. Beds and linens were comfy, the main bathroom is roomy with plenty of surface and storage space. Big closets with lots of hangers and shelves. Super soft and fluffy towels! The area is very quiet and the rooms are very dark with the shades and curtains on the windows -- we slept great and hardly heard any outside noises. I might have heard one loud truck the whole weekend. Kitchen has everything you need to cook some simple meals and a full-size refrigerator and freezer. It's too bad the weather was crummy the weekend we were there because there is a grill and a nice back deck in the big backyard we would have liked to use. Instead, we relaxed on the comfy couch in the big living room. We were able to park our car in the garage, which was nice for added security. I went running in the neighborhood, which is very quiet and peaceful with hardly any traffic. Also nice to have a washer and dryer to use."

Stayed with a pet",I have been coming to Macomb for many years and also lived there after college! I have never stayed at a better place and will definitely stay again! I had no issues and loved the place the deck and grill were also awesome . Carissa immediately responded if I had any questions. It was such a comfortable stay and so peaceful. I strongly recommend the Blue Pearl!

The location is a bit off the grid and a great place to unplug. WiFi was spotty. Did I mention everything is super clean, organized and tidy?!?!

Only concerns were that the gravel driveway doesn’t get cleared of snow. My husband went back to our hometown and got his F350, so we were alright through the storm, but might be a problem for other travelers. Also, some of the furniture desperately needs to be replaced. Otherwise, kitchen is well stocked, and there’s lots of room to work virtually, watch tv, just lounge around. It’s close to town and just a few minutes from the hospital."

When we were there it was pleasantly quiet and no one bothered us, but they were available if needed. The surrounding property was beautiful and the cattle grazing was a nice addition to the ambiance. The unit itself was super clean, comfortable, very spacious, and decorated with many personal items from the family's cattle business which we found interesting and a nice touch. Carrie was great at communicating and flexible with our check in time. We would absolutely stay there again if we go back to that area and highly recommend it to others!"

Super comfy king size bed, full kitchen, full bathroom, giant leather couch to relax on, beautiful rural area to explore with the convenience of Macomb only minutes away. So having no expectations coming in I can tell you that now I expect we'll be looking at the airbnb experience first for all future travel and if those travels were ever to bring us back to Macomb Carrie would be our first call and staying at The Loft our first choice.

This is a working farm and I loved being out in the 'country'. I get it, if you're looking for a place in the middle of town so you can walk to the cafe around the corner, this probably isn't the place for you. Although you can get anywhere in town in just a few minutes by car. If you like peace and quiet, however, along with beautiful rolling hills and pastures right outside your window, then this is definitely the place to visit. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Macomb on my next trip."

The home is in fantastic shape. Everything was super clean, well labeled, and very thoughtfully put together. The kitchen is probably the best I've seen in an Airbnb, with some top grade appliances. The street was super chill and we enjoyed relaxing on the front porch and deck.
If you're staying in Macomb for any reason you'll probably have a hard time finding a space any better than the one Melisa has put together."

This is a type of setup we would typically avoid (multiple guests on one property), but we were pleasantly surprised. The host, along with the other guests, all were very friendly without being intrusive. All common areas were very nice with plenty of room. The property and surroundings are beautifully maintained with lots of space to roam (the dog loved it). The room had everything we needed and more. Everything was clean, organized, and in working order. We will most certainly stay again if we're ever back in the area. A big thank you to Jennifer and her family for making our stay great after a rough start to our weekend."

Close to Wildcat Springs Park and Spring Lake Park. The place is tucked away on country roads but Jennifer gives clear instructions on how to get there.

The burn pit is perfect for sitting around, visiting, and cooking yummy foods. If you are looking for peace, quiet, beauty, and calm, this is where you need to go. Jen was attentive, sweet, and quick to respond. The only problem I had was wanting more homemade wine!! We will definitely be back. Thank You Jen!!!! 😊"

Enjoyed an early morning walk - very quiet except for the birds and saw a small herd of deer. It was definitely away from the hubbub of a city or even a small town. If you like the out of doors, you will love this place."

She greeted my son and I with a warm welcome which made us feel instantly at home and comfortable (especially since you are quite a ways out). The property is beautiful and there is so much to explore and take in...from the bird walk (which is more like a hike -and really beautiful), lake, & fire pit set up in the middle of the properties, to the delicious homemade wine & offerings in the fridge, super comfy bed, and beautiful landscape. We would definitely stay here again! Also, Nauvoo and Jacob’s geodes are a top recommendation for those staying here!"

My fiance and I both grew up in the country and have NEVER seen so many stars. There's a lovely nature walk that leads you right to the lake. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're considering staying here, just do it! You won't regret it. 😁"

There's not much to this place (read the description, it's very accurate), but everything you need, clean bathroom, plenty of towels, a comfortable and inviting bed, and a kitchenette. The wifi is slow, and there's only a small tv with a dvd player, so bring a book! My favorite part was my greeter Catnow the cat. He wandered over upon my arrival and at my leaving as well. Very friendly cat, he let me pet and hold him, purring away the whole time, and made me feel so welcome."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I visit Nauvoo/Carthage every year for the RLDS/LDS history, and as a retreat to get us away from the busyness of our lives. Jennifer’s property is an absolute HEAVEN. We found ourselves wanting to spend time at the studio immersing ourselves in the beauty of her land, and wanted to extend our stay longer. We typically have used hotels in Keokuk for our visits - NEVER AGAIN. This will be our designated home away from home as we enjoy the spirit of the “City of Joseph.” Please consider her as an option, it is family and dog friendly and is more than she advertises it as. Additionally, her family has owned their property for 150 years - and it includes a “highway” that was used by early Saints to connect Carthage members to Nauvoo. She truly welcomes ALL and you will not find any place in the area that offers a closer vision of what Nauvoo aimed to be - a Zion where ALL ARE WELCOME."

Wood for fires is provided, wine and eggs are in the fridge. You do not have a stove so keep that in mind if you cook. You get value with this place without paying more than $75 a night! ln my opinion you can't beat that.
Just so you know....wifi is very iffy and you are getting limited local channels but that is ok with us. We wanted private time alone with nature and you get that here. We are Verizon and had one bar. If you want to watch a movie download it to your phone and then watch it there. You will not be able to stream it live in the cabin."

Stayed a few nights","Jenn was amazing!! The barn studio was so cute and the bed was unbelievably comfortable!! It was so fun to explore the beautiful grounds and swing on the swings. Not to mention the sunset was gorgeous!! Jenn and Jerry welcomed us to a family fire which included live guitar music by her son! We actually felt like part of the family!! The WiFi is spotty, but believe me when I say this is a blessing!! Don’t hesitate to book this place; you will not be disappointed!! This place is five stars without a doubt!"

Stayed a few nights",Returned this year for another 2 night stay. Loved being greeted by Catnow. The gardens and flowers were in full bloom. The accommodations were clean and comfortable as always. We thought we'd miss having air conditioning in the lower level but the ceiling fans and table fan kept us comfortable. If there are guests staying above you will hear foot falls but they've always quieted before it disturbed our nightime sleeping. The kitchen area is thoughtfully supplied. Linda is a friendly caring host that is always working to improve her guests stay.

We had problems with the wifi and couldn't connect. The barn was beautifully furnished but with quite a few cobwebs and bugs around. If that doesn't bother you this is the perfect place to stay!"

Jen is so welcoming & an amazing super host. Linda (yes of THE lake linda) is super sweet as well & abe the other sisters scruffy dog made fast friends with our pup & they played all day running around together
If you do have the pleasure of staying here definitely check out the vineyard on the other side of the lake & swing on the BEST swings in the world. Take that walk around the property & look at the clear night sky with billions of twinkly stars!!
we'll definitely be back for the amazing location, conversation, & wine :)"

From the quaint and spacious studio layout of the barn (which was far larger than one would expect from a studio space) and the welcoming personal touches such as a jar of homemade wine from the family vineyard, to the accommodations the host made in regards to helping me find a great spot for dark sky telescope observation. The sky views were absolutely amazing and I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to find an especially dark sky for star gazing. The price was very reasonable and the area has a lot to offer for anyone that enjoys the outdoors and is looking for a reprieve from the concrete jungle. I'll definitely be going back again."

We got to sit around the campfire talking and making s’mores with not only the other guest that were staying upstairs but her adult children coming and talking to us was truly the cherry on top. The wine in the refrigerator was great BUT the cookies we woke up to as a surprise was truly heart warming. Truly a wonderful experience. It felt like home away from home. No need for AC at all.

Stayed with kids","The space: Simple, classy, rustic yet subtly contemporary, everything we needed for a peaceful retreat from the rush of life. The space feels large the way it is laid out, the kitchen has just enough to be fully functional and still keep it simple and easy. It's neither home nor hotel, but clearly an open space meant to comfortably hold someone seeking quiet and simplicity.
The hosts: GENEROUS, genuinely kind and available but not imposing or in any way pushy. We made some amazing memories with this family, and we also had ample time to soak up and bond ourselves. I stayed here with my two young daughters, the space was safe for us and spacious enough for lots of creative play (indoors and outdoors).
I've never had a better AirBnB experience. I've liked past places, but as a lover of quiet rural existences this space was perfection.
To the tech-driven: If you're looking to be on devices the whole time, you may be looking at the wrong place. The internet is sufficient but basic (I joined a Zoom call and was able to see and hear but not easily be heard (could have called in by phone for that, Verizon cell service at 2 bars), movie streaming was perfect and videos emailed fine).
Being PRESENT in body and place is what I feel this spot most invites of its visitors. A wonderful breath of fresh air to connect to place, people, self and family here. [And feel well rested! I slept better than I've slept in a year in that bed.]"

Stayed one night","If you have a reason to be in Macomb, Illinois, you have no reason not to stay here. Or, without the double negative, if you are questioning whether this is a nice place/neighborhood, don’t. This will meet your needs. Are you considering a stay at a 2-star hotel/motel? Don’t. This is a very small town, and you will pay nearly the same at the two available hotel-ish places. I almost made that mistake, and then remembered that there’s this convenient little thing called Airbnb.
I’m not one to write phony, glowing reviews, so I’ll wrap this up succinctly.
The neighborhood is quaint and quiet with an easy walk to the downtown square, where you’ll find sufficient places for food/beer and morning coffee/breakfast.
You’ll sleep fine in your choice of a northeast or southeast facing bedroom. (Put the ugly step child in the middle room.)
TVs are provided in the living room and bedroom(s). Typical access to streaming services.
Easy-peasy. Enjoy the Midwest. We’re Midwest-nice."

The cottage is super cozy with a great bedroom and movie room. We’ve been to a ton of BnBs and this one is by far the best decorated and homie of any, it’s a great place to relax and disconnect.
I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Macomb!"

To top it off, the neighborhood is so peaceful that I got a wonderful night's sleep every night, despite being a light sleeper.

Literally everything you could need was provided - from kitchen supplies, towels, coffee, homemade chocolate chip cookies at check in and even a pack and play that the hosts were so gracious to provide for us. It was a home away from home for us. There is so much love and detail put into this cottage and we are so grateful we were able to experience it - it made traveling with littles comfortable, fun and relaxed!"

You will find everything you need for a comfortable stay. The gardens are beautiful and provided such a nice atmosphere for morning coffee. The bed is very comfortable and the shower is fantastic. You get the best of old and new in this historic little house. I appreciated the ADA shower and grab-bars in the bathroom to accommodate those with disabilities. Highly recommend!

For me the sofa appeared quite worn, and some furniture pieces as well. The living area had some reading material that was covered in a layer of dust. The awning over the front porch is in bad shape.
It was however fine for a short stay, and as I said the basics were good to go. The price probably reflected the mediocre condition/appearance of the home - and that was fair Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","This home was sufficient for our needs. Daniel gave easy to follow instructions, there were no crazy things to do before leaving & the price was much better than the local hotels. However, after reading so many reviews before booking, I was surprised the following things were not mentioned. I will put them here for future guests to be aware. One, this house is extremely old - which only matters because every floorboard, every door & even the beds squeak with every move you make. I would not suggest staying with young children, as I assume they would not fall or stay asleep with all the noise. It is also dusty & lots of foliage right outside so my husband’s allergies went through the roof during our stay. You are also right next to student housing. It was after 3am before it got quiet next door. Not a party or rudeness, just loud talking outdoors right outside our windows. Like I said, it was sufficient and there was nothing awful, just things that you might want to know before booking"

The weather was very cold compared to what we’re used to but the home was warm and not drafty. The entire place has what you need. Of all the Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in, this was the easiest check in by far. Totally recommend Daniel’s house and will definitely try to stay here again and again."

The check in process was super easy, the host communicates super well and the whole place was clean and charming! The location is also amazing! Just blocks from Forgotonia Brewery, The Square (which is home to two amazing coffee shops), and WIU. This is really the best place to be! I cannot sing my praise loud enough! I really hope this home is available next time I come to Macomb! It is so so worth staying at!"

The kitchen had everything we expected and also some supplies like olive oil, coffee, tea, some spices and condiments. It made cooking easier. Daniel is an excellent host. He was very helpful in accommodating my needs, making the place scent-free and used only natural cleaning products. He purchased a grill, which was very nice to use."

Stayed with kids","This place was “you get what you pay for” good. My family (husband and toddler) and I were pleased with the cleanliness of the place and the ease of entering the home. The shower and bathroom were very clean, which is super important to us.
The location of the home is great regarding proximity to attractions, events etc. However, it is on a busy street and you can hear traffic as well as the numerous trains that run by through the night, which did not bode well with a toddler in tow or a light sleeping adult. I’m glad we brought a sound machine and earplugs.
The biggest downside to this home (for me) is that it is old and has a very pungent scent. I compared it to my great-grandmother’s home (when she was still alive). It was also very humid in the home despite having the AC on 71° during our stay. We keep our home on 73° for comparison.
Overall, we were satisfied with our stay given the price point. Thank you!"

The house itself is perfect for a family to stay. It has everything you need and the check-in/out process was simple. The decorations were adorable and everything was clean ... they even had extra condiments in the fridge / toiletries in the bathroom if you need!
Highly recommend for your next Macomb stay."

Stayed over a week","Darling cottage in a secluded corner of a larger, well gardened property on the eastern edge of the WIU campus area. We had an extended stay here and the house was fully equipped for basic needs—we even baked cookies.
Excellent walkability to the Amtrak station, Forgottonia microbrewery, and Bold drive thru/walk up coffee shop, with the quaint & historic Macomb town square farmer's market just a few steps further. The house is comfortable for 2, a little tight for 4 adults for more than a week. Kitchen is well stocked, heat and AC are excellent, internet is solid (unusual for Macomb, which can be spotty).
This is a vintage, cutely updated & modernized, Gunnison ""Magic"" Kit prefab home from the 50's that has unusual build details, if you are curious about that sort of thing. It is about 1/4 mile from the train tracks, but the only noticeable sound is an occasional whistle, not the rumble. Being near campus, there are pedestrians and the occasional ""boom"" car, but they're only audible if the windows are open. Convenient off-street parking, right next to the house."
