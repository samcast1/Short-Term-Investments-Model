Stayed one night",The place was great I only wish I had my grandkids with me the Pokemon machine they would have loved that. If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely stay there. The little touches made it feel so nice. She was concerned for our safety as the weather had changed some. Don't hesitate book it.

Stayed with kids","Our stay in London was wonderful, thanks to Jacqueline's top-notch hosting. The house was easy to find, and it was beautiful to wind through the hills and mountains to get there. When we arrived, it was simple to enter the home. Jacqueline left lamps on for us, and the air conditioning was on—we felt everything was ready for us. The house was impeccably clean and very comfortable. Our kids loved the bunk room and had a blast playing the old school arcade games. The icing on the cake was the breathtaking view of the mountains and the surrounding farms. We had fun with the wildlife, too: the cows (and calfs!) peacefully grazing, a turkey wandering around the woods, and a curious lizard climbing the stairs outside. The price was just right, and we didn't break the bank to relish in Kentucky beauty. Thank you!"

Surroundings are beautiful and the house is all sparkly new with lots of little things to make it feel like home. My daughter found the stack of games and uno cards in the first 2 mins lol. Host was extremely helpful and responsive and flexible with us when our plans got a little wonky. 100% recommend!

Stayed one night","We were in town for a concert at Corbin Arena. We weren’t sure how we felt about the distance to town from the AirBnB, but it was such a simple route and didn’t seem like 30 minutes at all! Such a beautiful and peaceful spot to spend a night. Truly in the rolling hills of Kentucky. They had enough of the essentials in house that we hardly even had to stop at a store. Would be a great place to have a large family all stay close together and utilize all four of the houses next to each other!"

Stayed with kids","Such a great place to stay! The location is beautiful and peaceful— I couldn’t stop looking at the view from the back porch. Jacqueline responded immediately to every message and her driving instructions helped me find the place right away, even though my phone map told me differently. The property manager was nearby to help us get in and he was very helpful and friendly. We had everything we needed and it was great to have so many beds. The kids really loved the bunk room and arcade game, and they watched a movie in the comfy living room. I used the kitchen for meals and I really appreciated that it is well-supplied with dishes and utensils. We will definitely be back if we travel that way again. And thanks to Jacqueline’s guidebook, we decided to go check out Flat Lick Falls, which was a stunning little side-trip. I highly recommend this host and location!"

Group trip","I know I've given this a 5 star rating but, somehow, that does not seem to be enough. From the location, to the home itself, to the people, this was a wonderful experience for my family. While we were dealing with a tough family situation, we found great peace in just being together in this wonderful setting. No matter what window you look out, you just see beautiful countryside. I'm not sure I have the words to do accurately describe our experience. The home itself is very cute and cozy. From the moment we walked in, my wife raved about it. My kids were apprehensive when I told them where we were staying, but immediately fell in love with the place. From the woods behind the house to the cows in the pasture beside the house, it was breathtaking. We are already in the process of planning our next trip!"

Group trip","My husband’s uncle passed away, which led us in our travels from MI to KY for the weekend to attend his funeral. Jacqueline’s place was perfect for our family of 5 which are fully grown. We had everything we needed to feel welcome and at home. The house was extremely clean and easy to find, the space and beds were comfortable, and the home was located on a beautiful piece of property just 25 minutes from the funeral home and 25 minutes from our uncles homestead. My family agrees that this Airbnb was one of our favorites ever rented for cleanliness, decor, location, space, and comfort. We would definitely stay here again to visit family in the area! I’m so glad we found it!"

Stayed one night","Jacquelines home was like home away from home. We made our reservation to have a place to rest overnight on our long drive to the Smokey Mountains, however, we wouldn't have minded staying longer. It was very easy to find because of excellent directions, and very easy to check-in. We were so pleased when we went inside and saw how clean and welcoming it was. The treats were definitely a surprise and we thought very kind of her to leave for us. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft and seemed like high quality sheets. This was our first experience with an Airbnb home and was a great way to start. Definitely better than staying at a hotel! We will happily recommend Jacquelines home to others and will make our reservations there in the future when traveling thru this area. We would like to know if Jacqueline has other homes in other locations that we can use for future trips. Such a great place for the price! Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","This 3BR home was precisely what the Love Of My Life & Myself needed. We were looking for a private getaway that would allow us to pretend the rest of the world didn't exist and for 2 days...we got exactly what we bargained for! Private, out of the way, secluded and tucked into the Kentucky hills...this place was amazing! Not only was it spotlessly clean, but it also had every single amenity we could've asked for as we lacked for nothing. The perks such as the Smart TV with streaming packages and the stocked cupboards were a very welcome bonus. The rest and relaxation we experienced together as a couple was sorely needed, so we will DEFINITELY be returning many times over in the coming months. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY AROUND! 👍"

The beds were so comfortable and the bedding was soft and beautiful. Two of our three kids slept in (a vacation miracle) they were so cozy! We were also impressed with the size of the bathroom. We enjoyed morning coffee on the front porch and relaxing on the big couch. Jacqueline was an incredibly responsive host and they home felt secure and was easy to find!

Stayed a few nights","This is the our 3rd stay at Jacqueline's Airbnb. We have never stayed at an Airbnb more than once. Here are my pros and cons of staying here. Pros: 1} Jacqueline is always proactive in the upkeep of her Airbnb. We have stayed at many places where it was most probably great at the beginning, but over times the host have just let things slide. The last time we stayed here was in May and since then, she has had curtains put up over the existing blinds in the bedrooms, a screen door installed over the back door, and a new thermostat in place; 2) Jacqueline is highly communicative with any questions you may have; 3) she reads ALL of the reviews and actually act on any areas of concern and 4) we just found out she has a second Airbnb right next door !! Here are my Cons: NONE !!!!!"

Stayed with kids","Well I have to say as a person that has stayed at a few airbnb properties their will always be pros and cons most definitely. Her property is at a great price rate and very affordable if your looking to find a place to stay if your going on vacation to Kentucky or passing through! Her place is very clean and well kept and has an assistant that lives on the property who is also super helpful and nice! The property is in the country so it's very quiet and peaceful. And it really helps that their is a dollar general literally down the same road and it's walking distance or a 2 minute drive and carries everything you need even groceries you could get at your local Walmart or Krogers! All other stores, restaurants, and local fun outings are all a average 20 minute drive from the property which really isn't far at all! Jacqueline at the property owner of the Airbnb was he really super nice and very communicative and gave very good details instructions through the process from start to end!"

Jacqueline thought of everything, down to the smallest detail of providing makeup cloths, toiletries, and other items that a guest might forget. The kitchen seemed well stocked with everything you would need, and we definitely want to take advantage of that on our next visit. One night just wasn’t enough. The morning view out the front door was like a painting…so peaceful, quiet, and beautiful, and just a perfect way to begin your day with your first cup of coffee before the kids wake up. Future guests (with little ones especially!) will love the PacMan game in 52, and that was such a fun addition to make it seem like home. We only stayed one night and absolutely hated to leave! Can’t wait to visit again and again and again. Thank you so much Jacqueline for making us feel so welcome and at home ❤️"

There are so many brochures for the areas and very clear directions. I even got to play Pac-Man in the kids' bedroom. It really was one of my favorite places to stay and I hope we can do so in the future. Less than 5 minutes to a Dollar General and only a few minutes more to London.

I got to try dates stuffed with almonds the first time in my life from the generous snack bag provided, and I will say that I am now hooked! Just a heads up to anybody it may concern, but it is not great place for accommodating a trailer like we had (7'x14'). We were able to get it turned around, but not very easily. However, this is absolutely nothing against the property and my fault for not looking into it. I would do it again, though! Thanks, Jacqueline, for a great place to stay for my family and I. We all really enjoyed the Pac-Man game!
Will probably be back again next year."

Stayed a few nights","Jacqueline was very responsive and gave excellent instructions. She added little touches for our stay, which was very thoughtful. Her place is beautiful and in a peaceful location. The bed seemed a little hard if you're a side sleeper, but that's nothing against her place, just something we noticed. We would highly recommend her place to anyone in the area and will likely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Jacqueline's place was very clean, location was beautiful, given wrong keypad info, kitchen seating wasn't comfortable, the chairs were small and high. the beds had plastic protective coverings which made sleeping noisy and very warm. The hardest thing was no internet connections & spotty cell service for us. Jacqueline has for the time being just a hotspot hook up which wasn't strong enough to connect. Being in a different state, she had sent friends to help and asked neighbors to use their Wi-Fi without any luck after 3 hours of trying. Our trip was a trip where we needed internet connections, a good night sleep, and a comfortable place to sit and eat which we didn't get. So unfortunately, we had to cancel our stay. She had given us most of our money back which helped. I think once she gets full internet, changes her plastic covers, a different seating option, and gets screens for her windows her place will be absolutely beautiful. Aubrey was a life saver & her friends were GREAT!"

Stayed with kids",Ms. Jacqueline was very responsive to our questions and needs. We were her first guest and she had a couple kinks to work out and did so within minutes if notification or prior to the need being needed. The electronic lol was not working so she left us a key at vvc a designated simple spot. The house was clean and had great space. We arrived late and left early so we did not see a lot of the countryside but were able to see the deers. We would stay again and suggest you give her place a try.

Stayed about a week","This is our go-to place when we stay in London. Clean and roomy, not always available but we try for it. Love the middle bedroom, the most comfortable bed. Never tried the other 2 bedrooms, but they look inviting. Easy to cook meals with all the utensils you need, we stay a week at a time and get tired of eating out. Easy parking at the front door makes unloading a breeze. Everyone would love this place. Closets have items needed for small children to make your stay more comfortable. Games for older children. This place is decorated that just makes you want to go home and do the same thing."

We were lucky enough to snag a couple of days during Christmas, and we were so happy to ""come home"" every day after visiting family and eating too much food and opening too many presents. Every morning, we woke up, took our time and enjoyed coffee and honey buns provided by Arlene. Every evening we came back to our cozy hideaway and slept that deep sleep of vacation in the comfy beds. The place is so clean and has everything you could possibly need. We were so grateful!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was super clean and everything you could ask for Arlene had. Fresh flowers on the table, honeybuns which were really good. There is a Keurig machine as well. There are 3 bedrooms which all had great personal touches. Bathroom was very clean and tons of beautiful plush towels. FYI, the hot water in the shower is on the right and cold on the left😊. Tons of snacks provided plus water bottles which was a great added plus. We did not interact with Arlene during our stay as we did not need anything, but she was home and available if we did need her.
The only negative was the stairs at the fire pit on the hill. If you have any trouble walking, this is not for you if you want to use it. It is steep with no handrails and there is a sign that read “Not responsible for any injuries”. I am handicapped so I could not use it and it was not in the description.
But other than that, this is a wonderful place and we would definitely rebook this if we were back in this area."

Stayed with kids","Arlene’s place was a half way meeting point from my home in Ohio to my son’s family in Tennessee. We agreed to meet in London for a visit and it couldn’t have been more perfect.
Arlene has a gift of hospitality and it shows from the very moment you walk in the door. The apt was spotless, accent lights were on throughout the home, the place smelled wonderful and there were fresh snacks and cold waters in the fridge.
We really felt as if we were her special guests although she had never met us.
Communication was clear and prompt. Arlene welcomed my grandchildren ages almost 3 and 5 and had a shelf full of books and age appropriate toys. You can tell she values children- there was a high chair, pac n’ play, baby tub and rocking chair at our disposal. All in excellent condition and clean as a whistle. Oh! And she had a great selection of children’s movies to enjoy in the evening.
The apt is spacious, well decorated and within walking distance to a park, ice cream shop and a great date place- “Local Honey” - great food and excellent atmosphere. London is a sweet little gem for sure.
As you can tell by the length of my review I was very pleased with our stay.
Thank you, Arlene for sharing your home and town with us! London is blessed to have you!"

Stayed with kids","We were in town for a wedding and enjoyed our stay very much. Everything was clean and well maintained. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. Arlene was easy to reach via text or call, but not intrusive. We appreciated all the little extras - the honey buns and Kcups in the kitchen, the extra blankets and throws, bedside lamps, fluffy towels in the bathroom and the information and maps of the local area. The temps dropped the weekend we were there or we would have used the fire pit and s'mores kit. Would definitely stay again if we were in the area."

Arlene was super responsive, and even provided us local suggestions (The Bluegrass Baker) to celebrate my daughters birthday.

Stayed a few nights","This is a comfortable and very well cared for airbnb. It is very clean, well equipped and tidy and has everything you'd need for a good stay. It is very close to the heart of London. Arlene provided a big plate of honey buns from the local bakery for us which was very kind of her and there was water and condiments in the fridge. The rooms are large and the main living space runs the length of the building. Do be aware that it is somewhat of a basement apartment with only the front bedroom having a proper window. The bathroom and utility room have small, high, windows. Also the air conditioning is set in the main house. Arlene very kindly offers to change this for her guests if they text her, but as we do tend to yoyo with the heating (I feel the cold and my husband does not) we didn't like to be always asking her to change it and there were lovely, soft blankets on hand for me to keep cosy with, whilst watching the TV. The AC unit is just next to the kitchen and is very powerful at times. Husband loved it!"

Group trip","We had a great stay at Tyler's home. I was surprised with the location being on a very winding road but hey, it's Kentucky! We came in to ride at Wildcat Off-road Park and it was a 20 minute ride on the sxs's to the park. The house was very clean and accommodating. All appliances worked as they should-the fridge does make a fair amount of ice, inside & outside lighting was great, & the location was very quiet. A few things that would not stop us from coming back but worth mentioning - the shower in the ""laundry room"" is small for a larger person - I would suggest using the hall bathroom/shower. The stairs to the upstairs loft are very small and steep and to get to the stairs, you have to go through the front bedroom. Bring extra paper towels and toilet paper with you as you shouldn't depend on the owner to provide a lot for you (I failed there). Although we brought our own pans and casserole dishes, it would be helpful to have a new full set of pots, lids, and skillets in the house."

Stayed with kids","The place was in a great location and very private. It was nice and spacious. We definitely had enough room for all of us. The home itself was very clean, but the air mattress was not. And it did not hold air either, maybe time for a new one. The outside fire pit and picnic area looked very nice and we were sad we were unable to enjoy them due to the weather. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend"

House is in a very quiet and scenic place and is beautiful inside and out!! Nice big porch to just sit and relax and enjoy your evenings after playing all day!! The only thing that that I feel could be improved on is the access to the 2 beds upstairs, possibly a staircase and entrance from outside or inside....other than that absolutely BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO STAY AND VERY REASONABLY PRICED!!! We thoroughly enjoyed it!!!

What I assumed was a closet in the bedroom on the lowest level was actually a door to a little basement room with washer and dryer inside. It was fun for the kids though to find a ""secret passage"". You could tell it was an older home so bathrooms, doors, etc were older as well. But the house was decorated well and very clean. Not many check out instructions, which on the one hand was nice as a guest but we were concerned we didn't do enough! Would stay here again!"

The space was exactly as described and included everything we needed including morning coffee. There was enough room for the two of us and our dog to stay comfortably for a few days. The patio was also nice to enjoy our morning coffee.
The neighborhood dogs may make an appearance and are friendly. Consequently light sleepers might hear the dogs barking when the sun comes up but we were able to drown it out with box fan that was provided.
Overall the stay and the hosts were great. They were friendly and provided us with local hikes and bars/restaurants. If looking for local bars/restaurants in London, Local Honey and Pour Boys are great spots."

The house was beautiful,absolutely spotless and with the stunning deco, provided a peaceful environment that allowed us to relax & unwind! The attention given to creating spaces that allowed our group of 5 to gather comfortably with room to spare, a well stocked kitchen & all bathrooms were much appreciated. It was the little things the host did that made our stay exceptional. We even enjoyed the front porch even though it was chilly. We were able to successfully see the Moonbow & will definitely be planning another trip that will include another stay at The Black House."

The Black House is an exceptional Air B&B. It is exactly as the pictures show, we felt at home from the moment we walked through the door and I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling in that area."

Channing was a great communicator and always responded quickly. The coffee maker didn’t work initially but Channing had a new one delivered before we could even miss it!
The house was in a great location with easy access to the highway in either direction.
We have family a little further south so I can definitely see us staying again in the future! We felt right at home from the moment we walked in!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I stayed for one night on our way from N.E. Ohio back home to N. GA. This was a great place to break up the drive and relax before continuing our trip. We booked Wildrock Cottage when we were about an hour from the property. Andrew and Andrew were very accommodating. We arrived to a very clean cottage with everything we needed. With their home away from the noise of the interstate it was a peaceful and relaxing night. The seating area in the back yard looked inviting but the rain kept us inside. A short drive will put you in downtown London where there looked to be several places to eat. We did not go out until the morning we left. Found Sacred Grounds Coffee Shop…drive through only. Coffee was very good. If you are looking to get away from noise and city lights for a relaxing time, I definitely recommend Wildrock Cottage!"

Stayed with a pet","Andrew’s place was perfect in every way! It is very obvious that every detail was thought through carefully. (Ex. Lids on the garbage cans so our furry friends weren’t tempted to steal the garbage.) The property is in a peaceful area with a nice yard and untraveled road for taking walks. There is an outdoor area to grill, eat, and enjoy a campfire. The inside is very clean and decorated perfectly. I’ve never seen so many toiletries provided at a rental. My mom and aunt forgot one of their bags at home so we thought we’d have to run to the store to get toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. Not the case! All of that was available if needed. We will definitely stay here again on one of our long road trips. I’m so thankful our dogs were welcome because this house and yard were 1000 times better than a small, crowded hotel. Thank you for sharing your space with us!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay at the cottage! The home matched the pictures very well and had everything we needed. The property is peaceful and seems secluded even though it's not far out of town. The highlight inside is the living room furniture. It was super comfy and relaxing in the evenings to just lounge and enjoy TV. The only caveat we would add, which is not meant to be negative, would be the entrance to the driveway. The road to the home is narrow for the last mile or so and then the drive turns very sharply back. We were in an F350 and could not make the turn in one pass. Had to make a two point turn to get in and then the same to get out. By no means a real problem, but something to be aware of as you approach if you drive a big vehicle. We would definitely stay again though next time we are in the area."

We planned to check out some of their recommended restaurants, but we ordered a family dinner from Habanero Mexican Grill our first night & had more than enough leftovers for all of the remaining dinners of our trip. The weather wasn’t great for outdoor adventures, but fortunately we had a cozy place to stay & plenty of indoor options. We definitely recommend this place! The beds are super comfy too."

Stayed a few nights","What you see is truly what you get. Andrew’s place offered everything you could need in an Airbnb. Among many things it is spacious and free of clutter, and I am a fan of its modernized feel in addition to the little details.
One will appreciate the privacy of the home, as it is well off the main road but also within a short drive into town for food, etc. I will add a qualifier to this notion of privacy with the forewarning that absent blinds/curtains on the windows around the kitchen and entryway may be perceived by some as a bit eerie—particularly when walking about at night.
Overall, I appreciated Andrew’s hospitality as a host, and I earnestly recommend the prospective renter to give this place a go."

The location was secluded and we felt very remote while only being a few minutes from anything we needed during our stay. So many wonderful suggestions for activities and places to visit during our getaway. We could have definitely stayed another week to try to do everything they recommended. The Natural Bridge and Cumberland Falls were EPIC! Overall, we had an amazing time and the Andrews were a major reason for that. We highly recommend their cottage and hope to return in the future.

The location is about 10 minutes from the main street which has many great restaurants. The Andrews also provided a guidebook for the area which was very helpful. I was able to visit the Red River Gorge area and Cumberland Gap for hiking as well as greater Lexington for historical tours and bourbon tasting which were all about an hour from the cottage.
The only downsides I experienced were that the lower driveway is a bit rough and there’s the slightest noise from the highway in the distance if a big truck goes by but this obviously is not heard indoors at all. I highly recommend staying here for your SE KY adventures!"

Though some of the drive to the location was through some rough looking neighborhood, once you arrive at Andrew's place all that is forgotten. Very private and peaceful. Welcome gifts were left for us as well as our dogs, which we found very thoughtful and sweet. The only negative I would have to say, is that we were unaware the master bedroom did not have a door to the room, only a locking baby-gate type latching. I wish we had known about that ahead of time, because our dogs kept trying to get into the room with us as they could see and hear us in there. Other than that, the place was practically perfect!"

The interior was very cool, a modern farmhouse kind of vibe. The reclining sofa, big tv, and surround sound made viewing television, after we finally came in, so enjoyable. Make sure you are prepared to cook at the house or drive a little distance if you want to go out to eat.

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I were traveling through the area and found ourselves in need of accommodations. We made a last minute request and Andrew immediately responded and allowed us to stay at his beautiful home. The house is located in a private setting. It was obvious to us that Andrew takes pride in his ownership of the home. That pride is reflected by the design elements and appearance of both the outside and inside of the home. The house was also impeccably clean and well furnished. We were grateful to wake up in a beautiful setting and continue our travels. We would recommend this as a great place to stay to friends, family, or anyone else planning a trip to explore this beautiful area of the United States."

It’s well-appointed with premium furniture, appliances, TVs, cookware and dinnerware, and the beds and couches were incredibly comfortable. The hosts have anticipated every need, and helpful little touches abound. Outside, the area is peaceful and serene, and the yard was perfect for our small dog to play.

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely wonderful stay! Perfect place to stay with my two high school seniors and our dog. London was a perfect location for the waterfall hiking trip I planned. We exhausted ourselves hiking 20 miles in 3 days! Van Hook Falls, Dog Slaughter Falls, Bark Camp Cascades and of course, Cumberland Falls and its infamous Moonbow. Each evening we came back to relax and watch the sunset on the front porch and then enjoyed the evening stars on the back patio, next to the fire. I was so impressed with the little touches inside the home that made us feel so welcome. Even our pup felt welcome with an elevated food bowl and a little toy as a welcome gift. 🐶 This home in the hills Kentucky is beautifully decorated! Hosts were very responsive and helpful. Will highly recommend their place to all who have asked about my trip! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

I stayed for 2 months as part of a personal spiritual retreat. The silence and solitude was perfect. And so was the amazing scenery. It’s secluded and private, surrounded by stones and trees.
Interior is clean. It’s so well decorated, they should be professional interior designers. And it’s cozy.
I can’t recommend their place enough."

Stayed a few nights","I'm giving this 5 stars because I can't give it 10! This was by far the nicest, most thoughtfully appointed Airbnb I have ever rented. She has gone WAY above and beyond. This felt less like renting a house and more like being a treasured guest in someone's home.
It's in an out-of-the-way place but that's a big part of the charm. The house sits in a beautiful setting and is extremely well-maintained. It looked like new construction or new renovation.
We LOVED the back porch and fire bowl. We sat out there and enjoyed them both nights of our stay.
The beds were extremely comfortable, the kitchen was very well stocked. We cooked a couple of meals there and had no problem finding everything and doing what we needed to do.
And the extras... There were snacks, coffee, spices, juice, even a first aid kit! This place has it ALL.
Kay clearly takes hospitality seriously and that helped give my family a terrific weekend. If I ever need an Airbnb in that town again it will be this one."

The first thing that stood out was that there were many great options left there for us for breakfast including fresh fruit, orange juice and water, oatmeal, cereal and milk, and plenty for our whole family (all 7 of us).
We were very impressed by the beautiful decorations in the house, it just made our experience there very lovely. Very comfortable beds with beautiful covering made for an excellent place to rest. Comfortable couches made a. nice place to sit, and a well stocked kitchen were great for a place to eat. The cottage is in a pretty part of the country in Kentucky, so a lovely place to drive to and stay.
We also found so many little touches, she really thought of everything. A tub of missing toiletries, candies in every room, everything you might need. We plan to come again the next time we travel through Kentucky.
Kay worked quickly to put us up as we requested booking at the very last minute."

Michella was very responsive and quick to respond with any questions we had.
The place has everything you need for cooking meals or grilling. The master bathroom has a wonderful multi head shower. The whirlpool bath was nice to soak in. We appreciated that she had new toothbrushes in the bathroom because I had forgotten mine.
With corn hole, darts and a trail to walk right out the back fence there are lots of things to keep yourself and the family entertained. There are board games to play too. We didn't watch any T. V. but it was nice having one in the master bedroom and living room. The master bedroom bed was very comfortable.
If you like a place that is quiet and secluded this is the place to stay.

There is also a very spacious garage which came in handy due to the abundant rain showers that were occurring while I was there. I was here on a business trip and drove from London to Corbin each day. It is a very quick drive in between the two places.

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely LOVED staying at the Olive Grove House in London, KY. This was a very well appointed airbnb! We stay in about a dozen vacation rentals throughout the country each year and this was one of the best we've stumbled on to yet. Very clean, extremely comfortable beds, pillows and linens. The living room had two large sofas, again very comfortable with a easy to use large smart tv. A huge garage, we'd typically not use a garage, but with the possibility of hail we figured why not?! After traveling for a few days it was wonderful to catch up on some laundry, beautiful brand new machines (well everything in the house seemed brand new!). The house was amazingly well stocked! Laundry detergent, dish washer soap, every travel sized toiletry you could ever dream of needing, coffee & tea and the list goes on... we are traveling with our special needs kids service dogs, whom couldn't be happier roaming around the huge fenced-in backyard. Every detail was A+++++"

I enjoyed exercising our dog on the many well maintained trails in the park as well as visiting the very picturesque Old Mill on the stream within the park where photography opportunities were unlimited. One especially nice feature of the home was the especially large grassy fully fenced back yard for pets. The kitchen was also a plus as it contained all new appliances and was amply furnished with several extra touches/conveniences. We enjoyed several meals on the deck off the kitchen which was private & had attractive & comfortable outdoor furnishings. The two car garage was convenient as we had some stormy weather. Beds were quite comfortable & situated at opposite ends of the home, both had baths. Access to the washer & dryer was appreciated as well. Should we ever revisit London, this home will be our first choice."

The host was extremely helpful and quickly responsive to fix the issue. He explained that it is being fixed! The house is very cute and in a great location. Our only complaint was the cleanliness of the floors. We have a little one that crawls and this caused us to be more aware of it. I did reach out to the host and they were positively receptive and were going to deep clean!
My dad grew up in the house and we loved getting to hear stories of his time spent there! We loved that most things within the house had been preserved with modern decorations and updates where needed. We recommend this location as a place to stay if you are in London! We would love to stay again some time!"

I'd recommend bringing a few kitchen items with you, if you plan to cook something specific while staying here. Kitchen was stocked, but lacking in a couple items (e.g., crock pot, cooking oil, and other specific things you may need.) That said, it does have basic pots/pans and utensils. Completely easy to work in, but we were scratching our heads a bit for what we were cooking.
Overall, cozy house and easy to sleep in. Perfect for me and my friends while attending a local wedding."

It’s about 35 min to Cumberland falls. There is a great park to walk at or take the kids to play just a couple minutes away. (Veterans park).
The home has gorgeous natural lighting. A great fire pit and grill. We loved it there and will definitely stay again.
I’m other reviews, I read issues about the hot water in the shower. We had no issues. Let the shower run for a few minutes and the water will get hot. It does take a few minutes though. The host also went above and beyond by supplying shampoo, conditioner and body wash!
The kitchen had everything we needed plus some. I was surprised by the welcome snacks and coffee bar set up! Such a great perk that we truly appreciated.

There was an issue that caused us to need to be relocated after our first night but the host was quick and easy to communicate with. We were moved to another one of their property called ‘The Blue Moon’ and it was a fantastic bungalow in the heart of London. Very cute, comfy beds, enough room to visit with our party of 6. This host was very very apologetic and communicative and resolved the issue to their best ability quickly and efficiently. They offered late checkout and made every effort to make us feel welcome. I would absolutely recommend renting through them. Thanks so much!"

We had a couple minor issues at check in (faulty door lock and needed some household items) but they were immediately addressed. And they checked in with us later to see if we needed anything else, which was so kind. The house is adorable and in a great location, convenient to anything in London but quiet enough at night. The window and fireplace in the living room is stunning. Loved the sun in the morning and watching the groundhogs play across the street in the evenings! Very comfortable beds. The complimentary snack cart was a big hit too. :) Parking is a little tight but workable for more than one car. I would have liked a washer/dryer on site but everything else was just excellent. We’d definitely stay again."

Another note about the house is there is a lot of traffic on Mill street through the night. I just set my white noise and slept like a baby. The 3rd bedroom is an office with a daybed and there are no doors so there isn’t any privacy in that room. We enjoyed the morning sun coming through the front windows. Overall a great stay."

A quiet little street within walking distance to Main Street and a few minutes drive to all your commercial/shopping needs. The kitchen was well stocked with new (and very nice) cooking supplies and utensils. We also appreciated the thoughtful snacks and water that were available. Since there is more exploring that I want to do in the area, and a few spots we found that I hope to return to someday, I definitely look forward to staying here again in the future."

Stayed over a week","Jordyne’s place was great found! We highly recommend you to stay at this place if it is available. It is a very neat and comfortable house that gets almost everything you need for your stay! We also discovered our new love bourbon through the sampler (thanks Daniel!) The Airbnb is located in the center of London, very close to everything within walking distance or less than 10 minutes' driving. We had a very great month staying at the place.
About The Living:
People in London are very friendly and hospitable. It was a very very safe place in town since it was surrounded by courthouses and police stations.
We strongly recommended the Sacred Cafe, where has the slowest service we've ever experienced, but it worth the waiting for the fantastic staff and their amazing considerate serving.
Grocery: Apparently London has various very good farmers' markets, but they closed in the wintertime during our stay. We recommended the Kroger at 1732 KY-192, great produce, and way better than the other Kroger.
The Only Downside: The only downside for our stay was the lack of laundry accessibility. The laundry mat in London is the most expensive laundries we have ever visited, the nearby town as well.
FYI: Don't forget to try out the bourbons while you are in Kentucky! They are so good!! Ask for recommendations or search for the local-limited addition info."

Stayed with a pet","WARNING‼️ WORST AIRBNB EXPERIENCE! It started out fine, although it was very cold. Olivia brought some space heaters and we used them continually, wore big coats and boots inside the house, and bought electric blankets. We were not told prior to arriving that the house had heating issues. On Christmas morning, the heat completely stopped. Olivia’s father finally called me and said that it was Christmas, and they couldn’t get anybody to fix it, and said he could bring some more space heaters. It was far too cold, even with heaters (55 degrees and dropping), so I asked for a refund so I could leave and go to a hotel. I did not receive ANY response, so I reached out to Airbnb for help. I’m still waiting on help with this issue, and was out a lot more money staying at a hotel the remainder of my trip. Heating issues are understandable, but not responding to your guest or attempting to help them when they are WITHOUT HEAT in subzero temperatures is unacceptable. DO NOT STAY HERE!"

The host also added those extra touches that you don’t always find such as a starter supply of laundry soap and softener, extra roll of toilet paper, and a few toiletries in case you forget a basic. There were also plenty of large bath towels and cloths so you don’t have to worry if everyone will get one. We were able to cook all of our meals for our stay in the kitchen.

The TV was a little confusing, a 32"" tv in front of larger TV which you could add your own Netflix etc. or use VCR. The smaller one was hooked up to Pluto..so if you don't have or don't want to add your streaming account info you were limited to what you could watch.

We appreciated being off the road because we had a carrier on the back of the car so it felt safe. We were not expecting the highway road noise with the property being part of a farm."

The drives through the are we’re so beautiful. The location is close to grocery shopping for anything you need. Coming back from hot summer hikes the tiny house had great a/c and comfy. Top marks."

Stayed one night","It's a charming, nicely kept tiny house with welcoming rocking chairs on the front porch! It's not as private as I thought it would be, with a couple of homes right in front of the house. But everyone is quiet. Except a barking dog 30 feet away that is very opinionated about his territory anytime you are outside of the house. It goes on for a while, too. And, at least for me, nothing was done to help the situation, even when I asked. I like dogs, but don't have any need for rude behavior. The farm animals were great, friendly, and enjoyable."

The bed is a double which is against the wall so the one against the wall has to climb out the end of the bed to get to the bathroom. Not a big deal for us but just to note. Diann had a few snacks available which was super thoughtful because we had been traveling and didn’t want to go out again. We will definitely plan to stay again.

The porch with its country view as a backdrop to the lightning storm, falling asleep to rain tinkling on the tin roof, waking to a stocked coffee bar, freshening up in the large shower, puppies and goats and ponies and a donkey Hee-Hawing at me while I played guitar in one of the rocking chairs…
Diann waked by unobtrusively once and we chatted; a lovely lady and considerate hostess.
The home was very clean and well stocked. Mini fridge, gas stove, wonderful sunk Country sink, plenty enough counter space and all the cooking utensils you’ll need. And a microwave, of course.
The decor is just lovely. Marble, marble everywhere! Classic, comfortable Country furniture that went mostly unused due to that wonderful porch. I think we slept better on the comfortable Full-size bed than our own Queen.
And yes, Pizza will be delivered!"

Stayed one night","I’ve always wanted to stay in a tiny house and I when I saw this listing in my old hometown I jumped at the chance to stay there while I was in town visiting friends. And It was awesome. Like legitimately awesome. Everything is so well thought out, and you really do feel like you’re home when you walk in. The tiny house is more convenient to London than Corbin, but just barely so. If you’re looking for a cool spot to stay while visiting that part of that state, I highly recommend Diann and her tiny home. I’ll definitely be back."

Stayed one night","I highly recommend Diann's tiny house as a convenient, spotless, modern place to stay. It's so lovely out on the farm but close to I 75 and all the hiking and Cumberland Falls. It's not far to the main restaurants and shopping in London and it's also easy to get to Corbin from the house. This is a great place for one or two people to stay and Diann is a thoughtful host; she has lots of nice touches: rocking chairs on the porch, gas logs inside, adjustable A/C and ceiling fans, large shower and modern kitchen with fridge, microwave, stove and farmsink. I loved it!
A few pointers for guests: bring your own shampoo and conditioner and be ready to climb into bed from one side only as it's in a corner. Parking is right next to the porch and Diann will give you great directions to get to the house. Enjoy!"

There are some adorable little ponies, goats, and a donkey on the property. The house itself is very cozy and quaint, doesn't feel cramped at all for being a tiny house. Diann left short notes in various places that were very helpful. Overall definitely recommend"

It is only a block from main street and walkable to several restaurants but was also very quiet. One of the best AirB&B's in which I've stayed!"

Stayed over a week","The Blue Moon of Kentucky is a charming place to stay. We were there for two weeks visiting family and couldn’t be more pleased. This was our first time getting an Airbnb and I originally got the reservation for October, 2021. However, we were unable to make it due to illness. Daniel was very accommodating in changing the reservation. Then, the next one had to be changed. After rescheduling three times, we were able to stay. Daniel was very understanding and helped secure the final date. He communicates quickly and you have few questions. The Blue Moon is centrally located and we walked to restaurants. Even the couple of nights we stayed in, we had everything we needed to make supper. We will certainly stay again the next time we’re in London."

Stayed over a week","Thank you so much for the wonderful home! It was great staying there, and this was my first Airbnb. I am sold on it now. The access to the location was wonderful and provided easy travel for my first trip since March 7, 2020. It was nice being back in Kentucky after the longest stretch of not being home (since 2018). I got to see lots of friends and family in the area, some I had not seen since 1983. Thank you for making the stay a simple part of the trip.
It was nice being able to cook, do laundry, and even stream some shows as I was adjusting to the time difference. The house was very clean, and the rooms were very nice. The dining room became a good office for me, and I greatly appreciated being able to have fast Internet. I felt confident that if any issues came up, I could reach out to y'all for assistance.
Thank you so much for sharing your home!

Daniel was easy to communicate with and made everything so easy.
We would highly recommend Blue Moon and will be back on our Kentucky adventure."
