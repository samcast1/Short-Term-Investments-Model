Stayed one night","Kimber's house was conveniently located vis a vis restaurants and the university in town. Her Air BnB home was well decorated and supplied with plenty of towels, utensils, and conveniences such as hair dryers and even air freshener. Also, this house has an interesting history, reflected in the art and other decor of the interior. During the many years we have been using Air BnB, I can think of only one unit I might describe as better. Kimber's house is a joy to stay in--a real treasure."

Stayed a few nights","Our group was two couples traveling together thru NM, had a great time at Kimber's place. Very good location, close to historic downtown, easy parking, quirky (in a good way) two story house. Small kitchen, but very well equipped. Tiny living space downstairs, large upstairs.
Kimber was very responsive, check in and out was simple. We would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed with a pet","A few things to know:
--The windows on the first floor open to sidewalks, and pedestrians have a clear view into the house. Closing the blinds is required for privacy, like living in a cave.
--If over 5'10"" tall, you will bump your head on the ceiling in a couple of places
--There are two comfortable chairs in the house-both are in the ubstairs bedroom. The downstairs sofa in the dining room is small and stiff.
Otherwise, the place is nicely decorated, clean, and has a great location. Our dogs loved the convenience of a fenced yard."

Stayed with a pet","Right in the heart of Silver City's downtown. Quiet at night but regular sidewalk and street traffic during the day. Lots to bark at for our dogs in the secure yard. The food co-op is literally half a block away, restaurants right across the street as well as through the rest of downtown. Easy parking. Comfortable beds. Not a lot of couch/lounge space. Overall a great place to stay while visiting Silver City and environs."

Stayed a few nights","The Teachers' Cottage was a great place to stay while exploring Silver City. Well-appointed, convenient location, super comfortable. GREAT pizza place (Forrest's) and bakery (Diane's) right across the street, Roxy's diner around the corner, Little Toad Creek Brewery and Distillery a few blocks away, lots of art galleries and other restaurants along Bullard Street. Took a nice stroll along the Big Ditch (stream/park a block away) - be sure to check out the fascinating tile mural in the park that describes how floods in the late 19th / early 20th century turned Main Street into the Big Ditch. HIGHLY recommend exploring Gila Cliff Dwellings at the end of route 15 north of town. It's about 1.5 hours to get there (windy mountain road) but well worth the effort; it's a national monument, but there's no fee."

You have the benefit of the historic character with modern amenities—the bathrooms and kitchen have chic, new fixture and appliances. The beds and blankets were super cozy and comfortable.
If you want to be in the heart of historic Silver City to walk to restaurants, cafes, bookstores, galleries, and shops—this is the place for you. Be sure to hit them all on Saturday because Sunday and Monday is a ghost town."

We were there on New Year's Day, so not much was open, but we expected that and were able to walk to a grocery store on New Year's Eve to stock up. The fenced yard was wonderful for our dog, and the house itself was lovely with eclectic and interesting decor. The kitchen had all the basics, with a few extras. We were only here for 2 nights, but it was enough to make us want to return. Kimberly was responsive, but gave us our privacy--we felt that we could have asked her anything."

Stayed one night","Traveling with a dog can be tiring, especially to new places. The teachers cottage was a dream! not only was it super private, I parked right in front and let the pup out to play while unpacking. You are less than 2 minutes walk from pizza, an adorable coop grocery (with cute gifts -when Birdwells is closed) and 5 min walk to the local bar (Alexander is an amazing bartender!)
From basking in a quiet private yard to enjoying the decor, I was happy to splurge on this space instead of risking a hotel. There was little foot traffic and I saw only dogs on leash. There's a gorgeous ""ditch park"" river walk at the very end of this street and an off leash dog park 6 min drive. Be sure to check out The coffee shop around the corner but plan ahead, the line was long (for a reason!). Spend the extra cash and you will be glad you did!"

Thanks Kimber for letting us stay and all the great ideas!! The home is extremely functional with great Wi-Fi and tv set ups. The AC was great and you can not beat the location.

I enjoyed the fenced in yard for our small pup as well; it also had seating areas. The only element to note is it doesn’t have a separate living room with traditional couches; it does have a love seat in the common area with the dining table and a charming sitting space upstairs with two lunge chairs. Not an issue for us even with six people, we had plenty of places to sit and relax."

Stayed a few nights","This is a historic, adobe home that has been lovingly restored with modern conveniences. It's absolutely adorable. The upstairs room has two double beds, a full bath, and a sitting/ work area. With all the windows and the compact space it feels like a treehouse. The downstairs bedroom has a Murphy bed, and a door that opens to a tidy, well kept enclosed yard with a swing, two rocking chairs, and a table with an umbrella. This place has a lot of character, and it's right in the historic district so everything is within walking distance. Keep in mind that it is a small space. My brother is 6'4"", so none of the beds, or the sloped ceilings upstairs were comfortable for him. The rest of us are under 5'10"" and we thought it was a great place in an arty, laid-back, friendly town. We can't wait to go back."

It was within walking distance of a beautiful main street, full of artisans and co-op food grocery. Walking distance! I adored Silver City and The Teacher's Cottage was a dream.
A downstairs bedroom and full bath and upstairs in the loft two queens and a full bath. The showers were fantastic and kitchen exceptionally appointed. What I found lovely was the large dining room table where we ate and played cards.
A wonderful place to come together with friends and family. Our host was proactive and positive. Her catalog of places was wonderful. Tranquil Buzz coffee shop is not to be missed. And we had fun at the Buckthorn Saloon and Opera house.
I worry about telling the world about this place because it is so wonderful. I would stay again in a heartbeat. It was perfect."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely historic home in the heart of old town, walkable to all of the shops, galleries, and restaurants. Beds were comfortable and I slept great. Due to the location, there is some noise during the day, loud trucks and motorcycles mostly but it was quiet for sleeping. Downstairs is a large bedroom with queen bed and tv. A full bath is just next to the bedroom off the living room. Upstairs is more of a loft type suite with 2 beds and a full bath. There is no off-street parking but I always had a close parking option. My only suggestion would be to have a sofa and more comfortable furniture in the living room area instead of just the large table and period piece chairs. Overall it was enjoyable and convenient. I would recommend it."

We ate breakfast there that we prepared and kitchen is well-stocked w/what we needed to do so, plus we grilled out (grill is very clean) and had nice enough weather in Nov to sit out in backyard and enjoy our beverages! PERFECT place to chill out! We plan on coming back to hike more in the Gila National Forest! Thanks Kimber for everything!!"

First floor bathroom was well stocked with plenty of soft absorbent towels as well as large size toiletries (shampoo, conditioner and body wash). The wooden table was perfect for playing card games and enjoying conversation with a glass of wine. Each room has several windows with easy to operate blinds (as privacy may be an issue with the sidewalks close to the cottage).

Stayed a few nights","This is a quiet, peaceful place to stay. Just 10 minutes from Silver City, but it felt rural and private. The original artwork and retro furnishings gave it a nice homey feel. The traditional adobe style architecture mostly worked to keep the house comfortably warm but we were grateful for the supplemental heater during our February stay. Beds were small (full? queen?) but comfortable. We were surprised and gratified to discover it had Internet (when we booked it, the description indicated it didn't). Indeed had we known this, we likely would have stayed here for our entire time in Silver City. We relocated to another local place for the remainder of our 4 week stay because we needed Internet for some time sensitive business. host was immediately responsive and helpful. All communication was clear and timely. If peace, solitude and quiet in a comfortable house is what you seek, this is the place for you."

The kitchen is very well equipped, as are the bedrooms. The location is unbeatable, with a view of the sunset over the surrounding hills that seems to last for hours. We had planned to spend more time in the actual old town of Silver City but just really enjoyed being here in this house surrounded by natural beauty.
We did enjoy a trip to Faywood Hot Springs about half an hour away, ate delicious crispy pizza at Whiskey Zocalo, bought some affordable art at the local artists’ guild, plus some very fun pottery from Animalia.
Our dog liked it here too, and it’s nice that Silver City is pretty dog friendly. We definitely plan to come back for a longer visit next time!"

Our dogs felt at home instantly—always a good sign! Terrific location to see the Gila cliff dwellings, City of Rocks and The Catwalk. The daily trip to town for vegan Food Co-op sandwiches seemed to take us 5 minutes. Wranglers Bar & Grill and Little Toad Creek Brewery were also handy from the house—we were SO glad we didn’t stay in a hotel. Many thoughtful touches throughout this hand crafted, double walled adobe home that was built to last forever. No microwave ( most dinnerware is handmade) but the Instant Pot’s steam function can reheat many foods, as well as cook. In short, everything you need for a delightful stay is here :)"

And the kitchen has everything you need—from making morning coffee to a full meal. Food co-op in town has a nice selection of organics and other good stuff. Jamie was an awesome host, always responsive. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful little place. My wife and I shared it with my parents and we enjoyed the floor plan very much. The bedrooms are set up like separate quarters, so there is a nice level of privacy. The open kitchen /living room floor plan is wonderful. We were all able to collaborate on our cooking projects and converse while lounging about reading. The only issue we had was that the level of cleanliness was not what it should have been. We found pet hair on the coffee table surfaces, food particles on the kitchen counters, and neither of the bathrooms were clean. It wasn't dirty to a level of being disgusting, but it wasn't what you expect when you've been charged a cleaning fee. I communicated these issues to Jamie and he was apologetic, but did not offer to refund the cleaning fee, which surprised me a bit.
Despite needing to do our own cleaning, we really enjoyed our stay. We spent a lot of time on the back patio and saw corvids, quail, hummingbirds, a deer, and other wildlife.
We enjoyed the quiet. We were never annoyed by dogs barking, engine noises, etc.
Pros: Great interior layout and decor, good kitchen, quiet, comfortable
Con: Somewhat unclean."

Two outdoor patio areas, access to modern washer and dryer, and an interesting workshop/gallery is next door in the same building. Very comfortable beds (I had the best sleep in ages). About as centrally located as you can be for walking around the fun historic downtown. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

Walking distance to everything. The outdoor patios are private and can give you views of the neighborhood activities, if you choose. The accommodations are beautiful with great eye to design and detail. The beds and bedding are cozy and comfortable and the condo is quiet . I’m particular about a clean and beautiful bathroom/shower and theirs was immaculate and designed well. The kitchen was fun and accommodated our family well for breakfast and small meals. We would stay here every time. Thank you for a great stay and experience.

Jan and her cozy cabin was a perfect option, it was so cute, comfortable, quiet and well appointed. I forgot our pups leashes at home and asked Jan if she had a couple we could borrow.

It's close enough to town to run in anytime for restaurants or groceries yet out of town just enough to feel private and secluded. In the yard I saw, mule deer, rabbits, quail, a road runner. It was a great space for me. I set up a desk to use as a home office. The kitchen is spacious and well equipped. The bathroom is large. Jan is very quick to respond when needed but otherwise you have your private space. She took care of the garbage and brought mail and packages I received. When I needed a chair she went and bought two new ones. The proximity to the Gila Wilderness was the main attraction for me. There was plenty of fishing and an incredible amount of hiking trails. Lot's of wildlife. Other sites nearby are City of Boulders state park, White Sand National Park, Cave Dwellings National Monument and the Catwalk. Lots of hot springs too."

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay at Jan's Cottage! The amount of Deer on the property is crazy! By the end of the stay you kind of get used to them always being around! The place is quite private and quiet. The place had everything a couple with a dog could possibly need and we would gladly return next time in Silver City. Which by the way was conveniently a quick drive down the road.

Two rocking chairs on the covered porch would be an easy place to spend a quiet evening. Coyotes were heard in the early morning hours adding to the rustic, western feel of the surroundings. Coffee, cookies and more awaited us upon arrival. This cabin would be a great base camp to explore Silver City, our only disappointment was we didn't have enough time there! Bonus was she allowed our little dog to come along. Thank you Jan for your great hospitality!"

It is a spacious studio unit with kitchen, small dining table, 2 recliners, a queen size bed, and a large enclosed bathroom. In my opinion, the cabin is nicer than the Airbnb photos portray. The front porch is lovely with beautifully clean and attractive cushions on the rocking chairs. There is also an outside patio adjacent to the cabin with table and chairs (again with spotless cushions) for dining in warmer weather. Good internet access. Very comfortable. We have already booked a return stay in May. Highly recommended."

It's a serene spot where bodies can settle, minds can still, hearts can open and spirits can soar.

Stayed with a pet","Cozy Cabin is as terrific as all the reviews and could not have been more perfect for my partner and me, starting with being welcome to our old husky, a reasonable price, completely clean, and a convenient location not far from downtown Silver City which still felt in the middle of nature. We saw a doe and fawn immediately upon arrival, and later a half-dozen or more deer including three fawns. Jan's freshly baked cookies, waiting on the kitchen counter, were delicious! Full kitchen, coffee and coffee maker, wifi, comfy bed and rocking chairs on the front porch, plus outdoor table and grill, though we did not grill. Whenever we are in the Silver City area, if we need lodging, we will be checking to see if this wonderful place is available. Thank you, Jan and Lew!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great place this is! It's located several hundred yards up off the street up a gravel road, and because it sits on a hill, there's a nice view of the hills to the northeast and the meadow below the cabin. We sat on the porch for hours and watched deer in the meadow (they ambled up to within twenty yards of the cabin to drink), and we watched the hummingbirds at the feeder in the tree by the porch in addition to watching goldfinches, quail, rabbits, and bluejays. It was SO peaceful!
The cabin is a studio with a very comfortable queen-size bed, a TV with DISH satellite service, a fully-furnished kitchen, and a nice bathroom.
Jan, the owner, lives in a house on the property, and she is very nice. She had homemade lemon bars for us in the cabin when we arrived.

The genial hosts are nearby if you need assistance with anything. Recommended!"

Lots of birds, and they have feeders,and a fun front porch. Great kitchen, lots of good information about the area in the bookcase. Cabin is simple, a little dark. Heating works but is a bit loud.

Stayed over a week","I stayed at the cozy cabin in late September, October, & November. I had a perfect Verizon signal. I saw quail, roadrunners, javelina, rabbits, and deer right outside the cabin. The stars were spectacular. The cabin has lots of natural light and is fairly well insulated. The window AC unit worked well when temps were in the low 80s. Two small space heaters warm up the cabin. The 700 sq ft cabin's open floor plan had plenty of room for this solo traveler. The full kitchen is similar to the size of a small apartment kitchen and was very comfortable for me. The cabin is surrounded by homes on three sides (including the hosts' house) but beautiful alligator juniper & oak trees provide privacy. I rarely heard the neighbors. My dog barked at the dozens of partly domesticated and almost fearless deer that permanently reside on the property. The hosts were warm, welcoming, and receptive to feedback."

Watching the deer, rabbits, quail, and birds was so fun and relaxing.

Stayed a few nights","A lovely house with a great location one block north of Rt 180. We walked into town from the house and window shopped one evening. The house is super clean with everything you need. Nice linens, lots of light quilts to layer as needed. We hate duvets (either too hot or too cold, and we wonder if the host ever washes them), so were glad to see the quilts. We appreciate the Brita filter, central heat, gated, fenced yard and dishwasher. The porch looks like an inviting place to hang out, but it was a little too cold (February) and we had too much business to attend to on this trip. We left a few books for the lending library. There are also a few games. We played our guitar and mandolin one night, and we weren't loud, but we didn't need to worry about bothering anyone. The only thing I would want to change would be the bed. It needs a sturdier frame so it doesn't jiggle and wake one of us up when we turn over or get in and out. If that could be fixed, we would be delighted to return."

The inside of the house is colorfully decorated with a nice sized bathroom. The bathroom and kitchen are well-appointed with many of the necessities for bathing and cooking. There are a few live plants in the house on which Colette had placed ornaments and/or lights to make the living room and kitchen festive for the holidays!!

Silver City has much to recommend it— nice shops/galleries, great food co-op, tasty food (Jalisco’s is great). We explored a bit of Boston Hill for in town hiking—lots more options outside town we’ll have to check out next time.
Excellent visitors center—great place for ideas for EVERYTHING in the area—history, museums, events, activities, food. The manager was a wealth of information. Also the university (WNMU) has an outstanding collection of Mimbres pottery.
Colette’s place was a wonderful place to rest and relax while taking in Silver City’s many riches! Highly recommended."

The beds and furniture are comfortable, and the shower is great! The kitchen was well-appointed for the several meals that we prepared ""from scratch"" during our stay. There are several pleasant outdoor spaces at Colette's that we loved, and the neighborhood is off the beaten path and quiet. There is also a small but nice botanical garden to explore just a short walk away. Colette is a very sweet and responsive host. Highly recommended, and we hope to be back one day!"

Stayed a few nights","Colette’s house was perfect for our needs. The location is just right for walking to town, yet very quiet at night for good sleeping! This house has two outdoor spaces- one shared with Colette’s house, and a private one in back- we used both. The outdoor spaces have lovely landscaping and the neighborhood is surrounded by large trees. The rental itself is very comfortable- comfortable furniture and beds. The kitchen has all manner of cooking utensils and made for very easy meal preparation. Although the home is cheerfully and artfully decorated, it wasn’t “over-done”. (We have stayed at rentals that had WAY too much decor you had to move to function). There is no TV, but we would rather not have one. Colette is very quick to respond to correspondence and her rental is reasonably priced. We will stay here again the next time we visit Silver City."

The house shares a fully fenced landscaped yard with the owner, but there's lots of privacy with a separate patio as well as deck and terrace. We really appreciate how well equipped it is with the basics for cooking, a water filer and coffee pods for the Keurig. We liked the wifi but not having a tv.

The host's home is on the same property, but we hardly knew she was there. Privacy fences shield the view of other nearby houses. Prepare to be enchanted while sitting on the front porch or patio!
We were charmed upon walking into the large, bright living/dining/kitchen area which features eclectic decor and artwork, as well as comfy furnishings. The kitchen was well-equipped with everything we needed. Comfortable beds, spacious closets, and a handy washer/dryer unit made things easy. We look forward to staying here again!"

The downtown area is so cute and transports you to another era. People in Silver City are so warm and welcoming. I’ve never felt so comfortable walking around exploring town.
The space itself is amazing. It’s decorated in a comfy and eclectic style. The home is equipped with full amenities (laundry, full kitchen, Keurig, porches). The rooms are spacious with plenty of storage. And we loved sitting out on the porch, listening to the cicadas sing and walking through the neighborhood to stargaze.
Colette herself is super friendly and hospitable. I’d recommend her and this space."

The bed in the master bedroom is queen sized and of moderate firmness and quiet comfortable. I'm a light sleeper, and really appreciated how incredibly quiet the house is at night. Artwork throughout the house is varied and interesting. Colette is a really nice host, and was accessible if we needed anything, but left us to ourselves otherwise. When leaving, I had forgotten an item and she was more than accommodating in arranging for a friend of mine that lives in the area to swing by and pick it up. We will be visiting Silver City off and on in the future now that friends live there, and I know we have a 'home away from home' with Colette's AirBnB. Five stars all the way."

Stayed a few nights","We recently planned a visit to see a friend in Silver City who recently opened up a new art gallery. After searching properties in the downtown historic district, we decided on “Quiet Place In Town” since we needed 2 separate bedrooms for 3 of us. We were greeted by Johanna when we arrived and she made sure we had everything we needed. The lovely home was very well stocked with towels, bedding, kitchen tools and even some non perishable food items. The layout was great. Nice large kitchen with dishwasher and the beds were comfortable. Clean and spacious bathroom. Colette made sure we always had an open line of communication available. We really enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back again. Silver City is a hidden gem and “Quiet Place In Town” is the place to stay! Thank you Colette and Johanna."

The apartment is comfortable and well laid out, with a large, clean bathroom, well stocked kitchen and comfortable sitting area. There is also outdoor seating though we didn’t use it since the weather was cool. The beds are comfortable but you may want to bring a book light if you plan to read in bed. Our only concern was that we found the WiFi signal to be weak and sometimes had difficulty connecting to it. Overall, we were very happy with our stay."

The location, at the end of the road, was a nice surprise. And the friendliest neighborhood kitties as well. Her attention to detail was a special touch - the lotion, bath soaps and salts and overall cleanliness. Having a washer and dryer was also much appreciated! The wifi isn't reliable, but we were okay with that as it forced us to chat instead of hang out on our glowing boxes. I'd recommend this place to anyone."

The location is perfect. It is only a short walk to the main downtown district yet it is as quiet as being in the country.
Tyga and Laura were very friendly and responsive to any questions and went above and beyond to address any query that I had.
I had a very positive experience staying here and am sure you will too!"

Easily walkable to many good restaurants, cafes, and shops. The ONLY slightly negative thing I have to say is that I don’t understand why we couldn’t park closer when there was an open spot right next to the house. I wouldn’t give it a lower rating because of that, just seemed kind of strange and I don’t love leaving my car out of sight."

So much history in Silver City, we did not get to visit places we wanted to see or hike. We are hikers and Boston Hill was perfect for morning hikes. We did have to drive to other trails around the city. The trails are beautiful and hopefully we will do more hikes another time. Great place to stay.

I understand that was a rule but literally that was my only gripe. Other than that, it was a very wonderful place to stay in and it was very peaceful and quiet.

Stayed a few nights","I was very excited to see this place available for a few days after having wanted to stay here for a number of years! Previously, it has always being booked during my trips to Silver (until now.) The architecture of the structure is very unique and welcoming. The Casita was quiet.
However, I had a very difficult time breathing during our trip due to a strong mold smell. There was obvious water damage above the bed. I am personally tired of paying high cleaning fees for air b n bs that are not clean upon check in, specifically, this place had hair in the shower and was very dusty/musty.
I was so looking forward to this stay and was disappointed that I had to manage my normally well controlled asthma and got little sleep when I had a busy slate of work and job interviews lined up for Friday.
If you are looking for a quiet, restful, cute place with an attentive host this could be for you; IF you don't have any breathing challenges."

There were dead and living roaches, spiders, and various bugs inside the space. It was rather unsettling. We are outdoorsy and spent 5 days camping after our stay. We encountered more bugs inside the airbnb than we did camping! If bugs make you squeamish and you’re not looking for an earthy experience, this probably isn’t the place for you.
Otherwise, the airbnb is conveniently located and in walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, and hiking trails."

The kitchen was organized and well stocked with all the necessary culinary tools, pots and pans, and dishes. The bathroom towels are oversized, thirsty, and plentiful. The full size washer and dryer looked brand new and laundry detergent was provided (and not rationed). The queen size mattress is comfortable and the sheets were soft.

We loved waking up to the sunshine against the tall trees from bedroom windows. And the well-stocked kitchen, living room, and sun room are also nice spaces to spend time in. The host has arranged everything in a tasteful and attractive way. All told, the house makes an ideal base from which to soak up all the wonders of Silver City and its natural environs.

We decided to name the apartment ""Grandma's Place."" No disrespect... it's just that the apartment has been perfectly restored to the 1950's, with of course, new appliences including a new washer/dryer on the property.
Parking was private, off street, and if Alessandro is around and you're a motor head as am I, have him show you his Italian motor bike collection as well as his antique Fiat truck. Don't miss it.
Alessandro's place is one of the best experiences we've had with vacation rentals."

Everything we needed was there. You can tell Alessandro has rented this place for several years. There were two options for parking and we took advantage of both during our 3 night stay. The location was very attractive and safe. Alessandro is an attentive hostess (and very knowledgeable of the area) without being annoying and in the way. He always was available and responded quickly to our occasional texts. We DEFINITELY will return to this charming apartment for another visit to Silver City.

The kitchen was perfect for making a quick meal, with all the kitchenware and utensils we could ever need. The leather sofa and arm chair in the living room were super inviting, the bed was nicely made up with cotton linens, and the dining nook in the kitchen was perfect. The area is very nice, quiet and safe, and a short walk to Silver City's historic downtown area for great coffee shops, bakery, galleries, book stores, etc. Alex met us when we arrived and was so helpful in telling us about things to do in the area. We hope to visit again soon!"

It is within walking distance to the quaint downtown area with several delightful restaurants, pubs, coffee spots, many terrific art galleries and antique shops.
We will come back and do more exploring and look forward to staying at Alessandro and Mileidy’s sweet apartment."

Everything that you needed was within walking distance. Nice little outside patio to watch the sunrise with a comfy bed with nice bedding. Shower head felt like a waterfall!

Alessandro's preparation for our arrival was beyond 5*. Brand new dishtowels, washing up items in the kitchen, etc. Bath towels looked new! This list goes on and on!! Alessandro seems to have though of everything.
This unit is in a group of similar others but neighbours were quiet and friendly.
An easy and delightful walk into town.
Kitchen counter space for meal preparation can be challenging but the kitchen table solves any issues in this department.
Thank you for a wonderful introduction into 1930s architecture and Silver City."

We were pumped to have a safe and easy place to store and lock our bikes while we were there. The Walton is super walkable to anywhere we wanted to go.
Alex and Mileidy left some lovely goodies for us to enjoy, which was a really sweet touch!

There’s loads of reading material about the history of the area in addition to useful maps and things. The kitchen is great, the nook is nice and bright and there are a few design ideas in there that I’ll use in my own little place back home!
I visited in August, and while there is an AC wall unit in the kitchen, I never needed to use it if I closed windows/doors during the day and opened up at night. There are ceiling fans in all the rooms and good screens on all the doors and windows.
I was worried that I’d hear neighbors or disturb them w my own noise, but it was lovely and quiet.
I’d absolutely love to stay here again. Thank u Alessandro!"

Also the sauce pans in the kitchen were corroded and deteriorated and should be replaced."

The decor is true to the vintage era with many fun touches of a particularly New Mexican flavor. The grounds are charming and full of friendly birds, and the location is great. It was a pleasant, easy walk to the main drag in town where the galleries, food co-op, restaurants and coffee spots can be found. We didn't have time to explore the gardens at WNMU, which are directly across the street, but it was nice to have the university, and the delightful public library, as neighbors. If you're looking for outdoor and cultural activities, Alessandro has thoughtfully curated all sorts of guides. I wish we had been able to stay longer than one night and will definitely be back again."

Downtown Silver City is a short walk and even shorter drive away. The place is spotless and spacious for one traveler. Well equipped kitchen with a nook that works well for working remotely. The biggest positive for me is that Alessandro lives nearby and is super responsive (responds in minutes), something I highly value in AirBNB rentals. The only downside is that heating is controlled centrally, i.e. the temperature cannot be adjusted. I was able to adjust the temperature to my liking by opening windows for a short period of times...that may bother others but did not bother me."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Alessandro's apartment and very much appreciated meeting him and having him come by to show us through. Much attention has been paid to making the space welcoming, attractive, functional and clean. Many of the original aspects of the apartment have been restored, and having done that sort of work ourselves we recognize the effort required to achieve it. It is lovely. It was also very quiet and peaceful.
The apartment has everything you might need to settle in, cook, and make yourself at home. We travel with a box of things like a sharp knife, condiments, a stick free frying pan, tissues, extra toilet paper, etc. Did not need anything from the “box”!
And the location is ideal. It's in easy walking distance to the university and downtown. We especially like the Western New Mexico University Museum. It has an outstanding collection of pottery – really outstanding, and it's just up the hill. Restaurants, groceries, shops – all nearby. We hope to be back again soon."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is perfect for 2 people. Even though there is a trundle bed in the living room, it would be crowded for 3 adults but perhaps a child would be OK. The place was spotless and very well cared for. The kitchen is well-stocked, there is an espresso maker and some coffee, and some wonderful fresh eggs. Alex was available if we needed anything. Even though Silver City does not recycle, he let us know that we could save our recycling items and he would pick them up and deliver to the recycling site. Highly recommended. Also, recommend Revel restaurant - not the usual run-of-the mill menu, good wine list and great, friendly staff. They offer a 3-course dinner with several food options, and it was difficult to make a choice. Everything was fresh and tasty. Also, found lunch at Little Toad Creek Brewery to be excellent - and friendly, efficient staff."

Stayed a few nights","One of the great things about Cherie's place is that, although it's in a local neighborhood, the peaceful and secluded setting gives one a true sense of solitude. Very quiet. Plenty of land between for much privacy. The only down-side was there was a bit of nearby road construction going on at the time of our visit. Of course, Cherie couldn't control that and that is only a temporary thing, anyway. And from the guest-house there was no tell-tell signs, no noise, no dust, nothing. The huge cottonwood trees that line the creek, which is just a few yards away, was great to have for bird watching as we sat outdoors to enjoy morning coffee. And, being just a few minutes from town was also a plus.
Cherie was a great host. Ever available but not intrusive. Thanks, Cherie, for making this trip a nice getaway."

This August was very hot throughout the SW and Silver City was no exception. The space had AC in one bedroom which we used but the interior was still warm for our taste during the day. However, early mornings we would open doors and windows - it was cool outside . We’ll definitely return but maybe in the spring or fall."

From the moment I booked the guesthouse, Cherie let me know not to hesitate to ask if there was anything I needed. She is 4 miles outside of Silver City and a great middle point for all the surrounding trails, and national parks. I felt like I was living in my little slice of heaven for the 9 days I was there and left feeling uplifted, relaxed and like I had a new friend. Thanks for sharing your beautiful place, including High Lonesome Book Store, with me! Truly a hidden gem."

It is only 1/2 mile from the boundary of the national forest, with excellent trails for biking and hiking. It is also about 3 miles from Silver City, which is an incredible little town. We fell in love with the City and the casita on our visit and would definitely go back."

The house is super clean and has everything you need. We didn’t want for anything! Cherie gives you all the privacy you want, but is available if you need anything. The creek was easy to cross in my Jeep and Cherie was great in letting me know how it looked, before I headed down, so I could determine what car to bring! I highly recommend Cherie’s place for a peaceful stay close to town."

Stayed a few nights","We found the location of Cherie's guest house to be just wonderful. It is only a few minutes from Silver City, yet it is out in the country, where there is no noise and beautiful evening skies.
The cottage had everything you could possibly need for a short stay, or an extended stay. We actually cooked a modest Thanksgiving dinner and had two friends over. The fresh turkey breast came out great.
The place is clean and fully stocked with anything you might need. I had forgotten my shampoo and conditioner, and was happy with the choices Cherie had. Also, I am often bothered by the strong smells that soaps and shampoos generally have, but Cherie had hypoallergenic soap in the bathroom, a huge plus.
The one issue I had was a bed with less support and firmness than I would have liked. But, I am 69 and have a lower back issue, so that might have exacerbated the fact that the bed was not supportive to me. Certainly we would stay there again, as the couch was very comfortable for me, and my partner did fine in the bed without me there."

The guest house was decorated with some very nice original artwork, and the book selection included several volumes by one of the owners. One was a very well written saga of a trip down the Gila river with his dog and a tomcat--and I had to get a copy. Cherie kindly had it autographed for us. The guest house is in the country, but just a few minutes from Silver City. We had a lovely time and would definitely stay here again!"

Comfortable chairs all around the porch to sit and enjoy the morning and evening. The pleasant climate and slow pace of Silver City also make this a great getaway. Cherie runs a bookshop and small press, and the bookshop in back of their main house - floor-to-ceiling with Western, Americana, outdoors, hunting/fishing, and regional history books - new, used, out-of-print - is a gem! We enjoyed talking with Cherie and her husband about their press and bookstore, and her husband's own non-fiction and fiction works set in the region."

The house is located in a beautiful area, very peaceful and quiet, yet only a short drive from Silver City. As I mentioned, she has provided some of the best directions I've ever encountered. There is a relaxed, casual aura to the whole place that envelopes you.

It's so fun to have a small house like this, instead of a hotel, when traveling with family. Having a common area for casual visiting is priceless . We had such a great time sitting on the porch, drinking coffee in the morning. Cherie's friendly, smiling dog kept polite, unobtrusive company with us."

She provided coffee/tea/hot chocolate, there were board games, and she even had out candle heaters we could turn on for a great smell. It was close to where we needed to be and we loved the firefly theme throughout which we think was inspired by a nearby petroglyph hike. the neighbors are a bit close but we didn't see them at all. There were roosters crowing in the morning but I needed to wake up around then anyways. a homeless person did ask for a cigarette while we were packing up, which was my only complaint. I would definitely love to come back again in the future if I need to come back to town"

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at Donna's place. It was our first visit to the area, and there were several things about her place that simplified things for us. She was really close to a main road, and that made getting around much easier. Second, she was very close to places to shop, so we weren't wandering around everywhere trying to locate retail shops. Third, there was a really cool trailhead just down the street from her place where we could walk our dogs and take in the natural beauty of Silver City. With the beauty and convenience of her place, plus the fact that it was so clean and pleasant and had everything we needed, we would certainly return. If you are looking for an out of the way, but convenient, clean place with a responsive host, you will love Donna's place! PS I really want to give special thanks to Donna, who offered to extend our check-out when one of our pets required emergency vet care. This was above and beyond, and we are so glad we had her support!"

The place was spotless and the kitchen was well appointed having everything we needed to feel comfortable. Sitting on the porch having morning coffee was a delight. Hiking trails were within walking distance. Donna was very responsive to our questions without intruding during our time there. We wold highly recommend this stay and we would definitely return during our next trip to Silver City. Thom

We loved that it was a dog friendly rental and she advised we bring a lead for our dogs outside which was a good idea. The only thing is the neighbors have a rooster that starts making noise really early, nothing that the host could control but be aware. Otherwise only a few mins from downtown silver city and there’s even a trail down the road from the rental. Would definitely recommend & would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","The space was great and this part of town is surprisingly quiet at night. There is some traffic out front in the early evening and early morning but nothing at all busy. The seating area/living room was very nice with a microwave, fridge, & plenty of room. The bedroom is spacious with a great view out front and the bathroom is small but surprisingly bigger than I expected. The shared kitchen across the hall is convenient and has pretty much anything you need except a large enough table if you have more than two people. However there is so much room in your private living room or there is also space out on the enclosed porch down the hall to sit. The downstairs porch is also very nice but I didn't make time to sit out there.
The location is great and the small restaurant across the street has some good breakfast burritos. A big plus is that it's walking distance to the the shops and restaurants on Bullard St. and the local farmers market on Saturday. I would definitely stay here again."

Thompson House is a beautifully restored home and they have created at least 3 rooms that can be rented. We were in Suite 2. It had a couch and 2 chairs in one room and a bed in the next room with huge windows. Loved all the light. The house and rooms were very well decorated. I want her to come help me with mine! There is a common sitting room in the front of the house and a kitchen area with coffee and tea. There is a mini fridge in the suite and a bigger fridge in the kitchen. We walked downtown to several restaurants. There are many art galleries near by . Some had odd hours and weren't open while we were there. We used this as our base for the Gila Cliff Dwelling adventure.
