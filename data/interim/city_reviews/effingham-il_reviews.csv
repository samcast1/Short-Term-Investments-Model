Stayed one night","I love how you can enter a code to unlock your door and lock it. I love the barn doors it makes the places look so classy!The huge king size bed was so comfortable! As for being next, to the bar I never heard any noise.The shower amazing, plenty of room plus a big showerhead ,and the next best thing when you stay at an Airbnb is having a washer and dryer and they were so fancy.Thank you Janice and John you have a very beautiful and comfortable place and I can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed one night","What a great place! I arrived late and had to leave early, but still was able to get some work done. I rely heavily on wifi and The Shoe Inn had a great lightning quick connection! Exactly what I needed!
From the time you enter the front door, The Shoe Inn was immaculent! Everything you need is right there. So clean. The electric fireplace is a visual. Not sure if I was really tired or it was the comfort of the bed and pillows, but I don't think I moved the entire night. I didn't check in until 10:30pm, so the bar connected to the Inn was alive for a Saturday night. The noise... barely heard it and was no issue at all as I had work to do.
I highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity whether it be one night or more. I'm definitely going to keep a lookout for it on future trips to the area."

Stayed one night","I reserved at the last minute and it was quick and easy to pay and have access on short notice. The apt was cute, super clean, and I was able to park right outside the front door which gave comfort as I was transporting expensive items in my vehicle. The local grocery/general store was located right next door so I was able to grab a beer when I arrived and get coffee, a fountain drink, and a ham and cheese sandwich in the morning for the road which cost less than $5! Lovely space! The only issue I had was the keypad to get in. It was a bit fussy for me and took multiple tries to get in."

However, after spending the day and most of the evening driving in rain, heavy fog and construction..walking in was like ""ahhhhhh"". So cozy and immaculate that I was instantly comfortable. We were very happy with our evening there. The bed is SUPER comfortable and the place is darling."

Stayed one night","I chose the Shoebox Inn despite it being out of my way, and I’m so glad I did! Honestly it ended up being one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in.
It was easy enough to find, had parking right in front, and felt safe enough even with me being a solo female traveler.
Once inside, it was clear that everything was new and sparkly clean. The washer and dryer was an added bonus. I would note that guests need to supply their own laundry detergent; I was glad I had some on hand!
I was able to hear the bar next door, but really only when using the bathroom. It was peaceful and quiet when it came time for me to go to sleep.
I’d definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Great overnight stay in Teutopolis. Easy to find, very cute studio type unit. Very well appointed, perfect accommodations for a short or long stay. While there is a train crossing about a 1/4 mile away, noise was not an issue. I heard only two trains go through the area while I was there and I don't believe either blew its horn (besides, I like the sound of trains passing...). The owners are very congenial and helpful and respond to messages immediately. They offered suggestions on nearby restaurants and best ways to venture about the area. Also, great beer specials and friendly people at the gaming bar next door. As Arnold once said, ""I'll be back""."

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay in this quaint space! It was the perfect size for two for an overnight visit to the area. There was a little bit of sound from the bar next door but not enough to disrupt our sleep. Don’t let the location deter you from staying here. Great space that is well-decorated and perfectly-stocked!
The only downside was the local coffee shops & restaurants are closed on Sunday morning but there are plenty of available places in the neighboring town (Effingham). We had a great breakfast at Niemerg’s which is a very popular local restaurant."

Stayed one night","Cute and clean! Exactly as described! Got a late start on my drive so couldn’t make it to my original destination, and I am so glad! Found the Shoebox Inn it was the perfect stay. Easy to access. I parked right in front, and could take my suitcase in without having to deal with steps.
As in the host description, the space is attached to the pub. I could hear some of the chatter and music through the wall but it wasn’t particularly loud and didn’t keep me awake. And if I’d needed them, there was a white noise machine and ear plugs.
Comfortable bed.
The window faces the street and sidewalk and the blackout curtains allowed for complete privacy.
Look forward to coming back through this way again and having a little more time so I can enjoy the fireplace and go to the pub and game room with nice wooden shoe motif.
Janice and John were very responsive, helpful, and polite!"

Stayed a few nights","LOVED the ShoeInn!! We were visiting family in Teutopolis, so the location was perfect!! Super clean, just like the pics. Whoever designed, did a great job. I've stayed in hotels that were not nearly as nice, plus what a steal!!
The hosts-and friends had warned that there might be a noise issue due to a gaming place literally next door (shares walls). However, it was only talking we ever heard, kind of like when your roommate is talking too loud in their room. All we did was shut the bathroom door & the vestibule door-the only places you could actually hear it-and we were fine! We had a speaker to listen to just in case, and the host provides earplugs (didn't use) & a white noise machine (accidentally turned it on then couldn't figure out where the fan was coming from!).
Super clean & cozy-loved the fireplace!! Will definitely stay again!

The sound machine helped except for the base of the music. I was there for a retreat/conference and was up early so not a lot of sleep. But if I was passing through town or visiting family in the area it would have been perfect. I just needed more sleep :-) If you are there for business or conference just be aware of the noise factor.

It is attached to the bar next door, but wasn’t a huge deal and hosts provide white noise machine and ear plugs. Really only noisy where I was like “what’s going on” when someone was winning the jackpot on the slot machine apparently haha. Bed was super comfy so I just slid the door shut and was out like a light. The fireplace is the main heat source and adds some nice glow to the room at night too."

Appreciate the honesty about the noise potential from the bar, it was only barely noticeable and did not prevent me from getting a great night's sleep in that big bed. Thank-you Janice and John!"

Stayed one night","We’ve stayed at quite a few properties, and this was hands down the best one. Clearly Janice & John know what they’re doing and you can tell a lot of time, energy, sweat and creative thinking went into this hidden gem.
Every single detail is accounted for and the well laid out instructions are second to none.
The space is modern, well designed, well built, comfy, safe and so clean you could eat off the floor. The holiday decor was the cherry on top.
Being connected to an elegant bar & a Saturday night, we wondered how it would play out. Never heard a thing other than some very faint music while in the shower, and who doesn’t like tunes in the shower ? We’re convinced the walls have been soundproofed.
We will stay nowhere else when passing through in the future if it’s available. Cool little town and an amazing place. We’d give it 10 stars if it were possible."

Stayed one night","Unfortunately I was cancelled last minute so I’m not sure why I’m being asked to review but 1 star was all I could muster as this was a rather significant inconvenience. I’m a post Covid PTSD Nurse survivor and my therapy dog is retiring and my new pup in training is taking his place. This shouldn’t of been reason to cancel and I didn’t have time or energy to fix it as I was traveling post holidays on an unexpected timeline. I ended up staying in an over priced scary motel in the middle of the Midwest. I save lives, and I’m struggling to save my own health in a broken and delayed system. Shame on you for not allowing my fur children who are literally saving my life helping me fight night terrors by placing my in a situation out of my comfort zone.

The fireplace and the Christmas decorations made the room feel so cozy. We loved that it was right next door to the bar. We went next door and talked to the locals. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. If we would have been in town longer, I would have liked to check out the other establishments in town, but it was a short trip. Oh, we did stop at the winery before checking in. There is also a very nice winery about 5 minutes from there. Long story short, this place was perfect and we plan to stay there again!"

One thin top layer blanket had a few super light stains, but nothing I could have complained about. We didn't need to use it anyway, so no biggie for us. I would absolutely book here again if we were to visit. Great location next to literally everything!"

Stayed one night","We stayed only one night on our way through on a road trip. I did not know the area, just chose it based on the distance we were wanting to travel that day. I was a bit nervous because I got an AMAZING rate (too good to be true) so I thought the area might not be good. WOW! We were so impressed! The area was perfect just off the Hwy with Walmart, gas stations, many restaurants both sit down and quick serve, shops, liquor store all within walking distance! The lobby was very clean and modern looking. The hostess was at the desk and greeted us immediately. Check in took 5 min at most and she told us we could use the pool and breakfast was included even though we booked through AirB&B (some places don’t allow this). The pool was super warm and clean. Very quiet even though we were near an elevator. Room was beautiful, clean, looked like the pictures and was huge. A/C worked great and Internet was fast! Check out was easy just dropped the key cards at the desk. definitely worth $."

Stayed with kids","Imy daughter birthday stay was cut short we got into the room after 7pm on saturday and we left the next morning and didnt go bk she slept with her hood up and tightly pulled and tied. She was embarrassed because her friend saw the conditions of the mattresses and Mattress pads. On both king bed and pull out we had to put down towels and sheets over the couch and bed to lay down TO COVER THE hair everywhere. URINE/fecal/BLOOD MAYBE? STAINS ON THE PADS AND MATTRESSES IT WAS THE DEATH NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR HER TEEN BIRTHDAY WEEKEND. WHEN I LOOKED AT REVIEWS THERE WERE MANY OF THE SAME INCIDENTS HAPPENING TO LOTS OF GUESTS AND THE RESPONSES FROM THE HOTEL WERE TO STATE OVER AND OVEHEY WERE ISOLATED INCIDENTS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING the volume of complaints. In all these cases, there is not any resulted in a refund of any kind. AIR BNB WAS THE ONLY WAY ID END UP THERE.(LAQUINTA). I thought airbnb ""weeded out the weakness"". 1 was there from 7pm check in to 7 pm the next day."

We are pet transporters and it can be hard to find places that let you have more than 2 pets. We had 4 cats with us on this trip. I asked ahead of booking and was told they are pet friendly. I will tell everyone I know about this experience. I'm sure we will use it again."

There was a man having a mental health crisis staying in the hotel but she took control of the situation promptly, and made all the guests feel safe. She even escorted Guests to their rooms for additional safety, even though the person was already removed by law-enforcement. Although this situation was not her fault, she apologized profusely, took exceptional care of each, and everyone of us. Very reassuring. Deidra was outstanding!!"

Stayed one night","How lucky for us that we stopped for an overnight stay in Effingham, Illinois, during our cross-country drive from Los Angeles to New York. Determined to get a small town experience, we booked Michael and Teagan's loft apartment in a 100-year-old converted bank on this charming town's main street. The apartment could easily be in Manhattan, with exposed brick, hardwood floors, and oversized windows. It was the perfect space to unwind, with a comfortable kitchen, living room and separate bedroom and bath. Why would anyone stay at a boring chain hotel on the interstate when this kind of memorable accommodation is just a few miles away? We absolutely LOVED Effingham and our 24 hours there was a true highlight of our trip."

Stayed a few nights","The loft is an amazing space. No negatives about inside of the unit or the location.
Cons:
Sound —You share a wall with another loft. Unlucky, but there was a bridal party in it and I could hear over a dozen excited women squealing and stomping around for hours at a time. You can hear even normal level conversations from the other unit .
Host — after the bridal party finally left I took a nap. I woke to some man standing in the middle of the apartment talking. One of Startled, I jumped out of bed confused thinking someone had broken In. The host. This is unacceptable and warrants 0 stars. He didn’t message first or call, etc . He said he wanted to check the water since another part of the building had an issue. But he took my word for it not being an issue and didnt even check it . Again, clearly could’ve and should’ve messaged first. Especially coming from a host that needs you to tell them you’ve checked in and sends you an optional cleaning to do list for your final night ."

Squeaky clean and modern in every inch of the loft. So much to do just steps from the loft like fine dining, great bars, awesome shopping (I bought a classic Babe Ruth framed photo from the 1920’s and my wife bought all kinds of clothes!) The nook in the loft is amazing! The bed is completely comfortable. Shower head was uniquely designed and felt great! Bathroom pristine. Kitchen pristine. TV was HUGE! Parking was right behind the building and easy to navigate and we met so many unbelievably charming and nice people throughout the entire downtown area . This was the best weekend getaway my wife and I have ever taken and we will be coming back again and again in the future. Thank you Michael and Ann! Keep rocking it out!!!"

Stayed with a pet","We needed a place to unwind and get good rest on our way from Florida to Wisconsin. We stayed here on drive day 2 of 3, and were exhausted when we got to Effingham. The place was easy to find, instructions were clear and I was able to get into the lock box and then the loft in just a few minutes. There are a lot of stairs to walk up when you first come in, and no elevator, so keep that in mind if you don’t do well with stairs or dont like stairs. The loft space is incredible! Wide-open concept and ceilings that had to be about 15 feet high or more. They had the place spotless clean like a model loft getting ready to be photographed for a magazine. They had a free bottle of wine waiting for me, which was much needed on this trip. We stayed up a few hours after arrival, playing shuffleboard, which is one of my favorite things to play. The bed was really comfortable, the shower was super cool, the bathroom clean, and it was just amazing staying there. The hosts are super amazing too!"

Stayed with a pet","My family has stayed a handful of times at this Airbnb and every time we come back, it seems like they've added a new little touch or detail to make things more personal and enjoyable.
I can honestly say this is the cleanest place I've EVER stayed outside of my own home - they pay attention to even the smallest of cleaning details that it seems like a lot of other places tend to overlook.
The hosts are very responsive and proactive!
We could occasionally hear the neighbors in the next door unit, which was a first for us (we chalked it up to holiday excitement), but everyone respected the quiet time hours and all was well!
We will continue to be returning guests any time we're in the area!"

Stayed one night","This rental is everything it says it is, clean, nicely appointed, in a great area. However, we had an issue with noisy neighbors. With the renovation of the space, there is a wall that is not original brick and may be just a drywall wall between two units allowing noise to transfer very easily. The people next door were having a gathering and were very loud, so much so that we could not sleep. It was as if they were sitting in our living area. I called the host at midnight and asked her to intervein. She got ahold of the people next door, and everything was quiet by 12:30. Hopefully it was a one time issue, however, we only got 5 1/2 hours of sleep and had to drive 7 hours the next morning. If it were not for the noise issue, I would have rated it a 5."

This was my parents first AirBnB experience and they were absolutely blown away. The building is an old bank that is newly (beautifully) renovated, very clean, and the hosts have obviously tried to think of everything you need to have a comfortable stay. We weren't sure what to expect, but the town of Effingham is so unexpectedly quaint, with friendly locals, a farmer's market on Saturday mornings, and a beautiful town museum. Very walkable and doggy-friendly! Highly recommend staying here for both the AirBnB and to experience all that Effingham has to offer. Wouldn't mind heading back for relaxing mini vacation! We were sad to leave! Thank you to the hosts for a great weekend."

The place was spacious, fully stocked bathroom and kitchen (including kid plates, which my toddler loved), and check-in was a breeze. The local town was cute too - we ordered from Joe's Pizza then picked up breakfast at Daylight Donuts and Fox Holler, all locales that came recommended in the well-done visitors guide that Katy provided. We are already planning a trip back to Effingham for a visit rather than just a stopover and would love to stay in Katy's place again."

Learned how to play a few of the games there, and learned I am pretty great at shuffleboard lol. The book nook is adorable, there's plenty of books to keep you busy for a weekend in, and I love how stocked it is. Last Airbnb we went to, gave us two towels for a week stay and almost no utensils. This one was well stocked on everything, including pots, pans, plates, cups etc. Even had shampoo and conditioner etc there for use. Bed and couch is super soft. I love it. Recommend Fox Holler coffee. We are already planning to come back here early fall or next year in the spring."

Stayed with kids","Unfortunately we had to cancel this trip because our child started running a fever in the early morning hours when we were supposed to leave. I hate having to cancel plans last minute, but Michael and Katy are such gracious hosts that they were understanding and empathetic to the situation. Seriously, they set the standard for Airbnb hosts - I will always compare my stays elsewhere to my stays at the XCHNG Lofts. Even though we had to cancel our stay this time, this will always be the first place we check availability at when we need to stay in the area. 10/10 recommend."

Starting with the communication with the hosts, they couldn’t have been any more helpful. The place is amazing in every way. The decor, the amenities, the cleanliness. The location downtown was perfect. My wife and I worked remotely with a perfect setup of a standing/sitting desk and great WiFi. We were walking distance to coffee and breakfast in the morning, and great dinner spots and local brewery and wine bar at night. It all was next level. If you’re looking to stay in or around Effingham, there’s no question where you should stay. Thanks again to our amazing hosts!"

The furnishings are top notch, the bed incredibly comfortable, the kitchen has any and all items you would need to prepare a meal, and the location is central to all things Effingham. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning countless times as we return to the area to visit family. By far one of the best Airbnb’s we have had the privilege of staying in."

It truly is an effing wonderful home base for exploring Central Illinois (visit Mattoon for the Bagelfest! It’s BYOB though - bring your own bagel.).
Michael and Katy were super responsive and flexible to our itinerary. It made check-in/check-out a breeze. Major gratitude, y’all!"

Stayed a few nights","This may possibly be one of the best Air B and Bs my husband has ever stayed at. The décor, the cleanliness, the responsiveness of the hosts, the location - everything about it is a 10. We come to Effingham a couple of times a year to visit my husband's family and we will only stay here going forward. We bring our two little Morkies and it is so much more room for them here than in a hotel room. The pictures don't do it justice, it is a huge space with lots of room and high ceilings. The parking is a breeze. The steps to load and unload the luggage are a little strenuous, but nothing to stop us from staying again. It is walking distance to many bars and restaurants. They have a shuffleboard game in the living room. There was plenty of anything you needed within the loft - toilet paper, dish detergent, laundry detergent, etc. I cannot say enough great things about this place!"

Stayed with kids","A Beautiful open modern Apartment nestled in the heart of Effingham, IL. With courteous and professional host, you will have everything taken care of before you step into the door. This was our first air b&b experience and loved the ease of ""checking in"" at our own convenience with no need to wait on a host or let them know our schedule like a bed and breakfast. It was very nice to be able to throw in some laundry before we went to bed and have coffee at our convenience in the morning. The decor is perfect for the space. Michael and Katie made sure we had ample of bedding needed with the double mattress height air up mattresses. The appliances are all up to date if you want to warm up any food and the basic but classy plateware will cover all your needs. If we need to stay in town again, this will be our first choice."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay here. The pictures are accurate and its a beautiful loft. It made us feel like we are in a sleek modern / urban New York city apartment with all the exposed brick and piping. Very cool. The loft is literally right down town and there are multiple small boutiques, restaurants, and grocery store all within a minutes walk.
Michael was very accommodating and responsive to text messages. We even brought our 3 month old and they set up a pack n play for her to sleep in at night. This really helped us keep down the amount of stuff we had to bring for her so it was a huge help.
The only issue you may run into (which wasn't a problem for us) is that there are a lot of stairs to get up to the loft. So if you struggle climbing stairs then you may have a little bit of a hard time getting up and down them.
Thanks again to you both and we will definitely be back. 5 out of 5 stars overall."

Had plenty of room to cook and be together comfortably. Kitchen was well outfitted and plenty of towels and comfortable beds with nice pillows. It was too cold in January to enjoy the beautiful outdoor spaces with lake and dock but that would certainly be a huge plus in the summer months. Communication was good and check-in was easy and contactless as well as check-out. We had a great weekend and I would rent here again.

I'm very picky about my linens. I could smell how clean they were. The pillows were so comfy. The bath towels smelled fresh and were soft. I look for dust and dirt. Didn't see any!!! The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe the entire time. Host did a great job of communicating. I didn't have many questions since instructions were made clear from the start. I liked that a guide to the area was made handy on the coffee table. Overall this was a WONDERFUL experience. Look forward to booking again in the future.

In a previous trip I had asked if there was regular coffee pot rather than a single cup type. For this trip the hosts provided me the pot I preferred without me even asking.
A small thing, maybe but says volumes about them."

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for 3 months and it was AMAZING! It had everything I could think or needed in the kitchen. Great washer and dryer and very nice bathroom. The kitchen and amenities are all modern with stainless steal appliances, new washer/dryer, great shower, etc. When I arrived it was very clean. It is very cute from the inside and out. I never had any problems with the Wi-Fi during my stay and it was fast. I actually had no problems while I was there! The backyard has cute landscaping. It is located behind a nice and safe subdivision. I took walks throughout the week around the subdivision. It is a quite area and still located 10-15 minutes from chain restaurants and stores. Located 1 minute down the road is a gas station/mini mart for all the last minute things you would need as well as a few local bars with good bar food! The hosts are quick to respond. For people who are staying for a short-time or have a quick turn around the breakfast set up is nice with teas, coffees, Keurig, to-go cups, oatmeal. etc. The two televisions were great lots of options on what to watch as well as easy hook up to your netflix, hulu, etc. Comfortable mattress and pillows! I felt very comfortable there and was able to get a good nights sleep on the first few nights of being in a new and unfamiliar place which is very important!"

Any traveler, especially those who travel as much as we do, would be blown away by this little place. Cool old house... completely renovated and done in ways that utilizes every inch of the kitchen/ laundry/ bathroom space. Dug the perfectly balanced sliding door to the laundry, the English phone booth styled shower, Pikes coffee with cream... but our favorite was the tall, thin & handsome blue refrigerator... Seriously, great jobs guys... we loved it..."

Stayed one night","Incredible stay! Very large one bed room space for my wife and I. Wonderfully decorated, spotless clean, fresh sheets, and FINALLY a comfortable bed! That is more than enough, however that is not all you get. For the price if less than a Holiday Inn or similar stay, you get an entire kitchen fully stocked with a fridge stove microwave dishes and utensils, a spacious bathroom with a great shower, your own washer dryer, and an entire living room complete with a big screen tv. Once you wake up I suggest making yourself a complementary cup of coffee and sitting out on the back porch and listening to the church bell tower ring out the time (loud enough to hear outside but not inside). Mary and Ryan were incredible hosts, we got into the house pretty late and they accommodated us with ease. Keyless entry to the home made check in and out quick and painless. If you’re going to be in the area, stop looking for a place to stay, you just found it."

My stay was a longer duration as part of a move and the location was wonderfully appointed for temporary executive living. It also has everything needed for a fun weekend get away. Outstanding and helpful hosts that genuinely want you to enjoy your experience and want for nothing.

Stayed one night","This little home is a an exceptionally clean and unique modern tuck away from the city of Effingham. Great if you're looking for a quick place to get away for the night. Clean spacious kitchen and work table if you need to get some things done. Excellent WIFI! Check in communication was phenomenal and I had no issues during my stay. Side comment for anyone driving to the place at night, looks like the general neighborhood is under construction and expanding. Some map systems might not take you straight to the location, but if you continue East on State street you should see a mailbox with ""112"" on the other side of the street opposing the residence. Thanks Mary and Ryan!"

Thanks for being a great host and easy to work with. It was great to have a place to sleep and shower before the wedding we where attending. We had so much fun just sitting around the living room on friday night and catching up with family. Family is something that is very important to us and we realize sitting around and catching up like we did at your house is something we could not have done at a hotel like we did in your house.
We are assuming you live in the house beside the Airbnb. If this is the case we really appreciate the privacy you gave us.
Thanks again for the great stay and privacy.

The only thing that may bother some, it’s pretty close to the train track & the train horns are loud when outside. I slept so well that I didn’t hear them. Also I didn’t really notice them inside the house.
Jerry & Fran stopped by to say, hello. Very nice host. We were very comfortable there & the house had everything we could possibly need or want. I also loved that it had a drip coffeemaker & Keurig coffee maker.
Thank you Jerry & Fran."

There are two bedrooms on the first floor, so this is only a concern for the two queen beds and two twin beds that are upstairs. You can also hear the train go by at night, but most of us only heard it once and were able to fall back asleep easily. All in all, this is a great place to stay in T-town! Walking distance to the church and KC hall is a huge perk too!"

The house offered plenty of space for each of us to sleep comfortably and even a pack n play for our baby. The house has lots of character and was very modern and beautifully decorated!

Jerry communicated very well and check in was super easy! The only things that weren’t exactly impressive was there was food items left in the fridge and the little flies flew when I opened it up. The dishwasher wasn’t emptied either but at least it had run the wash cycle.

Stayed with kids","There was so much we enjoyed and appreciated about this house! It was clean, and has a modern, classy style and decor with quality appliances, cabinetry, countertops, etc... It was very spacious for our large family, and is in a nice area for family walks. It was interesting to look at the old, collectible items in some of the closets, like older books, classic board games, antique typewriter and more. The bedding was very comfortable, the master shower was great, and the kitchen well stocked.
The upstairs bedrooms were a bit warm, maybe it’s just this time of year, but if anyone in your group has issues/health issues where it might be a problem for them, then you might want to plan to have them sleep downstairs. It did cool down overnight though. Jerry was very accommodating to allow us an early check in. Overall, a great stay for our family of nine!"

Jerry was very communicative, kind, and helpful! We had one of the absolute best times, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. It was absolutely the comforts of home without actually being home. The bathroom was incredible, the kitchen was a dream, and all of the updates were such a great touch! It was also so kid friendly! We had a little tornado with us, and it was set up with little ones in mind too. When we arrived we had a very minor issue with one of the lights. It was absolutely no big deal, but he went above and beyond to accommodate what he felt was an inconvenience to us. The sleeping accommodations were absolutely fantastic. We are already planning our next girls weekend and a couples weekend for later this year! Every little detail you could think of was taken care of. You will fall in love with Jerry’s just like we did!"

I have bragged about This place to so many friends and had to show pictures of the decor . Researched the building after our stay so interesting. A hidden gem . Hosts always gave quick response . We were lucky enough to pass through the area twice in one week and stay in the three bedroom and the one bedroom loft. The only complaint my husband had was no tv in bedroom of the one bedroom loft . I have no complaints at all . ;). This place is above and beyond expectations.

Awesome views from the apartment, overlooking the heart of the downtown area, which was quaint and scenic. As soon as you walk out of the apartment, there’s a great restaurant to eat at that’s also kid friendly just a few steps away. The hosts outlined every aspect of the stay perfectly, also laying out recommendations of where to eat and places to go. I could go on and on about this place, but it’d be too long of a review for someone to probably want to read. To sum it up, don’t miss out on this fantastic opportunity to stay at this amazing place. My 6 year old and I did not want to leave. We will definitely be booking this place in the future again!"

Stayed with kids","This place is the bomb. If you are anywhere near Effingham, don’t hesitate to book your stay here. Everything was clean and high quality. The games were great. It was fun to be in a loft, looking down on the town. I was sad that the brewery has closed down, but there were plenty of other options. The farmer’s market was great. Historic downtown was cool. The stairs up to the loft entrance are not easy with suitcases, so be aware of that. It wasn’t a problem for us, but it could be for others. Overall, this place was relaxing and quiet for my family but it would also be a fantastic meeting place for family reunions, etc. My family really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

It was a nice relaxing time for the two of us. It was our anniversary and it was a well needed trip. I’d recommend this place to anyone with any kind of getaway in mind. Lots of room for kids or just a romantic weekend.
Really my only complaint was going up and down the stairs. But I’m old so that is not the owner fault :) I do wish that it was brighter in the stairwell."

Stayed about a week","If you want or need to visit folks in central/southern Illinois, or are traveling through - this place is perfect. I rented two units to create the perfect thanksgiving/early xmas gathering, and I truly could not have asked for more. Big, bright, beautiful spaces. Modern decor, great amenities (shuffleboard, games, washer/dryer) - all the things I needed to entertain my four kids, two grandkids, and my daughters partners - who all live in Illinois while I live in California. The exposed brick, all the wood, big tvs, and comfy furniture - yes, please. The giant kitchen islands with stools - perfect for where every family gathers - but completely open to the living area. Restaurants of every flavor in every direction, arcade, wine store, shops and boutiques... I could not have asked for more. We'll be back if they'll have us - for sure. Having stayed in amazing airrbnbs all over the country, it ranks among the best. Not a bad spot for a staycation or remote working need as well."

It’s spacious, impeccably clean and the basket of keurigs, the bottled water and the offer of a bottle of wine makes you feel right at home. The beds are comfy, each room has tons of space and fun games like Asteroids are the icing on this cake. Katy and Michael are fantastic to work with and any time I had a question about they responded in seconds. I cannot think of one thing that needs to be better. Oh and the downtown location cannot be beat! Within walking distance to bars, restaurants and a grocery store. They even have white noise machines even though I didn’t need it to sleep. I usually do! Thanks for the best experience."

This is a beautiful loft. The view from the living room is so beautiful and even though it is downtown on a busy street, it was very quiet.
This is a 3 bedroom loft. Each bedroom was very comfortable with high end linens. Everyone enjoyed a very restful sleep. The decor and art in the loft is beautiful. We loved looking at all the details.
Two sparkling clean bathrooms with all the amenities you would need. Fluffy towels and good water pressure.
All of the appliances in the kitchen are in great working condition. I was able to cook and because of the layout - I could enjoy my family while cooking.
I highly recommend this property. You can walk to all the local restaurants and bars. Downtown is very nice and you feel safe walking.
The hosts were available and very good communicators. Answered all questions promptly and gave great recommendations for local fare."

Stayed one night","Slice of perfection! Photos do not do this place justice! It’s beautifully decorated, spacious, full of natural light - right in the heart of Effingham. Katy and Michael are fantastic hosts. They provided the best recommendations, timely information and just made everything so easy. Would absolutely stay again and we are adding Effingham to our list of favorite places."

There are games all over the place. This place is beautifully done in industrial décor. It was just two of us, but this place could easily fit 4 more very comfortably. They even have an 80's video game in the room with the bunks and washer and dryer. So much fun! The town is amazing too. We met so many great people. Book this place, you will LOVE it. We will be back. Angie"

Table large enough for 7 -8 people to play cards and eat. Kitchen island was perfect size and kitchen is well stocked with essential items. Great location in town with multiple local restaurant options within 5 minute walking distance ( to include one with roof top bar). The old school mini arcade game in third bedroom was a hit! Hosts thought of everything and provide great communication.

Taking the canoes on the lake is fun.
Only thing a person I was with noticed was that there’s a cabin really close and if you are inside with the blinds open and they are in back there’s not much privacy.
Luckily they were only there for one night and we did two nights.
Other than that
A really nice stay."

Sitting back in what felt like our own private cove, we felt it was perfectly private & relaxed! We had access to the kayaks on the property and had a beautiful time utilizing them on the lake! Kristen even allowed us to check in a little early upon request because she knew we wanted to make the most of the sunshine we had that day. It rained in the evening and we were able to still enjoy the outdoor area, due to a little covered porch area in the back. Great stay - thanks Kristen!"

Stayed with a pet","The good: The cabin is about what you would expect from the pictures. Easily identifiable from the outside. There is a nice little path, right down to the lakeside and the dock. Checking in was as simple as entering the door code. Lots of information available, left by the hostess. Checkout instructions, as far as what their expectations were, were made pretty clear. The place was immaculately clean
The not so good: The area is a little crowded. The properties on either side are very close, one even sharing a driveway. Plus there are loads of campers right across the road. So a private, secluded cabin in the woods, it is not. The driveway is narrow, and at an odd angle, that makes it nearly impossible to turn and back up in a long pickup. It can be done, but it’s a challenge.
The outstanding: Responsiveness. Between Kristen and her co-host, Marietta, they were right on top of any question I had for them. Responses were timely and they were very accommodating and easy to work with."

Stayed one night","Modern update of an original lake property. For the cost of a local hotel room, we got the whole house! This lake property is located on a campground with many year round campers but at this time of the year, we didn't see anyone else around so it was very quiet! It has a great location in that it is ""a hop, skip and a jump"" from the public playground, beach, and pavilions. There was also new pickleball courts, bocce ball, disk golf, as well as golf courts there! Pinky's is on the next road too! Kristen let us look at the adjacent property she has for a possible future rental. Both were clean, modern interior, and had everything you might need! Things I appreciated: selection of pillows, comfy bed, wonderful shower head with great pressure, Roku TV and even had some DVDs to watch, a fan(I forgot mine and love a bit a air flow when I sleep), shampoo and conditioner in the shower to use, and extra blankets in living room to snuggle up on the couch with. Close to everything in town also"

She even allowed me to borrow a crockpot. It was spotless upon our arrival so we were able to drop off our stuff and get outdoors to fish and kayak immediately. Our only full day was a little rainy but we made the most of it by playing games and watching movies using the streaming services available. Our kids, 10 & 12, never complained once about being bored and we didn’t even allow them to play on their electronics. Also, I go back to teaching in a couple weeks and being away from home in such a peaceful place helped me to focus on lesson planning. Our time at the cabin was invaluable and we hope to visit again!"

My dad loves to fish so he was so excited when I told him I got an Illinois state weekend fishing pass and there was a dock right off our cabin!
The cabin was super clean and stocked with everything you could imagine. It was peaceful and not too far off the beaten path. I could NOT have asked for anything more. Although my dad struggled with the TV… lol but we made due. Ha!

The fishing is excellent and there are a couple nice golf courses very close as well. Our preference is the Fore-Way 9-hole course but we have also played Cardinal Golf Course and Meadowview Golf Course in Mattoon
We plan to be back for many years to come.
Thank you Kristen!"

Highly recommend the ""Lickin' my Chicken, Pullin' my Pork"" restaurant nearby for a casual, low-key, fun dinner spot. We went there for good BBQ and had a blast staying for a bit of karaoke.
