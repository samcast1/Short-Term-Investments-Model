Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Room #1 which was beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotless. Eryka keeps the kitchen and bathrooms well stocked with essentials needed to comfortably stay several days. Couches and bed were very comfortable, and backyard seating area was beautiful! I wanted to use the gym (love Peloton!) but we were so busy visiting family, sightseeing, and shopping. I will absolutely book this same location the next time I’m in town to visit family."

Stayed one night","Arrived and the instructions to enter made it super simple. The place is immaculate, not to mention the privacy of the backyard that I spent hours in just enjoying the yoga section. The morning of my departure I woke up and used the washer and dryer included and enjoyed the beautiful backyard while my cloths finished. To be priced so low this place is a hidden gem. Overall I am definitely adding this to my favorites to stay when in the area!"

Stayed one night","I loved staying in this pristine, beautifully redone apartment. Apparently the Jungalow is one of three apartments in this remodeled home, but it was hard to tell anyone else was there. It's very private and quiet, and the backyard is huge! I really wanted to have more time to hang out there--there's a gorgeous pergola with comfy seating, as well as a porch swing hanging from a tree. You can tell the landscaping has also been redone, and it's gorgeous. The interior is tasteful and comfortable, with a subtle travel/jungle theme. The bed is great! The kitchen is compact and very well equipped--I was only there for one night, but if I'd had time, I could have cooked an amazing feast. Appliances were all new and the ones I used worked well. There are laundry facilities too. Since I have family in the area, I will definitely book here again--I think a longer stay would work really well in this sweet, centrally located place. Such a great find!"

Stayed a few nights","Michelle’s place is clean, quiet, and in a very beautiful location! The bathroom and kitchen were stocked and the washer/dryer in the suite was a great addition! Michelle is a kind, responsive host. There is EV charging, we did not use it but another great feature! The proximity to the vineyards is unbeatable and Michelle’s recommendations for local food was appreciated. The town does close earlier (8-9pm) as stated in the description but we never felt rushed or like we did not get the chance to see a vineyard or grab food. Overall, a fabulous stay!"

Stayed one night","The house is in a village and it takes a look to drive past at night, the landlord has a special light on and is easy to find according to the house number.
The house has everything and is fully furnished and great for a family foot.
We arrived in the middle of the night before, the next day the clothes were drying in the washer, half an hour late, leaving at 11:30, and the host came by specifically to remind them to leave because the hygienic staff had arrived, so it was important to stay on time to leave."

Stayed a few nights","We felt comfortable in this lovely above garage studio apartment. We got to utilize the car charger with our rental, and the neighborhood was SO quiet, outside of the town of orcutt next to farms. I really appreciated the snacks and blackout curtains being available. I think something I was not expecting was to enter through a portion of their house (just a hall of closed doors), but we felt bad because the dogs would bark when we entered. It must not bother the host! We plan to move to the area, and were happy to interact if we had gotten the opportunity. Nice little spot to get some rest. :)"

Stayed with a pet","Michelle's guest suite was a great place to stay! It is tucked away in a picturesque neighborhood with mature trees and open space. It was really nice being able to bring my dog. He and I enjoyed a couple of neighborhood walks going exploring. Michelle gave very helpful directions for checking in. Parking is ok but challenging with more than one car. Just fyi, the stairs you take to go up are wooden, steep, and narrow. The suite was cozy and comfortable. The bed matress was nice; not too soft or firm. The shower and bathroom were clean and worked well. The kitchen was very nicely stocked, it would be easy to make any number of simple meals with the electric stovetop and microwave. Michelle also included some snacks and breakfast items! I would be glad to stay here again."

Stayed one night","Michelle and Lee are wonderfully gracious Airbnb hosts! The instructions were thorough and helpful, the room truly lovely and inviting, the amenities divine and the EV charger was a godsend to us after a day of driving up from San Diego to escape Hurricane Hillary--as was Michelle, who couldn't have greeted us with more kindness nor spoken more welcoming words when she told us to ""take our time, enjoy your meal together in Santa Barbara--it's self-check in and we're very relaxed folks around here"". They've earned our 5-star review. The only issue was that the bed is a bit soft and tilted us downward at the head. That said, we would absolutely book with Michelle and Lee again in the future. These are lovely people in a truly peaceful and lovely location!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed 2 days at Michelle's Studio above the garage. A good, quiet place to relax, cook simple meals, do laundry and chill in front of big screen TV with Apple TV and Xfinity cable & WiFi.
Mattress could be firmer, there was some noise from the main house and garage but quieted down at night.
Enough space for 1 or 2 people, electric induction stove top (no oven), kettle, microwave, toaster oven and toaster. Washer/Dryer and provided detergent worked great to catch up on laundry after being on the road.
Nights were cold in Dec but Michelle provided extra blankets and the gas heater in the unit worked well.
Quiet with large trees around property. Upscale neighborhood on a hill overlooking the Santa Maria valley; Trader Joe's, Walmart and lots of restaurants less than 15 minutes away by car in Santa Maria. You need a car."

There were full sized toiletries in the bathroom, and tons of towels and washcloths. The bed was super comfy with nice pillows and a nice fluffy comforter. Michelle gave us her personal cell phone number in case we needed anything, and also provided dining recommendations! She was literally the best host you could ever ask for.

Stayed one night","We were in California to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, and Michelle's place was a blessing to find, especially at last minute. We had been staying at a chain hotel, and it turned out to be less than we had expected - so we left after the first night. Needing only one night, I never thought I'd find anything on AirBNB, but tried my luck and found their place. It is above the garage, so perfectly secluded. The bed was lovely, and Michelle adds many personal touches that delighted us. Snacks, breakfast items, milk in the fridge to go with the coffee, OJ for my hubby, toiletries, and very soft bedding! I did not take advantage of the combo washer/dryer, but that was a perk for sure. The stay was quiet, and fuss free. Directions were clear and easy to understand. We were so much happier to stay here than the hotel."

My husband greatly enjoyed the rest of his stay there on his own for work, appreciating how attentive Michelle was when necessary while still providing privacy. The amenities Michelle provided were a blessing, the studio was well stocked, everything was extra clean, & the bed was comfortable. Michelle even warmed the room for us prior to arrival, what an Angel! 🥰❤️"

There were lots of towels, pillows, etc. However, the WiFi was spotty, the place was pretty loud (someone in the house seems to start working at 5 AM), it smells very strongly of the dog, and the kitchen was only stocked for two, when there are four of us trying to eat a simple breakfast. It wasn't too bad for us, since we didn't spend too much time, and it was overall a good place to clean up and rest for the night between our day trips to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo."

Bed was not at all comfortable. My husband and I got bad back after sleeping 2 nights on that bed. The kitchen has very minimal supply. Would recommend bringing necessary pot, pan, laddle. AC doesn't work effectively,had to keep the windows open at night to help cool down the room."

Stayed one night","Michelle’s place has great historic character while also being modern and comfortable for the weary traveler. We came in from a long drive around 11pm, and the check in directions were crystal clear. The room was spacious, cozy, and clean.
I really appreciated that the kitchenette was stocked with snacks, cereal, juice, yogurt which made our morning very pleasant!
All in all, perfect place to stop on your way to Santa Barbara or Solvang. Would definitely stay again!"

There place was wonderful, and quiet, out in the country, judging from the location it would be a perfect place to catch a Vandenburg Space Launch. I have caught many launches when working near the base, Tina and Carlos's place would be marvelous, as a crow flies maybe 10 miles away.
Would stay there again! If available, it's a great place, security door, own room key, shared bathroom tub and shower, and it looks like they are adding a bigger section to the home. I hope it's for Air B and B use! Thanks again Tina and Carlos!

We used the fire pit in the backyard and had a fun dinner together.
We would love to come back!"

The house smells like a resort (in the best way) and everything was easy to find. Between the arcade, games, the pool table and the super comfortable living room there was so much to do that. I didn’t want to leave the house. ￼A few questions I had for Max were answered within 30 minutes of my emails and he was very thoughtful and friendly. I will definitely try to stay here again next time I’m on the central Coast. ￼ between the arcade, games, the pool table and the super comfortable living room there was so much to do that.

It was obvious that everything has been done with lots of love and passion. We would say, that Mark and Christine are setting the standards for what Airbnb should look like. Next morning we had a breakfast prepared by Mark and we ate everything as it was so delicious.
All in all, we were sorry that on our way from SF to LA we can only stay for one night.
It is needless to say but we have to, we highly recommend Mark and Christine place!"

Mark’s company made the difference, we had a great chat which resulted in us breakfast with the 3 of us (love these pancakes which were an added bonus, also it was Natasha’s bday and exactly what she wanted 😊).
Before leaving Mark came back with a bottle of wine for Natasha bday!
I forgot my coat which he will now mail back, I must have felt at home as I have a reputation for leaving things with family and friends after staying!
This is the perfect example why we prefer private stays over hotels.
Hope to see Mark and his wife when passing through the Bay Area later this year!"

Super comfortable and more importantly, very quiet. (You can get up without disturbing your sleeping partner).
The Casita is in a very safe and secure, quiet neighborhood. And I mean, quiet! You can literally hear a pin drop during the night. The shared yard is very comfortable and inviting with lots of beautiful plants surrounding you."

Stayed a few nights","First off, I want to say that this is absolutely not of the standard. Everything was great reviews that has become the norm on Airbnb. This is an honest, “cross your heart and hope to die”, review of a stay that was truly fantastic.
Mark has checked off all the blocks on the list of things that most travelers want to have in their Airbnb stay. A super comfortable bed with premium linens, premium amenities in the wonderful bathroom, which has a deep soak bathtub to comfort those weary from too many miles on the road.
There is a large closet with plenty of room for suitcases and clothing. Also a nice little table and chairs perfect for enjoying the wonderful breakfast that Mark includes with the stay. Keep in mind that his breakfast is not a handful of prepackaged stuff from Costco. Mark provides thoughtful culinary creations that change from day-to-day.
The beautiful yard that is available for guests is quiet and comfortable, and a perfect extension of this comfy cozy cottage."

My boyfriend and I needed a quiet weekend away and we could not have asked for a better stay than here. The Casita was quiet, beautiful, and cozy. I loved how they decorated it! We especially enjoyed our special homemade breakfast (which just so happened to be our favorite-- French Toast!) by the window, enjoying the views of their lovely backyard. Mark even sent a heartfelt message after our trip that meant a lot. I would absolutely come back and stay here again, and I hope to do that soon! Thank you both, everything was just perfect!"

The bed was comfortable, there was plenty of on street parking and breakfast in the morning was the cherry on top! Thanks again for allowing us to stay and if we're ever in Santa Maria again, we'll be sure to book the Casita."

Were the best host from the start, I wish they had a 10 Stars rating.
Place is Flawless, clean, bathroom, sheets, towels all smell good.
Location beautiful, Peaceful from our city life.
What also was the BEST the beautiful breakfast that was served, Pancakes with fresh fruit, fresh OJ, Coffee, and this delicious Prociutto Omelets the bomb.
Don't waste your time at a hotel, this little hidden Gem is perfect.
We'll back Next Year
Thank You, for sharing you beautiful Casita.

Stayed with kids","Overall I would recommend this Airbnb, the hosts were friendly, helpful and responsive. The house is very cozy and has everything you need, even for a 6 week stay like we had. The landscaping and flowers are beautiful, and the home is well appointed with linens, kitchen items, etc. As the home is older the heater does clank and is quite noisy as are the creaky doors etc. The location was my biggest issue, being located in a mixed industrial/business and residential area, this house sits next to an auto body shop and also near an alley. Because it is close to the main areas of town, people would walk in front of the home on the sidewalk, which sometimes brought people yelling etc. and didn’t feel as safe. Unfortunately there was a loud party next door that took place during our stay. It was likely a one-off situation but made for a night of no sleep. One of the neighbors also has a rooster which would crow loudly every morning."

The place is surrounded by a professionally landscaped back and front yard, which offers you a sunny resting spot among all the singing birds. Donna and Herb load the cottage up with all the essentials you’ll ever need, and then some. Everything is homey and clean and just so incredibly charming right down to the claw foot tub to take a long lavender soak in. It’s almost like you’re at the spa! And it’s so helpful that they also offer their washing machine / dryer to clean your clothes after long days spent at the beach! Overall, best place to rent, and you’re in great hands with the hosts too!
Ps- beautiful flowers are sold for $10 along the side of the road leading up to the highway. You should enjoy some!"

We used it as a launch point for day trips to the coast and SLO and it worked great! We loved having a grill and grilling supplies for making dinners. The kitchen is well-stocked, too, which made it easier to stay for several days. Donna and Herb were very responsive to questions. Highly recommend this place!!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cute little house, The host has put some games in the closet and there’s a table tennis outback which is very cool there’s a barbecue. There is no cable TV, so you have to sign in on your Wi-Fi.
The clawfoot Bathtub is super cute however be careful getting in and out and don’t grab a hold of the curtain for any reason.
it is mentioned in the little instruction book that the host has put out... just worth another mention from me only because we found out the hard way LOL.
We spent most of our time at all the different beaches it’s a great location if you want to go to the different beaches up and down the coast there."

The bungalow was very clean and well organized. There was an abundance of linens, kitchen, bathroom, and laundry tools available. So many special touches including a vase of fresh Hydrangeas in the master bedroom and a sprig of fresh lavender in the bathroom. There was even a small cooler and ice packs available for a beach trip and a bbq with everything you need to do some grilling. We didn’t use those this trip, maybe next time. The landscaping provided a nice back drop for relaxing on the front porch and the back patio. I could go on and on about how wonderful of s experience we had at the bungalow! I definitely recommend Herb and Donnas Bungalow retreat!!!"

I contacted Herb in the middle of the night telling him that I was driving up from LA for the birth of my first grandson. He answered promptly and was very accommodating both with an early check-in, readying the house for our arrival, and flexibility on my dates.
The cottage itself is charming! It is clean and a really nice space to come home to every night. While it seemed a little odd at first to have a bed in the dining room, lol, it worked out perfectly as my 6'4"" took the bedroom with the bigger bed, and I took the ""dining room"" with the smaller bed. It worked out perfectly! And we each had our own private space!
I was even able to make a dessert for baby's homecoming party as the kitchen is well equipped.
Herb was also very flexible and accommodating when I wanted to change my dates and stay longer to spend time with my new grandson.
This is a fantastic value, and a great place."

Donna met us when we got there and Herb was there later in the evening. The house is an older craftsman home as the post says and it is actually very neat and well-sized. Doesn't even creek when you walk around ;)
The porch is nice to hang out as is the backyard in the evening. Herb is very generous with towels, pillows, soap, etc. More than most airbnb houses we've stayed in.
He also provides a wide selection of DVD's, which we took advantage!
Again, the house was not only perfect for all of us but it is centrally located from most central coast attractions that you want to partake.

Stayed with kids","This quaint craftsman style cottage is perfect for a smaller grouping of guests (we were four - though you might fit a couple more). We enjoyed the location being so close to local amenities and to the pool where our daughter & her teammate swam in the Junior Olympics. The home itself has great storage, original windows, a claw foot tub, a laundry room and a little backyard. While the kitchen does not have a dishwasher (it didn't bother us), it does have a full size refrigerator, a microwave, coffee maker, a regular sized gas stove and a basic supply of kitchen stuffs. Being able to cook and store our groceries was really helpful. You will not have to buy coffee (unless you choose to do so), detergent, shampoos, cleaning supplies, or even charcoal for the outdoor grill - Herb provides it all. You will not experience a shortage of towels, paper towels or toilet paper either. Previous guests even leave unused items to be enjoyed by the next visitors. We thought the lack of air conditioning would be an issue but it was not... Herb provides vertical fans in every room and opening some windows to allow the cooler Santa Maria weather to flow through almost made it too chilly. We found the neighborhood to be quiet at night and peaceful. We would choose to stay here again. You would enjoy it too."

The cottage is super cute with thoughtful touches, and has a warm, inviting energy. The single bed I slept on was extremely comfortable (I wanted to take it home with me), and my mom said the queen size pull out couch was fantastic as well as the queen size bed in the bedroom. The single bed can really be treated as it's own room as well since there are doors that can be closed to where it is. We found it plenty big enough for the 4 of us, and highly recommend a stay here. I've stayed in a lot of airbnb places and this is one of my favorites, if not the top! Also, Herb is super friendly and very helpful with checking in."

Stayed a few nights","I love the small town feel to Santa Maria. Staying at Herb's airbnb 1920's Craftsman bungalow enhanced that vibe. When I was in elementary school I had friends who lived in classic Craftsman houses and I wanted to live in one ever since. There is a sense of history living in a structure that has been standing for over 70 years. Looking around the home you can see the quality construction. I particularly liked the big tub you could take a bath in. It's deeper than the current day shower/tub enclosures. You can lay back and relax in the old school tub.
I loved the location. It's on a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood. I bought fancy laminated glass dual pane windows and heavy sound deadening drapes but this place is much quieter than mine. I wake up in the mornings to the faint sound of birds in the distance. Another plus is this place is blocks away from one of my fav bbq's The Swiss."

It was perfect for our little boy to crawl around and everything was provided for our comfort, including the pack and play all set up with some blankets and soft toys for the baby! Herb made us feel very welcome by giving us some great advice on restaurants and activities in the area, and even by including us in some activities of his own. It truly was a pleasure to meet him and to stay in his cottage. I highly recommend!"

Herb & Donna were the perfect hosts, rapidly sorting out a small plumbing issue, & sharing their recommendations & extensive knowledge of the locality.
Santa Maria itself is not beautiful, but the surrounding areas are, and it is a great location as a base for exploring.
We loved staying at the cottage & would definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","The house is a stand alone single story bungalow . Furnishings are comfortable rather than modern. Clean and nicely laid out. I really was happy coming back after a day of driving around. In a nice quiet street. Some traffic noise from an adjacent road which dies down completely at night.
Herb and Donna are wonderful hosts and where we had a couple of minor problems went over the top trying to resolve the issues even going so far as offering a full refund which was not accepted or needed. Even then they generously offered another day for free which was accepted albeit rather guiltily as the minor issues hardly warranted such generosity.
Would I stay again. Certainly."

Stayed a few nights","While this house is clean, it is very noisy! There were dogs barking in the middle of the night and a rooster lives next door. You will hear both dogs and the rooster throughout the day. What bothered us the most was this house is part of the backyard of the owner's home, and during our stay they played very loud music in the backyard throughout the day. It was so loud the windows were shaking in the house. My first communication with Ruth was asking about the WiFi as my husband would be working from the home, so she was aware we'd be there during the day. While I understand she cannot be responsible for the noise her neighbors make, she certainly can take care of her noise level knowing she has guests working from home. Additionally, there is no dishwasher in the unit (which was not in the listing when I reserved) and there are NOT enough dishes (enough for 4, not 8). If you want a clean place to sleep, this is great, but if you want to spend any time in the house, I'd look elsewhere."

While we only stayed in the actual AirBnb for about 3 hours or so everyday (apart from sleeping) I don’t doubt you could be there all day. There was a great variety of channels on the tv to keep you entertained & all the amenities necessary to keep one busy. The outside patio was a nice touch after a long day where you just want to relax with friends near a fire place for a bit or even play some corn hole games with them to pass the time.
Apart from initial check in, check out & some useful information I didn’t talk with Ruth, the host, much which if you’re anything like me is a HUGE PLUS.
Overall it was a great place to stay & a very pleasant experience."

The area is safe, residential, pretty and walking distance to a nearby park, the grocery store and a couple of places to grab coffee… 12 minute drive from where I’m working in Santa Maria. This airBnB is a great place whether you are staying for work or play."

Like a retail store that you walk into that you think “oh it smells nice!” The bed was very comfy (which we needed to rest for the spartan race the next day!), the shared bathroom was immaculate, with great water pressure from the shower. The Lego builds throughout the home were really cool!"

I do wish they had a microwave. There is a micro convection oven on the kitchen counter which is a healthier alternative. But a microwave for guest would be nice as well. Other than that, my stay was great I'd book again and again."

Stayed one night","We stayed for one night and got in late. We were coming from San Diego, made a stop in Solveng, and needed a place to stay on our way up to San Francisco. The location from Solveng was an easy drive and the house is located on a quiet street with parking. The check-in instructions were easy and communication with the host was fast and reliable. The room was exactly as described and the bathroom is down the hall. There was someone else there when we were staying but not sure if it was the host or another guest, so we had to share a bathroom. The room was clean and comfortable and we had no problem using the shower in the morning before we hit the road. Only suggest extra towels as we couldnt find them as mentioned in the check-in instructions but we made do with a towel I had in my suitcase. Again, this is a fabulous stay, comfortable, safe, and reliable. Thank you for hosting us, we would stay again."

Stayed one night","Staying with Shayne and his husband was unique. The two are so warm, fun and attentive. We enjoyed staying with them so much that we no longer wanted to do something but rather use the time for conversations. Apart from that, the accommodation was also super clean, modern and they asked for wishes/comments on our part. There's no better way to ask for it. Oh, and we fell in love with the dog! A lovely and playful young bitch. ☺️
We would keep booking Shayne and his husband's place!"
