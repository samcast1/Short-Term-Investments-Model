Stayed over a week",Needed to find a place for work and was happy that it was so close to AdventHealth Hospital. Place was clean and cozy. I would recommend this place! Loved the mini outdoor area and their garden is absolutely beautiful which made the place even more special.

Stayed one night","We were in town to go see a show at the Yuengling Center and then go to Busch Gardens the next day. Jose's place is an oasis from the bustling area. It was 10 mins to both the locations we were going and just minutes away from anything and everything you would need, restaurants, grocery stores etc etc. Great place, beautiful gardens and very private. Rachel was awesome at check in and the entire place was clean as a whistle. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is a separate building behind the main house. A nice touch is the motion-activated lighting that comes on at night as you enter the backyard to walk to your accommodation. The refrigerator had beverages and a snack, the freezer had breakfast sandwiches and the bathroom stocked with shampoo, soap, toothbrushes, Q-tips, etc. Jose responded promptly to the only message I sent him during my stay. My only complaint is that there was no cable TV. My college's football team had a bowl game starting 15 minutes after my check-in. I did have a laptop with me and Jose's brother helped me hook the laptop up to the TV with an HDMI cable. I had to purchase access to ESPN+ but I was able to watch the game."

Stayed a few nights",This was a nice stay. The space is open and is as described. The bed comforter needs to be deep washed. The bathroom wasn’t as clean as I had hoped with rust on the shower caddy and hair on the shampoo bottle and the shower liner is old and needs to be changed. Also this place needs a thorough cleaning and disinfecting. However the host’s mom was super nice and such a sweetheart. The iron didn’t work but I didn’t have time before leaving to ask for a replacement. I would stay here again but I just think an outside cleaner should be used since the host’s mom is older and probably can’t clean as thoroughly as needed.

Stayed a few nights","This spot was in a great neighborhood. It is located in the backyard but it is totally secluded and private with beautiful plants. It has everything you can imagine having at home, or if you forget to pack something, likely it’s there. Pots, pans, basic things in fridge like water bottles and eggs, spare soaps and toothbrushes.. Most importantly, Jose was quick to reply if you had any questions and his mother is a very sweet lady. She kindly let us borrow an umbrella on a rainy day. Our favorite part was the cozy back porch, which is a private space with a couch where you can sit outside and enjoy a cup of coffee(which they also had in the kitchen too) Everything was perfect."

Stayed a few nights","Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Booked this guest house for superbowl weekend. It was an easy ride to downtown tampa and the riverfront/surrounding areas. Jose was very responsive with pre-check in. His mother is so sweet!
The only downside to this is the guest house is inside their backyard. It is down a path and seems secluded from the main space, but you do have to walk past the main house into the backyard consistently to get to and from the guest suite.
With that being said, I never felt a lack of privacy when at the suite. The owners of the main house were there and attentive for questions but Erin I felt let you have your space otherwise which was wonderful.
The suite itself was extremely clean, and well stocked for guests. The pictures are really the exact layout of the space which was nice to know what to expect!
I would definitely stay here again."

The suite is fully stocked with kitchen items, coffee machine, and a fridge. The nicest touch was the extra toiletries in the bathroom in case you run out of your personal items!
Make sure to head to the neighborhood pizza and wings hot spot, Lee's Grocery! Just a short walk from the apartment.

This beautiful well-appointed home-away-from-home boasts an elegant and sophisticated upgrade from your stereotypical vacation rental.
The property’s comfort, cleanliness, and tastefully curated décor are indicative of our host’s tireless commitment to a superlative guest experience. Eddie’s concierge-like attentiveness can be seen everywhere from the luxurious linens and perfectly fluffed pillows to the fully stocked, ensuite coffee bar.
What's more, this guest home’s ideal location exceeds my every want and need. Situated near the epicenter of downtown Tampa, guests are only ever a stone’s throw from the city’s best bars, restaurants, and nightlife.
I would unequivocally recommend prospective travelers to Tampa leave their visit in Eddie’s capable hands -- lest they run the risk of having missed one of Tampa's hidden gems."

Yep, this IS the place …the quintessential case-study of everything the ""21st century sharing economy"" promised to deliver us ...a truly idyllic home away from home; effortlessly delivered and seamlessly executed; hosted by a wonderful family you'd like to adopt as your very own :) This is peer-to-peer perfection come to life -- elegantly personified by your gracious host, Eddie. Ok, so you want details?! Hmm, let's see …how about the perfectly 'invisible' concierge-quality service and attention (Eddie is politely imperceptible until you want something; and then he springs to action like the proprietor of a luxury 5-Star European hotel); or the chic décor; luxurious bedding; impeccable cleanliness; perfect climate control; the quiet serenity of an enchanted tree-lined neighborhood; and so forth.

Eddie was thoughtful in providing sanitary and toiletries in case you forgot— which came in handy as I forgot my contact case! The Queen bed was super comfortable and the shower has wonderful water pressure. This Airbnb is located conveniently within a 5 minute drive to downtown, and we loved visiting Armature Works which is close by. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Tampa!"

Stayed a few nights","The place itself was decent for the most part. Nice little kitchen, bedroom and small bathroom. All in all, it wasn't a terrible stay as there were some decent amenities and so on (Shampoo, Conditioner and body wash in the shower/Spare sheets in the bedroom/AC unit).
My only gripe was how loud it was for most of the stay. There are chickens somewhere near by? I was consistently woken up by the sound of a Rooster calling out in the morning somewhere nearby. There was also the fact that the host or her husband (?) would play music relatively loudly at night, and it made it difficult to fall asleep some nights. All in all, it was an alright stay for the price but I can't exactly say I'd prioritize this place if I were to visit Tampa again."

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
Host is responsive, provided us with stuff needed when asked.
Has a private entrance to the guest house
Allowed me to check in early
Cons:
On the weekend, it was a lot of noise coming from outside all night up to 4am. The guesthouse has thin walls, which got annoying and hard to sleep at night. There is also a rooster that will sing at 3am everyday.
AC is not steady, warm water in the bathroom.
One day a car was parked on our side of parking which did not allow to park the car. We had speak with the owners of house which they just told us to go around it and park in front of it.
Trash can lid stays fully open. If you leave trash for a certain amount of time, it can leave a smell around the whole area
Overall I would recommend this place if it's for a short stay, but not for long period of time."

The neighborhood seemed pretty safe, just some roosters that get kind of loud in the early morning. The only problem I had was that the shower water does not get hot. It would only be like lukewarm & since the weekend we were there was kinda cold, would of been nice to take a hot shower. Other than that everything went smoothly."

Stayed over a week","Dear Lidi and Carlos,
I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the incredible experience I had staying at your Airbnb apartment in Rocky Point, Tampa. Your commitment to excellence was evident from the moment I stepped into your beautifully maintained home. The cleanliness of the apartment was truly commendable, creating a welcoming and comfortable environment for a stay of over a month.
Every amenity I could have needed was thoughtfully provided, ensuring a hassle free living experience for one month stay. The attention to detail in the amenities offered not only added convenience to my stay but also made it feel like a home away from home.
Thank you for making my long stay in Tampa not just comfortable, but truly memorable. Your hospitality has set a high bar, and I look forward to recommending your apartment to friends and family planning a visit to the area.
Thanks & Best Regards,
Nilabdhi Samantray"

Stayed with a pet","This cottage was very comfortable, clean and tastefully decorated with the amenities listed. There was a glitch with the thermostat but Alex was quick to resolve it. I had a bit of an issue watching the premium channels so some kind of guide would have been very helpful. The location was centrally located in a quiet, up and coming neighborhood. I felt safe walking my doggie around the area and a couple of blocks beyond. Although I didn't need it, there was no hot water kettle but I sure enjoyed the Keurig coffee machine. My only recommendation would be to add a small night stand. I used to live in Tampa and plan on visiting again so I would be happy to stay here again."

Favorite park was how easy it was to walk to water walking/jog paths, Amelia Arena, Riverwalk etc. but also how convenient and easy parking was for our car. Just a great base to explore the entire area."

The unit is older, so there are some quirks. We are light sleepers so we had a hard time with the noise coming from the upstairs. You can hear walking and rolling of suitcases. But, if you're not bothered by sound, this may not be a problem for you. It was really nice having a washer/dryer and we didn't have trouble with parking."

Stayed a few nights","Location to bayshore, Hyde park village, channel side and the highways can’t be beat at Anna’s spot. Her condo is very clean and cozy. Large rooms, comfortable furniture, and nice TVs makes this a great spot to unwind. Our only complaints are being on the bottom floor we expected some noise since it’s an older home with wooden floors, but anytime someone walks upstairs you will know it. It’s very loud. I’d suggest asking to stay in a room upstairs if silence is golden to you. Also, my husband mentioned several times about the round, tiny toilet. But, other than that, the spot is absolutely precious and all the little extras like coffee, cream, bottled water, sugar, shampoo and conditioner were all wonderful touches. There are lots and lots of good things about Anna’s spot."

Stayed a few nights","I was so happy to find Anna’s place for my last minute trip with one other friend. Location and cleanliness were both amazing. The only inconvenience was when we ask for a slightly later check out, 11 or 12, we were told no due to cleaning yet the place was not booked for the next day. We felt like she didn’t care to help, but the weather made up for it."

Stayed a few nights","Location. Location. Location. Nice apartment in a great location. Near downtown Tampa and near Hyde Park. Easy drive to lots of shopping and restaurants. About two blocks away from the water. Beautiful walk along the water! Easy access to highways to get to other locations in Tampa and St. Pete. The apartment in on the first floor of an older house, possibly historic craftsman style, that has been divided into 4 apartments. There is a nice front porch. The apartment was larger than expected. Some things in the apartment have been updated. It has the basics in the kitchen and a large dinning table. All wood floors that look to be the original and they are beautiful but if you are not used to it be prepared for the squeaks. The living room is large and has a pull out couch. Not a lot of comfortable seating. Very simple. Bedroom is also large, big bed and has a tv. Plenty of closet space. Bathroom is small. Sink area and floor tile have been updated; tub has not. TIPS if you rent: The AC is on a set schedule, so you may have to reset it a couple times while you are in the apartment. You touch the outside of the circle to increase or decrease the temperature. The front door leads to the entry way to the building that leads to the door to the apartment. The entry is by touch pad and you have to push/touch the top of the key pad to lock it when you leave and turn the knob behind you once you are inside. Overall would recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Anna was a nice host, easy to communicate with.
The house is super charming and cute. On one of the previous reviews someone complained about the floor planks lifting. This house is a much older home (which is what gives it the charm factor) and the floors are original, (which I hope they keep as long as they can. The floors give the entire place that nostalgic character) so they will not be perfect. That shouldn’t be an expectation
Place was bigger and more spacious than how it looks in the photos.
Perfect location and a 1 minute walk to the Bayshore on the water.
For the price I was expecting there to be a few more things provided like coffee, laundry detergent etc.
but that was more minor for me, but I would have liked to know that beforehand.
Bathtub needs a little love / replaced but was still doable to shower in
Parking wasn’t an issue at all - parked out front every-time
I would totally stay here again, I really loved it"

Stayed a few nights","Pros: Great location, friendly and communicative host, comfy bed, ample space for working remote, affordable rate.
Cons: The apartment needs some TLC…bathroom especially was in pretty rough shape. Pictures made it look better than it was in person. Some of the floor boards would also sink down when stepped on so we had to watch our steps. Nest thermostat was touchy and would turn to 75 degrees during the night which caused us to wake up uncomfortably warm (it was 90-100 degrees outside during our stay plus humidity)."

A simple Bird scooter ride away. Apartment was clean and comfortable and had just enough amenities to make it work well. Older construction noted in previous review makes for charming noises associated with floors that have seen some steps. Anna was an awesome communicator and the towels were very soft. Did not find a box of Kleenex or tissue so perhaps have some with you. Will stay again when my wife can join as the Hyde Park shopping looks just her style.

Something to note for light sleepers: this apartment unit is part of a 4 unit complex so we very often did hear the occupants of the upstairs walking around, their tv, conversations etc. Obviously this is something that can’t be controlled but if you’re a light sleeper bring headphones!"

We had one small plumbing issue during our stay (not anyone’s fault whatsoever) but Anna was super quick to respond and very apologetic and had a plumber out within a couple of hours. I was very impressed by her hosting skills and by the house in general. If you’ve got this Airbnb on your maybe list, move it to the yes column, because it’s a gem. The size, location, decor, price, and communication can’t be beat. We would be happy to stay here again and again! Thanks again, Anna!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent location, walkable to many restaurants and Riverwalk which we loved. Felt safe in the building and I liked the community room with coffee and a place to work from even though we were only there for a week.
Being in downtown, it was noisy especially early mornings and the apartment was facing the Straz center of performing arts so there was lot of light coming into the apartment at night from the lights on the buildings so I would suggest management installs room darkening shades especially in the bedroom since it was too bright even with the blinds. I slept with AirPods even at night to avoid waking up to sounds early morning.
Parking was included in their garage which was great, however the parking spaces are too narrow and I can imagine dents in car doors while opening and closing the doors. Residents were mostly younger and drive very fast in the garage so need to lookout for that. We had trouble getting in and out of the garage on the 1st day but was resolved quickly."

SO much to do in Tampa and in just a .5 walk you can find yourself at the trolley to go even further. Maggie was able to get me a parking pass for my car which was amazing! Lots of amenities (while the lobby espresso machine seemed to fail everyone at points, haha!), got some work done daily on the 6th floor lounge and spent my evenings looking out at the city skyline on the 8th floor. Tampa is such a beautiful city and you will not regret choosing this Airbnb :)"

Stayed about a week","My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay at Ave. While apartment is small, we absolutely loved the amenities offered. There is a nice, heated pool. The gym rivals ones with paid memberships. There is plenty of open space to relax or meet outside of your room. I worked remotely for a week and found the co working space to be top notch (conference room, wifi printer etc.)
Ave is very centrally located and is very walkabout to area restaurants and the riverwalk etc. There are also bikes available in the lobby.
My one small feedback would be that the initial supplies offered are not at the level I am accustomed to at Air Bnbs. (ie. a soap for a single load for the dishwater). We did an instacart order on our 1st day for these items.
All and all, this is a great apartment, in a great building, in a great location. We look forward to our return.

Listing pictures and the room may not match, they have various furnished apartments. The kitchen is stocked except for providing k-cups (often done at other airbnbs). There’s a great patio to catch the sunset. The pool is centrally located so short hours of direct sunlight. They provide plenty of towels.
Overall this was great!"

Stayed with a pet","I stayed 3 weeks at AVE, so I spent a good amount of time there. The amenities were top notch. I have 2 big dogs, that I took to the beach numerous times, so the doggy spa was used several times. The coffee lounge was super convenient, and the roof-deck is beautiful.
The pool is pretty shaded, as it is in courtyard, so don't expect to lay out much there, but it is a nice pool nonetheless. The gym is nice, and well equipped. Overall the amenities are what makes the place. In addition, it is easy to get around, the highway is right there, the riverwalk is convenient, etc.
The ONLY negative I can give really, is that there was no private outdoor space. The listing said private patio/balcony, but my unit did not have any of that. Outside of that, the place was super convenient, and I was happy with my stay overall."

Stayed a few nights","Overall we would return, GREAT facility. Only issue was we were one of three groups renting, all of us requested a 1 bedroom unit and all of us got different floor configurations. Ave advertises a queen bed, we thought is was a double or mini-queen. The two couples in our group did get the queen configuration (different floor layout). The single person in our group got a configuration with a king bed, balcony, walk through closet from the bedroom to the bathroom. Logically it would seem that one of the couples get the king bed configuration, but Ave said it was all random. When they do not advertise king beds it does not mean they do not have them. Again, great facility, we would definitely go back the next time we are in Tampa."

She is located right along the river walk which is beautiful and close to some neat spots to check out at night. I was able to reach someone anytime I had a question. There is someone working at the front desk which I found very helpful to answer questions and direct us on how to get into the building , find parking, etc. The amenities were wonderful, including free coffee on the 5th floor, a pool and workout facilities.The only thing missing was dish soap and hand soap. The lady at the front desk explained that they were all out and couldn’t provide any. We also ate most of our meals at the condo and only had 1 package of detergent to do dishes. It would be helpful to have dish soap available to be able to hand wash some dishes.
Overall this was a beautiful condo and would be worth staying at again."

The studio is clean and arranged to meet all kinds of needs (kitchen utensils, washing and dryer ). It felt like home. If I come back to Tampa, I prefer Ave studios again. One suggestion: There was no one at the front desk when you checked out on Sunday, so sharing the check-out instructions in advance or at least putting a box that the keys can leave will make it easier to check out. Still, I didn't have any trouble as the Ave support line was very quick to return."

Stayed a few nights","Zucely's condo was perfect for our needs. It was in an excellent location on the bay with beautiful views, a heated pool and plenty of seating outside and on the beach area. The unit was very clean and located in an ideal place for us to get to nearby family events easily. The wifi was excellent, and the amenities provided were perfect. We arrived early and were able to enter and put our food in the refrigerator. The restaurant by the pool provided great meals and drinks and was so convenient. Everyone was very helpful, and we will definitely come back to Zucely's condo when visiting this area again."

Stayed with kids","We are a family of four with two teenage kids and thought the space looked like it had everything we needed. We appreciated the great views from the patio, a fun pool and especially the small restaurant and bar at the pool which we frequented! The parking was easy enough and location was so close to the airport! One suggestion we had for improvement was better couches in the living room. They were incredibly uncomfortable to sleep on, thankfully my kids are easygoing but they really were not sleepable. They were very hard, you could feel the rods in them and that is something easy enough to switch out. If you are planning on using those two couches as additional beds, might not recommend counting on good sleep. overall it met all of our needs and had a great experience."

A parking spot was easy to find and it was easy to get into the condo with the number code on the door. Shortly after we got there we saw stingrays swimming down in the bay and we loved watching them every night! Very peaceful location and we enjoyed the live music from across the bay at whiskey joes! The pool was also nice and warm so we could swim with our littles even though it wasn’t very warm out or sunny. We’ll keep this place in mind when we come back to Tampa!

Stayed a few nights","Was just what we needed. Close to everything, and easy to find. We took advantage of the beachy area for a quiet day to relax. We did not use the pool although it looked very inviting, we preferred the quiet, sand and view of the water. There are lots of condos in this place, but it was very quiet despite the size. The place itself was nice, nothing fancy but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable. Nice wall mounted TV in both the living area and bedroom. The couches were not very comfortable, but we really didn't spend much time inside during our short stay. Sunset was beautiful. Was a great stay."

The unit is on the top floor so you dont have to worry about noise from people above you too. The balcony faces a little inlet on the bay and we saw SO many stingrays and fish every day, our girls LOVED it. Zucely was wonderful to work with, always very responsive and helpful. The pool onsite is great and there is a little bar/restaurant inside the pool area. We had a perfect stay and we would happily stay again in the future."

The only thing we would look at is if having anyone sleep in the living room outside of the one bedroom the futons are not the most comfortable to sleep on so if they replace those with a better couch or sleeping spot the place is 5 stars! The bed in the bedroom was great. We also used the pack in play for our one year old to sleep in.

Stayed a few nights","The view from the place is perfect. We stayed to be close to the amphitheater, downtown Tampa and have a short drive to the beach. It’s exactly as described. The owner is very responsive. Very helpful with any requests or needs.
The place has everything you need. And the location has a food place and area to hangout for sunset. We even saw a baby shark in the bay from our balcony.
Only small cons… The futon to watch TV is a little hard so we sat on pillows and the queen bed is very firm. If you’re good with firm you are fine. One night the neighbors were super loud and the bedroom is located near the hall so you hear a lot and my white noise wasn’t as helpful. There is a noise ordinance for 11pm but the neighbors in the other units didn’t care. So one night was harder to sleep bc of the noise and firm bed. I don’t want to post anything neg but I just want to make sure peeps are fully informed. I hate posting neg bc the owners are clearly great and so is the place but I need sleep."

Stayed with kids","This was a nice location semi secluded and right on the water. We had chosen it because it met our needs, as it was conveniently close to the airport and a wedding venue that we were attending. We also wanted access to a pool for our daughter, in which the pool and Bar/Restaurant was a great place to spend time before the wedding. The Bonus I would say is that it's a straight shot over to Clearwater beach, only 20 mins if leaving early in the morning. We left at 730 and by 8 we were already sitting down having breakfast. Our only regret was that this was only a quick trip for us and we could stay longer.
The Zucely's kept in constant contact through the app and provided detailed instructions on how to find the room."

We enjoyed the beach area of the complex... watching the sunset, playing on the beach after the tiki torches were lit at night. The pool was heated which was so nice! It was pretty crowded at first but we were able to return later and swim while listening to a man playing the steel drum by the pool. The condo was very clean.

Stayed with kids","Great location — within 20 minutes of PIE airport (St. Pete’s/Clearwater) and even closer to Tampa Airport — but still feels far away from the city in that you get to look out into the water and feel surrounded by nature.
My husband and I and our 10-years old daughter stayed here for 3 nights and it was perfect for us. It’s a cozy space — quiet and peaceful for sleeping. We enjoyed quiet mornings as well, fixing our own breakfast and drinking tea/coffee on the deck.
Most of the days were spent out exploring the Tampa Zoo (so cool) and spending time with local friends. The first night, though, we got in tired from delays in travel and had a nice dinner at the simple bar/restaurant next to the pool. It was relaxing to not have to go out and find food once we got settled in.
The hosts were friendly and responsive. They had okayed an early check-in for us, and although we didn’t get to take advantage of it since our flight from MSP was delayed, I still appreciated their flexibility."

The only reasons we indicated 4 instead of 5 stars had more to do with Airbnb as much as anything. We’ve loved staying at Airbnb’s to be more in a central area, with personalized fun things to do and with a little more personal amenities (e.g. creamer). That said, I’m sure they would have responded immediately if I had reached out."

The condo is a short drive to Busch gardens and everything else we wanted to do in Tampa."

Great for a quick weekend getaway with an on-site restaurant/bar, pool, beachy firepit area, and space to spread out when in the condo. The condo itself is updated, clean, nicely decorated, and functional. There was a bottle of wine and snacks awaiting us on arrival. I could see my girlfriend and myself coming back here for weekend getaways a couple times per year."

We went to our next stop fancy brand x hotel and said it just isn’t as comfortable. We love how clean Zucely’s is. The service and communication level are excellent. The convenience of the location to the city or many other places is great. This was our second stay here and won’t be our last God willing.

The host went out of their way to leave us cold waters and snacks! The place is roomy And had everything we needed. The pool downstairs even has a bar and a food truck which we highly recommend. We spent the entire evening at the pool And didn't have to worry about leaving to get anything to eat or drink. Outside Near the pool they have 2 different sitting areas that are perfect for watching the sunset (my favorite part). The sunset was breathtaking! The view was amazing! Don't think twice just book it!

Hosts were always in touch, suite was perfectly prepared with snacks, water and even a bottle of wine! We left it for the next visitors, the bar next to the pool took care of allll the things. Hotel office also has a great selection of food, drinks and must haves when traveling. Fish, stingray and the occasional dolphin sightings were just a look over the balcony away. Pricey but spectacular restaurants/bars within a mile walking or driving distance. No issues at all walking 6-7 miles to check out the area throughout the weekend and we felt very safe the whole stay. Very family friendly place. Can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely short 3-day adventure for my 50th birthday. Location on the river was peaceful, private, and very relaxing. Did not get to take advantage of the all the amenities due to our short stay. Location is very close the Busch Gardens and Tampa Zoo. Just a short drive to the Florida Aquarium and Riverwalk area. We also drove to Clearwater beach for a day trip which only took about 30 minutes and was easy to find.
Wifi did not work while we were there, and hosts did all they possibly could to try to get it fixed while we were still there, very communicative. This was not a major issue since we tried to stay off the internet, and just enjoy the peacefulness of the surroundings.
As Waze took us into the neighborhood, it initially appeared a little shady at first, but as we approached the rental we quickly felt safe, and discovered a better route to take to and from the rivershed for the rest of our stay.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat next time we are in Tampa."

It was 15 min or less to everywhere we wanted to go, except the beach but that was still not a far drive. After day two we started mentioning we wish we would have planned less so we could spend more time at the River Shed. lol Having coffee on the porch or dock in the mornings was definitely a huge highlight of our trip. We really hope we can find an excuse to come back soon. By the way, we highly recommend: The Getaway (St. Pete- for drinks, and relaxing by the water), Dang Dude (Sparkman Wharf- great Asian food), Ulele (Tampa- fancy dinner), Colombia (Ybor- fancy lunch), and Grand Cathedral Cigars (Ybor- cigars. lol)"

I was on a sabbatical and wanted somewhere peaceful and quiet to hear God and got exactly what I was looking for here. So much nature and great views even just being inside. The room was very spacious and the interior design really felt like home away from home but still very cozy. Carey and her daughter were super sweet. They brought me my groceries on the first day since the shopper had left them outside. She was super understanding about adjusting my checkout time since my departure train got delayed. I honestly wish I could live there. The neighborhood is super safe since I went on walks a few of the days. Even the neighbors were super friendly. The kitchen had to be my favorite part ! Mattress was so heavenly not to mention the hammock and the fan since Florida is known for the heat ! Loved it here and definitely will be back.

Excellent location; short drive to downtown Tampa without the clutter of the city traffic and congestion. The bed was comfy, plenty of towels provided and kitchen had everything we needed.
It was magical to kayak/canoe with the manatees and watch all of the birds and squirrels up close on the porch and the dock.
We really enjoyed our stay and recommend to anyone who is looking for a place to relax and unwind.

As soon as we opened the door and saw the view we felt a calm come over us. Which was very helpful with 2 girls who were a little bit nervous about the upcoming night. Afterwards it was the perfect place for them to reflect on their evening and wake up to have a peaceful and quiet breakfast overlooking the river. I’m so glad I found this place and will be a great part of their Prom memory. We even saw a turtle sunbathing on a log in the morning. Loved it!

Afterwords we went downtown to an Irish pub.

We had a relaxing evening sitting out back watching the boats go by- such a neat experience. The inside was spotless, the bed was VERY comfortable and I actually took pictures of the bathroom because we liked the layout and the tile so much. We will absolutely be back to Tampa again soon, and will pass this place along as a recommendation to others we know! The hosts were incredible and SUPER responsive.

Carey was helpful in making sure we knew about all good restaurants in the area and answered any questions we had immediately. The River Shed was exactly as they said it was in the advertising of it. Sweet, sweet little cottage.
We loved the interaction with their wonderful dogs Skip and Weezie as well as the host family. Look forward to another trip in the future."

Stayed a few nights","The view from the back porch is serene, beautiful, and had me mesmerized. It was my favorite part of our stay! Such a lovely place to enjoy the quiet beauty. I misunderstood and thought the dock was a little bit more private, but you do walk through their backyard as shown in pictures to get to it. There was a musty smell especially after we came in from the outdoors. Water pressure and temperature in the shower could be stronger/hotter. There’s not a lot of privacy in the bathroom due to a barn door that has some openings. TV is the size of a computer screen. The bonus is that you are close to everything in Tampa and there’s so much to do there! Owners are also kind enough to offer their canoe to use during your stay."

They were responsive and extra thoughtful and went above and beyond to accommodate a few special requests. The house is conveniently located close to the campus. It is adorable and had really cute furnishings and everything that we needed. I spent the early mornings and late evenings on the back porch in the hammock reading. The greenery and the water were absolutely beautiful. If you are looking for a peaceful spot, this is it!!"

It’s soooo peaceful yet conveniently located and easy to get around. Hosts were so helpful. The wifi was so so(I do a lot of zoom calls) and they generously gave me a ton of networks but I still had to hotspot a decent amount. But doable! Honestly worth it! Will for sure be back

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED this BEAUTIFUL space!! When we first arrived I was caught off guard; I knew we would be on the river, but I guess I didn't realize the actual proximity to it! I felt like I was walking into a tree house.... If you enjoy nature, THIS IS THE PLACE. We spent a lot of our trip just sitting out on the porch... watching butterflies, alligators, fish, & dolphins go by. We enjoyed trying to identify our sightings with the thoughtful books/brochures on local wildlife that were provided.
The space was cozy, but not cramped. Perfect for a couple. Honestly, we were so content it was hard to get motivated to leave the Airbnb!
We did have a few super minor technical difficulties during our stay, which I'm really only mentioning to highlight that Carey & Aaron were excellent at communicating with us and resolving in an extremely timely manner (thank you!).
Hosts were accommodating, responsive, & friendly... going out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect with recommendations & allowing us to utilize some of their outdoor recreations. We appreciate you & were so happy we got to say hi & THANK YOU!"

When you're inside, it feels like you're in the middle of a rainforest with all the green growth surrounding you and the river backing up to the place. When I first stepped foot inside, my jaw dropped. I was blown away by how clean and beautiful the place was. I loved the way the place was decorated too. It made you feel welcomed and right at home. The back screened-in porch was one of my favorite features because even in the rain, I could be outside and enjoy the nature surrounding me. My only regret is not spending MORE time here. Will for sure come back and recommend to anybody looking for a private place with a taste of nature while still being close to anything you need in town."

We didn’t realize what a little slice of Heaven this place would be. We loved relaxing on the patio in the hammock and going down to the dock. It felt just far enough from the city for some peace and just close enough to get everywhere we needed! Driving to the beach, into the city, Busch gardens - we never had to go farther than 15 minutes! The place is so cozy and comfortable. I have no complaints. We will definitely be back here when we come to Tampa. I would recommend this for anyone - family, couple, solo-traveler."

The kitchen was very well equipped and had everything we needed to cook a nice meal. We also used the kayaks on the river which was a great activity. One big topic for us though was the odor (mold?) mainly in the bathroom / bedroom area. It made us move to the couch for spending the nights with an open patio door and made us open the doors every time we came home.
Without this issue it would have been an amazing stay during warm and sunny winter days in florida."

Carey and Aaron live in the main house, and I felt perfect safe and cozy in our cottage through their fence. They provided nice little amenities and some snacks, too, which were much appreciated. (Our car was full of our daughter's stuff so we showed up with nothing of our own really - so the amenities were very very appreciated.)

The Jungalow was the perfect spot to enjoy some pool/spa time but also walk over to SOHO and other spots in Hyde Park. We loved eating at several of the great restaurants on S Howard street and enjoyed some nice morning runs along Bayshore Boulevard.

Peeling wallpaper in our bedroom, wonky water dispenser in the fridge, floors felt dirty. There were also rats in the backyard which the owner considers local wildlife. It was a good home base for us in Tampa, but for the price, I’d hope to find a better quality option."

The house was stocked with everything we needed right away. (Loved the Keurig and coffee choices!)
We were able to walk to lots of great shops, restaurants, and Starbucks.
The traffic is loud, but honestly not worth complaining about. We saw a few critters outside but to be expected!
Would 100% stay here and recommend again!"

Several people mention the traffic noise. It seemed to be more an issue upstairs but it did not interfere with anyone’s sleep. Loved sitting on front porch and watching people and pups walk by. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent location, pristine home, squeaky clean, plenty of space, comfortable beds, great furniture but the traffic and trains were too loud for me to enjoy sitting outside. The weather was perfect (other than the pollen which is nobody’s fault) so I really wanted to enjoy sitting out on the front porch and have my morning coffee but I found the drone of traffic to be too much so I would go inside. I sleep deep so the cars and occasional train didn’t really bother me too much at night with the drum of the room a/c and sound machines but my wife was often awake. We loved the location and the house was the cleanest we have ever rented but if I’m being honest, I’d never rent it again (sorry Boyd you were a wonderful host) it was just too loud for someone who lives in rural Virginia and has no traffic noise at their own home. City dwellers or people who live near roads should have no issue, I’m just used to only hearing birds and all I heard was cars."

We enjoyed the walks and neighborhood, as well as Hyde Park downtown. The only downside is it’s right next to the fwy and train tracks so sleep was difficult- even with sound machines he provides. However, beds were comfortable - which is important. Overall Boyd did his best to make this home comfortable, warm and inviting. He went above and beyond to help us make his home our home for the New Years Holiday! Fountain in back is a great touch! We enjoyed the home immensely. Great Holiday House for families!"

Big foyer to keep 2 strollers in and leave all of our shoes with plenty of room to move around. Family room has 2 big comfy sofas and enough chairs so all adults were comfortable with plenty of room for kids to play. Huge covered porch helped when it rained. Easy walk to children’s play park, Hyde Park Village and Bayshore Blvd. Because of this accessibility it is on a busy, noisy street that is fine in the day but you will use the provided noise machines to sleep well. Boyd is lightening fast at responding and so compliant. Thanks again, Boyd!"

Group trip","My family stayed at Boyd’s Hyde Park home for my daughter’s wedding weekend. The house & casita were fabulous! The house is exactly as pictured, very clean, well appointed, and completely comfortable for a group of 8-9 people. The front porch is so nice, and the surrounding neighborhood is made up of pristine older homes with friendly people. It is totally walkable to the downtown Hyde Park restaurants and shopping. This area is a beautiful part of Tampa, very quaint. We did not have to contact Boyd about anything at all. The only drawback to the location is the proximity to the highway overpass. If you are sensitive to noise, there is traffic highway noise. Inside the house it was detectable, but not intrusive. It would not prevent me from renting there again as the home is wonderful and the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed at."

We enjoyed the open concept kitchen, dining room and living room spaces and we spent hours on both the front and back porches relaxing and talking. Everything is there that you need. Just bring your bags, some food, games and wine/cocktails. We also enjoyed eating, drinking and shopping in the village which is only a block away. We had one issue with a wobbling ceiling fan and it was addressed within a hour of contacting the host. The house is a corner lot so there was a bit of street noise and foot traffic late on Friday/Saturday but we will definitely book again."

Spacious & well-kept home has a ""Restoration Hardware vibe"" and offers every amenity one could wish for. Almost missed the separate AC unit in the mstr bedroom. Remember to bring/pick up a small container of laundry soap as washer/dryer is avail as well. Will rebook! Boyd very responsive.

Stayed a few nights","Amy's apartment was lovely! It was spotless and extremely well stocked. Kitchen had everything we needed and more. She even had filtered water in fridge.
The bed was very comfortable with soft pillows and quality linens. Bathroom towels were large and soft. She had everything from shampoo to a blow dryer. She even had a flat iron! Living room couch was comfortable, perfect for watching TV. She provided everything from an extra floor fan to beach towels and beach toys. Lovely location and close to everything.
Amy is an awesome host! Great communication from beginning to end! She made sure we had everything we needed, even stuff I thought I might have to ask for. I wish all my trips were as stress free as this one was. Definitely a 10 and would recommend! Can't wait to come back!"

Stayed with kids","La Casita was perfect. We arrived later at night and the solar pathway lights and Amy’s clear instructions for check-in helped us get in and start our vacation. The entire unit was spotless, and our 8-year-old was more than happy to munch on the snacks provided. There were other thoughtful touches throughout, such as a shower cap and desk lamp with a wireless charger.
The neighborhood was quiet and pretty. We loved the garden under the window and watching the birds and small lizards fly and scurry around outside.
Amy also offered some beach gear, which was extremely helpful since we flew in and out of Tampa.
The location and amenities were perfect for our family, and made the whole experience better. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Amy’s place for 3 nights and one of those night, I had planned to cook rice. After I messaged Amy to ask her some other questions , I realized that there was no rice cooker. Amy immediately ordered a brand new rice cooker just for me. My family enjoyed a wonderful meal I cooked for them and we really appreciate Amy’s generosity. She didn’t really have to do that, but she went above and beyond to make sure we were happy during our stay.
Besides that, Amy was also very responsive when we had questions about how to use the appliances in the house. We felt so welcome and comfortable during our stay. I love the decor in the Master bedroom, the TV with soft music and the whole aquarium were turned on when we arrived. The house was super clean and spotless and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to visit Tampa. Thank you Amy for letting us to have the opportunity to stay at your cozy home!"

When I tried to extend, her place was already booked for the additional days but she helped and reahed out to other hosts. Thankfully, her other guests canceled so I was able to stay at her place! All the amenities were probably the best I've had an AirBnB which was great for me to do my meal prep (preparation for upcoming competitions) and even had amazing condiments that I could use for my meal preps. Absolutely loved it and look forward to staying there again."

Stayed a few nights","Amy was a great host and very responsive. Check in/out was easy. The place was clean and she went above and beyond with amenities. Down to beach gear, sunscreen, hair products, and she decorated the place for the concert we were attending with balloons and had the artist music playing when we came it which was very thoughtful. Beds were fairly comfortable. Location was quiet. You do hear a lot of stomping from the upstairs neighbors but it wasn’t terrible. The only improvement I suggested was better lighting and mirror in the guest room. Getting ready for a concert with 3 women was kind of hard with the only good lighting being the guest bathroom and sitting on the floor for the mirror in the living room. I would have just brought a lighted-mirror and used the desk area in hindsight. But overall, I 100% suggest this place and would stay again :)"

Quick access to either the Gandy bridge to get to St Pete’s or Interbay to cruise up into Tampa. Amy was wonderful again and had a couple fun surprises for our kids while we were there. My wife has been quite taken with some of the small details of the place. There were a couple of new updates this year which were neat. Once again this was perfect for us. Thanks Amy!"

It was wonderful to have beach chairs available…and the insulated tote was perfect to take on our 3 picnics. This place was a great place to go “home” to after our days of being tourists. Amy was a wonderful host-so prompt and responsive to our questions and concerns. We would definitely stay here again if our journeys bring us back to Tampa.

when we arrived, we were absolutely Amazed with what we saw! The home was spotless & clean and in every way exceeded our expectations...
We particularly liked the sense of a home away from home, as it was very comfortable and it had everything you could possibly need and more. The neighbohood was quiet and Beautiful.. The location was in walking distance to park & walking trail area.
Also close to a must try Eatery (Sal's Bodega) the Food was amazing!!!!"" We had a wonderful time and thoroughly recommend this Airbnd. Will be definitely booking it again.... Amy was so thoughtful and responsive and she went above and beyond for us during our stay..
Amy even put up Christmas tree for my family

I wish we could stay longer the only issue is the distance from our job site which is an hour and 45 min drive but her place was gorgeous and filled with little surprises if I’m ever on vacation in Tampa this is the spot I’m searching for first.

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed our short stay here— Such a cute apartment and the bathrooms were great (especially the showers)! The washer/dryer and dishwasher amenities were nice to have but we did have to buy our own detergent for both. Ceilings are squeaky from the tenant upstairs but they did provide a sound machine for one of the bedrooms. The host left a basket of snacks which made us feel right at home! Overall clean apartment and felt comfortable.

Stayed with kids","What a wonderful, clean, quiet and peaceful stay. There was everything you would need for a night’s stay or week. Toiletries, bottles of water, snacks, charging wires in case you forgot, etc. There is nothing that Amy didn’t think of! We would hands down stay here again. She was very accommodating to us and let us check in early and leave late. Best airBNB experience this far."

Stayed with kids","Amy was so on top of everything. Great and responsive communication. Home is very clean, location is safe, quiet, and just what we were looking for (not as central but that’s perfect for a family with a little one). Thoughtful touches throughout the home. I would stay again."

Amy is kind and helpful for any needs or questions you may have. Her home is lovely and updated and has all your needs for one or more nights!
Would definitely recommend and we will plan on staying again when in Tampa area again."

Stayed with kids","The perfect rainy last night on our Florida trip. Almost booked a hotel near the airport, so glad I didn’t. We made dinner, played games, had a chill movie night, and each had our own space to retreat to when the “togetherness of a family trip” got to be too much (wink). due to all the rain. Couldn’t have done that at a hotel! The layout, cleanliness, and thoughtful touches are worth it."

Stayed with kids","This place was great! Location gave easy access to everywhere we wanted to go. Very clean. Lots of plants made a wonderful addition and has my wife now trying out her own green thumb. We have two kids (7 and 4), they both were quite sad to leave their “Florida house”. Not huge, but ample room for our family of four to spread out and have our own down time. Very enjoyable!"
