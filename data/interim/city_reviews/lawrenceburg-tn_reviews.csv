Stayed with kids","We ended up running into Mara and she was so friendly! She was welcoming and responsive when I texted her, and the place was adorable! It had a modern vibe and was very spacious. We had a cooler full and she allowed us to check in a few hours early so we could put our food in the fridge. She had a make-up mirror in the bathroom--I've never seen one in an Airbnb before! It helped me see to put my contacts in! I love the extra little things that she had throughout the space that made it a great and comfortable place to stay. Two of our kids shared a queen bed and the other two kids used the sofas which flattened out into beds. We will stay here again if we come back to Lawrenceburg!"

Group trip","This location is the best that I have stayed in since I started using Arbnb for lodging.
We felt welcomed here and had total privacy. The loft was above and beyond in cleanliness, friendliness, and furnishings.
We adventured to experience the Amish way of life in Ethridge and we did but this place of lodging was icing on the cake.
Thank you Mara. People are already asking about it."

We were in town for a family wedding and it was a great location to easily get between Pulaski, Columbia, and Lawrenceburg. We even did a day trip to Lynchburg easily. Mara was excellent with communication and expectations and had a nice welcome book with additional information. I will definitely stay here again the next time I’m in town!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is beautiful. It is a great place to sit out on a covered deck to watch birds (eagles) and nature. Fishing is great off of the bank, deck, pier, using the kayaks or paddleboat. When you are done with the fishing, you can go and take a nap on the hammock.
If you do not want to get back to nature, then travel to Etheridge and see how the Amish live (great shopping)."

Stayed one night","Beautiful setting. We were greeted by a pair of nesting eagles flying in front of us as we pulled up to the house! Very spacious. Very comfortable. Clean, cottagy-feel. The back porch provides a peaceful spot for sitting viewing the many birds, including eagles, enjoying the water. Cows with their mooing in the fields across the way was fun and restful to listen to. I wish we had more time to spend at Alanna's but we were only passing through and staying for 1 night. I would highly recommend staying for longer if you can, to fully enjoy the natural setting and surroundings. Loved our stay!"

Stayed with a pet","This was one of the most peaceful and wonderful vacation stays we've ever had. The property was gorgeous and well laid out to give easy access to everything. We can't say enough about the back deck! We literally spent three days just lounging and relaxing on the deck playing games with the family. Being able to let our dogs roam free and play together with the neighborhood dog Bruce was great for them too!
Todd and Jennifer were great hosts and responded to everything quickly while making sure it didn't disrupt our stay at all. They put a great deal into ensuring we had every little thing possible so we could just enjoy our stay. Simple touches like an extra power strip on the deck that allowed us to have coffee fixings outside on the deck with us so we didn't have to go back and forth in the shanty topped it all off. If we're ever in the area again, we'd DEFINITELY stay again. Thank you both for an amazing and peaceful place to spend our vacation, it was just what we needed."

Stayed one night","Might be the best AirBnB we have experienced. Unique setting on the creek. Todd and Jennifer were very nice and helpful. I would highly recommend the Jennifer’s massage therapy. We had biked the Natchez Trace Parkway that day, and she did a great job of helping us recuperate. I would also recommend an early morning cup of coffee sitting down by the creek. Dangling your feet in the water is most invigorating. We will definitely be making work to revisit."

Stayed a few nights","Where to start… this place is perfect for anyone looking to get away. Especially if you’re in need of deep inner healing.
For me isolation is key when I need to come back to myself.
Even though I had to cut my trip short for family reasons, i couldn’t have picked a better place. It’s out in the middle of nowhere. So keep that in mind. If you like having Walmart within 10 minutes this isn’t the spot. Bring what you need with you. (Food, drinks etc.) you’ll be fine.
Attention to detail and providing needs such as grill, Hot plate, pots pan’s, keurig, coffee etc.
Topped with an adorable thoughtful gift, it was all spot on!
The out door shower is amazing!! Everything is laid out perfectly. Todd showed me how everything worked, lights, out house etc. Some people may not be down with the outdoor facilities, I think it’s great.
The dock by the creek was my happy place. I literally fell asleep in the chair twice!
I absolutely hated to leave. I can’t wait to go back."

When we arrived we were greeted with smiles even with us being so late. Todd and Jennifer are extremely welcoming and genuine people. The property is amazing! There’s not a single thing I would change… They went above and beyond for me and my guests even making us personalized keepsake gifts! I work in hospitality for a big hotel chain so I’m very particular. This place was immaculate! I can’t wait to go back and stay a few days next time! The best experience by far thanks to Todd and Jennifer and their hospitality! My little dog didn’t even want to leave lol Beautiful property, amazing hosts, wonderful experience!"

Stayed a few nights","The host were amazing and had us wonderful gifts when we arrived. Cabin and grounds were beautifully decorated, had everything you could ever think of, very clean. Just wasn't a big fan of no indoor restroom, but we were told that when we booked, Todd explained everything. It looked a little bigger inside in the pics, kitchen was extremely small, but it was nice, and on the outside deck has a very nice grill and sink and counter that made it easier to cook meals outside. All in all very cute little tiny home. Bed was very comfortable and lots of hot water! The outdoor shower was AWESOME with Alexa music by the creek. probably my favorite thing. Has indoor as well, but outside won us over.
Our only complaint was that a trailer was being moved in on our main night causing lots of disruption of the quite and calm we wanted so badly that we paid well to have, but things happen. Visits from dog Bruce were great!"

Stayed with a pet","Words will never truly do this home justice. The Shanty is magical, peaceful and quite unique. Driving through the creek as you head in is so special. The entire home is custom and quality. It was the most efficient use of space I’ve ever seen.
Todd & Jennifer are incredibly THOUGHTFUL as well as excellent communicators. The place is stocked with absolutely everything you need. We’ve stayed in many Airbnbs and this by far had the most personal touches and so much to do.
The outdoor shower is AMAZING and done so well.
The decks, huge fireplace, hammocks and slide all creek side create a vibe like nothing you’ve experienced. We played hook for hours out back and used the chalk board to tap into our creative abilities . Rest and relaxation awaits you. If you found this location I say just book it! We were sad to leave and can’t wait to go back."

Todd and Jennifer have put so much thought and effort into making your stay as stress free as possible. They were wonderful hosts who, since they were unable to greet us at our arrival, made a point of meeting us before we left and even invited us over to their other cabin to see the waterfall and show us around. Their thoughtful gifts, beautiful area and kindness will definitely have us back again!"

Stayed a few nights",The Shanty and Todd & Jennifer were amazing! They greeted us at check in. They had decorated the cabin for my girlfriend’s birthday! The view and sound of the creek is top notch. All of the amenities were great including the fire they had build for us when we arrived. The cabin was cozy and perfect for two. The outhouse is a neat experience! We will definitely be back!! One of my favorite bnb stays so far!

Stayed with a pet","I took to Todd and Jennifer’s looking for a peaceful place to run away to the woods for a retreat with myself and my pup. And WOW! That’s precisely what I got, and more! Todd and Jennifer were so incredibly thoughtful - there to meet me when I arrived, showed me the lay of the land, even added some personal touches based on what I told them ahead of time. I felt so very special! Like they had carved out this little piece of hevan just for me and Slinky : ) This is a place where you and your dog can be fully wild - enjoy the sounds of the creek, play in the creek, roam the woods, play with the neighbor dog (so friendly!). Coming here was the best gift I could have given myself, and one I plan to gift myself again!"

Stayed with a pet","This was the most incredible space I’ve ever stayed it. I felt like I was in a movie where someone has a life crisis and runs away, only to find a perfect little cabin in the woods that turned out to be exactly what that person needed to find themself again. This isn’t just a space to stay. This is a safe and sacred place, the serenity and beauty of nature all around is like no other. The hosts went far above and beyond any and everything possible. I would stay here every weekend if I could. My plan is to come back and visit as much as possible. Don’t hesitate booking this space! Oh and don’t let the “outhouse” worry you! It was very very clean and easy!
It was just a dream staying here!!! Thank you Todd and Jen for creating this amazing safe haven for so many."

This gorgeous cabin was just perfect for us and our 10 year old daughter (who really loved the loft) and two of our younger dogs. Plenty of room outside to explore and enjoy. Don't let the outside bathroom throw you - it is immaculate and was truly easy for everyone. The inside shower was fabulous - hot water and all. We loved it and will absolutely come again!"

The view was priceless and the environment was relaxing. They had everything we could have needed there. For example fire wood, bug spray, wood chips and kindling for the fire. They even gave all three of us including my pup a trinket to take home. Just what we were looking for. The lodging was very inviting, comfortable and clean. The bed was very comfortable. And we appreciated the hospitality for our pup. We want to go back and next time stay 3-4 days"

The Shanty was so cozy, beautiful & relaxing. The creeks, the slide, the hammocks, the fire pit, the decks were amazing. The cabin was so clean,cozy & beautiful. The bed was so comfortable & was very clean. We didn’t even leave the cabin;there was so much to do at the cabin & the surrounding area. We just stayed outside & relaxed. They had all the essentials to be able to prepare & cook all of our meals. It was just amazing. Before we got down the road we were planning our next trip back. It was a great place. I highly recommend staying here. You won’t be disappointed. Todd & Jen are so nice & so creative. Thank you both for letting us stay at The Shanty. It was a wonderful, relaxing stay!

Stayed a few nights","I lost my adult daughter, tragically and suddenly in February. It is healing for me to take last minute trips. I call it running away from home, and the more in the middle of nowhere, the better. Jennifer and Todd’s Shanty by the Creek was perfect. I had a bonfire ready to be lit for me on arrival. Todd also had some beautiful, healing music playing. I spent the next morning sitting in the creek. I went on a short creek walk-don’t forget your boots- my duck boots did great. Since I was alone without cell service, I decided not to go too far, although Todd offered to send a walkie talkie with me. After changing out of my wet socks and shoes, I spent the rest of the day in the hammock reading and listening to music and the creek. I only went inside to sleep, but it was so quaint. This is the perfect place for a woman traveling alone. I felt perfectly safe, and Todd was always available. They even left a little gift."

We felt so relaxed among the beautiful, peaceful scenery. The hosts are extremely thoughtful and friendly, and the personalized wooden keychains they made us make a great memento of our stay.

Don’t miss out, book The Shanty, you will not be disappointed. Todd and Jennifer were great hosts, so were their pups and kitty cat, Missy. Thank you, we will be back!!

There's no way to capture that tranquility through a photo. The personal touches and details are so on point. I think they've created the perfect 100/10 Airbnb experience. Go out of your way to go here (we did.. from Australia!). You'll feel like you're in a fairy tale (particularly Goldilocks and the 3 bears in the cottage!).

Stayed a few nights","I’m absolutely head over heels for this place. This was the first time I have booked a Air B&B myself. My friend booked a place in Miami for a bach trip and it was a bad experience. It made me hesitant to ever book on this app.
The Shanty changed that! Not only was the place exactly like it was described, it was better. This property is gorgeous. Any worries or anxiety completely went away the second we arrived. Its extremely safe and secluded. Todd and Jennifer are incredible. I know some people don’t like rentals where the hosts live on property. Do NOT let that bother you when it comes to this place!! Not only are they the nicest people you will ever meet, they are also respectful. It was my bfs birthday and they went above and beyond decorating, and making his day extra special.
I am already trying to figure out when we can come back. I didn’t want to leave. My only complaint is that I didn’t book this place for one more night. Already trying to book another stay here ❤️"

Todd and Jennifer have thought of so many specical features that make this place unique and special. From the adult sized wooden slide that dumps you right into the creek to the cozy deck right at the edge of the water that's perfect for sitting and sipping a glass of wine. If you prefer curl up in the hammock and listen to the sounds of the water and wildlife. There's another wooden deck that runs the length of the house with a gas grill, patio table with chairs, chalkboard and outdoor games. On the inside of the house you'll find even more special touches such as essential oils, candles, spa soaps, hand-crafted wooden queen sized bed (with a very comfy mattress) and lots of wood carvings. Todd and Jennifer even crafted a special gift for us to take with us as reminder of our trip."

Felt right at home even with cute welcome gifts from the hosts. The kitchen is perfectly stocked and easy to maneuver in. The shower outside and inside has plenty of hot water which made for nice long showers. Plenty of seating outside to enjoy. I was honestly a bit worried about the outhouse thing but it was easy peasy. No biggie. I worried for nothing. Lol. Bed is firm but comfy. If you want to watch tv .. there is Great selection.

Stayed with kids","We came here looking forward to some time beside a stream. We were given much more of a surprise then we could’ve asked for! There were plenty of things to do.The slide which safely landed the kids feet into the water was just perfect. We also enjoyed hearing the water flow from sitting on the back porch. Mr. Tod helped get the outside pit fire going & we lived ending our evening chatting as we sat by it. The kids enjoyed the outdoor private shower, which was excellent for relaxing and had plenty of hot water. There’s nothing lacking at this BNB. Pictures really don’t give the full impression of how beautiful and enjoyable the whole experience can be. I highly recommend this if you are needing time away and fun and refreshing."

We could have come with the clothes on our back and would have had everything we need. They brought us farm fresh eggs for breakfast and made us feel at home. The creek is beautiful and perfect to refresh from the TN heat. We will come again!

The place was exactly as it looked in the pictures, but was even more restful and beautiful. They thought of and provided everything. The outdoor seating and slide are perfect, and the shanty is clean and cozy, but the attention to detail is exceptional. We will definitely be coming back and recommending it to others, and can’t wait until Todd and Jennifer get their other place finished!"

If you love being in nature, peace and quiet, privacy, luxury in a cabin, with modern amenities, while being in the wilderness, this is your place. They did not miss a thing, from the luscious towels to the essential oils, to the modern indoor kitchen appliances and the perfect outdoor kitchen set up. Sadly we only had 3 nights here, and would love to return. Also the nearby hiking is stunning. Thanks for everything Todd and Jennifer."

They are the sweetest most awesome host ever! They go above & beyond to make sure your stay is nothing but perfect and perfect is what it was 100%. This is a great place to stay, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Spotlessly clean, super cozy & in a very quiet and peaceful location with such outstanding hospitality. The creek area is beautiful especially at night when sitting by a warm fire beside the creek. I just can’t brag enough about this place & Todd & Jennifer. Ohh… going down the slide is a must even for adults. Made the inner kid in me come out. So just book it! I promise you won’t regret it. I’ve already booked the Shanty again and I’m counting down the days to go back."

Babbling brook. Loved hearing it from the bed with the windows open.
But don’t forget the bug spray, if you sit outside. The “no-see-ums” bit me up good."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for the most peaceful and relaxing getaway this is the place! It’s literally a little slice of heaven! Todd and Jennifer are the BEST hosts! I was greeted by Todd and his daughter my first day there and he showed me everything I needed to know about the place, how to turn on the lights, the shower outside, and the bathroom etc… I cannot express how invigorating it was to shower outside (with a tankless water heater so you never run out of hot water) and be in nature. It was one of the highlights! Waking up to the sound of running water and beautiful sunlight hitting the windows every morning was just amazing. I sat by the creek and wrote songs and played guitar. I laid in the hammock and read, and sat by a fire at night. They provided fire wood too! And everything else you could need from blankets, bottled water, snacks, toiletries, etc.. if you’re not sure of whether or not to book it, DO IT! You won’t be disappointed!"

The cabin has so many cool thoughtful touches from leash hooks to keep your furry friend happy to mood lighting. We slept in the loft and it was a cozy den! The hosts are fantastic and make sure your stay is perfect. The fire pit by the creek and cozy deck and peaceful surroundings were the perfect spot to relax and get away from it all.

We were very comfortable inside and outside. We loved drinking our coffee down by the creek in the mornings and playing games on the patio at night. Our dogs loved playing in the creek and being able to come on vacation with us. This airbnb is absolutely wonderful, just book it!"

Stayed a few nights","This was by far the cutest little set up. It was evident that Todd and Jennifer spent a lot of time and energy making this place as comfortable for their guests as possible. It had the seclusion we were looking for, but all the comforts we weren’t looking to sacrifice! As parents and farm owners we needed a way to contact home, WiFi made that easily possible. The compost toilet was a first for the both of us, but it was much easier than I expected. The view and set up out back were perfect for the deep breaths we needed to take and the tiny house had plenty of room to relax inside. Todd and Jennifer welcomed us upon arrival(at 11:30 at night!) with a personalized gift and a fire! They gave us a quick but thorough tour and answered all questions, and we were made to feel so very welcome! We will definitely be bringing our kids back for the summer to enjoy the creek water(intentionally this time lol)."

Stayed with a pet","Words cannot express how amazing this place is!! The Shanty - a cute little tiny cabin by a flowing creek?! Dream come true! I brought my dog Laverne with me and she loved all the smells and got a few sips from the creek.
The inside - absolutely adorable and just enough room for us. TV with a Roku, big bed and black out curtains. Also a loft with a bed! A nice kitchen with all the amenities you need. I was so comfy and cozy.
The outside: The outdoor shower was glorious and roomy. I loved it! There’s also an indoor shower but I loved the outside one so much, I only used that. The woodwork is beautiful on the whole property. There’s a nice fire pit. Also….there’s a slide!! Yes, a slide!
My favorite part was the deck in front of the creek. I loved sitting, drinking coffee, and doing crosswords (provided by Todd and Jennifer)!
This was my first experience with a composting toilet. I was nervous but it was SO easy and clean!
Hands down, my favorite place :) Mika, the Queen, was fun too!"

In addition to the nature, I also enjoyed visiting the nearby Amish community (was my first time seeing the Amish) as well as the beautiful Davy Crockett state park.
On a side note- if you want to take a stroll through the neighborhood be aware of an extremely aggressive dog to the left of the driveway (one house over across the street)."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time. This place was SO quiet. We asked if there would be wood for the fire and not only did he collect some up but he had a fire built with kindling and everything so we just had to light it. He did have to come by the garage for a few minutes our first day but he text first to ask and was very prompt. He always responded to messages almost immediately. If you are in town please also check out these local gems that we totally LOVED: Escape from Warehouse 1 (one of the best escape rooms I've ever been to), Lo-town Coffee (great stuffed french toast) and Pearls for the Home (a sweet, unique home decide/gift store). Will definitely be back.
*If you are looking for a super fancy, modern style cabin, this isn't for you but if you are looking for a comfortable, quiet, escape then this is perfect."

Stayed with kids","We stayed in Lawrenceburg for my son’s baseball tournament. We chose this house because it was close to the baseball fields and we were happy that there were lots of restaurants and grocery store close by. Upon driving to the house, the neighbor across the street has a huge 20 foot skeleton in the front yard which alarmed my kids. (It is July, not near Halloween!) Unfortunately upon entering the house, there was a strange and unappealing smell that I could not get over. My husband thought it smelled like a someone had been smoking pipe, but I thought it was mothballs. I was also disappointed that we were only provided 1 roll of toilet paper and there were no additional garbage bags than the one in the kitchen upon arrival. The washing machine/dryer works but it is noisy. The decor was very nice and the beds were comfortable. My kids loved playing outside in the large yard and catching lightning bugs."

Stayed one night",Owners were friendly. We love dogs however they had a dog that kept coming around jumping up on us trying to sometime get into the house. Very Annoying. We had a grandson graduating from high school and we had a few of his friends drop by to take pictures with him for about 30 minutes and eat some Barbecue. The owners texted and said we had too many people there. We let them know before hand we were doing that. Guess they forgot. The master bedroom needed a chair to sit in to dress and it would have been nice to have a recliner in the living room. There should be better screen doors that have better latches. All in all it’s a beautiful location but maybe a little too close to the owners house . Over all we enjoyed our stay.

Also the check out was “before 10 am” which was difficult to do with kids and making sure we had time for cleaning, packing, showers, and breakfast. There was plenty of places to sleep. The internet didn’t work for us so we weren’t able to really use it at all. It was quiet and nice to have space to walk around outside."

Stayed one night","We were driving from Western NY to TN when we found Jodi's farm house in Amish country just outside of Lawrenceburg. The setting and layout of the home were perfect for our needs. Jodi was responsive and helpful with communication. Self check-in was helpful, since we were arriving very late. We were able to rest from the 13+ hours in the car with my 78 y/o mama. The beds were very comfortable, although we found the linens on one bed to be overworn and embedded with human hair. We let the host know about the linens and a couple other cleanliness issues and trust they will be addressed.
Waking up to the country air, horse and buggies clip-clopping down the rode, and a breezy front porch to rise and shine was the good medicine we needed to get back on the road again. They even had ice cream treats in the freezer!
As Airbnb superhosts back in NY, we found the experience to be overall a positive one. To have the whole house to ourselves and the peaceful setting were highlights for us."

Group trip","I appreciate how clean everything was. There were also cleaning supplies available, and the tubs and bathrooms were clean. So was the refrigerator and freezer. Clear instructions in a frame that told us the wi-fi and restaurants and phone numbers to reach them in an emergency.
I appreciated that a pool guy had come just before we arrived. Also, the nightlights and Kleenex were in every room, which was a nice touch. Just like the bonfire pit that was loaded and ready to light. The cleanliness was the most important thing to me. My parents appreciated the porch swing and the beautiful trees and large back yard. The hardwood and the lights were just such a beautiful open home with a big dining room table. Plus, each room had a chair and place to put our bags. IT was wonderful!"

Stayed with kids","Baylen'sv home was just like the photos. It was accommodating for my mom who has limited mobility. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms offered plenty of closet space. I would definitely stay again. Cons: no iron, water was only hot enough for 2/4 of us to shower back to back, Only 1 bedroom have a TV, I didn't want to leave the peaceful space. Pros: Baylen was an awesome host who responded quickly when I went into the wrong apartment and ALMOST panicked when I walked into an EMPTY apt., lol y'all I thought I got scammed! But when you have a AWESOME HOST who quickly led me in the right direction. It was a LONG 12 hour drive to Tennessee, that was supposed to be 9.5 hours. But once we got to the correct location, it was the perfect place to shower and relax on the couch or bed. PICK THIS PLACE! The locals are great and helped when we had a little fender bender. Stranger took us to get a new tire and to the tire shop. This town felt like home! I'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","We were staying over to attend a family wedding in Paluski. We recommend this place. I think this might be a former sharecropper's house, or something like that. It has been completely modernized, they did a very nice job.
The location is on a country road close to several Old Amish farms. We would see folks ride by in their horse-drawn buggies several times a day. There is an Amish Heritage museum showing Amish farm living down the road about a half-mile. You might also find it interesting to drive along some of the back roads, and see the Amish farms.
For breakfast and lunch, we recommend Bob's Cafe, on Route 43 next to the museum building."

When they found out we were traveling with an infant they hand delivered a playpen and high chair to make our stay more comfortable and we were really grateful for that.

Stayed a few nights","Eric’s place had a special feel to it. He put a Welcome sign with my name on the door to my room, like the luxury hotels are now doing. The day after I settled in, my productivity in studying for my upcoming certification exam immediately increased.
I visited the local attractions like Ethridge Amish community and Davy Crockett State Park. The highlight of all these was staying home in Eric’s space on the patio in front of the pond next to his home.
Eric was extremely flexible in check-in and check-out, which helped me a lot. I got sick from an excellent gluten free restaurant in Columbia, TN, and had to stay until it passed. I appreciated his recommendation for the Walmart in town, where I stopped when I first tried to leave and decided to return to Eric’s place. The Kroger Eric told me about had great health food options and worked out much better for me than more expensive, health-oriented restaurant food.
Overall great value for a semi-remote space w/ all suburban utilities"

The house and surrounding neighborhood are beautiful, especially the nice big kitchen and outdoor seating area. The cats can become bossy if you stay on a longer trip, (started meowing at night) so I would recommend having them put away.
A hotel stay will get you likely a nicer bed, blackout curtains, and stronger wifi. I was getting only about 25mbs download speed and Microsoft Teams and FaceTime weren’t able to reach HQ video. Erics place will give you a bit of stargazing, a country feel, the ability to cook food, and a cool place to hang out at."

I have always been a city girl, so wasn't sure how it would be to be in the country, but it was really soothing and relaxing being out of the hustle and bustle. Eric's place has a pond to the side of the house and a swing where you can sit and relax. I am not even a bird watcher but really liked looking at the colorful birds that hang around the property.
While you are out in the country, you are not out of civilization, Eric's place has all the modern conveniences and is really beautiful and full of great design and craftsmanship - I was impressed by his modern home. Also, I have stayed at other airbnbs where reviewers have written they were spotless, and haven't always agreed with other people's reviews. This place is truly spotless, so please respect this wonderful place if you stay there.
Finally, this airbnb is really close to an Amish community, so if like me you are interested in learning about Amish culture there is an Amish Welcome Center where you can learn more, or you can drive around and wherever you see a sign for fresh eggs, cheese, baked goods or custom furniture you can stop and buy something directly from the Amish families and get a glimpse into their very different way of life.
If I am ever in the area again I will stay here for sure. Eric was a kind and generous host and a really talented and interesting person to get to know."

Stayed a few nights","If you get the chance to stay with Eric, I would highly recommend it. I arrived as a guest but left as a friend. From the house to the host, this was southern hospitality at its finest. Eric’s house is situated right next to a large pond where we got to go kayaking. From the room, you get a beautiful and serene view of the trees and the pond creating a lakefront like feel. Breakfast on the porch with the swinging chairs added to the peaceful farm feel. Eric also took me around town and showed me some of the best places to eat, hang out and even introduced me to his entire family. His place is also extremely close to the worlds fattest pig, Jimmy, which is definitely worth a visit. Make sure to bring a donut or five with you if you visit Jimmy. My time at Eric’s house was the perfect retreat and I left rejuvenated and with a new friend."

I was left alone to swing in a hammock between two trees by the lake. I feel fortunate to have had the chance to speak with Ernestine, who is a gem of a lady with a pure heart, and loved hearing her stories about this beautiful property she's found time to open to travelers like myself. I hope you get the chance to relax and take advantage of this serene location and great host."

We will definitely be back, and I'll stay at any cabin Ernestine has to offer. She is absolutely wonderful! She welcomed us within minutes and was super, super responsive. We had a water main break the 2nd night we were there, and Ernestine had it fixed before we ate breakfast the next morning. That folks is record timing if you have ever had a water main break!

Stayed with a pet","Such a nice secluded location. We weren't there long enough to utilize all that it offered, but if we were, we would have. The space was clean and cozy. The air conditioning (and heating) is not ducted into the rooms and so if you want either of those things in the room you have to leave the doors open while you sleep, and at all times to get them to a comfortable temperature. While it was dry while we were there, had it been raining the place would have been a mud pit as there is no grass or.ground covering of any sort immediately around the cabin. It's relatively new construction, So I would assume that's coming at some point."

Don’t expect a 5 star cabin (this isn’t a knock, we loved the place!!!) but it’s in the woods so you’re going to encounter bugs and flies and things of the like. The hosts do stock the kitchen with a fly swatter and fly traps so that’s super nice.
The place stayed cool despite the hot temps, too.
I’d recommend bringing your own disposable or plastic dishes. There are some there, but not a ton. You can totally get by if you don’t feel like hauling all of that though, we did!!
We had a great stay. The girls loved seeing all the geese and turtles and exploring the property. We’d absolutely love to go back!"

The lodge is clean, beautiful, well stocked, and always smells amazing! The beds are clean and comfy and there’s a fireplace outside and a ping pong table inside. Perfect for family getaways! She has a binder made up for her guests that is full of useful local info on things to do, places to shop, local places to visit, and local places to eat! She is very responsive and eager to accommodate! We love to get away and this is the perfect place to stay while we visit the local Amish community! We can’t way to visit The Lodge again!"

Fun times with ping pong table on the family room. Fast internet for streaming. Awesome outdoor patio and fireplace. Our doggo loved exploring the yard. Our host Maryn was so easy to contact and made us feel right at home. I would highly recommend the Lodge. We’ll be back in April."

The water pressure was like something I’ve never felt before! Silly, but in Florida we have nothing like that! The Amish stroll by in their horse/carriage on the main road and it’s convenient to Lawrenceburg being right out of town. We will definitely book this place again next time we are up to visit my dad!"

Unfortunately, there were few opportunities nearby to eat, also the Amish people were not enthusiastic about strange people, so we had a slightly different experience than we thought but that was certainly not due to the airbnb because everything was well arranged there!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're looking for a place to disconnect with a too-busy life, spend some time at the Amish Lodge. However, if you choose to stay connected, that also is possible with a work desk and WIFI provided. When you walk through the door, the farm style decor invites you in with a feeling of ""coming home"". The Lodge is immaculately clean, with a large, well equipped kitchen. Beds are super-comfy. Maryn is the perfect host. She communicated well and provided info and tips for our stay. We especially appreciated her personal note of welcome. Our only regret is that our short stay, planned for visiting a family member recuperating from surgery, didn't allow time to enjoy the outdoor patio, fireplace and gas grill. Hopefully, we'll be able to return for a longer visit in the future."

We had a problem with the Propane tank went Out texted her, and she told us exactly where to go and sent me the money. If you go pay attention to all the details, they are awesome. She's done a great job with the house. My favorite spot was the back patio, and every time the amish wagon came by, my two year old granddaughter would say my horse is coming . She also has a book to write in to tell about your stay. And believe me, if you forgot anything, she has it. I also wanted to walk away with the spice cabinet. lol"

Loved sitting on the patio watching the Amish travel in their buggies & hearing the clopping of the horses. Maryn was the perfect hostess-providing a list of restaurants, must-see attractions, & securing a safe space (tornado warnings one night of our day). Perfect location--Mule Day festivities in Columbia, shopping at Town Square in Columbia, antique shopping in Lawrenceburg, touring Amish Country in Ethridge. Best restaurants: Marcy Jo's, Puckett's, Amish Smokehouse, Pat's Diner, and Striker's Steakhouse. Thank you Maryn for navigating a perfect trip. We will be back soon to finish what we left off. :)"

The little things like snacks, coffee pods, creamer, detergent to wash items, all the kitchen and cleaning supplies you might need, feminine hygiene, products, extra toilet paper/paper towels, extra towels that don’t matter if they get some stains on them for like washing your dog or messes kids make, wood/lighters/lighter fluid, gas grill, etc. for the fireplace, nice chairs to sit in outside, ping pong table, darts, games and toys for all ages, extra pillows and blankets. I could go on and on! It’s very centrally located to local attractions, stores and shopping. It is right off the highway and you hear a little noise but actually it just sounds like white noise. It’s a very open floor plan. Which is great! The exposed beams are beautiful! There is so much room. This is truly a hidden gem. You will be missing out if you don’t book this place."

Stayed a few nights",The Amish Lodge is conveniently located. It is close to retail and restaurants (Lawrenceburg is a couple of miles away). The porch area is nice and would be great for cool fall evenings. It is located near a busy highway which was a little noisy but tolerable. Parking is convenient and access to the property was easy. The house has a rustic feel with beautiful open beams in the living and bedroom areas. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen will have most anything you would need. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this property to others.

Stayed a few nights","Maryn is a terrific host. She communicated with me to ensure that I had everything possible to enjoy my stay. The house is spacious and super quiet. I love it. The vibe is perfect. What a gem!
Exceptionally clean, the beds are ridiculously comfortable, the neighbors are quiet. It is one the best places for study, for business, or for a simple romantic weekend. A little rustic, but the aroma of fresh sawn lumber is therapeutic to one's sole. If you are considering a secluded, perfect, get-away, book it now. You will not regret it."

Stayed with a pet","10/10! My boyfriend and I (and are two cats) stayed for 3 weeks and worked from the lodge remotely
Pros:
-great Wi-Fi
-ping pong table (we played about 100 games)
-lovely accommodations
-super comfortable bed and couch
-great shower pressure
-large kitchen with all essentials plus extra personal touches from the host
-patio with grill and fireplace
-dedicated parking
-suggestions from host
-wonderful host!
Something to note for other guests: the lodge has a true cabin build so the rooms are separate by walls but no ceiling. So you have privacy but you can hear from the other rooms and kitchen. So it may not be very private if you are staying with another couple or friends."

Stayed with kids","When we first walked into ""The Amish Lodge"" it stunned us by how charming, cozy and how loved it is by the owners who have taken phenomenal upkeep in every room. We were provided basic necessities (though we had brought our own), the house had supplies that one may forget but are important to our daily needs and care. They even had razors, towels, feminine hygiene products, capped toothbrushes, and MANY more toiletries! I was honestly shocked how they have thought of everything that one may need when staying away from their home. This home really is like a home away from home. It was such a pleasure to have picked this home out of the at least 30 other prospects we had on Airbnb. There was even an incidence on the last night where I had dropped a glass cup and I had told them in the morning, they were super forgiving and even said we didn't have to pay for it. It was an extremely kind and caring gesture that I honestly was shocked by. We even had left two items that we had gotten while there and Maryn and Maria are even coordinating how we can retrieve it. They are great woman who go out of their way to make sure all our needs and wants are met. Our whole family wishes them many blessings and we hope that many others book this beautiful place and see what this part of Tennessee has to offer."

Stayed a few nights","The Amish Lodge was a perfect little getaway. We wanted to be close to Nashville, but not too close. Ethridge is a cute little town off the beaten path that also provides your basic necessities such as grocery stores, gas, and a few restaurants. I loved seeing the horse and buggies around! Maryn has done an excellent job to ensure that everything you need is present. From coffee, to towels, spices for cooking, or just the ability to cook a home-made meal, the Amish Lodge is a great stay. The King bed was extremely comfy! Laundry on site. An outdoor fireplace on the patio. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area, or just looking for a calm, home-y space. Thank you for your hospitality!"

Her attention to detail is so carefully thoughtful. The place itself is very cozy and comfortable with a lot of fun things to do (fireplace, ping pong, toys for kids if they are tagging along), and the furniture/bedding/extra blankets add to the warmth of the cabin. The location is in a beautiful, quiet corner of Tennessee, which allows for some fun exploring. We particularly enjoyed finding new hiking trails and areas to explore. Maryn is a great host--you will not be disappointed staying with her."

Stayed one night","We really liked the decorations, layout and openness of the home. There are two bedrooms but be aware that the ceiling is open so there is not as much privacy if you are in the bedrooms. We liked the location but there is a home next door and would liked for there to be a little more privacy between the airbnb and the home next door. The home is very convenient to the area with Amish community being so close and Lawrenceburg being just minutes away. We loved that. The only thing that was disappointing was the presence of bugs. We notified our host and she was very apologetic and was having her pest service folks in as soon as we left. We would consider staying again in the future."

I wish we would have had time to visit the coffee shop but we arrived after it closed and left before they opened. Will definitely stay again.

Stayed with kids","My entire family absolutely loved the place! We were all very impressed by the condition of the home and how cozy it made us all feel. My daughter (7) was so very excited to sit on the balcony and wave as the people strolled by, my husband on the other hand was more than thrilled over the coffee station in each room, and I just couldnt get over the beds and decor! Stephanie has been such a wonderful host! Always kind, very responsive, and thoughtfull our departure was tough. We couldn't seem to want to leave the place and having the coffee shop with such wonderful food and drinks below almost convinced us to stay just one more night. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town as a surprise for my Dad's 80th birthday. The entire experience with Stephanie and her staff was effortless. This grand old Victorian was exceptionally clean and well stocked. There is a quirk that became endearing. The space is shared with a coffee shop on the main floor, Chuckaboo Coffee House. It's a hangout and a great way to meet the very friendly locals. It's rewarding to support efforts to care for these older homes. I wish the Garrett House all the success in the world."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay here. The place was super clean and had everything you need in the bathrooms. If you’re looking for 3 bedrooms with 2 baths, this place can’t be beat. It does not include the kitchen, but we loved the coffee house on the first floor, with a great little area off the front porch to sip on your coffee. Staff was really friendly. Super fun place. Every bedroom has a tv with Rocu. Also had a great balcony off the second floor. We’ll be back here next time we’re in Lawrenceburg!"
