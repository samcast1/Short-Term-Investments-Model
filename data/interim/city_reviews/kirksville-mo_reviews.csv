Group trip","We had an amazing time at this Airbnb in Kirksville! We were in town for a graduation, and this location was perfect. It was so nice being able to come and go easily, feeling safe all weekend. The house is conveniently located near the main areas of Kirksville, making everything easily accessible. The home is cozy and inviting, with plenty of room for everyone. We loved the thoughtful touches and amenities, especially the hidden bed in the ottoman—it was such a delightful surprise! The beds and linens were very comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. This was the perfect place for us to spend the weekend while visiting our Truman student. We definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a comfortable and memorable stay!"

Stayed a few nights","As one of my daughter’s friends described it, “we found the one nice airbnb in kirksville!”
I’m sure that’s not true, but now all of us want to rehab a church into a house. Such a fun experience. Loved the touches. Loved the amenities. Plenty of room. Even a “hidden” bed in the ottoman. Thought for sure it was in the couch. We stayed for a graduation. Was so nice being able to come and go and close to everything."

Stayed a few nights","I would call this lovely home the gem of Kirksville! I loved every minute of my stay here and wished I could have stayed longer. The whole place was spotless and the decorating style was exquisite. It had a fresh and modern feel yet had a ton of character and charm. It was even better in person than the photos! The cathedral ceilings and woodwork throughout was breathtaking. Absolutely everything you would ever need in this completely stocked kitchen and I cooked every night. It was so cozy and quaint but felt spacious and open...perfect for a couple or a small family. The neighborhood was calm and quiet and just a few minutes from anything you might want to do in Kirksville. Bethany was the BEST hostess! She was so gracious and accommodating and responded to questions pretty much immediately with an upbeat and friendly disposition. My stay in the ""church house"" exceeded all my expectations and I hope to stay here again on my next visit to Kirksville. :)"

Pat and Ginger, our hosts, checked in with just the right amount of attentiveness, adding to our comfort without intruding on our privacy. We are immensely grateful for the tranquility and comfort provided to us during our stay."

Stayed with kids","We arrived to Hackberry Cottage later in the evening after the sun had set. Pulling up to it, Ginger had the lights on and we could see it looked lovely! Communication with her throughout our stay was fantastic.
Inside was clean and very inviting. There were treats and a sign greeting us when we walked in as well as Christmas decorations and music playing lowly from the living room TV. She mentions antiques in her listen, and they are gorgeous. Additional, should you look closely, some artwork on the walls is by the host herself!
There was everything you could possibly need and more. My children thought the “secret room” (a small nook/nursery off the master) and balcony were the best thing!
We stayed in town for my fall graduation from Truman, but all agreed we should make a plan to come back in the summer to be able to enjoy the outdoor spaces. (It was colder and rainy.)
I’ll end with this wasn’t just the loveliest Airbnb we’ve stayed at but the loveliest place in general!"

Group trip","The home was spacious. 3 floors that made it easy for our group to be together and also privacy with bedrooms and a bathroom on each floor. The kitchen was well supplied with all that we needed, including two sets of dishes, one more formal and one for all the time. The dining area offered a large table for meals and/or playing a game or putting a puzzle together. We enjoyed the Keurig and snacks that we found upon arrival. The ""welcome"" sign really made us feel at home. We would definitely recommend Kirksville's Cottage in the Woods and hope that we will have another opportunity to stay there. THANK YOU, Ginger & Pat!

Group trip","So relaxing. Just what my Brother,Son, Son-in-law, a good friend of ours and I needed. After a long day of fishing and a Colton’s steak dinner, we were ready to retire to the relaxing showers and beds to get up early and do it all over again.Ginger was quick to respond to any questions we had but for some reason I was only getting part of her message. We all are impressed how everything we needed was here. We didn’t get a chance to cook in the very well stocked kitchen. We needed a whole week to enjoy everything. Patrick and Ginger have gone above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Can’t wait for another trip to the Chalet in the woods and stay longer. Thanks again Patrick and Ginger for a great stay. We highly recommend you .✝️"

Ginger was a responsive host, checking in frequently to make sure we didn't need anything. I was traveling alone with my teenage daughters so safety was very important to me. This home is located in a very nice neighborhood and I felt safe and totally at home. We were visiting friends and the girls were able to make so many sweet memories here. This was the very best vacation rental that I have stayed in. I would highly recommend this home and host."

Group trip","We enjoyed our stay and it was much easier to navigate than staying in a hotel! We had 7 people in and out all weekend. The large dining table was great for gathering and playing games. The multiple levels and beds and baths was nice for everyone to have their space. Please note, the upper level was very warm and the lower level was very cold! Make sure guests are prepared for this. Almost everything you need is in the kitchen and bathrooms and the coffee bar with snacks was a nice touch. We had two big celebrations over the weekend and we will consider coming back to this spot when we are in town again. The outdoor fire pit and conversation area was nice and peaceful as well. Ginger made note that they were out of town prior to our arrival and that the issues we encountered were due to an outsourced cleaning service and that they would have attended to things much more closely. Though it is a cottage, it is very spacious and has lots of fun decor items to explore."

They truly have tried to think of everything to make their guests comfortable and ensure they have an amazing stay. If I ever need to stay in this area again I would not stay anywhere else!

Stayed with kids","Pat and Ginger were extremely accommodating and the house was perfect for our stay. You could see the neighbor's houses through the trees, but the house was private enough we didn't see another person the whole time we were there, but also close enough to town that a short drive brought you right to the middle of Kirksville. The hosts were extremely responsive and very helpful to answer any questions we had about the house or area."

From goodies on the table to bananas hand delivered; from clearing snow from walks and my car windshield to offering help on loading our car at checkout.
We felt comfortable and private yet knew that if we needed anything, they would be there to help.
We come to Kirksville often, and our grandkids have now dubbed this their favorite place to stay when we're all together!"

Group trip","Of all the AirBnB places we’ve stayed, Ginger’s stands out, top of the list. Where do I start? The house was shining with lights and Christmas decor when we arrived, and we had a personalized welcome sign! The roomy size, decor and the little touches made it a gracious, comfortable place. So many choices of tea and tea pots, coffee pods, bananas-even extra food and snacks in the pantry. Truly Ginger and Pat are kind, carefully thoughtful hosts. Our teenagers loved it, wondered wistfully what it would be like in the summer."

Stayed with kids","We go to Kirksville every year to have Thanksgiving with my parents. We selected this place so that ourselves, our adult children, and grandchildren could all be together in one place vs separate hotel rooms. This was the perfect place. Ginger was an incredible host, and even provide wonderful treats and a delicious cake! We had a couple minor issues with an appliance not working, but it was taken care of immediately. Ginger followed up with us to be sure we got checked in OK, had everything we needed, and checked on us throughout the stay. Beds were comfortable, kitchen was great! Several of us worked remote from the house for a few days, and the WiFi was fast and strong for all of us to work successfully. Separate spaces were wonderful. The environment was peaceful, with deer in the yard every night. Beautiful pergola with a fire pit. Just a wonderful stay altogether. Everything was clean. We loved one of the blankets so much we bought one for ourselves! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough how this was the absolute best b&b rental we've ever stayed in! The house really, truly was outfitted with everything. The kitchen alone had cooking amenities you just don't find everywhere. The house was immaculately clean and welcoming from the moment we entered. The outdoor firepit area isn't just a firepit area; there is a percola(?) type frame with swings, separate seating, hammocks, etc. So relaxing! I tried to get a picture of the deer in the yard the second morning, but they were mia. The first morning, we sat and watched one literally romping and dancing in the yard for at least 15 minutes; guessing he was happy the rain had stopped! Towels galore, comfy galore, comfortable beds and attentive hosts at an absolutely fabulous price! What more can you ask?"

The house has so much character and is the perfect family place. There are plenty of rooms and a wonderful deck and area to sit and relax outside. It was very clean. From the floors to the ceiling fans, every detail was thought of. The beds all had freshly cleaned sheets and all the throw blankets were clean.

Very clean with nice furnishings. Large kitchen and bedrooms and the sunroom is really an extension of the living room with a wide open area-makes the space seem very large. There’s an extra memory foam mattress in the front closet. The bird watching was interesting even for non bird watchers. The main bath shower and claw foot tub are awesome! One thing to know-there is only a TV in one bedroom and none in the living room. However, we played games and did just fine without it. This is a great location for parents wanting to spend the weekend with their college student or families wanting to gather."

It is close to the town square and many fun places and good restaurants. Julia was very easy to work with and very helpful. If we plan to stay in Kirksville overnight again, we will definitely pick Julia's house again. Whie it was a bit noisy; we live in the country and have forgotten what it's like having other people close by is like. So, it most likely normal if you are used to living in town. LOL. It would be nice to see general location of offered houses on Airbnb before you commit. Overall, very happy with our first experience with Airbnb and Julia. Will use this service again."

Stayed one night","Bailey's Little Cabin in the Woods is perfect getaway for anyone - family, couples, hunter, girls/guys get away, single. This is a beautiful secluded property with ALL the comforts of home with some unique decor - hunter's sweet spot with needed woman's flair. Several different woodpeckers and other birds were showing off in the trees around the property while we enjoyed the short groomed trail behind that led to a deerpath and dried up creek bottom.
The screened in back deck was great spot to enjoy the soft light and meal cooked on firepit, while an American Woodcock sounded off in the woods. There is small open small deck as well-either spot great for reading/writing, crafts, games, coffee or cold beverage. Smores and popcorn over firepit while watching the sky light up with night stars before turning in to rest and prepare to explore state parks the next day. Don't worry if nature isnt your thing, Kirksville is nearby with some stores/shops. Bailey can give ya tips to enjoy!"

Thank you for creating this space in Novinger! We always stay in a hotel in Kirksville when we visit from Colorado. The local hotels make me feel like we’re being scammed for the value. Your tiny cabin offered tranquility and a chance for my 4 year old and I to do some bonding. He had never seen an acorn before! We created memories in this cabin that we will never forget.

Did lots of fishing with my family and Jay fried some amazing fish. Place was clean and organized, I have zero complaints and we will definitely be booking the cabin soon. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you want to have a peaceful vacation. Jay, thank you for your friendship! Much love and respect to Gina and Jay.

Group trip","We stayed at Gina's place for graduation weekend in May at Truman. The cabin is in a small clearing with surrounding woods--very private and peaceful. It's about a 15 minute drive from the Truman State campus. It worked well for our family. There's a fire pit/fire ring on the property and Jay was kind enough to provide some firewood for us to have a bonfire one night. Both Gina and her husband Jay were very responsive before and during our stay. Guests should be aware that Hungry Hollow Rd leading to the cabin off Hwy 63 is a country gravel road, fairly narrow and some hills, so drivers will need to go slow (you might want 4 WD in winter driving conditions). A window air conditioning unit cools the house in warmer months. Best to keep doors to the bedrooms open at night if you want them to be cool (especially the bedroom furthest from the unit). We enjoyed our stay and we wouldn't hesitate to book again!

Stayed about a week","What a special cabin in the woods. This is the perfect place to stay for someone who appreciates a country atmosphere. The place is beautifully decorated. Contains everything you need to make meals while you're there. Complementary coffee is available. You are on your own slice of heaven with fishing and public land a close walk away. Town for those who like to shop is off about 3 miles of gravel about 6 mile drive total. The area is beautiful and hospitable. I personally loved being in the country with cows, deer, and other woodland creatures. Open windows let the natural ambiance pour inside.
The hosts are wonderful people who make your stay comfortable and welcoming.
The bridge is now open. Be prepared for loose gravel and dirt on your vehicle. Other reviews had mentioned not having a private driveway... While the driveway can be seen from the road there is a driveway for you and your guests to park vehicles in. And you are not sharing it with other guests or the hosts."

Stayed with kids","This is a nice place to stay. The host met us right away and was very helpful. When we couldn’t figure out the Wi-Fi, he came right back and helped that was much appreciated. A short walk down a gravel road is Hazel Creek Lake. The Hosts live Close by, but you can’t see their house and you can really only see one house in the distance. Nice small deck on the back of the house made a great place to have a morning cup of coffee.
You can’t go wrong here if you’re wanting to stay in the country yet still be close to Kirksville or Greentop .
When the bridge is fixed, it will have excellent access to 63 Highway. Until then you do you have to take some gravel to get there, but it’s not that bad if you are used to driving in the country.
We plan to stay again."

It was just nice to step away from the hustle and bustle of life and enjoy peace and nature! I went by myself, but noticed there were toy cars and coloring books for children as well.

This cabin is much bigger than you would expect, every room is spacious. The bathroom has plenty space for several people to leave their things out or place in the pantry shelves. The beds were very comfortable; the layered quilts and blankets were wonderful and felt similar to a weighted blanket. I hope this cabin is available whenever we visit Kirksville.

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in many rental homes in the United States and Canada. This home met and exceeded all of my expectations. Eddie & Co. have taken this lovely 1940s home and turned it into a charming get away. Booking and pre-arrival communication was quick and easy. The home has clearly been refreshed and decorated in a fun farm theme that matches Kirksville. The beds and linens are comfortable. One point to note would be that the bathroom is very narrow as is often found in older homes. This was not a problem for one person use, but if you had reason to have two people in the bathroom simultaneously (i.e. providing assistance) it might be a bit challenging. The bathroom was spotless and nicely appointed. The kitchen/dining/coffee area has lots of room for enjoying a meal. The location of the house is great for visiting our Truman daughter and access to restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet. Would return in the future. Thanks for a nice stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Small, but lovely!
My friend and I stayed 2 nights at this cabin. It was cozy, the hosts communicated well, and we had just about everything we needed.
It's small, as listed, so I found it most ideal for two people, but the host offers an inflatable mattress if desired/needed for up to 4 guests. It's in a pretty location, though the distance from nearby towns is something to consider (I didn't mind the drive, others might).
I found the furnishings charming, and it's packed with books to read, card and board games to play, and media players for dvds, cds, and even records. There's internet, but you could certainly find entertainment the whole stay without it.
The listing fails to mention the incinerator toilet though, and there is no door on the bathroom, just a curtain. These things are manageable, but somewhat unpleasant surprises. I also found their cookware to be too small to properly cook for two people.
The pros outweigh the cons though, and I plan to visit again someday."

Stayed a few nights","Interesting, cozy, and peaceful. A log cabin-style tiny home. Renee was responsive and provided all the information I could need. The lights from their house behind the cabin prevented it from feeling secluded to the point of being spooky, but it was quiet, so very quiet. This was a perfect place to get some much-needed alone time surrounded by beautiful woods. There is a fire pit stocked with plenty of firewood and implements for cooking. Everything needed to make s'mores was waiting for me on the table, which was a nice additional surprise. Plenty of books and art supplies were available, and I especially enjoyed completing one of the available jigsaw puzzles. Heating, cooling, hot water, and Wi-Fi were all reliable.
Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","I rented Loyd and Renee's Yarrow Cabin to visit nearby family. It's location is a perfect distance to feel ""away from it all"" without being too far.
Their clearly recognizable signage was appreciated from photos.
I had my senior sidekick, Queen Ella Doodle, with me. I greatly appreciated their welcoming and accommodations for pets. Upon entry, Renee placed a paw towel for me after I advised I'd bring my paw plunger for Ella's 4 mudmops, in case of rain. There is a designated potty patch with signage, and a nearby trash can. I did bring my own bags.
Cozy. Thoughtful heart was put into every inch.
Perfect size for just me and The Queen. Slept solid. The bedroom loft ceiling is angled and low. My height is 5'6"" and I managed ok.
My only issue was with the incinerator toilet, and it was operator error. My 6am paper placement did not align, causing exactly the mess the sign warned me about. I was really careful after that!
Lovely place and lovely people!"

The beds were comfy and the kitchen was well stocked. The internet was a little spotty at times and cell service is not available, but it only helped us to unplug more. The only thing we missed was a place for the four of us to gather together other than the dining table - which we used to eat and play cards which was still fun. There are a couple of recliners in the living room, which we used a lot for reading. The TV room in the basement had a small couch for our two kids to watch a movie. The patio was a nice bonus. We did some stargazing at night that was great. Overall, this was a great place off the beaten path and it was a great value for our stay. We will be back again to unplug!"

As a group Truman alum it was a great place to stay for our trip down memory lane. As for the house itself, the beds and space were comfortable, the wrap around porch is great, and it had everything we needed! The view and the property are beautiful and a perfect escape!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is in the country but a very short distance to Kirksville. There is also a convenient country store nearby. The home is in a quite area and in the evening while sitting on the beautiful deck you can hear the whippoorwills singing at night and watch the fireflies after sunset.
The beds were very comfortable and there were ample linens and extra pillows which appeared to be new. Everyone commented how well they slept and how comfortable the mattress was.
The bathroom and showers were well stocked and the showers were newer and we had plenty of hot water.
The kitchen had ample pots, pans and dishes. If you're planning on cooking a big meal you might want to check with Mary on the size of pots or skillets you require. I was making a large amount of pasta and used two pots as it wouldn't fit in one. No big deal and all turned out well.
We will definitely stay here again!"

About 10-15 minutes away from town on a quiet gravel road. The kitchen is well equipped and we cooked dinner there every night and sat on the beautiful wrap around porch to watch the sunset. Mary was very accommodating and let us check in early as we were traveling from Chicago. Would definitely recommend.

The view from the wrap around porch is amazing, but the view inside of the cabin is a close second, with gorgeous wood interior. The smell upon entering takes you away to a hideaway in the mountains. Charming does not begin to describe this place. The gravel road leaving up to the property has been maintained exceptionally well. Mary and her family welcomed us graciously and provided an in depth tour of the cabin. The people, space, and surroundings made for a cozy, warm, and inviting trip. I hope to return in the future."

Stayed a few nights","The Hilltop Farmhouse was absolutely awesome in terms of accommodations, scenery and location.

Our objectives in visiting Kirksville were for for peace and quiet, wildlife watching, and to visit the conservation areas and state parks nearby.

The farmhouse itself was beautiful, spacious, and we loved the wrap-around porch. It was secluded and very private.

The wildlife was abundant. Off the porch or nearby, we saw deer, turkeys, squirrels, opossums, raccoons, red-tailed hawks, Canada geese, bats, and more. We heard barred owls, great horned owls, and the crème de la crème: three sets of coyotes howling at each other.

The location was great – secluded and private, yet close to Kirksville and other scenic locations. We visited Thousand Hills State Park (literally across the road – although the main area was a short trip by vehicle), Union Ridge Conservation Area, Atlanta-Long Branch Conservation Area, as well as Truman State University and A.T. Still University. We also went to church on Sunday in town. All in all, a wonderful and relaxing weekend.

We plan to visit again."

The kitchen was stocked with lots of cooking utensils which was great and it's a fun kitchen to cook in. There's a washer/dryer which we didn't use but it's nice to know it's there. I think my two favorite features were the jacuzzi tub and the view of the sunset from the porch. Would definitely stay here again in the future, it's a lovely and affordable place to stay in Kirksville."

Stayed a few nights","The Hilltop Farmhouse was wonderful and perfect for our stay in Kirksville. The house is was better than listed in that it was larger than I expected and the views and land are gorgeous, and no close neighbors-- making it extremely private. The loft is a full-sized bedroom with a king bed and there is a good-sized bedroom on main level that also includes a large living area with 'cathedral' ceiling. It's a log home inside, really-- just beautiful wood everywhere. The covered deck surrounding the house is 360 degrees. The home also has a large finished walk-out basement that also made it larger than advertised.
The home was clean with clean comfortable beds and other linens.
We want to stay at the Hilltop Farmhouse again on future visits to Kirksville."

The value for the price paid was phenomenal. The home is old, with the original kitchen cabinets and bathtub, but has many nice updates where it counts -- bedding, sinks, appliances -- overall it was super clean and had newer furnishings, wifi, robust a/c and fans (appreciated on 100 plus degree days in July), nice TV and the location was walkable to campus, downtown, and church. For me, this was the best solution and I would definitely stay again."

Being from Kirksville myself, the house's location was in close proximity of everything. I will definitely rent The Little House for any visits moving forward!"

The neighborhood was quiet and we slept well, it's a very short drive to the Hyvee grocery store and the AC kept the house nice and chilly despite record breaking heat outside. Maurtiz was quick to respond, very accommodating, and flexible with our arrival time and unusual requests. We hope to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here while in town for my little brother's graduation from Truman. Perfect location for walking to graduation on campus, and only a couple blocks from where my brother lives. Given the number of college kid party houses on the street (pointed out to me by my brother), it was surprisingly quiet at night. The only evidence of it being so close to campus was the amount of foot traffic right outside. Street parking was always easily available.
Before arriving I received an email with the passcode to get in the front door. I actually didn't meet or contact Mauritz during my stay, as it was never necessary. The entire process was very easy and efficient. Although I was the only one staying at the house, my parents and brother came over each night and we ordered dinner in instead of fighting the crowds at restaurants in town. The space was perfect for us to have low key evenings together as a family. Highly recommended for anyone coming to visit their college kid family members. My parents said they wish they would have known about this place the past 4 years, as they would have always stayed here rather than the local hotels."

Otherwise, great place! Check-in and check-out was fast and easy and the house was spacious and as described. I would recommend it!"

The hosts were welcoming and really on top of replying to messages. We can't wait until we have visitors again so they can enjoy this place instead of a hotel."

Stayed over a week","We stayed in this little house for a couple weeks. It's very charming and actually quite nice inside. The neighborhood is close to the university campus but still fairly quiet, definitely a plus.
We met Royce and his wife only a couple times, but they were very friendly and seemed ready to help if we needed anything. It was nice to know they were just across the street if we had questions!"

Stayed a few nights",We had a comfortable 5-day stay at the Little House in July while visiting family. The owner was very kind. She met us when we first arrived and then stopped by a couple days later to offer clean towels. She also brought us some delicious blueberries. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood. The a/c worked great. It reminded me of staying at my grandparents when I was a little girl. Our grandsons had so much fun playing with the toys that were in the little red wagon. We hope to stay at the Little House when we visit Kirksville again. Thanks again for all your hospitality.

The home is nicely decorated and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The outdoor fire pit and hot tub area was a nice bonus—we lounged in the hot tub on a cool, clear evening and watched the stars in the peaceful surroundings. The smart TV was also a nice bonus as we were able to log in to our streaming services and watch movies.
We will definitely stay here again when we visit Kirksville."

Mattie responded in a timely manner to any questions, which was greatly appreciated. The floor throughout the house is more of a polished cement or epoxy so it was very cold to walk around barefoot or sit on. There are not any rugs so just be sure to bring some comfy socks (plus you can slide around in them)!
Mattie and Logan’s place was a great place to spend quality time with friends and play board games."

The ones there are nice and big but worn out. Also, you don't have access to any closet. Not even one for hanging clothes. The weather got chilly and I didn't know where the blankets were I assume , in one of the closets that are locked up. I didn't want to call them in the middle of the night to ask. Lucky I keep one in my vehicle."

Overall this was a great stay.
The house was well maintained and decorated with nice touches here and there. The hot tub felt great and was intuitive to use.
It’s hard to find much to critique since everything was exactly as advertised.
I would say though the couches and beds were too soft for me so maybe not ideal for anyone with any mobility issues.
The house rules seem to be geared to prevent very particular behavior which didn’t cause any issues for us but came across as harsh."

Mattie was so sweet to work with and I appreciate the texts to check in before we got there and after we checked out!💕 The outdoor hot tub was relaxing with the cool weather in February and it was nice feeling secluded in the woods while also only being 10 minutes from town! We saw quite a few deer around the property which was pretty cool. We actually got engaged outside under the hanging lights during our stay which was so special!🥰 We would highly recommend staying at this Airbnb and we look forward to coming back again someday!❤️"

It was just minutes away from everywhere we wanted to go: the campus, the downtown, and the State Park. It was just my daughter and I, and the place was perfect. Tastefully decorated. Very comfortable beds. Best night sleep because the cabin is so private. It had snowed the day before we arrived and the forest looked enchanted. The check in and the check out was seamless. The cabin has absolutely everything one could possibly need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The special welcoming touches, like the hot cocoa bar, were much appreciated.

Logan and Mattie's home is clean, quiet indoors and out, tastefully decorated, comfy king bed (didn't use other beds), hot tub easy to use, lots provided including beach towels for the hot tub, stocked Keurig cups and condiments. Great space for relaxation! Communication was friendly and informative. Follow Mattie's texted directions to find the home. Google maps sent us on the wrong road. One of my favorite Airbnb's thus far to escape to peace and quiet. Location is within 10 minutes of grocery stores and many restaurants."

Stayed with kids","Tim and Jennifer's home is a perfect landing spot when visiting Kirksville. The location is just on the edge of town, providing solitude and quietude in the evenings when you need. There is a small yard on from and back yard, that was a nice place for our young son to kick around his soccer ball. The bedrooms gave privacy and space for individual family members to spread out. And the sunken play room was a perfect place for toys, games and fort building. We were back to our hometown to celebrate the life of our mother, who had passed. The home is perfect for a family of 5-6 to stay. Yet, because of the layout, the kitchen/living area even provided enough space for my siblings and families to gather together for just a few hours and share memories. Jennifer and Tim were gracious and communicative hosts, allowing us flexibility and comfort and privacy. Everything about the stay felt good--and the check-in/check-out process was one of the easiest we've experienced. Such a great place to stay when visiting Kirksvile."

Stayed with kids","The Crofter’s Cottage is perfect for families with children! There’s so many fun toys to play with and entertain themselves in the children’s area so you can get a breather (which can be so needed while traveling!) and the yard was great for getting fresh air. Beds were nice and comfy, everything was clean and well thought out."
