Stayed a few nights",Good location walkable to a lot of things. Cute neighborhood. Place was just as described. You can hear the neighboring units and building noises pretty clear so it’s a hit or miss if you get considerate guests or not. Thankfully it wasn’t too disruptive during our stay. Overall the communication with Jessy and Diego was great and everything was easy and smooth.

Stayed about a week","I was looking for a place that was close to metro stations and safe to walk around at any time, and this apartment was a great choice. There are 2 metro stations nearby, supermarkets, a convenience store, a mall, cafes, and restaurants. All within a very short walking distance.
The apartment was smaller than I expected, but it is comfortable for one person (or a couple) and has everything a traveler might need. I stayed for 1 week and liked the time I was there. The WiFi is good for work, studying, and video calls. The bed is very comfortable and the neighborhood is charming."

I am a very restless sleeper yet I slept very well here (I'm very easily woken up, but never had an issue here). The location and value is definitely worth it, I had a great time trying all the food nearby. it's also very easy to get around with the public transportation."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the apartment, location and hosts ranked as one of my better experiences on AirBnB. It is perfect for a single person but would still be cozy for a couple. It was a great space for either vacationers or work travel to Boston. It was an easy walk to many sites, several tube stations and the South End for great restaurants. I was attending a Conference for work at Hynes and it was an easy walk from the Convention Center. The internet and small dining area made it a great work space as well. Overall, really enjoyed the stay and will definitely look to stay there again. Thanks!"

Stayed one night","I stayed here on memorial day and it was probably the best hotel experience I’ve ever had. While checking in, I was greeted by friendly staff, a welcoming atmosphere, and a unique location and vibe; full of musical memorabilia (and a killer record collection), I felt right at home. We found out we got an upgrade to one of the converted airstream trailers they have available- the room was beautiful, with decor that perfectly fit the “James Brown” titling. I love that they have a record player (with accompanying records from the room’s artist) in each room. We got to check out the pool next- It’s saltwater, which is a nice touch (great for your skin!). Particular standouts from the staff were Julian the valet and Elle at the front desk, who were both awesome- overall, the staff were all incredibly kind, and were always courteous and willing to help with anything. One of the coolest, most enjoyable hotel rooms and grounds I’ve experienced; I’ll be returning in the future."

Stayed one night","Cute hotel, especially if you're into music. Great location. We didn't get a chance to take a dip in the pool, but I love that they have a heated pool. We unfortunately were not able to secure valet parking, as it is ""first come first serve"" (which I hadn't realized). There IS a parking lot across the street, but it's expensive (will depend on the day/time, but we had to pay $100 for our Sunday to Monday overnight, which is not insignificant). We were also told we were ""upgraded"" to better room upon arrival, only to find out the upgrade was one of their camper's in the alley behind the building. Perhaps that's an upgrade for some, but it felt as though they were trying to move us around to secure rooms in the building. And, of course, the annoying ""service fee"" they charge when you arrive. Yes, it's listed in the description. Yes, it's still annoying. Overall we had a nice stay, just a few small annoyances that could have made it better."

Stayed a few nights","We loved Jason and Dabney's place. The attention to detail was visible - from the toiletries to the fully-equipped kitchen, everything was thoughtfully taken care of and set with such a good taste.
The location was ideal - situated in a peaceful neighborhood, yet with some dining options and grocery close by. The T station is just a 10-minute walk away, and it takes 20 minutes to reach downtown from there.
We definitely recommend it and certainly, we would stay here again if we go back to Boston."

We had trouble opening the front door, but Jason was responsive via text message and was able to help us out with opening the door. The AirBnB was clean and tidy. The AirBnb is in a good location and about 15 minutes from the train station and only about 5 minutes away from restaurants and other stores. Overall, we’d recommend this AirBnb to other people visiting the Cambridge/Boston area."

I would generally not use either, but came down sick and was grateful for both. Low flow shower and small shower head was the only bummer but definitely adequate. White noise machine provided to offset family living overhead was effective.
Extremely responsive host, very kind to extend check out a few hours to coordinate with late flight. Perfect location for my visit- walkable to the T and good coffee shops (Tatee, Vester). Would definitely recommend."

Stayed with kids","What a great place to stay for our trip to Cambridge and Boston! The apartment was clean, well-stocked, and conveniently located. We found both the bed and the fold out couch comfortable, and we really appreciated the little details around the apartment (the art on the walls, the white noise machine, the closet with extra towels) that made the stay feel home-like. The Roku tv was a fun way to unwind after a long day of being out and about, and the windows looking up onto the street in the kitchen provided lovely morning light for reading. Also, we loved that the apartment was so close to various restaurants, shops, and museums. We’d love to stay here again on return trips to the area. Thanks!"

Would greatly recommend staying here if you’re looking to explore the nearby area!"

Stayed a few nights","The space was clean and just as described on the listing. Jason and Dabney were very clear with instructions and responsive to any messages or questions we had. The apartment is a basement-type and can be a bit small sometimes. Overall, the apartment is quaint and amenities - like fridge, utensils, coffeepot, etc. - are very much appreciated. The area it's located in is a nice, quiet neighborhood, close enough to walk to the big Boston sights but far enough not be in the hustle and bustle.
Some of the things that didn't work for us: the bed was very uncomfortable, and neither of us could get much sleep. I've travelled quite a bit for work so I'm use to not sleeping in my own bed, but the bed was rock-hard and difficult to sleep on. The apartment is at the bottom of a house and there are residents upstairs that are frequently heard - sometimes yelling and stomping around. We also discovered strange things after leaving the apartment for long periods of time that we couldn't recall either of us doing - turned off lights, moved items, etc. It spooked us a bit and we weren't sure what was going on.
It didn't keep us from enjoying our trip thought. Definitely a decent place to stay if you aren't particular about those things but probably not for us. Thanks so much!"

Stayed a few nights","A really great place! Fun/stylish/clean, fully renovated, yet in a charming very old building. Building next door is from 1826 and this seems similar. There are two rooms so were ideal for us since traveling as parent and kid.
The neighborhood is also charming, it feels like it used to be rougher than it is, we enjoyed exploring a bit and found Curio Coffee 3 blocks over, great coffee and baked to order waffles.
We decided to stay here in Cambridge rather than in downtown Boston, that worked although we needed to Uber over to downtown. The closet T station is under some renovations at this time so train over to downtown wasn't going to work."

Stayed a few nights",Book this place now! We enjoyed our four night stay in Cambridge while we toured Boston by day. All of the photos depict exactly what you will see in person. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is clean and modern (it also includes a washer and dryer). The full kitchen made it very easy to prepare meals. There is a Whole Foods a mere 10 minute bike ride away (there are other grocery stores but we used Whole Foods). We used the Blue Bike system all around Boston and Cambridge - highly recommend! There is a Blue Bike station less than a five minute walk away. Use the Blue Bike system and buy a week’s pass on the Subway (Charlie Card) and you can easily get around Boston and Cambridge!

Stayed about a week","I live in Boston and needed a place to stay locally after traveling internationally so I could isolate myself from my roommates as a precaution during the pandemic. This place was perfect with a kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and parking. There were helpful notes everywhere to explain how to use keypads and turn the water on for the laundry so I could manage everything myself. The TV has a ton for options for binging and I was able to use the provided HDMI cord to hook up my laptop to project my barre workouts. The place was also very clean. Excellent home away from home. Thank you!"

The apartment has such a wonderful modern aesthetic look to it but at the same time is so practical and very homey! This place is conveniently located near the various activities we wanted to do which was a huge plus. There nice touches included to the place such as including a Cerve cleanser which I had forgotten mine at home so this really saved me! The Roku Tv also was put to great use since we were able to watch some Netflix or YouTube on there! Something else I really appreciated was having a dishwasher for sure! We would most definitely recommend this place to anyone thinking about visiting the Boston area and we hope to come back soon!

Stayed one night","The snazzy hotel was ideally located for me, just a stone's throw from the Boston Common, and the room was clean and attractive (especially if Industrial Chic is your aesthetic). Accommodations in Boston are generally way overpriced, and I wouldn't call this place cheap. That being the case, I was unhappy to discover, after I booked the room on AirBnB, that I would be paying an additional $30 ""destination fee""--which turned out to be $35 when I was actually handed my bill, which turned out to be $42 and change after taxes. It would be more honest to notify customers of these specific charges before they book the room, but so it goes. The free chicken sandwich in the bar, consumed amid drunken Jenga players whose constantly collapsing structures were actually fun to observe, took the sting out of the added fees, at least."

The location in the Chinatown / Theater District area was walkable to plenty of attractions, including Boston Common, Quincy Market, Prudential Center and the North End. All the Moxy staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the laid-back bar for drinks and a light lunch. The onsite gym was a nice amenity as well. The room itself was small, but typical for an urban hotel room, and the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern. The rate we got through AirBnB was much better than the rate shown on the Moxy’s website, so we feel we got a good deal and a good value."

The hotel generously provided food and drink credits upon check in, and the on-site bar had floor to ceiling windows that made it a perfect place to people watch. The only thing that could be improved would be to provide a wider selection of in-room toiletries. I also would have liked a blanket, but didn’t see anyone at the front desk at the time of night when I needed it. Overall it is a nice place to stay that I would recommend to others."

Stayed one night","DO NOT STAY HERE. My boyfriend and I booked this place 5 weeks in advance and fully paid for it before our weekend in Boston for fanexpo. We were searching for parking for an hour and 40 minutes around 8:30pm when I got an email saying our booking was canceled for “unforeseen and immediate circumstances.” Apparently they “ran out of rooms because our room wasn’t reserved.” They claim they gave me a full refund of $356 for one night but only sent $285. The host also sent me to the basic Airbnb help line rather than dealing with the problem HE CAUSED himself. The help line said it’s his responsibility yet he refused to take it. If you’re booking here, have a plan B. I’ve never experienced such unprofessional behavior for such a “nice and $$$$ hotel”."

South Station is a 30 second walk from the front door and many of the iconic locations of Boston are within 15-20 mins walking or 5-10 via Uber. The only issue was that the apartment was a bit noisy from the noises of the city and streets below but this was easily resolved by listening to some light music on my AirPods, a noise machine might be a good idea to bring along with if you are a light sleeper. Overall, an excellent space to explore and enjoy Boston from. Thanks Konrad! I'll be back!"

Stayed about a week","Where do I begin? This Airbnb is so beautiful & spacious, and well equipped for an extended stay. I loved the art - the buddhist statue, the cubicle display of scupltures. And the loft being tall with tall windows & high ceilings made it feel very spacious. The kitchen was very sleek and updated, with everything you could need. The only small thing is that the location is not the most quiet, with a lot of surrounding construction, and people making noise at night. However, if you reside in a city already, you would probably be okay with this. For myself, the highlights of this Airbnb far outweighed that issue. Everything was either in good walking proximity, or at least good walking proximity to the T - which Boston has an excellent train system. Konrad was also very helpful & responsive. Thanks for sharing your beautiful condo!"

We consulted his guidebook and found that all the recommended restaurants were conveniently located near the Airbnb and also served great food. The Airbnb was so cosy that we found ourselves eager to return to it after each tiring day of activities, and we would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the best of Boston, with minimal effort."

Transit is close although we like to walk as Boston is a super walkable city which made the location even better for us. Although when we did need a ride, the location made for a very easy pick up for drivers to find. Wonderful restaurants close by and for the times you might want to stay in, everything needed to cook was available. Konrad was very helpful, responsive and checked on us to make sure we made it in with ease and everything was set. This was nice as we arrived very late. He also offered great recommendations as well! Per all the other reviews, everything that could be said about this unit and Konrad as a host has been said and we totally agree!"

Stayed a few nights","There are many things I like about this place 1) great location, close to South station and Chinatown, endless food options and I walked to the station to take the train to NYC, super convenient! 2) Very spacious, plenty of room, high ceiling, beautiful apt 3) nice decor and artsy feeling inside 4) The laundry is a plus! 5) Konrad is friendly and good with communication. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Boston!"

The space was clean and stocked with amenities to use during the stay. I would mention that folks should be prepared for some noise between people outside and the neighbors (but it’s a city, so there will always be something!). Those that are more sensitive to noise while sleeping may have a hard time. Overall, I had a great stay and would absolutely stay again!"

Stayed over a week","We just returned from an 11-night stay at Konrad's loft, and we really couldn't have asked for a better stay in Boston! Konrad is so nice to work with, and so kindly accommodated us by shifting the reservation by a couple of days when our plans unexpectedly changed. The apartment is in a wonderful location - active and busy on the edge of Chinatown, but on a super quiet block (very little street noise, which is great for light sleepers)! Just a few blocks from the Red, Orange, and Green lines, as well as Emerson College, the Boston Common, and Downtown Crossing area - so, easy to get virtually anywhere in the city from the apartment. The unit is quite large, comfortably furnished, super clean, and very well-stocked! We were moving our kids to their colleges, and the apartment was a great space to have them over in the evenings for dinner, etc (nice, large table to eat and/or work at). The A/C worked perfectly, which was pretty important for the crazy August Boston weather, and the in-unit laundry was fantastic for a longish stay. This was probably the best Air BnB we've stayed in and we will absolutely re-book for subsequent trips out to Boston. Can't recommend highly enough! Thanks again, Konrad! :)"

We stayed on the 23rd floor but there is a club in the alley below our room. We heard the bass and music until after 3am. Worst nights sleep ever. In their defense, there was also a card from the hotel offering assistance if we could not sleep?? Unfortunately, didn't see that until the next morning and wouldn't have wanted to change rooms at 3am. Would stay again, but request room on the other side."

We walked everywhere, only needing an Uber to/from the airport and once in the rain. We had planned to drop our bags in the morning after our red-eye flight from Los Angeles. Instead, we were able to check in at 9:30 AM! This was totally unexpected and so appreciated!
The rooms are extremely small but well laid out with lots of hooks to help keep items off the floor. As long as you are comfortable being very cozy with your travel partner, this is a great place for the price. The restaurant and bar served very nice drinks a good food. We will come again if my daughter decides to attend Emerson!"

Parking garages nearby as well, we drove in from New Hampshire and paid for a spot in advance (through an outside source) and literally left our car in the garage the whole stay. Staff was friendly.
We know we will be choosing the Moxy for every Boston stay in the future.
The rooms are small, at least the one we paid for, but we were ok with that as we were not planning on staying in our room outside of showers, clothing changes and sleep.
Definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights","This is a weird AirBnB. It’s a funky new-gen hotel, which is okay, but have you ever seen a hotel with no closet and no dresser, like nowhere to put underwear and socks??? You hang hangers ON WALL PEGS.
And no in-room coffee, and the only restaurant has no decaf, just decaf cappuccino?? And all the furniture folds up and hangs on wall pegs??
But when they finally gave me the room type they had sold me, it was okay for the money and location was excellent for me.
If you’re not on a high floor, be prepared for sirens and horns honking."

Stayed a few nights","The hotel itself was extremely awesome. Very clean, very friendly staff, great bar and food. The room was cozy and the bathroom was clean. The only thing we had an issue with was both nights our sleep was heavily disturbed at 1-3am. Both situations very obviously out of the hotel’s control as one night it was night construction with workers tearing up the road. The other night, the bar/club across the street kicked everyone out when they closed at like 2am and there was a massive crowd of people directly outside the hotel yelling and fighting. It created so much traffic that included people honking for over an hour and the police were called. This was obviously not something Moxy could control, but the rooms facing the street/front of hotel were very not sound proof and we heard everything outside. There were earplugs provided in the room. Overall good experience."

The hotel itself had a bar (they make a great Old Fashioned) and complimentary coffee in the morning. Location was great - close to Chinatown and the T. Everything was very walkable. Absolutely loved it here and will come back!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is prime it’s walking distance Boston commons park. The w hotel is across the street l, which also confirms that it’s in a good location. Check in went smoothly, the room is pretty tiny if your used to normal size rooms, luckily the guy at the front desk upgraded me to a corner suite room for free & it was a lot bigger with a panoramic view of the city, so I was extremely satisfied. You can also pay an extra $20-30 to have this room, which I would highly recommend. Everything else went smoothly."

The room is small but cute and well organized - perfect for a night or two in the city if you aren't planning to need a bunch of space in the room. Other reviews mentioned noise, but I was on the 8th floor and didn't have any issues other than expected city noise. There was free donuts and hot chocolate at check-in which was a fun touch :)"

We were on the 23rd floor and the 24th floor is a freaking nightclub and they were having a DRAG QUEEN SHOW!!!! Got zero sleep! They charge you $25 a night Hotel fees and offset it with a $25 voucher for food, but the food is literally $20 for a sandwich made at the bar and $6 for a Gatorade. They have Random people not staying at the hotel coming in and out because it's a night club! Location is great! it's walking distance to everything. TV didn't work half the time and when it did they don't offer local channels with dish! THE ROOM IS THE SIZE OF THE BED. Bathroom was nice but shower door didn't stay closed. Never spoke with host and front desk looked at us crazy because we weren't in the system."

Great atmosphere. It was nice to have a bar/nighttime hangout space in the hotel. My only complaint (and it's very minor) is that they advertise that your purchase includes two complimentary drinks. Excited to use them, I frequented the bar only to find out that you have to choose between three specific drink options that they have pre-selected and the coupons do not apply to any beverage you order. Any drink you do order will be pricy -- just expect it. Overall, great stay."

Stayed a few nights","The Moxy is a hotel, simple. We had a hitch with the first roomed assigned, it did not have a river view. However, the desk person couldn’t have been more friendly and efficient in changing our room. We also received 2 free drinks and a $25 credit to be used at Bar Moxy for food or drinks. The rooms are simply decorated industrial modern. The rooftop bar was closed for a private event on Saturday evening and not opened on Sunday:(. The location was perfect for us- we walked to Fenway one day and walked the Freedom trail the second. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a really cool, energetic hotel. Definitely a good place if you are looking to go out on the town to party.
Some trouble checking in with my airbnb booking but that was sorted after some minutes.
Gym was relatively well equipped and completely empty of anyone else (party hotel).
The only real problem was the noise in the room from police cars, traffic horns and nightclubs. I would have expected some noise of course, but I don't think the windows are well fitted (can also feel a breeze) so the effect of double glazing to suppress the noise is much reduced. it's not quite like being outside... but almost.
They do provide earplugs but if you want to get up on an alarm to get to the airport, maybe you don't want to use those.
I was also only there Friday and Saturday nights, so maybe less of an issue in the week."

Stayed one night","A nice place right in Chinatown and the theater district. The rooms are definitely on the small side, and storing lots of luggage is not really possible in the room since it doesn’t even have a closet, but it’s a great place for a weekend getaway if you’re traveling light. Overnight parking was an additional $40 at the Tufts Medical Center garage right down the block. The Boston common is a block away, and the Wang, Wilbur, and Boch Center Shubert theatres are all around the corner, so it would be a great place if you’re in town for a show. They also give you a $25 coupon to spend at their hotel bar, which is a nice touch. Room was clean and tidy, with an exposed concrete ceiling, and pegs on the walls to hang bags. The concrete walls and ceiling made the stay quiet, we didn’t hear any noise at all from the hotel, only the occasional honking of a horn from the street. Overall a great location and a good value, but if you don’t mind the smaller size, I would recommend the Moxy and would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I ended up only staying at Deborah’s place for one of the three nights I had booked. During my stay, I noticed that there were tiny ants all over the bathroom and the bedroom that I was staying in. I left early and went to a friend’s apartment and reported the issue to Airbnb. While this was concerning, I’m giving Deborah a 5 star review because of how she handled the situation. She responded to my claim with Airbnb very quickly and was gracious, apologetic, and accepted my refund request with no issues. It seems she wasn’t made aware of the situation previously, and was just as concerned as I was. Besides the ants, the listing is in a great location and it’s very convenient to get around. It’s very walkable and Porter Square T station is only about 11 minutes away if you want to head into downtown, and Ubers aren’t too expensive from there either."

Stayed over a week","Deborah is a wonderful host, and I highly recommend her place. I was in Boston for two weeks for a research trip, and her house was exactly what I needed. She lives in the house and rents out her guest room, so you have more privacy and quiet than you would in a larger Airbnb that hosts more guests -- bathroom all to yourself, and ready use of kitchen and public spaces in the house. The bedroom is spacious and well-lit, with plenty of extra blankets and pillows (and towels), a workspace, plenty of storage, and bookshelves full of good reading material. I like to cook for myself most of the time when I'm on longer research trips; Deborah's kitchen has all of the utensils and equipment you might need, and she offers to share cooking staples, as well as providing tea, coffee, and breakfast food. The location worked perfectly: a quiet street about a 12-15 walk from both Harvard Square and Porter Square, and a few short blocks to the grocery store and laundromat. And finally, Deborah is a lovely person; she enjoys chatting with her guests and getting to know them, but she is never intrusive. If I'm planning an extended stay in Boston in the future, I will absolutely try to book her place."

Stayed a few nights","There is something special about this Airbnb. My partner and I immediately felt comfortable and welcome here because Deborah greeted us when we arrived and showed us around her kitchen, making sure we knew that we were encouraged to have juice, toast, granola, and so on. I've never actually felt comfortable eating host's food at an Airbnb until coming here.
Deborah is a pleasant host. She is enjoyable to talk to, but not forceful about conversation (I've had that with hosts at other Airbnbs!). She even shared her umbrellas with us when rain came on the forecast.
Check in was easy. Very residential, quiet street. The Airbnb is walking distance to all things Harvard and a quick walk to the Red Line, making all of Boston accessible.
I appreciated being able to control the temperature of the bedroom. The duvets on the bed are cozy. The room and bathroom are comfortable.
All in all, a great stay. I'd be happy to come back here again. The Airbnb quickly felt like home."

She gladly shares with visitors her homey, cozy and well equipped kitchen and
many of the contents of the refrigerator for breakfast, as well as fresh fruit , teas and coffee.
Deborah is delightful to chat with as much or as little as you care too. She is quite knowledgable about the area, among other topics.
Her home is immaculately clean and follows strict covid protocols.
It is an older house in a well established neighborhood on a quiet street and close to Harvard University.
I cannot praise my experience highly enough and I look forward to returning the next time I am in Boston!

Her place is lovely and I would definitely stay again if I visit another time.

Her real American house, located in a quiet street and neighborhood close to Harvard, is clean, well maintained, nicely furnished and equipped with every comfort. The bedroom, bathroom (which by the way only we used) and all the other common areas also fit in that picture.
Deborah is rightfully a superhost: friendly and helpful. She lives on the same floor as us and uses the same kitchen, but for us it felt like we had a lot of privacy. However, if you need anything or want to know, Deborah will be ready for you right away.
Nice to note is that Deborah does shopping which you can use during breakfast: fresh fruit, cottage cheese, juice, eggs and very, lots of types of tea.
As for the location, it's a 10 minute walk to Harvard Square and about 20-30 minutes to downtown Boston by public transportation.
Nothing more than praise for this Airbnb, it is highly recommended and we would love to come back here!"

Stayed one night","Deborah was a wonderful host and we would highly recommend her to other travelers. She has a beautiful quaint home on a quiet street in Cambridge. Deborah was very responsive and easy to communicate with. She was very flexible with us during check in and check out and allowed us to keep our bags at her house while we went sightseeing for the day, even though it was outside the hours of our reservation. She even set up a fold out bed for us, and offered us fresh fruit from the farmers market for our travels! She also had AC in the guest room which was a valuable addition in the middle of the humid Boston summer. She was very hospitable and considerate and we had a wonderful stay in her home. Would highly recommend!"

Her house is just 10 mins walk from the nearest subway (red line) and very convenient to go to Harvard or MIT. The room was much better than I expected. It has a great personal touch with all the books and other amenities. She treated my like her personal guest. It was a very good find.

The house is a short walking distance from Harvard campus and Mass Ave, down a lovely side street. The bathroom was never occupied during our stay, and Deborah provided tea and other breakfast/snack items for us to enjoy (although we did not have the time).
The apartment is beautiful without being fancy/trendy. Just what we needed for a comfortable stay in Cambridge at an affordable price."

This is airbnb as it is intended; you step into the household of the host you receive with all the hospitality. Everything is clean, you can use everything from the well-stocked fridge. In our case the cooling air conditioning was a solution. We could sleep well because of that. Deborah is modestly taking your privacy into account. This will make you feel at home quickly."

An exceptional location, a small apartment halfway between Cambridge Street & Beacon Street, on the top of Beacon Hill, halfway from Bowdoin and Parker Street stations (Blue, Green & Red Lines). These can take you, for cheap ($22 for 7 days with the ‘famous’ Charlie card), practically anywhere in Boston and its surrounding areas.
And last but not least, our Hostess, Huanan who, from the very first day of our reservation, has always been available to answer our questions, inquire about our needs and share with us her advices / ideas on Boston"

The unit is actually more spacious than the pictures would imply, plenty of room for a couple. The only downside to the location is parking, we parked in a garage about 0.7 miles away and it was a decent walk with some uphill with luggage. Nothing too crazy though. We definitely felt at home and had everything we needed during our stay."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed in Boston for a week and really enjoyed calling Huanan's studio apartment our home. The location couldn't be any better right on Beacon Hill. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. The places that were too far for walking we used the subway which has a stop at Boston Commons and is just around the corner from the apartment. There is a shared patio on the back side of the building that we enjoyed on several occasions.
The bed was comfortable and the linens were clean. There is a portable air conditioner which helped keep us cool during the summer heat wave. The bathroom was roomy and clean.
Huanan offers free luggage storage in the building's basement in case you have an early arrival or late departure. We took advantage of this and felt that our bags were in a safe space.
Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","This beautifully decorated & well-appointed apartment is located in one of the most lovely and historically iconic places in ""old"" Boston, Beacon Hill. Conveniently close to almost every amazing historical site in Boston. There are a couple of BUTS, though, that may matter for some: there is absolutely NO nearby parking. You may even have to double-park and temporarily block a very narrow one-way street to unload luggage at the location. And it's a 3rd floor walk-up. We parked in the Boston Common parking garage (park nearest the ""State"" or State House exit!). It is a not-less-than 10-minute walk (for me at age 78, more like 15 or 20). From check-in at 6 p.m. Friday until check-out at 4:45 a.m. Monday, parking cost $68. It's a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest transit points at Park Place station or Arlington Street station. We did a LOT of walking. All of that said, though (now that we fully know what to expect) we absolutely WOULD stay here again during a future Boston visit!"

We didn't use the kitchen amenities but if you'd rather cook, you'll have what you need in pans, utensils, dishes, etc. as well as a microwave. The bed was a comfort especially after lots of walking.

Pros: Excellent Location, centrally located to all. Walk to Boston Public Garden and Boston Common in 5-7 minutes. The North End/Little Italy 15-20 minutes, Downtown & Quincy Market 10 minutes.
The studio is perfect for a multi-night stay. It has everything you may need. Kitchenette with pots, pans,utensils, dishes, microwave, etc. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, full-length mirror, and small, cushioned stool to sit on while doing hair/makeup.
Comfortable bed, gorgeous view.
Cons: Studio smelled like cigarettes on arrival. I opened the windows, and the smell was gone. I let the host know, and she was responsive and helpful.
People upstairs walked loudly and slammed doors. Not sure if they were tenants or Airbnb guests.
**If you have limited mobility, this is not the place for you. 3 flights of steep stairs in a neighborhood of brick and cobblestone sidewalks and streets.**
We will definitely stay here again."

Huanan was available, but we didn't see her, all the instructions were clear and there were lots of recommendations in a binder. I was pleased with the extras ( quality shampoo & conditioner, hairdryer, straightener, extra towels, blankets, coffee pods, tea).

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in multiple airbnbs across the world and I have never left a 3 star review for anyone, but felt this one was needed. My chief complaint is that the place was dirty. We walked into the building and were immediately struck with a horrible smell of fish and onions that remained throughout our stay. The stairs looked like they hadn’t been vacuumed in months- if ever. The dirtiness proceeded up to our place on the 3rd floor. We arrived in our suite, and there were muddy foot prints on the bathroom floor. This floor also looked like it had never been mopped and there was sticky residue on the floor. The corners of the bathroom had black gunk in them. We look in the shower and there was loose hair all over the shower wall and a discolored shower mat stuck to the floor. The sponge on the sink was soured and had been used too long. I had to hunt for a new one. While the location was great and the bed comfortable, it wasn’t worth the money and overall was NOT a good experience."

Stayed one night","This apartment is tiny but very functional and comfortable for three. I found the bed to be extremely comfortable - firm but with a soft top, and the full-sized pull-out couch was about the most comfortable couch I've ever slept on (keeping in mind that I like a firm mattress). The kitchen was small but functional - don't plan to cook a 4-course meal there, but you'll be able to do breakfast and a simple dinner just fine. The bathroom was nicely spacious - my girls loved the ""dressing area"" with a large full-length mirror. The only problems I had were (1) I could not find any sheets for the couch, but I also did not try to contact the host about it since I was only there for one night. If you plan to use the couch as a bed, you want to check in about bedding before you arrive. And (2) parking was a bear. The street is adorable and old, but very narrow with no parking. We had to block the street to unload, and then I had to go pretty far to find parking."

Stayed a few nights","The room is on the third floor, up a narrow set of stairs, and on a street you likely won’t be able to park on, so prepare for how you’ll unload your car. However, with a second person to bring up bags, parking in the Boston Commons garage was extremely easy, and it was a very short walk back to the apartment.
The room is small, but has everything necessary for a comfortable stay. We stayed for the proximity to the hospital, and we’re happily surprised by how close we were to so many shops and restaurants. Huanan was quick to respond to my questions, and I’d rent this room again."

Stayed a few nights","Location is so spot on! We were in walkable distance to the main sites. The place was great for our 3 night stay. It’s also a very safe area. CVS, Whole Foods, and Target within several blocks of the apartment. Bed was also super comfortable. It is on the smaller side, which is to be expected in a small and old city. Just right for two ppl, maybe tight with a child. Note that there is no elevator and the apartment is on the 3rd floor and the stairway is very narrow. It’s also a bit more dated and kitchenette is very small. Probably not fit for anything other than heating leftovers or boiling hot water. Huanan was very easy to communicate with and Ken was quick to bring us additional supplies. Would definitely stay again if in the Boston area."

The apartment would be good for more a 1 night stay. (Unfortunately, time only allowed for us to stay 1 night.) The closest overnight public parking is over 0.5 miles away & $30 per day was the cheapest we found. The apartment’s bathroom had no ventilation other than a window- it was HOT. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom wouldn’t go below 77, so it was a bit warmer than our liking. Not unbearable, we just prefer to sleep in cooler temperatures.
The hosts both communicated quickly."

It's a shame that others have led Michael to have to close the rooftop access because the view looks amazing from what I could see. Michael was proactive and lightning fast with responses to my questions. He checked in on me to see how things were going. He has a nice guestbook with restaurants and other areas of interest.

Stayed a few nights","Terrific AirBnB, great location.
One of the very best AirBnBs I've stayed at. Exactly as described in the listing. Bright and airy apartment, very well taken care of. Very clean. Good living room. Comfortable couch. Large and usable kitchen. Comfortable bed and linens. Clean bathroom. Nice hardwood floors. Good heating and air conditioning. Nothing at all to complain about in terms of the living space or condition.
The location is pretty much perfect. You're within walking distance of many excellent restaurants, Copley Place, Newbury Street, and all the rest. But you're on a quiet street.
The only caveat--and this is mentioned in the listing, but I'll reiterate--is that this is four flights of stairs up, and there's no elevator. So if you have trouble navigating stairs, this won't be for you. But if that doesn't bug you, no problem. And there's good central air conditioning in the unit, so if you're sweaty after climbing up, no problem :-)
You won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","We can very highly recommend the 'Eagles Nest' -- It is an extremely well kept and attractive apartment in an excellent location. It has a real Boston brownstone on an attractive tree lined street that manages to simultaneously be central urban living and yet is as quiet as a country lane. The apartment is attractively furnished and comes with a very usable kitchen (we enjoyed making eggs for breakfast one morning). In addition, and in importantly in the summer heat and humidity that Boston is known for, the air conditioning is very effective and quiet. We slept well there after busy days visiting colleges and seeing a few sights; and were always happy to come home to our 'home away from home' in the evening to relax. Highly recommended."

There are nice touches, such as phone chargers scattered throughout the apartment.

Apartment is close to Orange line Massachusetts Ave stop which is before Back Bay commuter chaos on the inbound.

Stayed a few nights","Amazing place, well above our expectations. We have stayed with Airbnb in more than 20 places on 3 continents and this apartment was one of the top 3.
Very intelligently composed, with a fantastic kitchen, lots of sunshine, smart furniture, nice bathroom, comfortable bedroom, and a gigantic smart TV.
Excellent location for exploring Boston - we have walked straight to downtown Boston several times and the walks were wonderful.
Plenty of trendy restaurants and bars in 6 block radius.
We recommend this place whole heartedly."

Stayed a few nights","My son and I stayed at Michael’s place for 3 days. It was a very comfortable stay. I would recommend it highly. It was clean, comfortable, stylishly decorated and very accurate in the descriptions. As he mentions in the description, there are 3 flights of narrow circular stairs up to his beautiful apartment. It was close to public transportation though we didn’t use it. Michael was very responsive and check in was super easy. He was extremely kind to let me check in early because my flight from the west coast got in early morning and I needed to freshen up before a college tour.
Thanks Michael for a great stay in Boston! I will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED our stay at Michael's place. The main living area was an open floor plan so it was very spacious and bright. There are a lot of homey touches throughout the apartment that made it charming. The location is incredible - within walking distance of anything that you need, restaurants, train stations, etc.
Michael was super responsive and the place was also well kept and clean. I've been to Boston before but this time around, it was definitely a different experience due to where we stayed. I highly recommend this home away from home!"

The neighborhood is stunning, we enjoyed walking around admiring the charm and exploring local businesses. Michael was super responsive and friendly. Couldn't have asked for anything more. I definitely recommend this place if you want to feel a bit more local and a bit less touristy."

Stayed a few nights","The place looks much better in real life than in the pictures. It has also a beautiful view to the city, and the street has even an iron cast water fountain. It is super quiet, even with the windows open. The mattress is firm and supportive, which is important if you have back problems. The host is very patient and attentive, and answered all my questions in detail. The location is great, within a walking distance to some of the best restaurants and bars of Boston: Meyers and Chang, Wally’s Caffe Jazz Club, Beehive, Giacomo’s etc. It easier to get to the historical area, to the museums, ball game, Charles River Esplanade etc. The only con is that being a top floor/attic with two sky windows, it gets warm during the day in the summer, but the air-conditioning fixes it quickly. You also should be willing to walk up three floors with your luggage (I was). I could not recommend less, and I am planning to come back."
