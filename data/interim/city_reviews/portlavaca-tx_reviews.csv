Stayed with kids",Summer was very communicative and helpful. The house had everything we needed and a wonderful backyard for the dog and kids. The neighborhood is in an older part of town but the people were friendly. There are dogs out in the neighborhood so good to be aware if you are frightened of dogs. They were friendly enough and did not worry us.

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home and was one of my favorites that me and my family have ever stayed at. Great location, and is very spacious, loved the backyard for my small doggies. Even loved the cute touches of the bathroom bottles holding the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The host was very communicative and the listing was accurate. I also appreciated the keyless entry as opposed to other places I have stayed at that have lock boxes that are a pain to open. Overall 5 out of 5 stars."

Stayed with kids","Michelle's place was wonderful! There were only 2 of us so the place was more than enough. Her instructions were so detailed and she described everything that we could have thought of! The dock and view was beautiful. maybe 2 minutes away are beaches capabale of being swam in. Fishing options GALORE! Drive about 30 minutes towards Port O Connor and there are more beaches a little more sandy than shell and jetties to fish on. great area to get away in Nature or play with the kiddos. We were there mostly for fishing and I would recommend their place and give it a 10/10 for proximity to fishing and their private dock on their property. A/C worked great, place was clean when we arrived, stocked with condiments, all appliances you need. Thanks for letting us enjoy your place!"

Stayed a few nights","Exceeded our expectations. Peaceful and quiet location. Fully functional kitchen. Lots of comfortable places to sit and relax - both inside and outside. Long pier with sheltered area for fishing includes a water hose and lighting. We did a lot of fishing and really enjoyed it! Using dead shrimp for bait we caught a lot of sea cats; However, we also caught white fish, speckled trout, etc. My personal favorite was the HUGE, line yanking, black drum (my first). Also recommend checking out the Calhoun County Museum in Port Lavaca - this beach location has a lot of history and the docent made it really interesting."

Even the shampoo, conditioner and body wash was so good! The mattress was very comfortable and we had the best naps and sleep! Walk out and enjoy a beach, straw hut cabana with chairs, fire pit, and private lighted pier! We fished one day off the pier and caught many whitings, a few hard heads AND TWO huge black drums right out the back! Talk about fun! The Indianola Marina is about a mile away with food and live music! Michelle & Clint are great hosts! This place checked all of our boxes and we would love to come back one day soon!"

Stayed a few nights",Accommodations are even better than expected with easy access to all desired areas. Soo clean & well outfitted with everything needed. Covered parking right next to door. Gorgeous views… much prized private dock/pier/beach a real plus as public facilities can get crowded. The lighted/covered dock is perfect for fishing all hours with fresh water fish cleaning station & built in bench…caught 40 some odd fish off dock including a 33 in Red Drum in one evening. Equipped with fire pit & grill. Also available are lighted palapa & chairs & a covered sitting area both for eating & enjoying hot cups of coffee or cold drinks of choice while listening to ocean waves & watching the amazing sunrises! We stayed 4 nights & hope to return soon! Dan & Sandi

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing, secluded apartment! The space was sparkling clean with everything we needed and Michelle was a very friendly, responsive host. Such a perfect location for those looking for a private getaway. Unless you venture to one of the nearby local stores, you may not even see another single person. We adored the private beach & pier! Our group isn’t much for fishing but I’m sure the pier would have been perfect for that. Instead, we chose to jump off the pier into the water & float in the warm, gentle waves during the day. Don’t fear the shells in the sand at the shallows of the water, go out a few more feet & the ground becomes very soft & accommodating for swimming. We would love to come to this property for another girl’s trip in the future."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at Michelle's apartment for his birthday and Father's Day. I chose this place because with everything going on, I was looking for cleanliness. However, I was also looking for peace, quiet, tranquility, and the opportunity to fish and crab. Michelle's place was all of this and more. The place is SO cute and extremely clean. I was very impressed. Although we didn't get to speak with Michelle directly, there were a couple times we had a question and her husband was more than happy to answer them for us. We felt so comfortable in this apartment. The whole process from the initial reservation through check-out was so easy and pleasant. The only thing we hated was that we had to leave a day early, as my husband got called in to work for a mandatory meeting. We would love to return in the future and would definitely recommend this rental. Oh, and we caught several fish (most too small to keep, but a few cats that were keepers), a couple sharks, and about a dozen crab. Thank you Michelle for allowing us to spend time at your beautiful apartment. It was a wonderful experience."

We spent most of our time on the private fishing pier! Murphy bed was comfortable, and the couch made a great second bed. Great host, easy check in. Overall a great place!"

We brought food and cooked our own meals, and I’ve honestly never seen a cleaner refrigerator in an Airbnb! I’m kind of OCD about a clean place to store food, and it was spotless.
The location is excellent. We did well fishing over the weekend, but when we weren’t fishing it was nice to sit on the little downstairs patio or on the pier and just relax. We brought our kayaks and enjoyed boating around the little lake across the street via a public access spot nearby. I highly recommend this place!"

I would recommend this airbnb to anyone and have already referred a friend as well. We will definitely be back to stay and have found our favorite vacation spot. Michelle was so pleasant and made sure we had every thing we needed and checked to see if we were doing ok. Love love loved this place!"

Perfect for our 4 night stay, but I think we could enjoy it for a much longer period. Beautiful clean bay beach, fun local store/restaurant/saloon, great restaurants at the Indianola Marina and Port O’Connor, as well as in Port Lavaca. And my local granddaughter and I caught many varieties of fish one afternoon. We loved it and it’s certainly on our list to try to stay here when we return to visit family."

We had difficulties getting into the place and the host was not responsive. Fortunately the neighbor came and saved the day with a spare key.
The location is great to plan for Buckee's or HEB if needing to stop for anything. Great local taqueria nearby."

One bedroom is private but be mindful of the fact everyone will have to go through it to get to the bathroom-it was a nonissue for us; but may be an issue if booking for a work trip with coworkers. Other bedroom has two beds and privacy is obtained by closing thick fabric curtains. They worked well when closed to block out living room/kitchen noise and light. Kitchen is well stocked. Will stay again in the future if needed.

Stayed with kids","We told her the floors were dirty and that I had found roaches,she could send someone to clean floors,she said she had orkin service for over a month and that it takes time to get rid of them. Why would she rent the property if it takes over a month to get rid of them? I dint want to bring them back home with me I was very disappointed. she offered to come spray chemicals to kill roaches but I had all my kids I was not going to risk their health.
The listing said it had a dryer/washer,
The only dryer/washer we could see were connected to the main house. They were full of clothes on top as well as the floor around them. There was a pot on top on dryer and look very unsanitary. The main house was very unkept, a set of couches right in front of the house and a dirty looking pool on the other side of the house. Definitely won’t be staying here again."

Fishing was so good, we had to buy bait every day (at Indianola bait shop). The pool table really put this one over the top! Nicest home on airbnb for this kind of vacation. Caught at least 10 Bonnet head sharks on squid and one with shrimp. We had better luck with frozen shrimp than live. The crab traps were a handy extra. Best extras were: tons of kitchen towels, condiments and utensils, coffee station, lighting was great, charcoal for the grill, lighted dock was a HUGE plus. Bed was super comfortable. Modern, clean and fresh. Our hostess offered up everything in the home, which is a refreshing bonus. Appropriate for all ages."

We enjoyed sitting around the fire pit, barbeque-ing and playing pool. 15-20 minutes to Port Lavaca where there is a Walmart. 10 minutes to Indianola where we enjoyed that fishing pier too and live music and food.

The pier is set up great for fishing and crabbing, day and night. Close enough to Port Lavaca for groceries, supplies and restaurants: 15 minutes. Our family was always entertained with the games, pool table, ping pong, fishing, crabbing and when it rained we had the large TV to eat popcorn and watch a movie. The master bedroom has a great view with a very comfortable bed. This room can be darkened or left open with outside light. The house guests have a pay it forward way about them with the goodies left in the pantry and refrigerator. Hope to come back soon."

So many things provided to use both inside & outside! Lawn chairs too! The fishing pier & fishing lights were amazing and added to our stay. Great for kids, because you didn't have to be an experienced fisherman to catch fish. Sooooo much fun! Loved the house, setup, porch and our bed was super comfortable! I can't say enough about what a great house it was."

Located right on the water between Alamo and Magnolia Beaches , this spacious but cozy house is loaded with amenities, including free Netflix and Amazon Prime. It is extremely clean and has everything in the home needed for a relaxing stay. The views from the windows are stunning and the private dock is a great place to fish or just watch the birds and marine life. The privacy and peaceful quiet are what I valued most. At night, the fire pit near the house was another bonus. 
Our hostess Angie was extremely helpful and even rescheduled our visit a week after the unusual freeze in Texas. We really appreciated that."

We had traveled from the DFW area to celebrate our anniversary & while it was cold, we never lost power & we were cozy with a view of the gulf. We got out everyday to explore the area based on our hostess great tips. BTW communication with our hostess, whether it was by telephone or text was immediate & accurate. Everything we could need to live 5 days in this house was there & it was so organized. I've attached a picture of the view out to the pier. PS - the white stuff on the ground is snow, not sand 😊"

Rockport TX beach was 40m drive which made our stay even more enjoyable. The owner even let us check out a little later from what originally was supposed to be so Thank you very much for that! 🙏🏼 We wanted to stay more days but unfortunately we have to wake up to reality.

Stayed a few nights","Great little beach house in Magnolia Beach area of Port Lavaca, Texas. Very cute and comfortable house that is well decorated and well stocked with everything you need for a long weekend or week-long stay. Comfortable and cozy living room with a sleeper sofa, chair, and recliner. The kitchen is fully furnished with large dining table, microwave, stove, toaster, and coffee maker.
The bedroom is large with a big king bed and two bunks beds. Two TVs with Dish and other cable services. The homeowner is very responsive and helpful. Nice neighborhood and places to explore the beach. Big backyard that is unfenced if you bring your pets. The front porch is very cute and a cozy place to have a glass of wine or a martini or to read a good book.
The house is located about 5 – 7 miles from the main town of Port Lavaca but is walking distance to the beach, fishing and all the fun you want in a beach house. One thing to note is to be sure to bring food, snacks, and drinks for the first day since there are no big grocery stores or places to eat except a small convenience store with a few essentials.
We really enjoyed our stay and the ""girls"" loved the beach."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived late and a mess, having just learned that our dog has cancer. So it was a bittersweet vacation. We left the tackle at home and let our dog dictate the days, mostly spent beach-combing, chasing driftwood sticks in the surf and catching blue crabs (she’s a great crabber)! We were especially happy to spend these special days in Bernadette’s very comfy and thoughtful house. The home was lovingly restored and decorated and was clean, cool and conveniently a few blocks walk to Magnolia Beach. The fact that their home was dog-friendly was an absolute must, and as usual we packed extra dog towels and her food dishes and made good use of the hose at the back of the house to keep the salt and sand on the outside. We hope to return on a happier occasion so we can do some fishing and enjoy more of the wildlife! We saw Ouster Catchers and Sand Pipers on the beach and even an alligator on the road in. And after some spotty showers, the night air was filled with Gulf Toads singing and the sky was filled with so many stars. This really is a special part of Texas!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect spot to get away from it all! The nautical decor is darling and really set the tone for our beach weekend. A short two block walk to the beach and the inlet of the bay, we made the walk multiple times per day just to take in the scenery or walk our dogs. The neighborhood is darling and everyone waves as they drive past. We used the house as a place to relax and go on little adventures to Pt Lavaca, Indianola, Port OConnor and Seadrift.
The kitchen was perfect to cook - if you wanted - or heat up leftovers like we did. The bed and the couch and chairs were super comfy and we laughed more than once that we had driven five hours to lay on someone else's couch, but that is what good weekend get aways are for.
There was plenty of hot water for long showers and plenty of towels for bathing. We did not use the beach for swimming so I cant say if there were beach towels, but we always bring our own.
There is a little market in the neighborhood, otherwise Pt Lavaca has everything you might forget to bring. And we didn’t try it, but renting kayaks or paddleboards would be perfect as you can put in just a few blocks from the house.
Definitely pack bug spray, because this is Texas!
Absolutely great getaway spot. We have already recommended to friends."

Ocean Drive is where the “action is.” Bernadette answered my various questions leading up to check-in. The kitchen has everything you’d need, the house smelled super and the beds were very comfortable! Having coffee on the porch is a fabulous way to begin the morning. Neighbors are quiet or not around. Super friendly neighborhood with the interactions we did have, and some even brought us margaritas on the beach! Pro tip: bring your own beach towel and bottled water."

Stayed a few nights","this is not the first time i have used Airbnb and have always been very satisfied with my stays.. but i was highly disappointed with the response from the owner.
First, the place IS adorable and in a nice quiet area.
We had issues from the start, which do happen, but blame was put on us and refused to give any refund. from the moment we got in, there were issues with wifi and the tv... we were told to reset the system, per maintenance, and it didnt work.. which in the end, the owner tried to blame us. maintenance tried to fix the tv issue with the dish technician (as we left to have dinner) and when we returned maintenance was still there and stated he had ""reset something"" and ""hopefully it works"". . where it didnt... and again, owner tried to blame us. Dish was going to come out the next day (Saturday) but had no time frame and wanted us to wait around for them.. we were on our VACATION.. but that was also put on us that we wouldnt allow anyone in the house.. which is NOT the case. We didnt know if we were going to be there or not, as there was no time set and we were on vacation. we shouldnt be asked to wait around when we are paying for services. the last day the toilet stopped working.. maintenance sent someone (a buddy of his) with a plunger.. and we decided to do it ourselves since it was a ""used"" toilet.. and it still didnt work.. so the last 24 hours we had to use the restroom on the beach."

Stayed with kids","This is a wonderful beach cottage 4 blocks from Magnolia Beach. Bernadette had great and timely communication which makes everything so easy. The cottage itself was super clean and the beach décor was especially thoughtful. You can tell it's been recently renovated and for sure the cutest cottage on the block! The king size bed was very nice given it's a 1 bedroom and our 3 year old loved the bunk beds. Overall I would recommend this cottage and really was a great value even during peak summer season.
Tips: Research Magnolia Beach. This beach is ideal for fishing on the piers, sitting with your chairs and enjoying the view. It's free and you can easily drive your car right up close to the water. However it does have a large amount of shells. So water shoes are recommended so you don't cut your feet. Not ideal for smaller children who are looking to play in the sand and build sand castles. Rockport or Port Aransas which is about 50 minutes away is much better for that.
Local Area - this is a small community with limited restaurants. So the kitchen is stocked with cooking utensils and a grill. So better to stop by HEB on the way in and stop up for your stay.
Don't forget all your own beach equipment and beach towels.
AirBNB details for this cottage: Everything lists correctly - just pointing out no washer or dryer. So be prepared to bring towels and beach wear home wet/air dried. 2 A/C window units that to work very well for living room and bathroom. Kitchen and bathroom run a few degrees warmer.
One small revision - AirBNB shows check in time is Noon. It is 3:00pm. We did request an early check in and Bernadette was able to accommodate a 1:00pm check in. Again, she is great at communication via the website message center."

Stayed with kids","This home was wonderful! Sitting on the bay in the most laid back town . I took my entire family there and everyone enjoyed it so much.
We were just down the way from a perfect little pocket beach with picnic tables and covers. The other direction from the house was the marina where my husband could launch his boat. And across the street the fishing pier was there for us to enjoy. We sat on the huge front porch and watched the sun rise over the bay. As night fell we sat on that same porch and visited as a a nice breeze kept us cool. The house was beautifully decorated. Comfy beds , clean bathrooms and large bedrooms was a delight. The kitchen was stocked with everything you needed to prepare a meal. There was even an extra fridge in the laundry room for keeping our drinks in! Our sweet host met us there when we arrived and was only a text away when we had questions. Absolutely everything was perfect with this place. Comfy house. Quiet town. Beautiful views. Oh my goodness it was great!"

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect place for our big family’s annual Mothers Day Weekend getaway. It was peaceful, beautiful, and Indianola has the best classic laid back easy vibe you love to find in a little hidden gem of a small coastal town. Also, rent the golf cart… it was the perfect addition! We rode around all weekend, even down to the marina for some pretty great hamburgers!
The beds were very comfortable, the house is spacious (pics don’t do it justice at all), the 2 bedrooms downstairs were great for separating toddlers who need to nap from noisy teenagers and the new couch was amazing! The set up downstairs is perfect for extended families and we loved the swing. The backup generator was a fab touch when there was an outage in the area and we were the only ones with power for miles.
There were extras that provided a great touch. From Shampoo & conditioner to condiments and lots of towels. If you’re looking for a laid back getaway to relax and be lazy for all ages… this is THE place!"

Stayed a few nights","Our group’s stay at Lisa’s place was so special! We all remarked how fresh and clean the house smelled. The bedrooms are large, with a huge common kitchen/living area and the ocean right across the street. Since it’s August, we enjoyed leisurely morning coffees on the cool and shady West-facing back porch and the spectacular Moonrise out front at the end of the day. The outdoor shower was a bonus feature we all took advantage of at least once—don’t miss it! Lisa was there to greet us and share tips for the beaches and restaurants nearby. She was always available to answer any questions we had.We are a group of college friends who made more wonderful memories together in this beautiful place. Thank you, Lisa, for being such a great host. We hope to get back soon!"

Stayed a few nights",Really enjoyed our stay. Lisa was great and answered all our questions. Loved the area. Went swimming at a small pocket beach down the road. Great place to go fishing - the pier was a short distance from the house. Downstairs there was a dartboard and a cute swing. The only drawback was the upstairs and downstairs are not connected. Which is not stated in the description of the house. So when we arrived the two other rooms with the daybed/futon and full size beds were downstairs and my daughters (24 & 27) did not want to sleep down there because there were no locks on the metal sliding doors that you entered into the downstairs or the bedrooms which made them uncomfortable. Also they wanted to be with us - upstairs. So we made it work. But overall the house was wonderful and the area was nice!

The home was beautifully decorated, and just FANCY! I read a review that mentioned a smoke smell and there was absolutely none—the home was immaculately kept. I also appreciated the availability of plenty of paper goods and trash bags, and a well stocked laundry room. The kitchen was very spacious and well stocked.
We enjoyed the swings, the fire pit, and the short walk across the street to the water to hunt crabs, and Lisa told us of a fun swimming spot for the kids just a short way down the road. The outdoor shower was a plus!! Also, the ample parking under cover was super nice.
Lisa was super responsive and an incredibly helpful host. We will definitely be back! Our new favorite place!"

The “Salty Ranch” was a perfect location. We went to several places in the mornings and fished in the evening. The last night we were there my husband caught a 34” black drum and I caught a 37” black drum. Too large to keep but amazing experience. We also caught sting ray, bonnet head shark, croaker, hard heads, and catfish. The place was comfortable for all our needs. I love the water barista and coffee bar. The panini maker was fantastic!!! Alex was a great host and when we needed anything she answered immediately. We spent a lot of time downstairs resting on the lawn. I don’t think we ever turned on the TV. What a great week. The marina down the street was very nice too. Thank you so much."

HEB is 25 minutes away, so stock up before your stay; spend more time fishing and less driving. The fishing marina has good eats if you don’t want to drive to Port Lavaca.
The fishing pier is in really good condition. We caught a couple hundred fish from it, with a few keepers; lots of fun. We also caught a few blue crabs with the already included crab traps. Alex and Cody (and their family) provided very helpful tips. Don’t be afraid to ask.
Don’t leave anything outside that can be eaten overnight, the trash pandas (raccoons) will find it.

Group trip","Alex is a tremendous host. She is very thoughtful, a great planner, knowledgeable about her area and an extremely nice person. We felt like we were renting from a friend or neighbor even though we never met. The house was extremely well stocked and came with at least a starter package of every item we needed. Our group experienced some of the best fishing of our lives including an 80 pound gar, a 60 pound black drum and over 200 combined speckled trout and sand trout. The pier is well built and even comes with a private landing for trophy fish. Crab traps, a long handled dip net and even a check-it stick were provided. Our 5 day trip could not have been anymore enjoyable and if you are looking for outstanding private fishing this is the perfect place. Thanks for everything Alex. We look forward to booking again soon."

Group trip",This was a great experience. Peaceful area. We caught 50 crabs that were keepers over the 5 inch keeper requirement. We even caught a stone crab to keep one claw. The beach part was great for swimming and going out in our kayaks. Neighbors were nice guys. Night fishing was awesome. Trout hitting the lines all night long. The layout of the house was well thought. Plenty of places to sit and chat inside and outside. Beds were even comfortable. Only add on I would recommend is a big fan under the porch area.

We lounged on the beach and swam all day and fished on the lighted pier all night and had a wonderful time! The interior is decorated so cute and it's so cozy and comfy. The beds were VERY comfy and there's literally anything and everything you could need here. Alex really goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and provides many things that you don't typically find in other rentals. There are amazing views from every window. Thank you again Alex for a great time. It was just what we needed and we will be back!

Stayed with a pet","We spent a wonderful month here. It was clean, cozy, just right for the two of us and occasional visits from our daughter, too. We were surprised at how far it was from the town of Port Lavaca —but that turned out to be great. It was easy enough to get there for whatever we needed, but then back at the house could enjoy the laid back beach-y vibe of the Magnolia Beach and Indianola areas, and the even quieter setting of the house itself which is tucked back and a bit away from the beach activity. The screened porches were wonderful; we especially loved the back view over the marshes with a variety of birds to watch. We fished from the public pier, and could do our 3-4 mile daily walks right from the house or nearby (Zimmerman Rd which runs through the Texas Ornithological “Magic Ridge” sanctuary). Paul was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns and clearly cared about our experience in their home. We’ll be back!"

The house was beautiful, the beds were comfy and the loft was easily accessible! The kitchen was beautiful and functional!
One of my favorite things from this trip was sitting on the deck with coffee or a glass of wine gazing at the water! The beach views and the sunrise/sunset from this house are absolutely stunning and so peaceful! The downstairs area is great for relaxing and there is plenty of room for activities! The table is huge, which was great for playing games on! We also took advantage of the bikes and kayaks that are for guest to use, they are in great condition!

Every day contained a mid-afternoon bike ride along the water. We drove down to the marina on our first night. The food was great, and the fishing from the pier with the locals was so much fun!
The house was beautiful, clean, and we enjoyed the open kitchen and living room at meal times. The beds are comfy, and there’s a perfect loft nook for the kids.
Preston was a wonderful host, very responsive. We were greeted at check in by Lisa who was so kind, and she had so many helpful suggestions!
It’s been so long since we’ve experienced the slow pace of “coast life”, and the Teal Tertle was exactly what we needed! Our family will definitely be making this an annual trip."

We were just down the way from a perfect little pocket beach with picnic tables and covers. The other direction from the house was the marina where my husband could launch his boat. And across the street the fishing pier was there for us to enjoy. We sat on the huge front porch and watched the sun rise over the bay. As night fell we sat on that same porch and visited as a a nice breeze kept us cool. The house was beautifully decorated. Comfy beds , clean bathrooms and large bedrooms was a delight. The kitchen was stocked with everything you needed to prepare a meal. There was even an extra fridge in the laundry room for keeping our drinks in! Our sweet host met us there when we arrived and was only a text away when we had questions. Absolutely everything was perfect with this place. Comfy house. Quiet town. Beautiful views.

The Casita was exactly as described, very clean with easy access and spectacular views. Rosangely and her husband communicated well and went above and beyond to be hospitable. Fishing off the dock was easy, fun, and we ate some of our catch. Other than a nice convenience store around the corner, supplies are about 25 minutes away at Walmart Supercenter in Port Lavaca. We would recommend this place for anyone wanting a quite escape to the coast. Thanks again for a great time."

In the mornings and evenings, we were able to sit on the porch and take in the view of the bay and the ships passing by. My husband was able to wet a hook which he loves to do on their private pier for their rentals.
We ventured out to nearby towns to sightsee. We especially loved the pizza at the Indianola Fishing Marina.
Overall, our trip was very relaxing."

My grandson and I drive down from Austin for a lovely quiet beach visit, and Roseangely is a fantastic host. We walk up and down the beach at Magnolia Beach as well as visit King Fisher beach nearby. Magnolia Beach has a great sunrise, wonderful shell collecting, fossilized corral, and lots of hermit crabs to observe. King Fisher beach, nearby, has a nice shallow sandy beach. Relax, enjoy nature, take a nice swim at both places, and do some great birdwatching. We don’t fish, but lots of visitors fish right off the beach."

Great little spot right across from the water. Very quiet and perfect to spend with a significant other, a friend, or even by yourself. Very quaint and cozy space. Just enough room for a small getaway. And if you feel like venturing out, away from the beach-you can go into town and try out some of their restaurants. We didn’t get to, cause we went out after most were closed. But we did find a cool little bowling/pool hall/arcade game place called Beau’s Bowling. I suggest checking it out. But thank you again to the hosts for this much needed vacation!"

Stayed with kids",We loved this little condo right on the bay. The location is perfect if your looking for a less populated-quiet- and relaxed setting. Great views right in front of the water. You can’t actually go in the water in front of the condo there’s rocks and there but a little further down there’s a beach just a short walk or you can drive right up which is what we chose to do. The closest Walmart is a 22 min drive. The condo really does have everything. The hosts thought of all the essentials- there’s even q tips in the bathroom! The space was nice and clean. VERY cold ACs. We didn’t have any issues with cooling down in June. The 1 TV is in the bedroom so no TV for the main living area/kitchen so my husband was bummed cause we made him sleep out there. Oh well! We had such a great little vacation here. So relaxing to sit downstairs and let the toddler run in the shade of the house. They have lots of bikes you can use too. Highly recommend

On our last day, our host directed us to a spot 30 min away where we could be sure to see Dolphins, and we did.

The town is small then only some basic groceries are available around the area but there are markets in 20 min by car. We and our 8 year old kid, loved the apart, the view and the Indianola Marina that you can reach in less than 10 min by car and enjoy good food and concerts during the weekend! That was so cool!"

Stayed a few nights","A great stay! I was celebrating a 5 year anniversary weekend and we both wanted to spend time away from the city (Houston) This did not disappoint. The hospitality we were greeted with was exceptional. Hostess came out to personally greet us with a warm welcome as soon as we got there and ensured us to not hesitate to ask for anything. I do recommend bringing sandals to the beach itself, a lot of small rocks and seashells that can make a walk unbearable. The Airbnb itself is perfectly suited for two people. Clean and welcoming with plenty of amenities such as dishes, cups, utensils, stove etc. This was a perfect stay. My only issue was that We did not get to stay longer! Will most definitely be back and recommend it to anyone needing a break or relaxing getaway."

We brought our daughter for her 8th birthday and they gave us a Unicorn cake which she loved. She adores unicorns! We will be back no doubt!

Check-in to the Casita was easy and the place looked exactly like the pictures. We spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the water. The Casita is within walking distance of Magnolia Beach but we drove since you can drive your car onto the beach. Nice little beach to get away from the crowds at the more touristy ones. The Casita is in a pretty remote area so would recommend bringing food for meals but there are some good eateries in the area if you're ok with a little drive. All in all it was a great stay and would definitely recommend!

The house faces the bay, and there are 2 giant picture windows, one facing the bay side to watch the sun rise, and an occasional ship floating by, and the other facing west to watch the sun set. The kitchen is nicely set up and we used it quite a bit. This area and its vicinity is steeped in history, and it was interesting to go through the information, even though we did not get to visit them. We left feeling we should definitely come back, and maybe in a bigger group."

We had the best luck on Muller- which can be bought at the bait shop in town-Big Bear. All around it was amazing, the Marigolds were on bloom, so you had the touch of wolf flowers in the yard. It was just amazing. You’re about 20 minutes from town. In town you will find just about everything. Restaurants, Walmart, bait shops. Port Lavaca has a cute small beach area. Perfect for the kids.
We walked the pier, and were completely shocked to see the “Pink Floyd” figurative flamingo flying. The wild life is amazing at the BnB and on the pier.
Night fishing was our best luck. As soon as we would cast, we would get a bite. I will say, when the bay is copper, fishing wasn’t the best, but we utilized activities in town. The back porch had the most amazing sunsets, with rocking chairs and great breeze."

Lucas’ description was perfect. Very private and loved that we were able to have Sadie Mae (our doggy daughter) with us!
We loved drinking our coffee in the morning while watching the birds fly and fish jump in the water.
Our evening sunsets with a glass of wine were wonderful!
We brought bug spray and Citronella candles (at Lucas’ suggestion) However, we never used them or saw a mosquito! Yippee!
I brought my fishing gear and I saw lots of fish jumping; however, we were enjoying the place so much I never even unpacked it. I will definitely be back to fish from the beautifully lit dock.
Lucas was available and answered any questions immediately. We had one tiny hiccup and he had the problem solved quickly and efficiently!
Thank you so much for sharing your home with us! We will definitely be back!"

We made some happy memories there that I will never forget. Fishing, site seeing, and all around great time. It's worth every penny. 10/10 would definitely recommend. Even the host was so accommodating and responsive. Thank you for everything."

The facility is well equipped, clean and quiet. Everything worked. There is a responsive young man working for Michael who lives nearby who was absolutely great for providing help and information. I was out doing things all day, everyday, but the facility was always good to come back to and relax, eat, shower and sleep. I would stay here again."

But definitely don’t go outside with dowsing yourself in bug spray. The second anyone went outside we were cover in mosquitoes 🦟. It didn’t seem to matter the time of day we would all get bit. A decent spot though.

Stayed with kids","the place was very clean and accommodating for my family. however, it was too close to other trailers, so close I could hear them walking and thought it was in my air bnb. the photo of the loft with the chairs left the impression that is off your patio, and it is not. the air bnb is a good couple blocks from the water . other than that, the host was very friendly and responded so quickly. welocked our key inside one night, and at 1030 p.m., he had someone there within 30 min to let us in."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay the area very much. The house was very clean and comfortable. The beds, sofa, and easy chair all offer good support making them comfortable to sleep and set in. We found every thing needed to cook but would probably bring a few specialty items if staying for an extended time. The area is quiet and not crowded which was one of the plusses for us. We loved the access to the bay and fishing and were often the only ones in the area fishing. It was exactly what we were looking for after spending 2 months in Port Aransas which is becoming more busy and crowded every year. The flip side of that is that you will not find restaurants or night life right out your door if that is what you are looking for. Again the area and facilities were perfect for us and Michael was a very accommodating host. We highly recommend this property if you are looking for a saltwater haven off of the beaten path. Thank you Michael, we enjoyed our stay and would consider booking again."

Stayed with kids","Very hospitable, close proximity to beaches, nice clean house and host was easy to contact, even made us muffins and had adult beverages ready upon our arrival. My only issue was we chose the location because of the observation deck, which was very misleading, its not on the property of the house, you either have to walk through a pit of mud and through two other properties to get to the observation deck, or you can drive there which is what he recommended. We felt very mislead with the observation deck which was the reason we chose to go there, but everything else was nice"

Rockport TX beach was 40m drive which made our stay even more enjoyable. The owner even let us check out a little later from what originally was supposed to be so Thank you very much for that! 🙏🏼 We wanted to stay more days but unfortunately we have to wake up to reality. Ugh, that is going right back to work!! We are definitely booking here real soon before summer ends!!!! 10 out of 5 stars : )"
