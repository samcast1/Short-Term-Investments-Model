Stayed one night","Every year on vacation, we like to stay in at least one unique accommodation- this is certainly one of them! This grain bin is adorable, down to the ""overalls"" curtains! Care was certainly taken in designing this unique Airbnb! I loved looking at all of the decor. I was able to see a nice sunset right behind the bin and a beautiful sunrise over the other side of the highway. There are things to do within 10 to 15 minutes. We ate at Ye Olde Trail Tavern, which has interesting decor for us ""first-timers""- try the Fritos Chili Pie (which isn't a pie, but still good). The place is right off the highway, which is convenient. (For very light sleepers, this may be out of your comfort zone, but the a/c on the first floor provides white noise, and you can use the fan in the loft to block noise while sleeping, as well.) Note that the staircase to the loft in Bin #1 is spiral, in case of fear or inability; we were fine. Thank you, Brandy, for a fun and unique experience!"

Stayed a few nights","This stay was so much fun! The grain bin was done so authentic in vintage style decor. Our host had taken such great care to make the place very cozy, very authentic vintage farmhouse style and the bed was so comfortable. Everything was easy from checkin to checkout and the place was very clean and tidy. The price was reasonable as well. We loved it!"

Stayed with kids","Super cute and really convenient to get to Lebanon. The only downside was that it was pretty noisy from the interstate traffic and we are light sleepers. I would just suggest that future guests bring some earplugs with them because other than that, this place is super cute and a great place to stay! My son also loved that we were so close to the candy factory! Brandy was super helpful and responsive when I had any questions! Overall it was a great stay!"

The decor touches were evident throughout...an old door as a headboard, overalls as window coverings, a grain scoop holds toilet paper. We got so tickled at all the nostalgia. We had a rainy night and the soft patter of rain on the bin was heavenly. This is a MUST for a great 66 experience. Well done!"

AC worked great, plus was a stand fan upstairs. Would definitely stay here again and recommend for a several day stay or overnight stop. Enjoyed the Route 66 park in Lebanon nearby."

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I loved our weekend stay in the renovated grain silo. Although right off the highway, the traffic noise was pretty well quieted by whatever insulates the silo. This also means that when the ac was on, the inside stayed cool and comfortable. We did not have time, but there were magazines, games, puzzles, and a big screen TV provided. The bathroom was well stocked, and the water pressure in the shower was amazing. Overall, we were super impressed by the grain silos and would definitely stay with Brandy again. Thank you for a wonderful weekend!"

This is a very private and peaceful venue, perfect for someone who wants solitude away from the majority of the bustle of society without being completely out in the wilderness.

Excellent rustic minimalist decor that gives the place a great sense of character without making it feel cluttered. Big open space inside gives you room to breathe."

Not only was the fact that it’s a silo really great, but the hosts have done an awesome job decorating with vintage, farming touches from Missouri and Phillipsburg specifically. Highly recommend if you’re looking to stay near there - there’s groceries and restaurants a short drive away and beautiful farmland on the rural routes around it. Also, lots of hiking/nature options around the Ozarks."

Stayed one night","We stayed at the bins one night on our way to Bennett Springs, which is just a short drive away. It was a unique experience that our sons will never forget. Our bin was super clean and just as pictured…and surprisingly spacious for our family of four! There is a picnic table and grill located between the bins (bring charcoal); it was a nice spot to hang out in the evening.
Located right off the interstate and highway, it was easy to access (there was some noise as others have mentioned so we weren’t surprised by that).
About a 5 minute drive away is a brewery and restaurant with live music, if you want to venture off the property and experience the local scene.
Brandy was wonderful and couldn’t have done anything better."

Everything worked, water was hot, tv had lots of choices and we kicked off our summer superbly!"

Stayed one night","What a fun overnight adventure! We love staying in quirky and unusual places! Sometimes that comes with some discomfort, but not this time. Our bin was cozy and comfy and most of all spotless!! What a great job Brandy and her family did, building and decorating this unique space. So many creative touches from “overall curtains” to the 7Up and Royal Crown sink and table! I love the happy feel to this bin! But also appreciate the solid, careful craftsmanship. You want to feel safe on those stairs to the loft, after all!
Tips
If you stay, make sure to catch sunset! At least in April, we could look towards the front of the 2 bins and see the sun sink between!
Don’t miss the 2 barns up the road, with Meramec ads on the roofs! Good photo op!
Also, if you stay on a Monday there are fewer dining options. We had fun with a picnic dinner in the bin! A little too cool that night for grilling, but that would be great another time.
Enjoyed our stay!!"

The Cottage was the perfect blend of cozy & comfort that our weary spirits needed! We felt instantly at home & would give it 10 stars if I could-- we all loved it so much! The property was private with pretty landscaping and a neat old barn with areas for my boys to explore without worry, while my girls and I enjoyed baking in the beautiful kitchen using the fabulous appliances! The Cottage was super clean, well- stocked & had all the necessary items for today's lifestyle with a Roku tv and fast wifi. My girls were able to do their homework at the back desk while the boys watched movies. Shelly was ultra-responsive (even while out of town) and the check- in & out process couldn't of been easier. Would definitely stay here again 🩷"

There was plenty of room for everyone, it was close to the hospital and shopping. Any time we had a question Shelly was quick to respond. She was always nice and helpful. The extra off street parking was a great bonus when dad's home healthcare workers and a friend came by. This place was half the cost of a ""nice"" hotel with four times the space and onsite laundry."

Stayed with kids","We were trying to find a little place to have our family during my son’s baseball tournament we had to travel a couple hours for. This was absolutely the best AirBnb I have ever stayed in. The beds were so comfortable, the house was so clean, Roku TV’s in every room, very large flat screen living room TV, laundry included, and the fenced in backyard was perfect for my littles. Melissa was the best host I have ever encountered! Made us fresh lemonade, gave great recommendations, always was super responsive. I wish she could host and decorate every AirBnb I stay in! To say we were impressed with her is an understatement! If you’re staying in Lebanon, RUN… don’t walk to this one!! 🙌🏼
Even though we originally traveled for baseball, we will be back just to get away from home for no reason other than to feel at home at Melissa’s AirBnb!! Thank you for everything! What a blessing! 😇🤗"

Overall, it was a relaxing and enjoyable getaway, and I would definitely consider staying here again in the future."

Jo always communicated promptly and was so kind and helpful. The home itself was stocked with everything we needed and was spotlessly clean. It was the perfect place for a family get together with plenty of spacious gathering areas where we could all be together to talk, laugh, and reminisce. The acreage the home sits on and the views of the surrounding hills are absolutely breathtaking!! Jo offers many services such as tours of the ranch that we weren't able to take advantage of this time, however, we will definitely be back and look forward to doing all the things next time. Can't wait to make more cherished family memories here!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us, Jo!!"

If you're going to be floating, this house is a great escape to spoil yourselves before and at the end of a hot, tiring day. I've also stayed there in late fall and loved just hanging out in the house. We love the furnishings, and the house is such an interesting build and layout. The outside is great for cooking or having a fire, too."

Stayed about a week","Peace permeates this place. Jo and William offer a beautiful gem to stay and relax in.
After visiting many upscale places throughout the years, I would say that their home is the most perfect that we have enjoyed.
Their home is ultra clean, beautifully decorated and spacious both inside and out, with many vignettes to enjoy their sprawling ranch vistas.
We especially loved the visits of their sweet cows with their babies, the two bald eagles up close and personal, and the resident bunny who came to the front door each day.
Also enjoyed were the magnificent sunrises and sunsets while sharing meals on one of their outdoor areas.
Jo and William were both gracious and friendly hosts while also granting us peaceful privacy to enjoy their home.
I was also very impressed and appreciative with their generosity of the staples that they shared such as kitchen and bathroom necessities, outdoor grilling products, laundry detergent and so much more.
A special thank you to Jo, William and family for a very blessed time.
Their peaceful haven is highly recommend."

The home is so clean, and no odd smells like so many rentals. It was so nice to feel truly at home. Also Jo has a nice coffee and tea selection the highlight of each morning.
Jo was so warmly attentive and responded so quickly to any questions. I would highly recommend staying here, it’s a bit out of town, but the serene surroundings, gorgeous sunrises and sunsets more than make up for that."

Jo went over and above to stay in communication with us, too."

Stayed about a week","Our stay at Villa at River Ranch was excellent. First of all, it is a beautiful home, very comfortable, well cared for, and clean. There was a full compliment of appliances and kitchen utensils to meet almost every food prep need, along with ranging bathroom toiletries. The only things you need to bring are your food and a toothbrush.
I think what made our stay so good was the customer service provided by Jo, both before and after arrival. She responded to any question within minutes of sending it, with answers that were clear, with zero ambiguity, on topics from where to find things in the house to technical questions on the TV and Wi-Fi, as well as local restaurant recommendations.
All this, along with a week of great fishing, made this an extremely memorable trip."

Group trip","We absolutely loved everything about Villa at River Ranch! The house itself is stunning and impeccably clean and organized. The furnishings are gorgeous, high quality and comfortable. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need—even a cookie press! The beds, pillows and linens are super comfy too. Jo has thought of everything!!!
When you’re ready to enjoy the outdoors, Villa continues to stun. The property is beautiful with rolling hills in every direction and plenty of cattle and sheep to warm your heart. You can enjoy the surroundings from the wrap around porch or either of the two patios or go for a stroll on the private road. While the views are stunning during the day, the stars at night are breathtaking!
Jo is an amazing host as well. She communicated promptly and thoroughly with us leading up to and throughout our visit. She has a kind and generous heart and it is so apparent that she cares deeply for her guests and their comfort during their stay. She made my family feel so welcome and at home while we were in town for a family funeral. We had 3 generations staying together during a difficult time and the Villa provided us a peaceful sanctuary to gather and and celebrate the life of a family member taken much too soon. I will forever be grateful that we found Jo and her beautiful Villa."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, wow & wow.!!! The Villa is just simply amazing with beautifully appointed decor and well thought out lighting wherever you might need it. The pics are good, but reality is even better. Jo and her son William are wonderful and gracious hosts. The home is perfect for two couples, as nobody gets a bedroom that is lesser than the other. Both rooms have the most awesome sunrise views. We did not use the 3rd bedroom, but it would have been perfect for a couple of grand kids if they could have joined us. This visit was for myself, my guy, along with my son and his wife.
For an additional cleaning fee, we coordinated with Jo and William to take advantage of the using the kayaks to float the Osage Arm of the Gasconade River. We started with a 9:30 pick-up at the The Villa, by the time we floated to the first put-out access, it was after 3pm. Because we had pretty much decided to only do the shorter 4.8 mile float versus the longer 13+ mile float; we wanted it to last and did not paddle much. The river was down and running slow. We did have to do a few portages over the shallow river bottom. My son and his wife did a tandem kayak and would recommend the single kayaks if the river is low, as it was on our weekend. The tandem is heavier and required a few more portages than the singles did. The views, the trees, the peacefulness along the Osage Arm were so nice. No litter and no craziness of some of our busier float rivers in Missouri.
Jo recommended we use the Pro Angler App to determine the river conditions. I will do that for the next trip. On this trip I was the organizer and was so busy planning meals and timing that I didn’t prioritize using the app and I think it would’ve been helpful. I am already planning to return again to float and maybe try the Niangua River. Yes, the Niangua has the reputation of being crowded, but If the Osage Arm is lower than what we had the weekend of August 28, I figure a good back-up would be HVO (Hidden Valley Outfitters) at 27101 Marigold Dr, Lebanon, MO; 36 minutes and 27 miles from The Villa. Of course you will have to book with Hidden Valley and get yourself over there and back, but it is a back up or alternative and I don’t think that is a big deal in order to have the quality accommodations that are part of being at The Villa. You could do the cabins that the outfitters like HVO offer, but The Villa isn’t even on the same level. The Villa is refined living with peaceful sunrises, sunsets, great outdoor spaces and most importantly privacy and gracious hosts that are the salt of the earth.
I was very blessed in that I found The Villa available without making plans months in advance, as places like Jo’s are usually booked all summer long. Because she had just listed it on Airbnb, I was able to book and be her 3rd set of guests. The hardest part of booking was ensuring I understood all the details of getting the kayaks set up for the Osage Arm. I wanted to make sure I didn’t lock myself in without recourse or refund and not understand some logistics detail or not be able to float. I assure you that once you book with Jo and you talk to her right away to iron out any details you will be be pleased; if not and it is within a few hours of the booking, I’m sure she would release you. Jo didn’t tell me this, but just talking to her I feel her accommodating spirit if everything is done correctly and in a timely manner.
Very important: I realize that Jo has a lot of information on house rules and expectations, but because she has taken time to write everything out there is no misunderstanding. I appreciated this and I know it will serve to keep The Villa in tiptop shape for years to come. Do I take my shoes off in my own home? No. But I did it at The Villa and I appreciated the uber clean floors. Before leaving KC we checked the dogs in at at Cuddle Up Pup in Blues Springs, MO. The most stress free dog boarding kennel our dogs have ever experienced….it was like a spa weekend for them and they smelled good and had their nail trimmed when we picked them up. We did have a smoker in our group. He knew the rules. He didn’t complain and I have no idea how he managed, but he did and I think all went very well. The Villa is an amazing property that most anyone will be grateful that they booked with no regrets.
One last thing, as I was leaving Lebanon on Sunday I picked up a booklet that is produced by the City of Lebanon’s Office of Tourism & Marketing. They are on FB/ VisitLebanonMO or you could call them and have them send you the Getaway Guide, plus you could ask and plan ahead of time if there are any local entertainment bookings. Our family really liked Lebanon. We had Sunday morning coffee and breakfast at Judes before departing.
Knuckles and High Fives to Jo and William! Hope to do it all again sometime soon."

Stayed with a pet","We needed a place for Christmas with our adult daughter and her dogs. The place was clean and the yard was big although not fenced. (She never claimed it was fenced so we knew.) There was a beautiful Christmas tree in the living room so all we had to do was slip our presents under it and begin celebrating! The beds were basic but comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots/pans, but there was no salt (five peppers ... no salt!) and although not required I guess, most airbnb places we have stayed at have had water and some form of food available for breakfast. One thing I would say is to BE CAREFUL when entering if you are old like us. The porchlight is on the outside of the house, which makes it easy to get to the front door, but the entryway is unlit and very dark. When we opened the storm door we stumbled back down onto the sidewalk - while holding onto the door - and the flashlight - to get the key! OVERALL - THUMBS UP experience!"

Stayed with kids","Very quiet place to stay. Very big back yard for kids to play, toys for the kids to play with was a bonus. Watch out when pulling out though, there’s a sewer drain or water drain at the beginning of the driveway that we were not warned about and no sign so we ended up in it with damage to the back of our car from backing out of the driveway into it. There should be a sign or pole there to prevent that. Neighbors also said that this happens every time someone stays there so we were not the first ones this happened to. Neighbors and passer bys were very willing to help pull us out and already knew what happened before we even went to ask for help. That was the only downfall there. Other then that, the place was clean, nice and very quiet just like we like. Very close to restaurants, stores and the highway which was huge since we were visiting our son at Fort Leonardwood for his army boot camp graduation."

She was very responsive to messages and even let us check in early. The first night the propane was out for the grill but she got us a tank for our second night! She was very kind and we can't wait to stay there again next year! Thank you for everything, Stephanie! :)"

Stayed a few nights","For my short stay it was very nice. The hostess was very friendly and helpful. The pictures don’t really describe how beautiful the home was. It’s in a great location it was nice to stay where there was a washer and laundry detergent, hand soap and dish soap plus paper towels. The only thing I would wish and recommend
I wish more throw blankets and a fenced in backyard and a few things in the house that needs fixing but shouldn’t be a problem during anyone’s stay. Overall I would definitely come back again. Thank you so much. 😊"

Stayed with kids","If you have a bad back, this isn’t the place for you. The beds are incredibly hard and uncomfortable. There weren’t any extra linens for the extra pillows. There wasn’t a broom to sweep up the floor, no dish soap, minimal toilet paper. Shower sprays out on you when you turn it on. Doors are incredibly loud, hinges need WD-40. Only three chairs at the kitchen table, picture showed four. Back yard is a disaster. Ground bubbles up when shower is being used. Not good when you have a dog outside. Felt stark, not homey at all."

We had plenty of room to sleep. With more room if you needed to add a air bed or cot yourself. Thank you Stephanie for being a great host.

Group trip","WILL NOT RETURN. The previous reviews are very misleading. The minute you walk in you're hit with a musty smell. There were flies everywhere,  probably from the nasty condensating microwave or the half full cake pan in the oven leftover from God knows when. There was all types of expired food in the fridge, garbage bags in the garage bc the one garbage can they have was full. And I understand it's dog friendly but one of the bed linens was covered in dog hair along with all the towels that were rolled up and ""clean"". There was a used towel under the bathroom sink, contacts stuck to the tub, we found a pair of mens shorts in the couch along with more dog hair and underneath the couch was a sock, balls of pet hair, and 6 little toy balls. Underneath all the beds were clumps of pet hair and dust, the mirrors were filthy, there was sticky brown liquid next to our bed on the floor that was DRY. The pillows were all stained yellow and flat as a board and the beds that weren'tin the master bedroom are hard and uncomfortable. Oh and a sewer pong in the next yard over so sitting outside isn't an option for long
This place was filthy, don't waste your money."

It also has plenty of space for parking.

Stayed one night","We we're really looking forward to our stay here. We flew from Washington state to Memphis then drove 5 hrs arriving at 11:45 pm. We were looking forward to having a whole house opposed to a hotel room. when we entered the code to the lockbox it didn't open. I sent a message to the host, We tried several more times we even googled it thinking we must be doing something wrong after 15 minutes without success it was obvious that we couldn't get in so we went to town and stayed in a hotel. The host responded to my message 3 hrs later.
The response to my request of a refund since we couldn't get in was No and she appreciates our understanding. I do not understand, Anyone with integrity would make it right.
she didn't even refund the cleaning fee.
If she reviews the ring doorbell video she'll see how many times the code didn't work.
So at no fault of our own we're out the $120 I do not recommend going through this host but If you decide to stay here good luck getting in and don't expect any integrity"

The home owner is completely inflexible and will try to charge you for things. There's dog poo everywhere, so walking in the yard is not an option. The fence has places that are down so your dog can get out. None of the fire alarms are operational, being that none of them have batteries. There are no comforters, as shown in pictures, just extremely thin blankets that do not keep you warm at all. Overall, the worst place I've ever stayed."

Group trip","Renters beware - if you have a maintenance issue with this renter and they do not resolve the situation for you, you are just out of luck - A/C was not working properly. When we arrived, the internal temperature in the house was 80 degrees. Contacted the property manager within an hour of arriving, but had to leave for a wedding. Stephanie was quick to respond and had a technician at the house while we were at the wedding. Rec'd a message that the unit was frozen, but should be fine when we got home. Got home around 11 pm and the house was still at 80 degrees. Tried to reach Stephanie again, but didn't get a response until the next morning, after it no longer mattered, as we were only there for 1 night. She simply responded to ""open the windows"". We tried to do that the night before, but the 2 windows in the front living room would not stay up, and almost fell out when we tried to raise them. The window in the kitchen also would not open. This led to a very uncomfortable and hot night as it was too late to find accommodations elsewhere. When I contacted her in the morning asking for some sort of compensation for the uncomfortable arrangements, she refused, saying it was ""out of their control"". Response to the original problem was quick, however, the problem was never resolved. Stephanie simply said, ""we thought the unit would defrost by the time you returned"". After trying to continue to reason with her, she merely stopped responding. Am now in the process of appealing through Air Bnb.
Fire ring in the back yard was not useable - overgrown with huge weeds. Food was left in the freezer from prior renters. Cleaning job was sub par. Kitchen chairs need replacing. Will not stay here again! I would consider this more of a cabin then a house. If property manager was more willing to come to some sort of agreement on partial compensation, it would've been ok, but still not somewhere I'd stay again."

Only slight issue was the air conditioning struggled to keep the house cool. We reported it to the owner and she said they would look at it. We had a great stay here!"

Master shower was incredibly small and you are unable to turn it on without getting water sprayed on you unless you stand in the shower and wait for it to turn warm. I would recommend a shower head that turns but that was the only thing I can say I felt needed upgraded. I would recommend for sure.

It's worth mentioning that the backyard isn't actually fenced in-- there is a fence, but it has several gaps and downed areas-- it won't actually keep dogs or young children from wandering off the property. Perfect for what we needed, though, and a very fair price."

Stayed a few nights","This home was as expected, about a 15 minute drive from Bennett springs, quiet, spacious, and comfortable. The only issues we had were the amount of bugs that were inside the house probably from the longhorns being right outside. There was also a motion or timed light on the barn outside which turned on and off frequently throughout the night, this was very noticeable if you slept in the queen sized second bedroom. The house was clean and spacious and well stocked with what we needed like towels and cooking essentials. We had a great time and would likely stay again in the future."

It was located perfectly to where we needed to go for our family while were in town. It was clean and very open. Internet for the tv did not work well. We were not able to watch tv or log into the apps that the tv offered. It kept wanting to think and or search. In the pics the home showed a long horn. It seems to have been the theme to the home. And treats were left on the counter for a special encounter. Unfortunately, this did not happen and was nowhere in sight. The kids had their hopes up when we booked the home.
Overall, the home was great. It had everything that we needed. From full size Shampoo and Conditioner to coffee and basics in the fridge. I just wish we were able to get more of what the house offered in the listing."

Perfect for our large family, and I know that it would be great for singles and couples as well. The kids loved giving the cows treats and we loved delving into the simple pleasures of country life in the Ozarks."

This has become a trip all us boys look forward to and their place has become an easy choice for us to make this trip continue for years to come. Thanks again so much guys, and we look forward to coming back next April.

There was very little traffic down the gravel road, far enough from the main highway that the noise was not an issue and close enough to the interstate to get places quickly. We were pleased to see wildlife namely deer and wild turkey roaming the nearby pastures.
If you're looking for a place to stay that offers a nice home, secluded from the hustle and bustle and have great, responsive hosts, then book a stay!"

Stayed with kids","Levi's place was such a treat! This was a halfway point to meet up with some friends for a weekend. The house is exactly as pictured, but unlike most Airbnb's, this place is stocked! Everything we needed to cook and store food was already there. For the most part, we just relaxed around the house and grazed through the weekend. The space was conducive to letting a toddler run off his energy while we played board games and chatted. I especially loved the reclining chairs.
The town of Lebanon was only 20 minutes away and has most of what you might need. We did stop at the Rail restaurant the first night and really enjoyed our food!
We took Levi and Amy up on their offer for a farm tour, which was very interesting. They are a lovely couple and we're very gracious hosts. They were also very responsive and easy to communicate with.
I would absolutely recommend Levi's home. It truly was a treat!"

We would love to stay here every time we’re back to visit family (and will if they’ll let us!) Literally not one complaint. Such a great experience all the way through. Master bedroom/bath is on one end of the home and two additional bedrooms on the other end with second bath (doesn’t share a door with any of the bedrooms.) Family friendly. Cannot stress enough how clean it was. Everyone slept well no matter where they slept. If your family is big into playing games or watching tv together you would need to bring games and be prepared to figure out the tv situation BUT we personally enjoyed our time as a family without all the distractions and would recommend the simplicity."

We are from Missouri, but moved to New Mexico a few years ago - this place gives you a good taste of the Ozarks; it was a home away from home in our old home experience for us. 100% recommend and plan to return."

Stayed a few nights","Just book it!
This is our new favorite spot when we fish Bennett springs!
10 minutes straight into the park and a nice, peaceful and private place to cook up our catch and unwind at the end of the day.
The house was clean, organized and had some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.
WiFi was slow for streaming on the TV but worked well to answer work emails when it was necessary.
We cannot wait to book our next trip."

Only negative is that internet is a little weak - causes some buffering when watching streaming services. Rural location, that is very peaceful. Longhorns are a nice touch. Would definitely use again."

Group trip","We were looking for a place to spend the weekend honoring our father/grandfather on the 10th anniversary of his passing and we came across this little gem. I can’t say enough great things about the place and how gracious our host Levi was. We wanted someplace close to Bennett Springs State Park and this was a 10 minute straight shot drive that took you right into the park. The home was also very cleans and well kept and had anything and everything you would need for a comfortable stay. Levi even went above and beyond by placing a fire pit in the backyard when I told him a story of how my father loved to hang out in the backyard and roast hot dogs with his boys when we would arrive late on a Friday night for a weekend visit to their home at the lake. It made the time for me and my brothers and our sons even that more special. Plus Levi was always only a text away and quick to answer any questions we had. Bonus too, was waking up and seeing the longhorn cows right there in your backyard each morning. I highly recommend this home if your looking for a comfortable and clean place to just get away and relax. Thanks again for making another memory in our families history. We look forward to doing it all again next year."

This house exceeded our expectations in every way! It was spotless and exactly as described. I will say that the pictures did not do the Trout House any justice. Much nicer than the pictures.
The bathrooms were spotless and had more than enough towels and wash cloths.
All of the beds were very comfortable and very clean.
I cannot say enough about how impressed we were with the Trout House. We will definitely book here again if Patty or Richard will have us back. We did our best to take very good care of this awesome home.
Very convenient to Bennett Springs and just minutes from great restaurants.
Thank you Patty and Richard!! We loved this place!!"

Stayed with a pet","This beautiful, well appointed home was the perfect stay for me and my pup. The fenced yard was perfect! The large lot provides a lot of privacy. And the quiet, peaceful neighborhood allowed for us to take daily walks. We also enjoyed visiting Bennett Springs daily, a nature lovers delight and only a 10 minute drive. I highly recommend this Lebanon home for anyone needing an Airbnb"

Group trip","I've never felt more at home when away from home than I did staying here this last weekend. Everything was exactly as described in the listing and better. The kitchen was well stocked with coffee, cider and hot chocolate for the Keurig and also a nice little surprise of snacks to go with them. The bathrooms were spotless and had everything we needed to feel at home. The towels were so soft! The bedrooms were perfect for my girlfriend and our kids loved them too. We had everything we needed in the kitchen utensil wise to cook a great breakfast on Saturday morning. The living room was so comfy and inviting that we watched several movies in there. Without a doubt, if you need a home away from home then you have found your place here. I definitely will be back someday and I highly recommend you book your stay soon."

Stayed with kids","First I must say that the pics of the inside do not do justice. This home is very nicely updated and finished in a way that makes you feel right at home. It is very comfortable and cozy. The neighborhood is nice and quiet but also convenient to Lebanon and Bennett. We did not bring pets but can see how convenient it would be to do so, as the entire yard is fully fenced. There are some condiments including ketchup, mustard and Mayo in the fridge. There is a coffee pot with a drip pot and Keurig - a selection of K cups is provided but if you want to brew a pot, I think you bring your own ground coffee. There are also sugar and sweetener packets but we brought our own creamer. The bed in the master is quite firm, which happens to be just the way I like it. My kids found their beds very comfortable too after a day of floating the Niangua! I cannot say enough about how pleasant our stay was here. I have family in this area, so I suspect we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","A very clean, comfortable place that I was able to book on very short notice with a super quick response time. I travel to the Laclede County area often because my girlfriend has family there, and they're great, but it's always easier to skip their air mattress or being in the their way when can make our own arrangements for a visit. With that in mind this will almost certainly be the gold standard for hideaway on our next trip up to Missouri.

Stayed a few nights","The bland cottage was a nice and vintage feel. It felt very home like and was very clean. She had it decorated for fall and it was free of clutter and spacious. It is an old home that had been flipped, so it smelled a little musty, but not bad. There is a train track close by and we could hear it in the middle of the night. The only suggestions that I have are to fix the blinds as some of them did not open correctly, fix the dripping water from the shower, add a curtain or blind to cover the back door, and get a larger TV in the living room. The tv was so tiny that we had a hard time seeing it. The host was very responsive and nice. Overall we liked our stay and would visit again!"

The previous tenant and noted a concern and Molly shared right away even giving us the option to back out with a full refund the day before as she couldn’t get to the issue right away….we opted to stay and had no problems whatsoever but this was a generous offer on her part! The cottage was cozy and comfy and SUPER close to the Convention Center where we had an event to attend for the weekend. We had a medical emergency that caused us to have to pack up in the middle of the night to leave…I left Molly a message right away including that I thought I had done all the “things” for checkout but felt horrible if I missed anything…Molly was empathetic and told us not to worry about anything! Would definitely stay here again..no doubt!

Just a consideration for nighttime or early morning ablutions if both rooms are occupied. There are locks on the doors for privacy, but light and sound will easily permeate the attached bedroom."

The house is very close to the Cowan Civic Center, which is why I was in Lebanon, for a large crafting event. I would definitely recommend Molly’s place!!"

The whole house is so cute and really spacious. Dining table seated six comfortably. We will be back. Molly is an amazing host and immediately answered any questions I had. Thank you for hosting us."

The beds were comfortable and the updates done to the older home were tasteful and created an “at home” aesthetic. TV was large and easy to sign into for streaming. The kitchen and bathrooms had all the basic amenities plus much more than a lot of places we have stayed. There was even a fan in the bedroom closet which was perfect because we always run one at home. There was also a hair dryer in the closet and a bunch of board games. Shelly was available and responsive and we would definitely recommend this property.

It was a bonus to find a cute flat that oozed charm and comfort. The decor was fun and eclectic and everything was well organized and immaculate. The thoughtful touches throughout the home from a perfectly stocked kitchen, super comfortable bed with high- end linens to the well thought-out lighting made us feel right at home.
April and Tristan were very responsive to our questions and had patience with us in helping us navigate a few things. Thank you, we will definitely return!"

Stayed one night","My son & I were looking for a place to stay overnight in Lebanon, Mo that would be near Bennett Springs State Park (as we planned to trout fish for a few hours to break up our drive from SE Missouri to Kansas City).
I am very happy to say that we found April and Tristan's Airbnb...
Their place is amazing!
Everything from booking to check in was awesome. April and Tristan were always quick & courteous with their responses to any questions I had prior to our arrival and during our stay.
As for the place itself, amazing, CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, QUIET, & tastefully decorated.
Located just off the main road in town, with plenty of entertainment/dining options this place was quietly tucked away from any outside disturbances/noise. We were there for one night only which in hindsight is a shame as I would have liked to be able to take in the entertainment options that were all very near by.
Thank you April & Tristan for having us as your guests! My son and I enjoyed our stay."

Plenty of towels, comfy beds and pillows, firewood for both inside and out, every gadget and small appliance to cook full meals, hooks inside and out to hang coats or outdoor gear… I pride myself on offering helpful suggestions to improve an accommodation, but I have nothing to add. If you need peace and quiet, the most gracious and thoughtful hosts, and every possible amenity, we highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is great! The cabin is newer construction so everything is in great condition. It was really cozy for my winter stay. The construction quality is excellent and it's among the nicer accommodations that I have experienced near Bennett. They have all of the essentials on hand such as plenty of towels, coffee, great wifi, etc and added bonus I had a good cell signal inside the cabin which is sometimes hard to get in this area. The location is really close to Bennett but snuggled back in the woods so it feels like a deep nature experience. The only thing I would have liked to see would have been an easy place to hang my waders although maybe they had a hanger somewhere and I just didn't look hard enough."

Stayed one night",Another great stay. This was our second stay and starting to be our go to when visiting Bennett State Park. Has everything you need. Great outdoor sitting area. 5-7minute drive to the park. This should be an easy option for those traveling to Bennett to fish or just need a little peaceful retreat in the woods.

Stayed one night","Dmitriy’s place was beautiful. My boyfriend and I went for a quick over night at Bennett springs for trout fishing and his place could not have been better. It was close to the park and so peaceful. We had a nice fire outside and had a great time after fishing all day at his place. I definitely recommend this place, especially if you are wanting a peaceful getaway! 😊"

Stayed with kids","Came up for my sons Army basic grad, my husband is a vet & needs privacy/quiet so we were looking for a place a bit out from base that would be peaceful/cozy like our homestead. Lots of people doubled their price for this week, these hosts didn’t & I really appreciated that. Price was so fair. Neat as a pin & peaceful. Nice outdoor family area with a large fire pit. Hotel quality mattresses, if a bit firm. Close to trails and fishing. I’m saving it for family camping later. There is a faster way in if
you don’t mind gravel.
There are safety lights so I do recommend visitors bring a sleep mask if they’re a pitch black sleeper!
Thank you for the stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was a cute little cabin with all the modern amenities. It's not large, but there was plenty of space for two guests to eat, hang out, and sleep. The highlight is the outdoor area, where we spent most of our time. The fireplace and the chairs were lovely during our November nights, and we loved being to eat outside. The surrounding area is adorably isolated outside of the host's own residence. A nice lady came out and politely said hi from a distance while tending to their chickens. It was beautifully silent and serene, and the perfect place to get away and relax."

Cabin was perfect and only a few minutes from Bennett Springs, My gosh took me down K highway and took me down the gravel. Easy way was to go into the state park and back by the restaurant and the park store is OO highway, Take that way and less gravel. This place was perfect, we will def be back!"

Tranquil woodland setting where the owner's intent to meet the needs of the renter were evident, with coffee provided, great beds and linens, ample outdoor seating, firepit firewood, a hammock, and privacy. Highly recommend."

We wish we would have had time to make a fire and enjoy the scenery more, but we got in late.
Dmitriy gave excellent directions to find the place. Check in was super easy and so was check out. We would definitely recommend to others and we would stay again."
