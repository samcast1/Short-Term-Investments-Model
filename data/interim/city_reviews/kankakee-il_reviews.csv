Stayed with kids","Our family of 5 had a wonderful stay there while we were in town to meet our new grandbaby. The first floor of the house perfectly met our needs. It's also very close to a bike trail along the river, which was enjoyed by several of our family members. We ate several meals there. The kitchen had everything we needed. It was a wonderful price for the space!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful and clean place to stay. Lovely kitchen, felt nice and cozy. Hot water never seemed to run out, basic seasonings as well as filtered water pitcher were extremely appreciated. Hollie was a pleasure to work with, very responsive and proactive to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The home also felt very secure which allowed for good sleep.
The only cons that we had is the flooring was incredibly squeaky everywhere, including the apartment above us, and the water pressure in the showers felt a bit weak but that could entirely just be personal preference.
TLDR: Would 100% stay here again."

Stayed one night","Hollie's place was comfortable with great beds and dark curtains as well as blinds, which in our opinion, should be mandatory at all Air bnb's! The place had all that we needed--the kitchen was a good size for the space, and had all that we needed to cook a large meal. The only downside (which was not Hollie's fault), was that the upstairs neighbors were not super considerate--loud music/voices/stomping around late at night. But the fans in the bedrooms did help mask some of the noise. Overall, a comfortable place to stay with much more room than a hotel! (And it only took us 5 minutes to get to ONU, which is what we were interested in). Good value and location. Thanks Hollie!"

Stayed a few nights","Our family (5) stayed at Lynn’s place while in town for a funeral. The temperatures were freezing. When we arrived last at night the outside lights were on and we were able to pull into the garage and unload the car. When we went inside the house was welcoming warm and cozy. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed, it was enough space for everyone and the beds were very comfy. I had to contact Lynn twice and she responded quickly and extremely professional on each matter.
Everyone said they had a great time at Lynn’s and she provided us with a safe, cozy and clean place for our family that lives so far apart to come together again and enjoy each other. I recommend Lynn’s place to anyone in town looking for a great place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","I would have loved to have given Lynn's place a higher rating, but a couple of things prevented me from doing so. The house was beautifully decorated, in a great location, and we loved being able to park in the garage. It was raining while we were there, but even so, there was a dehumidifier in the kitchen that was very loud, that ran constantly, and needed to be emptied twice a day. All of our things smelled very musty when we got home. Also, the second full bathroom faced out to the kitchen, with only a sliding barn door, and no way to latch it shut. It was practically unusable, with a 2 year old running around. One of the main reasons we chose this place was because it had two full bathrooms."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at Lynn’s house. The house was clean, and in a nice neighborhood. The rooms were a bit smaller than we expected , but the space worked for our family.
The kitchen was well stocked with all the cooking supplies we needed. 🙂
Lynn responded timely to any questions we asked her. Generously, Lynn gave us extra time for checkout as we had a later flight home.
We were disappointed to find several spiders near the front door of the home, during our stay. We ended up avoiding using the front door as our 5 year old granddaughter, who does not like spiders, was on vacation with us. (Maybe it is a Fall problem-it was late September?)
Overall, we were satisfied with our stay in Bradley at Lynn’s Airbnb. Thank you, Lynn!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed at Lynn's listing for multiple months. It is a lovely,
well-updated house in a quiet neighborhood not too far by car from the many attractions of Chicagoland. Lynn herself is friendly, attentive, reasonable, and respectful of your privacy (which is proven by the fact that I unfortunately missed meeting her in person, as though she made herself available it just never quite worked out).
The space is clean and well-stocked, and Lynn is a genuine local (her face is even up around town) who is always in the area if you need her. (She even brought us a whole grill, though we never got around to using it, so it's completely new for future occupants.)
Overall I highly recommend this listing if you're looking for a true full house (and it is, every part of it entirely to yourself, no shenanigans) in a good neighborhood. Lynn will make sure you are taken care of."

Please be advise there is no oven because it is a studio but there are other listings available that Hollie offers that does. We spent more time in Chicago which most attractions we visited are 1 hr away besides that we loved the location and it is worth the value. Loved the shower also! It is beautiful. Neighborhood was quiet at night there is train that comes through but in general it was very peaceful and quiet. Hope this helps!

Stayed one night","Hollie’s place was beautiful and clean exactly like the pictures displayed it. Unfortunately, the walls seemed paper thin and I was able to hear the tenants/renters in Unit 4 during my whole stay. I could hear their tv channel enough to know they were watching sports center. I could clearly hear the argument btwn 2 ppl at 0130. I could hear them snoring, and could also hear them “make up” after having an argument, and then another argument later that morning. The studio is also across the street from the train station, which also runs throughout the night.

The apartment was also set with everything you need for morning coffee and lots of pillows. There was Construction nearby which was a bit noisy but I’m very confident that’s a temporary thing and not the norm. Overall a delight"

All amenities and supplies needed for my stay were provided. The kitchen is well-stocked, the coffee nook with the Keurig machine was so cute and definitely something I used daily, the extra linens and bedding provided were warm and comfortable, and the shower was incredible. Hollie was very prompt to respond to any questions I had and made sure any request was accommodated. Overall great place, every detail was well-thought out and arranged, and I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Hollie's place was as described and had all of the new appointments you would expect. It is modern with exposed brick walls and brand new appliances. We have stayed at over two dozen AirBnBs and this one is in the top 5 for attractiveness, convenience and access to the downtown area. We did not have a car rather we walked along downtown and visited the French Heritage Museum, the Riverview Historic District and the Frank Lloyd Wright House. We found a cozy little wine bar to have dinner and unwind.
Hollie sent us a special code to unlock the doors about 45 minutes before our appointed check-in time. Once we were able to finally enter the building and the apartment it was an amazing find. Very chic and a lovely place in a completely renovated old factory building. The exposed brickwork and high ceilings made our little piece of heaven just perfect. There could have been a bit more acoustical privacy in the walls of adjoining units."

We were amazed by the level of detail the accommodation has. From charging cables for our devices to hygiene products and a fully stocked kitchen.
The accommodation was very clean and very well organized. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at Hollies AirBnb!"

Group trip","This place was perfect for our retreat. It was incredibly spacious such that everyone could have their own space. The outdoor areas were really enjoyable - the fire pit &wonderful grill.
A few pro tips -
1) while the house has wonderful natural lighting - the lack of curtains meant a very early wake up for all non basement bedrooms.
2) request extra towels - it was really hard to find any extra things - although the owner is very responsive. The place is just so big you have no hope of finding it.
3) highly recommend still bringing paper plates/etc. if you plan to cook a bunch."

We celebrated my mom's 75th birthday and Elianora went above and beyond by putting up a birthday sign and having a gift delivered to my mom while we were there. How sweet is that? It really touched us. We played pool, watched movies, listened to music, danced, made smores around the firepit, etc. My family and I had a wonderful time and will definitely go back.

Stayed with a pet","I had a few bumps staying at this airbnb (trouble with the lock to get in, carbon monoxide alarm going off during a hot shower even with door open and vent fan on, and the dryer not working) which made it shy of a 5 star experience for me. That being said, Ami was very responsive and the place was pristine clean. Typical amenities available but many more for those traveling with kids. I slept soundly through the night and was able to enjoy a nice dinner from a local restaurant in Bourbonnais."

Stayed one night","Our recent Airbnb experience was nothing short of a nightmare. After a grueling 10-hour drive, we arrived at the apartment only to find that there were already people living there. This was a clear indication that the host had not changed the lock after the previous guest, raising serious concerns about security and privacy. We also doubt whether the apartment had even been properly cleaned between guests.
To make matters worse, we were left stranded outside the apartment for over an hour, desperately waiting for a resolution. With no alternative, we were forced to find another stay in the middle of the night, adding unnecessary stress to an already exhausting journey.
We strongly advise against choosing this Airbnb. It was a highly disappointing and frustrating experience that left us feeling inconvenienced and deeply let down."

Stayed about a week","I enjoyed the stay! Clean place, plenty of towels and bedding to host a small family. Laundry room was very convenient, backyard was sizeable and nice! Too early in the year to eat of any fruits of the tree in the backyard, but I got my sun in. Low fencing around it doesn't provide for much privacy. Grill outside was not used, but if I ever stay here again- I will definitely use it! One note to host-please put more garbage bags for use. After I ran out of the first I used smaller plastic grocery bags for garbage. Otherwise, the rooms were comfortable and having a TV in each one of the rooms was great."

I have come so often that at the end of a lot of travel, I felt almost like I was going home when we headed over! I was pleasantly surprised to find that in the two weeks I’d been gone, Ami remodeled! There are nice new floors, a beautiful dining table and chairs, some new decorative touches, and a new high chair and pack n play. I also enjoy that Ami always leaves a variety of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate and also has bottled water waiting. Finally, travel with kids is easy here because of the fenced in backyard and close proximity to Perry Farm, where the little ones love the playground and Imagination Station."

The fenced backyard was perfect for our dog, and it was great to have a garage to park in. Ami was helpful and responded quickly to questions. From the Keurig machine and basket of snacks to the well-appointed kitchen and bathroom, this place is a little gem with lots of touches to make it feel home-y. Thanks, Ami!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home however very strict rules and owners like to assume things that are untrue. When it says no smoking apparently that means no where at all on property including outside. We advised that we would need the home to get ready for our wedding and after bridesmaids leaving their things at the house as we all walked out to go to the actual wedding I sent both of our mothers and my husband to collect the remaining items the next day, I was charged extra for to many cars leaving the home, 2 kegs that were never in the home or out of the back of a truck and had just come from the Charleston room from our reception the night before, cigarette butts on the ground outside. Cleaning the home completely including all counters and the inside of the fridge and following the rules including putting all bedding in the washer will not suffice and you will indeed incur additional charges for the owners sitting in the parking lot across the street from the home making assumptions as you are putting your things in the car. Cheaper to pay for a hotel and less likely to be stalked or charged extra for picking up cigarette butts or having your bridal party get dressed with you. I am beyond irritated to pay for a party I did not have nor any alcohol in the home as most people would do the night before but I will not allow anyone to say I owe anything. I was raised better than that. I would highly recommend not staying here if you are a smoker or intend on doing anything other than sitting on the couch watching tv. Thank goodness we did not attempt to use the bike in the garage. I can only imagine what the charge for that would have been."

Stayed a few nights","Just close enough to Kankakee, but isolated and private.
While it's very close to the highway (I-57), the only vehicle noise was from Otto Road (and that was negligible).
Cathy said we could explore the garden. It was early in the growing season, but we did grab a couple of leeks. If you're staying with Cathy come Aug/Sep, you're in for a real big treat.
Everything inside the unit was clean. The bed was very comfortable (we're very picky about that). Firm mattress, plenty of pillows.
The air conditioning is very capable.
I have already recommended this to my friends.
Some helpful info:
The water comes from a well, so you may want to bring a supply of bottled water for drinking, making coffee, etc.
The bed is upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs.
This is a wonderful place to stay, and Cathy is a model hostess. She was out of town during our stay, but she responded quickly. She had her husband and a friend stop by to check on us.
Thank you for a great hideaway!"

The downstairs is more limited in terms of space, and the collapsable sofa made for a good night's sleep for our son. The kitchen has excellent facilities: oven, stovetop and microwave, and has all the glassware, china and flatware we needed. We only stayed one night. The little farm loft is conveniently located near the interstate and is just a 10 minute drive from the center of Kankakee, which is a lovely town to visit. A short drive from the loft is a beautiful small river, and one can enjoy rich countryside at your doorstep. Cathy was a very responsive and helpful host, and we couldn't have been happier with our stay."

It was so cozy and warm and instantly felt like home when you walked in. It was very clean, full of amenities, great location and super close to all of the stores and restaurants you’d want to explore. It reminded me how much I missed home and why I will keep coming back to Ami’s place!"

The only thing that we had a problem with was the bathroom. I’m 5’9” and the sink hit me about mid thigh. It can’t be more than 3 feet tall. And if you are any taller, you’ll have to really stoop in the shower. The shower head is a bit low for me, but it had great water pressure. The king beds are also really soft. If you like soft beds, then these will be good for you. The queen bed was perfect for me. Lots of support. I would stay again if I’m through this area. The backyard was nice and the neighborhood was quiet."

Only problem we really had was after we checked out. We got a request to pay $500 for a smoking charge, NO smoking was done inside the house. Only smoking done was outside on the back patio. If you are a cannabis smoker and plan on staying here I suggest leaving your personal smoking belongings in your vehicle as the aroma can be quite strong."

Stayed with kids",Ami’s home is so thoughtfully set up and was so inviting. There are actually 3 bedrooms and the king bed is super comfy! My little one loved the aquarium scene on the tv when we arrived and the kitchen is full of cute little touches (like a small assortment of snacks and lighting under the plug points). The layout of the place is really convenient and there’s a garage to use as well! There are also family bicycles that we totally would have used if we were staying for longer! Very clean and enjoyable home.

Me and my children came into town to throw a babyshower and after a very Long stressful day, It was nice to come back to her home and relax in the backyard by the fire pit and water! The house was very clean and had everything one needs when traveling.. plenty of towels, rags, toiletries, utensils and the location was perfect only minutes from the stores and coffee shops!! We will definitely be back !!"

The fire pit and access to the Kankakee river was just icing on the cake! The home was clean smelled wonderful, and we appreciate all the blessings!
We have to visit the area several times throughout the year and with the single stay at Morgan‘s place. We have decided that this will be our home away from home when we’re in the area.
If you plan to stay in the Kankakee Illinois area, we cannot put into words how enjoyable you will find staying at Morgan‘s place it is a 20 on a scale from 1 to 10!"

Stayed with a pet","Very cool aesthetic of the home. Lovely kitchen, unique rooms, and decor with an older style. There were a few nails sticking out of doors and floor boards that we got our shirts and socks caught on. It was troublesome to get ahold of the host for check-in as he was unavailable and we had to wait almost 2 hours after our check-in time to get the code to get into the home. The ping-pong/air hockey room was really fun to hang out in and we appreciated that there was a heater in that room since it is a three season room. The couches in the the pictures were different than the actual couches. The couches were extremely uncomfortable to sit or sleep on since there was plywood under the cushions. The beds in the bedrooms were also not comfortable and felt cheap. We appreciated the paper towels and a few other essentials being in the home."

The pool looked clean (we did not use it), and the yard was neatly kept up with spaces to relax or eat. Robert was responsive and even dropped off extra blankets for us cold Texans. The house is of course old, and does make old house noises, as to be expected. The beds were a bit firmer for our tastes and I'd prefer some more pillow options. Overall, it was a great find and we would stay again if we were in the area."

This property made for an excellent extended weekend stay for my family of 4 (myself, my husband, and our 9-year old and teen daughters), our two dogs, and my 20-something sister. The fully-fenced backyard was beautifully landscaped, and the pool was wonderful! The house was equipped with everything we needed to feel at home, and had several grocery stores within a few minutes drive, making it easy to stock up on snacks and such. The enclosed sunroom off the garage had a ping pong table, TV, and plenty of seating, which was perfect for when the kids (and the dogs) wanted to get out of the pool for a bit, but still wanted to hang around outside. We felt like we truly lucked out finding such a great place in an unexpected area, and Rob was super friendly and in touch. Bonus points for letting our dogs go swimming with us!"

Group trip","My daughter was on leave from deployment overseas and we were looking for a fun get away that was nearby. We booked this place because according to the listing it has a pool table, ping pong table, 50 inch TV, fireplace, Keurig and enclosed patio. It is a beautiful home with fun, eclectic furniture, a great TV, beautiful fireplace; but there was no pool table, no access to the enclosed patio where the ping pong table was located, initially no Keurig coffee maker. Robert was very responsive to our concerns. A Keurig coffee maker was delivered the next morning. He said the pool table was in storage but that he would work on getting us access to the enclosed patio and ping pong table, but he also graciously gave us the option of being refunded for the rest of our stay. We chose to end our stay early. It was not what we expected, but Robert did what he could to accommodate us. This is a beautiful home that has great potential, probably more fun in the summer."

Stayed over a week","The Good - well-appointed and clean, good amount of space (not quite as much light as the pictures - could be the time of year). The Bad: There are 12-15 stairs up to this 2nd floor apartment that are NOT pictured. I had a very difficult time as the stairs are higher than they are deep (handrail is really wobbly too) and couldn't get my suitcase up ... just wish it had been clearly disclosed. I let the host know right away - who was lovely except for this - offered to get someone to bring up my suitcase (good, but doesn't help with groceries, etc) who then became insulting and rude when I asked for a partial fund for the 4 days that I had to move because of this. I let her and Airbnb know with 4 days to go - and asked for less than 3 days refund. It was a bad experience, and I will go back to hotels and property management companies for my work travel. I've never left a bad review - usually love my hosts and they have appreciated how well I take care of their properties."

Unfortunately our code would not work immediately to let us in. I was worried because it was late, but Hollie responded and took care of it right away for us. (Thank you, Hollie!) The home was cozy and clean. The property was clean and well cared for. The home worked out well for what we needed. Thank you Hollie for taking such great care of us during our stay.

There is so much attention to the small details that make a home, from flavored coffee, to washcloths for makeup, to tiny mint chocolates on the side tables. We stayed one night one our journey from the Foothills of Canada to North Carolina and were completely blown away. Clean, charming, beautifully decorated and exactly what we needed after 29 hours of driving fairly constantly. Location is also excellent with ample parking and walking distance to one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been too 'Pa-Chan-Ga.
I can not reccomend this place enough. and the little roll out bed was perfect for our 15 year old daughter.

Stayed a few nights","Here in Chicago area for work for a month. Couldn’t find a nice Airbnb on such short notice close to where I’m working so gave Hollie’s place a shot even though it’s a commute to where I am working. Booked it for a week thinking to get somewhere closer. Long story short, booked it the entire month.
Host always responded quickly. Place is immaculately clean and cute decor. Comfortable bed. Clean bathroom. Highly highly recommend."

Stayed one night","We enjoyed our stay at Hollie's place a lot! It was so cute and comfortable, and we had a great sister's weekend together. Hollie thought of everything to make our stay comfortable...extra things like a fan and makeup mirror.
We got there later in the evening, went to Chicago Pizza Dough Restaurant for dinner, (it is not far down the road from Hollie's place). It is very good food and such a great value! We then went back to the house to just hang out together or watch a movie. We left early the next morning to go to an event at ONU, which is only 5 min down the road from this place.
Thanks for hosting us Hollie! We will definitely be back!"

It was very clean and had thoughtful touches, like a bowl of snacks for kids, games, etc. We even had use of a garage to store our bikes (the only place out of all the places we stayed for 2 weeks). We slept well and the home-like atmosphere left us refreshed for another day of driving. Becky O."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I (and our two small dogs) felt right at home at ""Smitty's Place"", and if we come back to the area, we will check on the availability of this rental. The beds and couches were very comfortable, the kitchen was extremely clean and well stocked with things such as paper towels, napkins, and salt/pepper, the backyard was ideal for the dogs, and the bathroom had soap/shampoo, hand soap, and the faucets delivered superb water pressure. The towels were clean, and there were more available than we needed. This may sound funny, but there were no weird smells in the house, such as smoky/cooked food, which was another great first impression when we arrived. We could not have asked for a better experience!"

Stayed a few nights","We were very happy with our stay at Ami's place in Bourbonais. The house was located a few blocks from Olivet Nazarene University in a nice residential neighborhood. This was perfect because we were there visiting our son, who is a student. Ami's place was the perfect gathering spot to visit him for the first time in months. We loved it.
Aside from the perks of the location, the house was extremely clean and comfortable as well. We thought the beds were very comfortable, and we were able to get a good nights sleep there. The kitchen was clean and had everything we needed. We were also provided with towels, coffee, snacks, cold water, and it even had shampoo and body wash. Ami's place had everything covered.
Overall, I highly recommend Ami's place. When we go back, we will be reserving Ami's place without question. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very happy with our choice to stay at Ami's place. We were far more comfortable than we would have been at a hotel."

In a nice area. Ami was very easy to communicate with. We highly recommend this rental and in fact had the person we were there to visit come over and check it out so she can recommend it to all of her out-of-town guests. Thank you Ami for providing such a clean and comfortable home for our stay.

Stayed with kids","Ami’s house was so homey and perfect for our small family of 4. Communication was quick, the house was super clean (I had brought my cleaning by supplies just in case, but didn’t really need them!) and just cozy. Quiet neighborhood but still close to stores /restaurants. The only “issue” (which wasn’t too awful) was the bedrooms were a bit cold at night even with the heat on pretty high. We safe sleep with our infant so he doesn’t use any blankets so we were worried he’d be too cold. Ami was quick to respond to my text and suggested we close vents throughout the rest of house, which we did at night and it worked out great!
We would definitely stay again and didn’t want to leave!"

Stayed with kids","We will definately be renting from Ami again! She was extremely kind and helpful, always getting back to me within MINUTES of me sending her a message. I took my 2 young boys (6 and almost 2) to go visit my husband, their dad, who is working down there. We have always stayed in hotels in the past, but I wanted something a little more like ""home"", so hopefully our youngest would sleep (he doesnt sleep ANYWHERE but his crib). The house was very inviting, clean, comfortable, and felt like we were right at home! Our 2 year old slept thru the night, no issues! We will definately go through Ami again when he is back working down there! Ami really goes above and beyond to make this hiuse feel like home, right down to the little stuffed animals in the extra bedrooms (which my 6 year old cried over when it was time to leave, he didnt want to leave it behind). Thank you, again, Ami for a great, relaxing, comfortable weekend filled with family memories!"

Stayed a few nights","Ami's place exceeded my expectations. The location is very convenient. Minutes from ONU, down the street from Perry Farm (with its brand new park) and a children's museum, close to Kankakee State Park, there is a lot to do in this area. The home was very clean with everything I might need during my stay (shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, etc.). The rooms are well decorated with comfortable beds and plenty of extra bedding if needed. I really appreciated having a king size bed - something I don't usually see in other Airbnbs. The living room was comfortably furnished. The kitchen had everything I needed for cooking at home. The basket filled with snacks was a nice touch. The home was spotless when I arrived. In addition to a lovely home in a nice area, Ami and Steve's hospitality was unmatched. They were quick in responding to my questions and gracious in offering to help me with anything that I needed during my stay. I highly recommend staying in this, or any of Ami and Steve's Airbnb homes, if you are in the area."

Our only ""areas for improvement"" would be 1. there were about 25 or so tiny, confused ants roaming around in the bathroom, which was otherwise very clean and welcoming, 2. the sheets and comforter were clean but the comforter on the king bed had a scuff mark and the sheets on that bed had some faint yellow stains, and 3. perhaps the outside light could be kept on in case of late arrival, which we were! Thank you so much for the lovely accommodations on the way to our 2024 Total Eclipse viewing in Indianapolis!"

Stayed one night","10 Star Host - Excellent communication and directions. Spacious Apartment (Could do cart wheels in the kitchen). I saw reviews about how guests mentioned how comfy the beds were. They were UNDER rated. The linens and bed was awesome. Slept like babies. Being an apartment, you might expect some noise but not true. Not a peep. This was so convenient to where we were visiting and welcomed not having the hours drive home. Would definitely book again when in town."

We saw duplex style apartments, we were worried about possible noise but not once did we hear anything from anyone else! They allowed us to check in early and we were blown away by how nice this place was, definitely so when we compared the price. I would 100% recommend this place for anyone who needs a quiet, quaint place to stay. We couldn’t have found a better reservation, and the host(s) could not have been more supportive and helpful to a mistake that was made by us. If we ever come back to the area this will be where we stay."

Washer and dryer are a godsend for extended stays. We were able to walk right in and get started. Will definitely stay again when we’re back in the area. Many thanks, Lyle!"

Stayed one night","We stayed here one night while we were in town for a college visit to ONU. Great location if visiting the college or visiting someone who goes there. Host communicated clearly and quickly. Carpet in each bedroom was soft and seemed newer. Comfortable beds and pillows.
A honest note: This apartment could use a deep clean. Loads of dust behind the toilet on the baseboards, dust collected in fan on the bathroom ceiling and dirty kitchen floor. Lots of chipped paint on door frames and scuff marks on walls. One smoke detector wasn’t on the wall where it was supposed to be (I think it fell off and was never put back, because I saw it laying on top of the fridge)
Also, very ‘dirty’, stale food smell when we arrived at the apartment. I am guessing it was from someone else in the complex cooking, but you never want that to be your first impression when you arrive.
We have stayed in many AirB&Bs; and I have come to expect a sparkling clean experience. Disappointed this wasn’t like that."

Stayed a few nights","Bourbonnais is not a huge town and this rental is situated well in the middle of it to get to all the places. We were there for move-in at Olivet for 4 nights and the property was perfect for our needs. Super nice is that Kroger is just a few blocks away - walkable if you just want to pick up a few things. Plenty of dishes for a few meals, nicely appointed rooms with multiple pillows available. The property is older which means only one bathroom to share, but Lyle has done a great job of updating the inside. Perhaps the best amenity of this property is the lightening fast communication of Taylor - if you need anything, a quick message is sure to get a response. Over the next four years of college for our son, we wouldn't hesitate renting again."

We will be staying at this rental again when we travel back and forth to Missouri every other year. There is a young girl in the neighborhood likes to come and greet you when you arrive! She is also a joy to meet! I highly recommend this place!!"
