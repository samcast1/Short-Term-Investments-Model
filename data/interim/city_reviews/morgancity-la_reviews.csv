Stayed a few nights","Aina was a great host for our family! She has been very flexible and responsive: it was already late and we were struggling to find a place to sleep after some issues with our previous accomodation.
She accepted to host us on a last minute request, managed to offer us a warm, quiet and cosy place.
We stayed there for 4 days, we were 4 adults and 3 kids and it was absolutely perfect: enough room for everybody, games, kitchenware, etc.
We definitely recommend you to stay there, merci beaucoup!!"

Stayed a few nights","Where do I start? This is a gem when visiting the MC area. This is not just a “room”; it’s basically a cozy private apartment at the back of a historical home. Many original features such as glass doorknobs, original wood floors, original windows, high ceilings etc remain. The owner, Deborah, is a local with generations of family involvement and history in the community. I must mention the absolutely beautiful, massive oak tree outside your door. The perfect place to relax with a book, coffee, or wine, or in my case, observe the busy bird activity. Thanks Deb for the fun conversation and the delicious banana bread. I’ll see you next time!!"

The amenities were more than most rentals and our hostess thought of everything. The gift wrapped box of sweets and homemade fig bread gave a warm feeling of the holidays. The area is steeped in history and beautiful homes. We will definitely return!

She has gone above and beyond the normal expectations and my husband was beyond comfortable during his stay. The guest suite is clean and cozy. The decor has a cottage feel, warm and inviting. The oak tree in the sitting area is impressive. The neighborhood is quiet and has sidewalks for walking. The trains and church clock was not a bother to us at all. We could not have asked for anything more."

I didn’t damage anything, I kept her place clean and now she charging me unnecessarily $729 can you believe it. This lady is a scam. Please turn the other way. She shouldn’t be charging me for nothing. I left her place in perfect condition. She must be very greedy for money cause that it just ridiculous. DON’T BOOK HER PLACE. TRAVEL NURSES TURN AWAY."

Especially the bathroom it was so roomy. It has everything you needed and more. I loved being able to walk to downtown and the the river. Deborah was very friendly and knowledgeable in the area as well. I fell in love with the massive oak tree. So beautiful. French press coffee and amazing pastries was a delight walking in from afternoon adventures. Thank you for the Hospitality.

The light in the living room is lovely. I didn't explore Patterson because spent my time there working on some creative writing, but my friend spent her time geocaching in the area and enjoyed it. Jan was incredibly kind, even answering my questions while she was out of town. If you need a place to eat, try Si Senor in Morgan City."

Stayed a few nights","I will start with how reserved I am normally about recommending places but I have ZERO reservations about recommending Nineteen06 in Patterson, LA. My husband and I loved everything about it! The history is awe inspiring, the details are unbelievable, the place is clean, beautiful, fun, and amazing. We rented both units. I have a love of everything old and love repurposing so I just took it all in -- the downstairs dining table craftsmanship, the upstairs coffee table made from beams, the upstairs whiskey barrel used as an end table, the downstairs cable spool coffee table, the upstairs display of the old post office boxes, the list goes on and on!!! All of the furnishings and decor are spot on! We spent time outside in the courtyard and thoroughly enjoyed our private oasis! Loved the white bicycle, the cable spool tables, all of the beautiful succulent planters on the back patio. I loved looking at the beautiful Bayou Teche that I grew up on decades ago. This place is beyond fabulous! We are already hoping to return for our anniversary! Thank you Jan for allowing us to stay in your unforgettable Nineteen06!"

The deco used through out the space tells the history of not only the building it’s self but also the town it resides in.

Stayed over a week","There's so much good to say about this place, it's difficult to know where to begin or end. That said, so that I don't get carried away I'll try to stick with three aspects of this BnB that made my stay there an exemplary experience. However, I can assure the reader that there are many more reasons to stay here. Of all the BnBs I've stay at, this is the best so far!
For one, the space is beautifully designed and kept immaculate. From the flooring to the ceiling and everything in between including linens, the materials of this place are of the highest quality. Some of the materials are even reclaimed from nearby historical buildings. It seems there's a story behind a lot of the stuff you'll see in the BnB, and it's all been put together with taste.
Secondly, the location is ideal. There is a bayou right behind the building, and there is a park probably less than 100 feet away. In addition, there is a grocery store within a 10-minute walk through what looks to be the historic downtown district of Patterson.
Lastly, Jan and her husband have put a lot of effort into sharing their town with visitors. There is a lot of literature regarding local attractions at the entrance of the BnB, there are books about the area and the local landscape (e.g., the bayou Teche), and there are several pieces on the walls which depict the history and/or landscape of this part of the world.
I stayed here while in town for work, and I would love to come back. Highly recommended!"

I would defiantly recommend this place over all others as it was a better stay than some of the five star resorts I've been to. Not to mentions the most competitive price in the area. The attention to detail and passion for design and all things pretty was abundantly clear and made our stay something really special. It seriously couldn't get any easier than this.

We were so entertained just kayaking in Jan's backyard, we only left once to attend the Shrimp and Petroleum festiva; which was veryt delightful. We can't wait to return. Thank you Jan for sharing this very special place, The Nelsons, New Orleans,"

We weren't quite sure as we pulled in to such a tiny, quiet little town but Jan met us to let us in and the place was truly breath taking. Very clean, cute, quiet and romantic. There are so many unique touches that make the place so incredible. You won't be sorry if you choose this place. We stayed two nights and found plenty to do for the day and a half we were there. Jan has lots of brochures with suggestions. We were seriously sad to leave!! Loved our stay!"

She went above and beyond more than she ever had to do for us! This trip was a special Anniversary trip planned for my husband and I! It was planned as a total surprise to him as he only knew we were going away but had no idea where! I asked Mrs. Jan if she would set up our place for us with a special cake, roses and wine glasses and sparkling juice! She did amazing! It was so special and my husband was blown away! This trip although was cut short by a tropical storm was very special due to the place and Mrs. Jan!
Thank you sooooo much!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
We WILL go back and stay here again! Beautiful place for an excellent price!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I spontaneously wanted to go somewhere for our One Year Anniversary. Let me say we chose this place because we wanted to be near water and we wanted to feel Louisiana. We live in Oxford, MS.Nineteen 06 BnB is WELL WORTH the drive (6 hours for us). It looks out of a magazine. GORGEOUS. Offers: marble counters, self closing drawers, all necessary toiletries, dishes, pots/pans, down to the throw blankets and quips-- top of the line EVERYTHING. Also a super cute bottle collection. Old news paper articles and antique memorabilia throughout the apartment. the two queen beds have different mattresses to choose from. One is like Tempur-pedic and the other is more firm. We were looking for things to do and Ms. Jan and her husband told us about a few places including Jefferson Island, which we chose. (About 50 min drive) Rip Van Winkle Gardens was beautiful (sub tropical gardens) and j. Jeffersons home to tour. This is a long review because they are new to AirBnB and I want to cover as much as possible. Also personal dock immediately behind the apartment with a small town ""park"" nearby. Two miles from Walmart. Can not wait to go back. The hosts have thought of everything here. There is also washer/dryer. Oh PS don't bring your own pillow. You won't need it they have the BEST pillows and 8 pillows on each bed. PERFECT PLACE. Also the Cajun restaurant (probably walking distance ) was cute and had a separate bar area. Friendly staff. I think it was called boiling mad. And the homemade lemon biscotti was delicious and I've never even cared for lemon anything but I ate both of them ha! Wanted to go find the bakery and take some stuff home but never got the chance Can't wait to go back ! Thanks so much!"

Stayed with kids","We had the pleasure of staying here this past weekend. This rental is a hidden gem right on the Atchafalaya river. It's in the back of a small and very quiet RV park, but honestly, you feel like you are isolated from the world. The word WOW! could be heard all through the house as my family explored the space. It's very large, with 3 comfortable bedrooms. And the living space is huge, with cozy furniture, a large media center and a pool table.
You can tell right away that a lot of love went in to decorating and outfitting the house. Interesting artwork and furniture abound.
Love the kitchen! It's generously stocked with anything you need. You truly feel at home here.
But my favorite part is the deck. Enjoyed quiet mornings with my coffee watching the fascinating traffic on the river. From air boats all the way up to huge barges and tugboats. And a bald eagle flew right in front of us!
Yes, we definitely recommend this spot!"

Tugboats far out on the river push all manner of barges in both directions. Terns and Gulls cruise overhead. Sunsets turn the river to gold and the sunrises supply the best sweetener for a cup of coffee on the deck.

Despite being amongst other homes, it felt quite isolated. You had the sense of being 'away' but also the comfort of being close to whatever you needed.
The home was within walking distance of a town center that had some good restaurants and interesting places to visit.
My wife and I are looking forward to the next time we have an opportunity to stay at this home."

Sitting on the terrace in the evening and grilling was a dream.
Definitely should have mosquito spray with you ;)
The rooms were spacious and due to the 2 bathrooms and the guest toilet we didn't get in each other's way either.
The kitchen was huge and equipped with everything you could ever need. There were even some spices available - but we had bought everything. Also in the manual everything was perfectly described. Check-in was smooth, and Elizabeth is incredibly kind and helpful. If possible, I would also award 10 stars.
If we are in the area again, we would book the house again.

It is a drive from the city but if you need a place to escape for the weekend or a place to bond with your family, this is it! We came to choose this place because this was the closest to our family and friends. The best thing about this place is obviously the view, but also how clean, safe, secure, and quiet it is. Not anyone can enter this area unless you have the code. Our best memory here was feasting on crawfish on the patio along the river, which we definitely would definitely recommend doing (of course just clean after yourselves). If you’re in town or want a getaway, please give this place a visit!!"

Gorgeous, expansive views of the Atchafalaya River with plenty of room for family. The interior décor draws you into southeastern LA culture. It's right in the heart of downtown Morgan City, and just off Highway 90, so it's easy to get to. Elizabeth's communication was clear and welcoming and she was available to answer questions. We spent the weekend telling family in nearby Thibodaux that when they needed a quick weekend away, this was the spot to go to. If you're looking and it's available, jump on this one."

Stayed with kids","I went here with my family, we had close to 10 people and the place had enough beds for all. We wanted a quiet place for the weekend and this place provided that and more. The place has a giant deck with a great view—perfect seating area for sunsets/sunrises.
The house is inside an RV camping/fishing site. Very peaceful and quiet. Since we only stayed inside the house and did not venture out except for church, we didn’t interact with anyone.
Elizabeth was very communicative during our stay, usually responded within a few minutes."

Lance was a great host. The home is super clean and walking in the door was so refreshing you didn’t want to leave. He was so kind to give us a boat ride through the most beautiful waterways of Louisiana. If you like watching the alligators swim, or turtles sunning or go frogging at night, this is the place.
I want to thank Lance again, we will definitely be back."

We enjoyed the evening sun in the huge garden, which also has a several swings, the occasional squirrel showing off his acrobatic skills and a nice fireplace. It’s great value for money. The only thing we regret is having booked just one day, ‘cause this place is a gem. Highly recommend a stay."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed the house boat. Carrie was very clear that there would be bugs. And she was right. Outside was covered with live and dead ones. We did have some ants inside. But all part of the experience. The hot tub took a minute to figure out. It is not the one in the picture, nor is it the one in the link that shows you how to run it. It is inflatable. But was nice to sit up top looking at the water while soaking in the hot tub. Do be aware that there is a camera aimed right at the hot tub. We knew they had two cameras, but I would have liked to sit in the hot tub without feeling like I was being watched. Local people super friendly. A little hard to find something to eat close except the food truck that is only open on weekends.
All in all we want to return. It was exactly what we were looking for. A true 5 start experience."

The view from the back of the deck was beautiful. The houseboat was clean and bright, beds were comfortable and kitchen had what we needed. My husband even got to try the egg grill up on top!!

Outside of boat was filthy and we had to spend 1 hour washing away dried dead bugs and bird poop on boat, chairs and table. Hot tub was missing until they set up a blow-up hot-tub the next day. AC froze up the 1st night. We had to clean evaporator coil and thaw unit to get it working. Microwave, oven and refrigerator were dirty. Sugar ants were a constant problem in the kitchen. There was a leak in the ceiling above the living room and kitchen. Grill was dirty from previous guest. Kayaks were dirty with dry-rotted straps...we had to find rope to be able to secure the kayaks. Large rat living in the storage box on the upper deck where the life vests were stored. One working fishing pole but no tackle at all. They delivered 4 new small poles but still no tackle. Kitchen was functional but old and dirty cookware and minimal utensils. Old boat, needs a lot of work. Cannot recommend!!!!"

Stayed with kids","Taylor was super responsive and helpful! The remote area lends itself to card games and disconnecting. If you’re a light sleeper, bring a noise maker because the local bar is just down the road and the music can be heard from inside. The waves will gently rock you to sleep. I loved the privacy curtains to make the boat dark at night. The pictures might lend you to think you’re in the lap of luxury but remember you’re on the bayou and there are critters of various sizes. We spotted alligators swimming across the bayou when I went up right after waking up. We had a good stay and are thankful for the experience. It added to our overall trip!"

Stayed with kids","It was a good price and good for what my family needed it for, a family wedding in Patterson. We had 3 couples and 3 kids so needed 4 bedrooms and it was about half the price of 3 hotel rooms for 2-3 nights and allowed my 15 year old little dog as well. Charles was so nice and provided great instructions and always replied. The house is open, updated finishes but not upscale or overly decorated like a lot of airbnbs. Just casual with what you need for a couple days stay. The back yard was fenced so that was helpful with my dog. We were in and out several times and always easy to park and enter. Very convenient to Hwy 90. Thank you Charles!!"

The television options were great and several streaming platform options. The location felt safe and had easy access to the main roads. There were main cooking items available including spices, etc. We had a few minor things/issues. We were looking forward the the swing set but the fence was broken and the set was being used to prop it up. The king bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable in the master and the bathroom lighting switches do not work so had to unscrew the bulbs at night. The biggest complaint was the noisy AC unit. It cooled well but was VERY noisy and hard to hear the tv or a conversation. Overall a nice stay and the host even bought games which we used from the start."

Stayed with kids","This is an older, maintained home. It reminded me of my grandmother’s home. The rooms are small by today’s standards. The downstairs bedroom (which we used as the master) is quite small and only has a full-sized bed, which could be a problem if you are tall.
There are several small steps inside the house. Not an issue for us, but might be a concern for those with mobility concerns.
My son loved being able to fish off the dock. Finish poles and worms were provided on the back enclosed patio.
The house was clean and met our needs—nothing fancy. It was very close to our family in the area and local stores. Google maps led us there perfectly."

We had a great, relaxing weekend visiting with my parents, kids, and family. The girls caught 20+ fish, we watched the sunset while eating dinner on the back porch, and played UNO for hours. Next time we visit, I will try to book with him again!"

Group trip","Mr. Dudley's place was a nice get away for our family. We were celebrating an early Thanksgiving together and were looking for a simple getaway to spend some time together cooking, visiting and playing board games. This home fit the bill. The Bayou Teche was just a few steps away through the back yard. There is a family of ducks that call this place home and stay around the dock that is connected to the property. There were very beautiful Louisiana sunsets and sunrises that could be viewed from the private dock here. We watched a bunch of pelicans diving for fish while sitting on the screened in back patio, safe from the bugs in the area. Very cool sight to see. There is a young bald eagle that calls this area their home as well. Very cool experience watching them fly over the Bayou and dive down to catch a fish before flying back up into the tress not 75' from the edge of the back yard. Quaint stay that felt like walking into your own home when you arrive, with a beautiful back yard."

Group trip","It’s hard to locate
For people that live out of town.
I rented this house for my sister and her friends who attended a party I had. They were disappointed that they didn’t have any bath soap / coffee maker I asked ahead about was gross / one of the beds had a stain on the comforter/ some of the beds were missing top sheets and no additional blankets were available.
The owner said they had extra items in a closet but it was too late.
It’s a beautiful view but wish they had fire wood for the fire pit to enjoy it. Also the neighbors did have 3 small barking dogs, the owner should plant shrubs or install a privacy fence on that side.
It’s not a bad place to stay but the beds should be more adult friendly instead of full and twin size."

The place is located near my cousins place in Patterson who I was visiting. State Highway 90 is right out front of the place. The road noise was a little much for me. I recommend this place for the view of Bayou Teche and the convenience to attractions in Patterson and Morgan City.

Stayed a few nights","In regard to my veteran dog: This dog is a service animal and AirB does not require me to disclose that as a pet, as she is not a pet. She has a job to do.
This home, in regard to mess, was one to begin with. Dead roaches, up to 20 in the home, and a dead rat, which I was going to provide in my review however I declined to leave a review on this overpriced rental. Now I have the time for this BS.
The home was massively unequipped and the accuracy of our stay and the amenities was highly exaggerated. Still I had initially declined to review this home, just to be nice.
They charged us a total of 100 dollars for use of a kayak for about 1 day in total.
I will not be paying this 100 dollar fee worth of BS just because I had a service animal with me. This place is lucky enough to have people considering to stay in it, especially without roasting them on a review.
Beware, this is just another example of desperate people attempting to scrape by with any means necessary.
Never staying at this shiz hole again."

Stayed with kids","I must say that this place exceeded our expectations. We were behind in scheduling a place to stay while visiting family in the area, but I reached out to Ms. Aina and she was happy to accommodate my special request. This is very spacious. You enter into a living area (brown plaid sofa) with a TV and the small round table with two chairs. The hallway has the bedroom and bathroom off it. At the end of the hallway is a very spacious kitchen with all supplies needed. After the large dining table is the gray sleeper bed and a laundry area. The sleeper is not ideal for 2 adults but was okay for my MIL & tween. The sheets and towels = BEST I HAVE EVER TOUCHED (and I have stayed in some nice hotels).
The sunrise was stunning. My kids thoroughly enjoyed the games provided. The grounds were quiet except the roosters in the distance which I enjoyed while taking photos of the sunrise and peaceful sound of the frogs in the evening. One even greeted us on the patio, which my 9 yr old son enjoyed."

The listing was just as described. Very clean with simple and easy instructions, we never had any questions for the hosts but had the pleasure of meeting Heather on the day we left. At that time, she offered for us to stay on the dock and fish as long as we would like until it was time for the next guests.

The hot tub was a perfect addition (note that it is not attached to the guest house but is located in a small structure on the other side of the main house- three structures total).

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely delightful stay at this charming holiday house by the bayou. The cottage is cozy and well-appointed, boasting a spacious bathroom and a lovely kitchen equipped with everything you could possibly need. The living room is inviting, with a comfortable couch and a large television, perfect for winding down after a day of exploring. The bedroom is equally delightful, featuring another generously sized TV for added comfort.
The hosts were incredibly friendly and accommodating, making us feel right at home and truly welcomed. The picturesque garden and the breathtaking surroundings of the bayou added to the magic of our stay. Plus, it was a pleasant surprise that the Wi-Fi signal extended all the way down to the dock by the bayou, allowing us to enjoy the stunning views while staying connected.
We couldn’t have asked for a better getaway, and we wholeheartedly recommend this lovely retreat to anyone looking for a tranquil and rejuvenating escape."

Stayed a few nights","This place was absolutely perfect if you wanted a quiet getaway. We were able to cook all meals in the kitchen, and utilize the hot tub that was completely secluded and private. Additionally, the dock is a perfect place to read, or go fishing. The bathroom is one of the nicest I have ever seen in an Airbnb, and the overall space could easily fit six people with the couches, and air mattress. The Airbnb space is completely detached from the main owners house, so you have all the privacy you need. Additionally, there is Walmart just a few minutes away and the washer and dryer ensure that you have all the towels and things you need for your entire time there. The owner is also great at communicating, and was able to work with us when we had unexpected timing issues with check in and check out."

The apartment was exactly as described - clean, spacious and new! The backyard is very pretty, perfect to hang out and read a book. The hot tub made our evening extra relaxing. What really set this Airbnb apart, however, was the attention to detail and the personal touches that made our stay special. Heather went out of their way to provide us with recommendations for local activities. Make sure to ask about Captain Caviar for a guided tour in the Bayou, which starts only a minute away from the Airbnb.
Overall, we had an amazing experience at Heather's Airbnb and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and welcoming place to stay near the Bayou. We would definitively stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We met Mack personally but did not get to meet Heather (but wish we had)! Mack was THE nicest guy! He was kind and very responsive to any needs or requests. The space is very clean and new. They have done a wonderful job creating a comfortable oasis in the midst of a pretty busy area (there is a big parking lot and strip mall right across the street) and they have gone as far as to share their own, private back yard along the beautiful river for fishing, hot tubbing, and enjoying the scenery. The location can get loud (traffic on a major highway very near by) and there’s not really any privacy outside the cottage, but it’s nice and quiet inside at night and includes all the comforts of home. You really could not rent from nicer people. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and Heather’s place is by far our favorite! We went for a Valentine’s getaway following my mom’s memorial service and a really hard few months of life, and it was the most perfectly peaceful place ever. Being there literally feels like a sanctuary from life. Everything slows down and your heart just feels peace. The small details throughout really make it a special experience. Parking is very convenient. The huge bed is super comfy. The shower and water pressure are amazing. The smart TV’s are huge. The dimmable lights are awesome. The hot tub and bayou view are fantastic. The kitchen is thoughtfully stocked. The bath towels are a great quality. Heather is super fast to respond and beyond helpful! We recommend the burgers at Rita Mae’s, boiled seafood at Bayou Lagniappe, and shooting pool at Pool Do’s! We can’t wait for our next visit to Heather’s place!"

It was a very thoughtful and beautiful reconstruction of this rental property. Simple redesign and extremely comfortable. Big bed. Beautiful bathroom and shower. Great kitchen and lounging area. We had all we needed to cook, and there is even a grocery store right across the street (we forgot our wine bottle opener). The jacuzzi was awesome. Riverview was beautiful. Firepit was excellent. Felt secluded and private. Great private parking spot to just pull up, unload, and enjoy the place. Hosts were very accomodating but not intrusive. They really keep up the property as well. We will be going back for sure! Excellent price point for this stay as well. If you need a great and peaceful getaway, secure a few nights here."

I would definitely return for our next vacation.
Things to note, the guesthouse is in front of the main house so you will have to walk in front to access the fishing dock and the hot tub. The host made it clear that we were able to walk around and enjoy the property as if it was ours.
We had a great stay and would return for another vacation."

Group trip","The place was magical; everything was a visual masterpiece between the house, water, and swamp. We all loved the comfortable home, the vibe of the area and amenities, the dock, local bars on the water, the chorus of the swamps at night...I could go on and on.
Tammy was a delight to talk to. She knew the information I needed to maximize my group's experience. She seems passionate about the area and knows how to host with expert talent. You can not go wrong with this place, and you will be in great hands.
I would add a boat to your trip. It opens up the area, and if you have up to twelve people with you, it doesn't cost that much per person."

Group trip","This house was absolutely perfect for our little group of friends. Absolutely beautiful view on the water. The house was very clean. The location of the property is right in the middle between Pierre Part and Morgan City and very convenient. Our whole group absolutely loved it. If we're every in the area again, I'll definitely be looking at this one again."

Stayed about a week","The cottage was pretty isolated from anything other than the small market and very few restaurants, you had to travel at least half an hour to get anywhere. If you were only there to fish catfish with the hosts it was very convenient but we were looking for more. The pictures of the cottage give you the impression that the kitchen was attached to the living space but the bathroom, bedrooms and living room were upstairs and the kitchen was downstairs. It worked for us but we spent a lot of time traveling to get to any other activities. They also seem to still be living part time in the space, there was furniture you could not use because it was full of their items, drawers and the armoire, the freezer in the kitchen was being used to store frozen fish, which they offered to move but we didn't really need the freezer so it wasn't an issue, just surprising. A little bit dirty in the cupboards, we probably won't use again but more because of the location, needs a good spring cleaning."

I caught a few fish the morning we were leaving. I planned on taking the fish home with me and clean them at home. Mr. Allen offered to clean the fish for me. I attempted to give him a tip and was quickly turned down. This place is quiet and relaxing and we're already discussing our next trip. I plan on taking advantage of a jug line charter for some catfish. My wife can't stop raving about the balcony and the sunnrise's! AMAZING!"

It was the most relaxing and peaceful place I think I have ever visited. The Marroy Camp was the perfect place to stay. The view of the lake and sunrise at the camp are amazing. The people of Pierre Part are very friendly. Mr. Allen and Mrs. Toni were the friendliest and most welcoming hosts. They made our stay so enjoyable. Even with it being a holiday weekend, they gave so much of their time to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Mr. Allen took us on a swamp tour and fishing. He cooked the fish we caught. Mrs. Toni was so easy to work with and her communication made check-in and check-out a breeze. We can’t wait to go visit again!"

We watched the local swamp boats go out and come in since it's near a local boat ramp. The resident eagles and other wildlife are amazing. It's located close to many great restaurants and bars and we ate some wonderful cajun specialties. Our hosts, Toni and Allen, were so nice and we loved visiting with them and hearing local stories. We missed a swamp tour we had scheduled with Allen due to the weather, so that is our only disappointment. We definitely hope to stay there again and go on that tour with Allen."

Stayed a few nights","Except for a delay and mix-up trying to check in, my stay at Steamboat Inn was strangely pleasant. The place is a step back in time, which fit perfectly with my reason for being in the area: genealogy and historical research. The kitchen, living areas and bathrooms are normally shared, but in this case, I had the entire house to myself! Even if other people had been there, I don't think it would have mattered. It was just pleasant. The Hosts, Charles and Wesley, were very friendly, and Charles was helpful in my research. He went out of his way to show me an old wooded cemetery lot out in the sugarcane fields. The kitchen has no stove or oven, but it does have a hotplate, which was adequate for my needs. There was a television in my bedroom, but not all of the rooms have TV's in them. The room was clean, spacious and charming as was the entire house. If you don't mind sharing a bathroom, this is a great place to stay, and the price is right."

The house is very spacious and I had the entire place to myself for the two nights I stayed there. The room was cozy and welcoming, the bed was very comfortable, and the house was so amazingly decorated and beautiful that I had to spend a little bit of time in each room while working on my laptop. There's not a lot around except for the market and a little restaurant at the gas station down the road, but it was exactly what I needed to decompress from a few days in New Orleans. The place was easy to find and it was safe for me to park my car behind the Inn. I definitely recommend Charle's Inn if you want some country peaceful time at a historic place to enjoy."

Hence, I knew when I played my guitar on the second floor balcony that Huey (or was it Howie?) Long had given one of his impassioned speeches from that very same balcony years before, and undoubtedly to a considerably larger crowd. However, even though I had the entire place to myself for two days and nights, not a single ghost or strange sound intruded on my solitude, not even the lady in blue. Oh well..."

Stayed a few nights","Guys i tell u what u what the kennedy house in Centerville,la. Its a must visit this place has been around for ever and with that its has its history. I was looking for a place to sleep because i was in town for work related reason only so a friend was suggested that i should get a airbnb so i did and i saw there was a place in town so i gave it a shot.most of the time when i travel i like to be close to the job im working on ,and most time it usually be a ran down motel . I tell u what i got to the place and i was greeted with the with the up most respect and hospitality u know the southern way. My two days i was i never felt so comfortable with open arms.The teo i guys i met was telling me the history of the place which history catches my attention,keep in mind that i was especting a ran down motel because i travel alot. And after they ran down the history about the place they gave me a field trip about the place and and every corner and details about what guest came there and what what took place in the house like in the last 200 years no kidding,the place is like a musem more then like a place with just some house with bedrooms in it and me on the hand ,i come from a 300 year ole city thats has alot to see with its rich istories and historical areas. So i really wasnt looking for a history lesson ,i ws just looking for a comfortable bed to lay in and a piece of mind ,i mean thats was in the back of mind head. So the tour went on and realized what i got myself into this plac is amazing every corner of the house has a story and a meaning to it now it's getting interesting. So when the tour was over they telling me places where i need to go check out and visit while im in town they put the key in my hand and said i hope u enjoyed the place. And they left. Ok!!!! all i can say history comes back to the place not in a bad way but, not in a bad way ,lets just say u can feel the present of history in the house u know what i mean the place demands your attention .its a must u visit and check out the area and also also never been so welcome in my life satisfaction of a place like this its a privilege. The host is down to earth and straight forward and accepting and willing to ask any question u might want to ask pretty cool i think , but anyway i can go on forever about the place,looking forward of going back to the place and soon im looking forward to read some of you guys comments after u visit the Kennedy house in Centerville, la.and read the what u like about the place. Thank u Mr. Charles for the genuine soutern hospitality and i value that 👌 ohh yeah p.s. i also enjoyed the balcony and the patio its perfect and pieceful"

Stayed over a week","After staying at the area hotels for work travel, I decided to venture out to the small town feels of staying at a privately owned place, and I am very happy I took the leap. Charles (and Wes) has a lovely, historic Inn with furnishings that give the feel and comfort of the South, personal art and decorations with stories to tell, and so many seating spaces to compliment your mood for the moments. I enjoyed my breakfast on the balcony watching cars pass below on Main Street, took sips of my Sazerac(s) seated in the front porch giving waves to locals, and grilled cajun sausages out back where there is a wrap-around porch with several settings for people with bistro tables, chairs and built-in benches. There is a very conveniently located Centerville Market next door with good choices of meats, veggies, drinks, snacks. I run regularly and ran East along mostly quiet LA-182 (Main Street). Charles introduced me to delicious meals in Franklin, at the Forest Restaurant (had fried crawfish and crawfish etoufee) and Guadalajara Mexican Grill (had camarones a la diabla). I will miss this home-away-from-home, and will definitely come back again."

Stayed one night","What an awesome stay!!! This was one of the best AirBnBs I've ever visited. I was looking for a place in the countryside to stay during the weekend to get some work done and to discover a bit of Louisiana. I couldn't have chosen better! The house is a gem and it is located in a picturesque little town with plenty of history at every corner. Charles was an awesome host and he was so kind to show me around, tell me the history of the region, its culture, cuisine and nature. This was truly like a crash course in Louisiana!! The house itself is enormously big and wonderfully decorated. If you're into historical vibes and Southern stuff, it's the place to go. It's perfect as both a getaway destination to chill or work remotely, and as a place to hang out with friends while enjoying cool vibes. There's a lot of nature in the area with some really pretty bayous. If you're looking for an authentic Louisiana experience, don't look any further. I highly recommend this stay & I'm definitely going to come again! Thanks Charles."
