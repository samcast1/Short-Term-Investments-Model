Stayed with kids","Overall we had a great experience.
The apartment has two spacious bedrooms and two full baths as listed. It was pristine and looks exactly as pictured. The apartment is located on the first floor of a traditional Philly row house and centrally located to iconic spots downtown.
One thing newcomers to Philly have to learn is that south Philly is 90% single lane one way streets. Once you get used to it, it is a cinch. Parking was really easy as long as it was before 9pm.
The neighborhood is amazing. Little did I know that 9th street is a culinary haven. We were only three blocks from Pats king of steaks (invented the Philly cheesesteak) and rivals Gino’s. There are a number of other walkable restaurants of mainly Italian and Mexican cuisine as well.
A 24 hr CVS and a full supermarket are 2 minutes away on foot.
Throughout our stay, our host was very responsive and friendly with any issues that arose. Michael and Blessing made great effort to answer all my questions and concerns."

Stayed with kids","This house was really cool - we loved the decorations and furnishings. The location is fantastic - just a few blocks from the Broad Street line and close to the Italian Market. The street itself feels like a little hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. This is definitely an older home - the stairs are steep (the kids were careful and navigated them just fine) and there are some gaps in the (gorgeous) wood planks, but this was not an issue for us. The double bed is very firm and the pillows are very soft - to each their own on things like that so it's not a complaint, but a heads up. In addition, this house was **spotless**. Kudos to the people who take care of this home. We did not use the kitchen to cook but it seemed to have all of the required amenities. All in all, a very nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","Amalia's East Passyunk Rowhome really lived up to the description, it was super charming and very comfortable. The decor is beautiful, very welcoming, with lots of lovely antiques. The outdoor space was especially lovely, with a huge old tree and greenery and nice outdoor furniture. The beds were very comfortable. Everything was great! Communication and checking in and out was easy. It's in a nice dead end street near good restaurants and shopping. Truly a good find!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was a great location for our weekend of South Philadelphia eateries, bars and sports, celebrating my husband's bday. We were able to walk to most locations and the on-street parking was great. We even walked home from Citizen Bank Park, with two pub stops along the way.
The house is very cute and the beds were very comfortable. The outside patio was most pleasant.
Our only concern as older people (75+) was the narrow tread on parts of the stairs and the height of the claw foot tub/shower. This is really a matter of confidence and stability so something to consider."

Stayed with kids","Amalia was a great host, and her place was in a great location for easy travel around the city. reAnimator coffee is just down the street and the local spot for Vietnamese cuisine, pho 75, is nearby. As others have mentioned, the staircase is narrow at parts, but manageable. We stayed with our 2 kids, and they did just fine. We had an issue with the Keurig machine (which might be resolved by the time of your stay) but opted for the coffee down the street. Amalia is very responsive and amiable if you have any questions or needs."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is very quaint, charming, and aesthetically-pleasing. It's located on a quiet, small street without much traffic or noise, but it's still near a subway station and main road for easy access to Center City. There are shops and restaurants within walking distance as well.
It was easy to check in and out. The beds and rooms are comfortable and well-furnished. We especially enjoyed spending time in the cozy living room.
Just be aware that you have to be open to the quirks of an old house (steep stairs, creaky floors, vintage stovetop). There's also no microwave, but there is a toaster oven.
We enjoyed our stay at this sweet Airbnb and would recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","Location is perfect, right in the middle of Passyunk/South Philly area - super easy to walk to Passyunk Ave or Italian Markets areas, right next to the subway if you wanted to take that and an easy rideshare to most other areas of the city.
The place itself was great too, it was just my wife and I and we found it had everything we needed. Very cute, would have loved to be there to use the patio/garden in the summer. Was slightly chilly when we arrived but thermostat was easy to use and we quickly warmed up"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this Airbnb was a delightful blend of historic charm and a few safety concerns. The home's ambiance was cozy and welcoming, and its location was convenient for exploring the area. The decor added to the experience, with intriguing elements that sparked our curiosity.
While we appreciate the importance of preserving historic properties, we couldn't ignore the structural issues we encountered. Holes in the floors, sagging floors hidden under rugs, and wobbly stairs raised safety concerns. The kitchen floor near the stove was particularly alarming, with boards that seemed ready to give way. Cleanliness standards could be a spot better, with noticeable lip marks on cups and neglected shower areas.
While we appreciate the charm of the home, we hope the hosts to prioritize addressing these safety and cleanliness issues for the comfort and safety of future guests. Thank you to the host, they were very helpful with local suggestions and proactive!"

Stayed a few nights","Very nice home, great location and just as described. House was charming and very clean. I was concerned with the firmness of the mattress at first, but it was wonderful, didn't wake up once and woke up with less stiffness than I have in my own bed. It is located on a quiet residential street with a school close by. There is a nice coffee house located within walking distance. The stairs in the home are steep and winding. I think it would be difficult for those with mobility issues but adds character to the home. The bathroom also has a deep tub you have to step into with a shower. Parking is tight as with any city parking. Amalia's home instructions were clear and detailed, we had no issues finding or getting into the home. She was very responsive and quickly answered a question before my arrival. We were very happy with the home."

Stayed a few nights","My friend and I had a wonderful stay! Very cozy space and the house has such unique character that I don’t usually care for as a modern-design-loving girlie, but really did appreciate. Aspects of my stay I did not expect and are things to consider:
Parking was ATROCIOUS 😩 And this is coming from a New Yorker. I was so glad my friend came along with me and could get out the car to make sure all was well while attempting to park. Those narrow 1- way streets were the worsttt - please try to avoid parking on those streets if you’re not comfortable or used to parking with very little roadspace to work with to get into the spot.
The beds were extra firm. I hopped onto the bed thinking it would be nice and bouncy like I’m used to at home, but no - Still had a good night’s sleep but just something to consider. Also I thought one of the double doors in the kitchen was a cabinet but apparently it’s a pretty creepy looking entrance to the basement so don’t open that 😅 STILL - GREAT STAY!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is adorable!
The decor is so fun.
Great kitchen, looking out into the garden, perfect for dining or working.
I was glad there was a washer and dryer available; although the dryer wasn't working, bummer, BUT there was a fun antique drying rack which we used instead.
The beds were comfy and we slept well.
The place has idiosyncrasies, it's quite compact--which goes with the territory for such an old home. The winding stairway to the 2nd floor may not be for everyone.
To me, it felt almost like time-traveling, with the retro decor and wooden floors.
The location is fabulous, a quiet street that's centrally located. We even found easy street parking and we didn't get a ticket, despite leaving the car all day (lucky us!).
I highly recommend Amalia's rowhome!"

Parking have to be paid for but for three hours $3.40. Which isn't a bad price at all. I basically paid $12 to park on the street all day (download meterUP app).

Stayed a few nights","What a great stay in such a beautiful neighborhood! Jeffrey was an excellent host. He responded very quickly when I requested to stay in his home, and he even contacted ahead to let me know I could check in earlier than the check in time. Very much appreciated.
The home looked as described in the posting and met all my expectations. My girlfriend also joined me and she loved this place as well. Very clean and comfortable. We both enjoyed waking up in the first bedroom to the skyline of the city.
If you stay here any time soon, this neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous to walk around in. From all the fall colors, Christmas decorations, and local shops, it will get anyone in the holiday spirit.
I look forward to visiting Philly again, and would not hesitate to stay with Jeffrey again! Very thankful for this excellent experience."

Stayed one night","Jeffreys home was great for the price. Jeffrey was super flexible with checking in. Jeff’s home was perfect except walking up those stairs but looks like Philly homes are all developed that way (Arizona born and raised, so we’re used to one story homes) I loved the fact that Jeffrey had board games for the family, the house was super clean. I would highly rebook this home in the future. Parking was an ease as there was curbside parking in front of the home. There’s a pub right next door to this home! Jeff was in control of the AC Unit/Heater but with a quick message to Jeff he was very fast to adjust the AC/Heater to whatever we wanted."

Stayed a few nights","I liked the central location of this place downtown, the fact that I was able to check in so late (8pm), and how clear the whole process was! The individual rooms are more like a walk-in closet than a whole bedroom. It is more of a dorm or hostel vibe, with two shared bathrooms. For the price, quite affordable, clean, and clear instruction - I just wish I had read the description a bit closer and knew the vibe a bit more before booking. Otherwise, I'd have given 5 stars!"

Stayed a few nights","This was one of the most beautiful airbnbs I've stayed at and it was absolutely immaculate--so clean and lovely. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it wasn't possible to control the temperature and there wasn't a window in the room--bit disorienting and hard to wake up. The temp was great in the shared space of the apartment but the room was quite hot. All in all though, I'd say it's great value for money, especially for the location--can't beat the proximity to reading terminal and the convention center."

It is also within walking distance of many of Philadelphia’s sights; there is a lot to do/ see/ and eat in the surrounding area.
The space was very well maintained and clean- in part because of the clear rules that all guests do their part in cleaning up after themselves."

There are restaurants nearby (including late night pizza by the slice less than a 5-minute walk!), and within a 15-20 minute walk of many sights and activites. Easy to get Uber for things like the Art Museum, the airport, or if the weather isn’t conductive to walking. Never felt unsafe or nervous, even when walking after dark, which I did one night all the way back from Logan Square. This is a gem in Philly, and I can’t wait to stay here again on my next trip up!"

But Food, medicine, and night life were all just a few blocks away and some spots were even right outside the building. Jesse is also a great host! He let me check in early since my flight landed in the morning, made sure everything was good even after check in, and let me stay a little late so I didn’t have to sit in an airport for 5 hours. 11/10"

If you are very tall or fairly round in size, the shower might be a challenge, but that’s not a complaint…just a heads up. I would definitely stay again. Jesse is direct, efficient and precise in the way a host should be or at least I appreciate that. There are thoughtful things in the room for comfort and ease. So many things are within walking distance. Another heads up…Parking on the street is difficult, but not impossible. The meters are a good price once you find a spot. All in all Jesse’s place is really cool, very cozy and comfy."

(Though smaller people will feel more comfortable here, with the close quarters and twin-size bed.) I would probably not want to stay more than a week here, just due to its size. Jesse was a great host though!"

Stayed a few nights","Jesse was a lovely host. Very responsive and attentive. Thank you so much Jesse! The room is nice and just as in picture. The location is great - quiet and beautiful, close to everything I needed.
A few things I found more challenging:
1) The air conditioner is actually a cooling unit – not quite the same in terms of temperature and noise. In fact, it is a VERY noisy instrument located just near the bed-head, with no ability to control the fan’s intensity.
2) There is only one cup (!) in the room, one fork, and one knife. There are no plates, no bowls, no cups for cold water. It is impossible to wash the one and only cup as there is no dishwashing pad. Even for a single guest it would be nice to have more than one piece of each.
3) Note that the shower is very small, so bigger people might find it challenging to take a shower. Also the water flow is not a strong one.
Having said all that, I do recommend Jesse’s apartment and will be happy to stay there again"

Check-in was a breeze, thanks to Jesse's clear and easy-to-follow instructions. It may be a small place, but Jesse has done a remarkable job of organizing the space efficiently. I had everything I needed, and the room was neat and tidy. A hairdryer, iron, and clothes hangers are ready for us to use. The bathroom was clean, and the shower had great water pressure.

He responded to a last-minute booking request very quickly and put my mind at ease that I would have a safe and pleasant stay. This apartment is in a great location with lots of activity going on nearby, but the building itself was calm and quiet.
This particular apartment might not be for everyone as there is not a ton of space to move around and it's a tight squeeze to get around furniture into the back of the unit where the bathroom is. That being said, Jesse has done a great job stacking the room with every creature comfort you could ask for. I would recommend this room to anyone and highly recommend it for people who are just looking for a place to sleep for the night and don't anticipate spending a ton of time in the room."

The neighborhood is incredibly beautiful, many food shops and very green. Also very central, just like discribed.
I sadly had an accident and had to spend my stay entirely in the room but Jesse went out of his way to help me with food delivery and my suitcase.
He is a wonderful host and I hope to get to stay again when I am back in Philadelphia again. I yet have to see the city after all."

Stayed a few nights","This place is absolutely perfect for a solo traveler looking for a comfortable twin bed and a clean tiny “pod-like” room in a safe residential area close to everything. I walked around at night without ever feeling unsafe and I saw many others doing the same. Jesse is an extraordinary host who has maximized the space available, he is always responds to texts promptly, and he was generously flexible with my check-in and out times. He rents this place for the same price as a private room elsewhere but this one alone has a private bathroom. Keurig, microwave, and fridge were all appreciated too. One word of warning for those who are sensitive to AC air blowing towards the bed: the unit cannot be redirected, so if you don’t feeling cold air throughout the night, do not come in the middle of a heat wave. But I did not need it for more than an hour or two at the time, as the small space cools very quickly. I will definitely try to book this place again next time I travel to Philly on my own."

There's definitely some neighbors who don't shy away from slamming doors, and the wifi could get a bit spotty, but for downtown in a major city it was great value.
Jesse is a great host and very responsive! He's done a brilliant job of making good use of a small space. It may not be the best choice for folks who are taller, wider, or differently abled than average, but generally I thought it was perfect for a solo traveler!"

During our first rainy weekend rats 🐀 invaded the apartment - not only the kitchen downstairs, but they also managed to open our sealed chocolate upstairs - and yes, our food was still packaged.
Hosts said they would send an exterminator, but he was only available two nights after, as this was no option for us, we had to cancel our stay. The apartment was put for rental again on the next day, I guess in the end its all about the money 💵"

A couple considerations- the back outside area could be cleaned up and trash removed. A critter was heard rustling around near the door near the bed one night. Decor/aesthetics could use a facelift. And cleaning could be a little better. Otherwise, a great place! Well described and comfortable. Perfect for the weekend."

The kitchen and washer & dryer are downstairs and accessible by a narrow spiral staircase. Being 6' 3' it was challenging at first but was ultimately fine. .

Place was very clean, little dirt throughout kitchen and bathroom sink could’ve been cleaner but 100% would stay again, comfortable, safe and walkable location, and again they were very responsive.

Stayed a few nights","Overpriced for the quality of the unit. Rob & Kyle were very nice, responsive and communicative which we appreciated and their space was in a very convenient location. But...the unit itself felt cheaply appointed regarding the kitchen and bathroom. The bathroom mirror was so high up that neither my husband or I could see ourselves. The shower was tiny. The kitchen didn't have a lot of the tools that our other Air Bnb's usually had. It had a weird way to access the kitchen, either by a very steep steel spiral staircase or you could enter it from outside your unit via the joint hallway. There was also nowhere to hang your things such as my husband's jacket and my dresses. Finally, when we first arrived, I sat not the end of the bed to put on my shoes and the mattress fell down since the slats came out. I reported this to Rob & Kyle and they were very responsive. They replaced the mattress, but didn't have boxsprings so we slept on a mattress on the floor-not ideal."

Stayed with kids","We chose this property for our trip to Philadelphia due to the location, reviews, and also the host's description regarding the cleanliness of the apartment. The reviews were all mostly good and unfortunately at the time of my booking, the last review that mentioned the dog hair had not been posted yet. The condition of this property was very disappointing in regards to cleanliness. There was dog hair everywhere (except the bed thank goodness). The apartment overall had a dingy and bad smell. The bathroom was also full of hair and with gunky, grime around the edges of the shower and toilet. The kitchen floor was sticky and both the microwave and refrigerator were dirty with food residue and hair in the refrigerator. I reached out to the hosts to allow them the opportunity to make things right. I sent them a message detailing my concerns and accompanied by multiple pictures showing the condition of the apartment. They said that the apartment had been rented for a month by a single guest who had left the place in really bad shape. They apologized for the condition of the apartment but offered us nothing in the way of compensation. They did state that they would be willing to give us a discount on our next stay. I found this to be unacceptable since the condition of the apartment had had such a negative impact on our stay, making us very uncomfortable, and the fact that we obviously did not get what we paid for and not what the listing stated. After pushing back, they finally offered us our cleaning deposit back but refused to reimburse us anything on our stay. As hosts ourselves, we completely understand that things happen; sometimes the cleaning crew does not do an acceptable job or something is overlooked. I really wanted to give them the opportunity to make things right but unfortunately they chose to act generally aloof to my concerns and offer the bare minimum in compensation. Your guest's experience should be your number one concern and when that falls short, I believe you offer your guests compensation and make an effort to make things right. Unfortunately that was not our experience. I also noticed that they waited until after I complained and pushed back on the refund that they wrote my guest review. It is really disappointing and unfortunate because the apartment otherwise is a gem! The location is so amazing! I would have loved to go back and stay here again. Hopefully they can fix their cleaning problem and others will be able to enjoy this place."

Stayed a few nights","On the plus side, the location is excellent, in a nice neighborhood very centrally located.
The kitchen as well stocked, and the Netflix, and Amazon prime, were great additions in the evenings.
Rob and Kyle were very responsive if I needed to communicate with them.
Having a dishwasher, washer, and dryer, was a big bonus.
On the downside though…
Parking was a problem, but it is everywhere in Philly.
That spiral staircase is very very narrow and steep. Difficult to carry food and drinks up and down.
if there are people staying in the upstairs unit noise can be quite an issue.
Cleaning could be more thorough. There’s a bit of dog here in the corner is everywhere and on the stairway."

Stayed a few nights","Recently had a stay in Philly for what turned out to be a really cold week with the exception of 1 weird day that felt like spring. The heating system, and the electric fireplace really held its own keeping this studio warm. The blue spiral staircase allowing you to connect with the basement level kitchen and laundry room, is the narrowest spiral I've ever tried, and I have been to Paris.
The oven/stove is electric, the washer and dryer are full sized units, your group is somehow 4+ people in this studio these units are well more than enough.
The bed, if you like soft you'll fancy this mattress but I am in need of something more firm.
Check in was easy via the touchpad lock at the exterior door, leading you into a brief, brightly naturally lit during the day and abundantly lit with lights at night hallway that looks recently renovated by way of final cleanup of grout and paint not yet being fully done.
The apt is a door to the left, also with a touchpad. This door has glass panes at the top, so if the effort was made one can peer into the apt, just fyi regarding privacy.
Anytime someone in the apts above flush their toilet, your toilet will burp. You will hear it and your toiletbowls water will flare up, so if you happen to be sitting on your toilet you're going to possibly get some collateral damage.
The living space has a very firm, contemporary couch with two windows having solid light blocking drapes. As this is a near street level studio without blinds only the drapes, you either use the drapes for privacy but get zero natural light, or get the natural light but don't get privacy from foot traffic, you can't have both.
The place is near an intersection with a city bus line and steady vehicular traffic through one way streets, generally posed no problem during my stay as there was zero aggravated drivers. At night the area is generally quiet with occasional pedestrians heading home, or walking their dogs, getting their street parked cars, etc.
Did notice one week night, around near midnight, one guy in a hoodie circling a few times from a block away, passing across the street in the windows view a few times, looking walking through and past, but when a single woman passed him, he spent the time to walk back to the street she cut into, the alleyway street, watching where she headed to and he walked quickly to the intersection corner to turn up the same direction she was going. 5 min later from that, he came back, resumed his looking around.
WIFI worked really well during my work hours, as this is a studio w/o a dedicated workspace, the couch and immediate coffee table made do. TV w/ fireTV and provided netflix account.
The location was extremely walkable and I took full advantage of that to not only get food but so as to burn off the food of Philly.
Hosts were always avail to answer my questions leading up to my visit. The studio is well equipped, though I could not find a oven mitt once I realized I needed one to take out some reheated pizza.
Thanks for having me and I will keep this place into consideration in the future."

This is one stay where the actual space was MUCH nicer than pictured. Tip for parking, I found the signs confusing and depending on when you arrive parking can be tight. If you want to be conservative about leaving your car parked/unmoved for days (as I did) use spot hero and get a garage spot. I left my car parked in a secure, indoor, covered garage for three days for $40. Rob and Kyle are there if you need anything!"

The host checked in several times to make sure check-in went smooth and to send links for local restaurants/activities. There is CVS and 7-11 at the end of the block for convenience items if needed.

Stayed over a week","Location
The location is perfect for sightseeing and night life. Because the apartment is central in Old City, it's a short walk to several historical sites and museums. Also, the apartment is very close to Penn's Landing so it was easy to run to the dock and get down to the river for runs (or walks). It's also just a short job over to the Ben Franklin bridge to walk or run across to NJ. The apartment is very close to night life. There are several restaurants and bars about a block away. Grocery stores are nearby, within walking distance. I felt safe in the apartment and in the area.
The apartment was clean and cute. I stayed for a month working nearby during the daytime. It was perfect for 1-2 people. The building is pretty quiet, too. I cooked several times a week, and the kitchen was adequately stocked (I did buy some foil dishes for the oven). The view is excellent. I got to do yoga in the mornings looking at the Christ Church steeple.
Strong recommend!!"

Stayed a few nights","I’m so glad I stayed here. The location is ideal, so I'll add a few details about features I appreciated: The apartment was spotless and welcoming. There are a variety of pillows, from firm to soft, as well as black-out curtains. The bed was comfortable and my son slept well on the sofa bed. There is some street noise, but I was in Philly for a conference and was able to work a lot in the evenings - the internet is fast and the building is quiet. I walked to the conference in central Philly, although I could’ve easily taken the subway. But I loved being in the Old City, particularly for the atmosphere. In addition, it is easy to get to the Amtrak station, and you can walk or take the subway to a Megabus stop. You can take public transportation to and from the airport, but I don’t think it’s worth the savings over a taxi or Uber, since the latter are much quicker. Finally, Patty's instructions and guides were thoughtful and informative, and she is super responsive. Highly recommend!"

Great running just south on spruce street takes you all the way to the unpronounceable river to the west. I used white noise while sleeping and never had any problems with outside noise. Half the price of weekend rates of the reputable hotels in the area."

Cooked a couple of meals as well as eating out.

From the moment of booking to check-out this was a great (faultless) experience. A quick response was followed up by lots of advice on where to eat, shop, visit. Check-in instructions were clear and simple... and then you walk into a wonderful apartment (the photos really don't lie, it's fantastic!) I already knew the area, as I've visited Philly before, so I knew it was in a lovely part of Olde City. The location is really convenient for so many attractions, and also for transport links, so it's a perfect base from which to explore.
All in all a truly great stay... so a big THANKS to Patty for the hospitality, and here's looking forward to another visit sometime soon!
Thanks for everything, Gav & Ali X"

Patty is a gracious and well prepared host. She sent plenty of electronic information prior to our arrival and was always available for assistance during our stay. The unit is very clean. The shower was just right, and both the bed and the couch were comfortable for sleeping. The kitchen is well stocked, but we didn't use it because there were too many good restaurants to try! We particularly enjoyed OH BROTHER for cheesesteaks, Vanderwende for ice cream, and Eggselent for breakfast. We didn't get to try it, but Amada (tapas) was recommended, too! We loved being in walking distance of the water. The PHLASH bus (and many more) stop right on the corner. Drivers were super friendly and helpful. We easily got around town to visit museums and historical sites. Great stay!!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed 5 days at Patty’s gorgeous studio apartment in Old City and I had the best experience. I could not tell if it was an old apartment with a modern renovation or a brand new apartment that had the charm of an historic Old City apartment. It is truly a beautiful space in a safe, central neighborhood near downtown Philadelphia. Located on the 4th floor of a small elevator building, the studio was extra large, super clean, lots of pot lighting, huge windows, had 4 separate zones (kitchen, dining, living room, and sleeping area).
There was so much natural light, and had modern touches like many outlets to connect devices. There was so much closet space and storage options. The kitchen had sufficient amenities for me to cook each night and avoid restaurants. The sleeping area was separated by a wall so it was extra dark for sleeping and offered privacy. Patty was wonderful in her communications. She was kind and offered a lot of useful, local information. Checkin was a breeze."

Nice, well equipped, well maintained apartment. Quite, clean building. CVS Pharmacy, variety of restaurants, and prime Philadelphia attractions in walking range once you get out of the building.
Philadelphia parking is a nightmare...especially if you are visiting from any one of land rich southern states. This place if perfect with no car. But if you plan to have a car, Patty suggested lots of good options for parking garages and lots that are near to the apartment. Do use that.
The check in instructions and wi fi instructions (and connectivity) were very well laid out.

Stayed a few nights","Great choice for visiting Philadelphia. The apartment is near all the historic sites and tourist attractions in Philadelphia. We were able to walk to everything. When we got tired, we took the bus or subway which took us within 20 meters from the apartment. One little secret for the seniors out there: seniors can get a SEPTA Senior Card which allows the card holder to ride free on all public transportation within Philadelphia. Check the SEPTA site and make an appointment by calling SEPTA to get the card at the HQ on 13th St and Market. The apartment is a ""studio"" where the bed is in the same large room as the living room but the size of the apartment is much larger than your average studio. Very comfortable and super quiet. Patty was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again when we visit Philadelphia again."

Stayed a few nights","Patty's place is absolutely fantastic!
The apartment is in the Old City, close to shops, restaurants, sights, and anything one could wish for. Even though it's very central, it's also very quiet. Once you're inside the apartment, you can't hear a thing.
The place itself is extremely clean and tidy; the minute you open the door you feel at home. Patty is very friendly and helpful. She always replied to our messages within minutes, and always gave us precise answers to our questions.
The instructions for getting into the apartment were exact and simple to follow. Both our arrival and departure were very smooth.
We were very sad to leave this beautiful apartment, and would not hesitate at all to go back when we're next in Philadelphia!"

Stayed with kids","Chose this place for the location and the price. It was walking distance to everything we wanted to do other than a hockey game and the museums/zoo in Fairmount Park. Plenty of coffee, souvenir shops, and restaurants in walking distance.
Check in involved three separate codes but all were provided in advance and were accurate so getting inside was seamless.
There were a couple issues upon check in but the host offered to address them immediately or after our check out and was timely in her responses.
The place is well suited for a couple or a couple with an infant. We have a toddler and it was a decent fit for us."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful neighborhood, comfortable, very quite, clean, two level apartment. Entering from a side street, you are surrounded by flowers, privacy foliage, and a raised deck, within a gorgeous small garden (Victorian feel ). The apartment has new kitchen appliances in a space adequate for cooking, eating, and studying. It has a bathroom with shower and stacked washer and dryer (both new and efficient). Upstairs, a bedroom with queen bed, sofa, chairs, a long, narrow desk, and a large TV set with several multimedia services. Two AC window units, one downstairs and one upstairs, keep the apartment cool. Checking in was very easy and wifi connection was excellent. Place is perfect for relaxing, near enough to UPenn and Drexel, restaurants, museums, public transportation, but away from city noise or crowds. It was a weekend stay, and I had no trouble finding free, street parking next to the patio gate for easy coming and going. It was absolutely perfect for me."

The apartment itself is comfortable, with a couple good places to work if you need to do that, and also good places just to sit and chill.
David was extremely responsive. There were a couple minor glitches in the beginning - he responded nearly instantly and got them dealt with quickly.
I would definitely stay here again."

The surrounding blocks in Powelton Village are some of the mosts beautiful residential streets of the city, with interesting old houses from the 1870s. The apartment is about a ten minute walk to the subway and the University of Pennslyania. We traveled by train and found it easy to get back and forth from 30th Street Station.

The patio where you enter the apartment is charming, and the greenery around you is relaxing and inviting. Love the location, close to campus yet with street parking available.

Stayed a few nights","This apartment is carved out of an old, much larger home. While the address states Hamilton, the entrance is on 37th street. The outside deck is charming and offers a nice setting for cooler days. Skylights help the small downstairs space from being too dark. The kitchen and bathroom are well equipped with all necessary essentials but both spaces are small so one must be creative in finding spaces to place personal care and food prep items. A
staircase leads to a large, comfortable bedroom. A nice touch were individual lights for reading in bed. The TV selection is fairly basic. One caveat: with the bathroom downstairs and the bedroom up, pit stops a night or dressing after a shower require the negotiation of narrow stairs. The neighborhood is a combination of older homes with similarly small apartments and single family dwellings all on deeply treed blocks. In the morning, commuters head to nearby bus stops or the 34th (or 40th) street subway stations and students of nearby Drexel and U Penn walk to interesting campuses. A bit of exploring can turn up a few good restaurants (Sabrina's, Distrito) and a grocery store. Downtown via the subway is minutes away. Parking can be dicey as most blocks have permit or two hour limits. With luck, a space on the far side of 37th street across from the apartment's entrance may be open and there are no restrictions. The apartment offers a satisfying home base for exploring Philadelphia. (Don't miss the magnificent organ recital at downtown's Macys every day but Sunday at noon and 5:30.)"

Parking is annoying but it’s Philly not the Airbnb’s issue lol. The instructions on finding the entrance were perfect I found it easily.
Only thing is a couple of the coffee cups were a little dirty still, and the hamper was full of dirty linens, I thought that was weird. Otherwise the place was spotless.
It wasn’t listed to be expected but there were no dishes/utensils available just one of each would’ve been nice.
Overall great stay, the bed is SO comfortable, and the TV is easy to use. Would definitely book again. :)"

The ceilings were probably 15ft? Which added to the luxurious feeling. The space had a huge window (behind those lush velvet curtains) which wasn’t obvious to me from the photos somehow.
We were here for one night for a show and then went to dinner. We were able to walk to both places. Super conveniently located.
Matthew was really helpful with making check in super easy and even provided a map showing which streets are good to park on. We were able to find parking easily an around the corner.
All in all it was exactly what we needed. A lovely comfortable getaway for the night that let us experience a great neighbourhood in Philly like we were locals.
Thanks Matthew!"

The walk to the train station was very convenient, and the CVS at the corner was only two minutes away. The bed was by far the best part; it was so comfortable and soft! I personally loved the high ceilings, which made the room feel spacious and free. The couch was perfect to sit on and watch movies. The Airbnb door was very close to their neighbor's door, which was a little awkward, but we rarely saw them at all. Still, their neighbors were nice, and the area was peaceful and quiet, besides the typical city noises and occasional people walking by the window. The place overall was very warm and comfortable, and Matthew was extremely responsive. I had several minor issues during my stay, but I was always able to rely on Matthew to respond and help fix or reassure my partner and me about the issues. We had an amazing stay!!"

For anyone who is bothered by noise, Matthew's stay is fairly insulated even for Philadelphia, so there was little noise that I noticed. When I eventually come back to Philly I'd definitely stay here again."

Easy entry to the room and thank you for the first floor entry. I have asthma and 3 flights of stairs to get to a room is a NO for me.

We had some difficulty with the door lock as you had to line the doorframe up perfectly for the bolt to go in correctly but we figured it out. Thanks for having us!

Stayed a few nights","Great place to crash for couple of days. The communication was smooth. The place is clean and tidy. Everything met my expectation!
Message for other guests; Matthew’s place is located in the big multifamily complex so be sure to read his descriptions/guidebook as you can’t depend much on google map. This new construction doesn’t have the best sound insulation so be prepared to hear people walk by outside or use the ear plugs that Matthew provided."

There is quite a bit of new construction in the surrounding area which I believe led to the confusion on location. We enjoyed our stay and will certainly consider booking with Matthew again if heading to Philly.

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Matthew's place for a few days while at a conference at the nearby Fillmore and highly recommend it! He was a great host - I appreciated his flexibility letting me check in a bit early, as well as the carefully prepared guide to the area. Check-in/out were easy.
The location was fantastic - easy walk to the venues, restaurants, pharmacy, and public transport (though I didn't use the latter, it was close by). The neighborhood is charming, with lots of cute cafes and tree-lined streets.
The place itself was spacious, comfortable, and well-maintained. The bed and couch were comfortable, especially after full days running around at a conference. As the description says, there is no kitchen (I had no time for cooking anyhow!) but there is a roomy mini-fridge, Keurig machine, and microwave if needed - though again, there are a ton of places to eat nearby.
If you want to stay in comfortable place in a cool neighborhood, this is it!"

For me it worked out great because it was exceptionally close to my daughter's apartment and made my stay much easier. I do have to say that philly is not a quiet city. It is very loud on the streets at night.

Stayed one night","Matthew’s apartment was awesome for our night stay in Philly. It was very clean, looked like the photos posted, and in an amazing neighborhood. Lots of restaurants, cute parks, grocery store & coffee shops! This area is very walkable. The apartment smelled great- meaning no smell, no fragrance, no over powering smell of an air freshener or cleaning products- more of a fresh- clean feeling!
We were given very clear instructions upon arrival- very easy to get into apartment. Door was a little sticky to shut- my only complaint was that price. It’s the most I’ve ever paid for a one night stay."

Stayed one night","First and foremost, no issues with the space. It was very nicely accommodated and in a (mostly) great location, especially as I was in town for the Beer and Metal festival at the Fillmore, which is an easy 8-minute walk away.
The real negatives had nothing to do with the host or space, but were the parking situation and the lack of late-night amenities in the area. Parking is basically all street parking with hourly restrictions for anyone who doesn’t have a permit. I frequently travel to places like Philly and NYC (and live near DC and so frequently park there) and typically either have some local garage or lot availability nearby, but that was not the case here. There was a public lot a few blocks away, but after I finally figured out how to get into the open entrance, I was told the lot was closed that day (a Friday). It took me 46 minutes to find a street spot that had no limitations.
Also, there are no late-night convenience stores around, so plan for that if you’ll be out late."

Stayed a few nights","Picked Matthew’s place based on the fact it was only a short walk to my son’s apt, who I was visiting for the weekend and it wasn’t a far drive to the Met, where we saw 2 concerts. I was very lucky to find parking on same street and did have some trouble finding the place, even using the app, but I have to say it was my fault because I was concentrating on finding the apartment number on the door instead of following the instructions and looking at the pictures. I contacted Matthew, who immediately came to my assistance and pointed me to the right door, of course which I was already standing close by to. Loved the place, which was so convenient to walk to local restaurants and breweries. My son and I went to Urban Village Brewery and Other Half Brewery the first night and had a great lunch the next day at Middle Child Clubhouse, they had great mimosas and pastrami sandwiches. Be warned, no matter how quiet I was coming back after the shows, the dog next door barked alot."

The dog next door does startle you at first, but you get used to it. I wish there were an iron since there is an ironing board. I did have an issue where I washed a stain and needed to iron it but discovered it wasn't there. This would help make the experience even better.
I would suggest adding an electric kettle so you could have instant noodles at home if you want to. Good experience over all."

☆Make sure to press the ""Key Icon"" on the accommodation page! There is a detailed and friendly accommodation location notice in the key icon.☆
Matthew's quick reply and kind visit allowed me to enter the accommodation. Thank you so much for your nice response.

There are so many great places within walking distance - our favourite being Urban Village Brewery. The train is close by and you can access downtown, the fashion district, etc, so easily. We did have trouble finding parking but ended up using the paid lot which was pretty close. By fault of my own, I had trouble finding the entrance to the place, but just listen to Matt when he says to download the app because there are step by step instructions lol! I would definitely recommend staying here."

The apartment has a private entrance but is actually more like an ""in-laws suite""--there is also an entrance connecting it to the main residence which does not lock from the side of the rental space. There is also no kitchen. This was not super clear from the listing, but Matthew made sure we were aware when confirming the booking. The place still met all of our needs, so we kept the booking. It was clean, well-appointed, well-decorated, convenient to great restaurants and coffee shops. Good value for the price. Thanks Matthew!"

We chose this spot because we were attending a concert at The Fillmore which was a ~10 minute walk away. There was street parking nearby and the host provided a helpful map to assist in the search. We only stayed one night, but I was able to
leave my car the entire time without a problem. Fishtown is very walkable and we were able to enjoy plenty of yummy food in our 24 hours in the city. I definitely recommend this AirBNB and would consider staying here again!"

Pros:
- The place actually seems much bigger than the photos, it has high ceilings and is very spacious!
- Extremely cleanly and decorated very nicely.
- Has a microwave, mini fridge, many lighting options, fan options, smart TV- all very easy to use.
- The bed is extremely comfortable
- Provided a designated “makeup” wash cloth- much appreciated!
- Nice shower w/ shampoo, conditioner, body soap.
- Lots of great restaurants/ activities within close walking distance.
- Was actually easy to find close-by street parking.
- Easy to find
- Worth the price
Things to be warned of (very minor):
- Relatively loud mornings (for lighter sleepers) due to construction
- If you are spooked by dogs- neighbors have a frequently barking large dog!
- Door is difficult to open (at first)- you have to REALLY push on it! Like linebacker style!
Overall a great stay. Absolutely recommend!"

The mini-fridge and microwave came in handy even if we were eating out most of the time. There is some construction going on nearby and the road was actually closed briefly at the time I checked out, normally traffic is light and not a problem due to the new road design. I would stay there again if I was in the area."

The bed was comfortable and linens were fresh and clean. When you check in you might want to turn the boiler on so you’ll have hot water when you’re ready for a shower (was located in an easily accessible spot).
Parking was a hassle, but once we found a spot down the street, we just took a Lyft or walked wherever we needed to go until it was time to leave. There’s so much to do in the area!
They provided silverware, cups, plates, coffee and coffee machine, tea kettle and tea, pretty much everything you need.
The club downstairs could be heard from our room on the fourth floor, but we didn’t mind the noise. They did provide ear plugs though just in case lol.
Overall was a great experience and we’d definitely book again!"

There is no parking onsite but I got lucky the whole time I stayed and found parking on the side of the building. I definitely would recommend staying here and I definitely will be back but a longer stay."

At night, we were on the fourth floor and we could still hear the club in the basement. Because of our age, we didn’t really mind it but at times it was frustrating. Took many pretty photos of the hotel and was satisfied. The beds are super comfy!"

The place was easy to check into, only issue you might have is finding parking depending on the day/time you go. Other than that check in was easy, you just show your Id. The lobby workers even gifted me a bottle of champagne after I told them what I was celebrating. There’s also a restaurant inside of the building and a small bar/club area at the bottom. Overall the apartment was super clean and nice and definitely would book again."

Once I enter the room it was a nice warm feeling it was comfortable it was relaxing and it was clean. The only thing I didn’t understand was the TV their Internet was not working for two days the connection with and link but other than that I had a wonderful peaceful relaxing time. I would definitely book this room again and recommend it to anyone

It was a ~15 walk to City Center, and there are also a subway station and a grocery store right next to the building. I felt pretty safe since it is right on Broad Street, there is a 24-hour reception and you have to put in a code to get inside the building, the elevator and the appartment.
The stuff is amazing and was really helpful every time I needed assistance."

Stayed over a week","I spent a month here for work. The unit itself was fantastic: large, spacious and well-equipped with everything you need for a long term stay. The internet download speed exceeded 200 Mbps which was great. This is a renovated hotel with a cafe and a restaurant on the first floor. There is also a reception so I was able to have things shipped to me during my stay and pick them up there.
There is an ALDI right next to the hotel so that was convenient for groceries. The hotel is a few miles north of Center City so you will need to either walk, bike (there's a bike-share nearby) or take the metro which is next to the hotel to get to the center. All-in-all, it was a good experience and would recommend this place if you don't mind not being in the heart of center city"

The room was good, with two beds, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location was also walkable to many attractions in Philly, and it was also easy to catch a bus or rideshare when needed. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, although be noted that it is within a hotel (which was quite pleasant)."

Stayed a few nights","To be honesn't there was nothing that made this airbnb stand out - just the basics of a hotel. No Continental breakfasts, not great wifi. We were put in a room that had a door connected to another room and multiple times the next door neighbors tried to open it when they were intoxicated. Woke us up many times. You could hear everything your neighbors were doing - also woke us up often. We were also backed up to the elevators and stairs so we heard them going outside. We also had someone enter our room when we had not checked out to clean which was frustrating. We ended up packing up immediately and leaving to the airport. area had good food around it - Rex's was our favorite. We also enjoyed Nom Wah (a dim sum place). The hosts were communicative, but sometimes it felt like too much. I know coming in when a conference in town can be a lot, and stressful on room accommodations, but I expected a bit moren- next time I'll look more into booking so we avoid coming in during a conference."

The location is as central as can get. All tourist destinations are a short walk away and you'll also find many grocery stores, cafes and restaurants around the hotel. Overall a great stay and definite recommend."

There were a few small inconveniences like the tv not working well (even after maintenance tried to fix it) and having to look around for the ice machine the first night. (Although there were signs pointing to ice machines, only a few floors actually had them.) Other than that, this was a great place to stay. Everything was very clean, and beds were the best — super cozy and comfortable! Nice water pressure in the shower too. All the employees we interacted with down in the lobby area were very friendly and helpful, and restaurants and tourist attractions were just a short walk away. Thanks for having us! :)"

Anywho, I stayed here with my family for a Half marathon that was this past weekend. It was walkable (.70 miles to start line) to Eakins oval. We were able to find decent pizza, snacks, and family friendly dinner close by. The hotel room was quiet, even by the elevators. We were on the third floor, same as the gym, and didn't notice any extra noises from people or the streets. House keeping did come in at some point while we were out and about in the morning. I'd consider staying here again!"

Then refused to give me a refund or allow me to change the dates of my stay, so I can get a different bank card to put my security deposit on. I personally think this host is obsessed with money, because they refuse to do the right thing. I got burnt out of $200 and they didn’t even try to give me back at least half of my money due to me not being able to check in."

Stayed one night","Definitely quirky and loved the idea of staying here with so much history was awesome.
I would have liked bottled water I. The fridge, we ran out of what we had brought with us. I just used a coffee mug and filled it in the bathroom sink. But, water in the mini fridge would have been a huge plus.
Expect low ceiling and narrow steps my husband is 6’ tall and tapped his head as we were packing. 🤭 I am quite curious about how the alcove came about where the bed is and how it was used.
Yes, you will hear the toddler and people upstairs. It’s to be expected since this is the cellar.
Love this historical spot and happy we got the chance to stay here. TY for sharing your space with others."

The actual space is very cool and you feel like you're back in time. It's small, but I think it's perfect for people who are wanting to explore the city and be able to come back to a historic area. It's a little quirky - a bit dusty, and you can hear every step that happens upstairs, but I would still highly recommend this spot. Patrick was very flexible, letting us check in early and leave our bags to pick up later after check out time and we so appreciate that."

Stayed one night","We are so glad we stayed at this wonderful gem in old city. If you value getting a taste of history while you are here and you need a place to call home base while exploring all Philly has to offer, this is your place. I never thought I would have an opportunity to actually STAY on Elfreth's Alley, which is the oldest residential street in the country. Patrick was a wonderful and responsive host and checkin was so easy. He set the place up to be ultra cozy (just as cozy as it looks in the pictures!) and really lean into the historical feel. The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze so this might not be the place for you if you can't handle stairs, if you are a larger person, or if you don't like occasionally ducking your head. Personally I really hope to stay here again. Our trip was quick and I really wanted to explore 2nd street more! Also note that the location is very convenient to get to the Market Frankford subway line."

Stayed a few nights","The perfect venue for a short 2 nights stay if you want to experience something a little different than your ordinary AirB&B (would not recommend more than 2 nights). We knew what we signed up for so we were not disappointed at all! The area felt safe even during the night. Very convenient location as it is close to major tourist attraction (all walk-able distance, we didn't even take public transpiration at all), also it's convenient as there are cafes (Starbucks for example) and grocery stores nearby. The accommodation itself was unique, we didn't have much issue regarding the noise since that is what we already expected (reading reviews from other travelers). Our only issue was that the place may not be squeaky clean, we bought slippers to wear in house and the bed sheets had stains and hair on them. There was also leftover food in the fridge from previous guests but these are all minor issues. Other than that, we love the place!"

We wrote to Patrick on our way to Philadelphia from Atlantic City and he got back to us immediately. Our stay was by far the most memorable and unique experience we could have asked for. The location was private, safe, quiet, and surrounded with cafe's, museums, shopping, and more. Parking was simple for the location, and everything was within walking distance. It felt unreal to be staying right underneath so much history. After a busy weekend, our stay was the perfect relaxing finish to our getaway. I would insist anyone traveling the area looking for a lifetime experience should book a stay. Forever thankful for the perfect 30th birthday evening at Patrick's airbnb. 🖤"

Stayed one night","I am conflicted. The cellar was an awesome experience. I am claustrophobic and was really worried about being able to stay. I did fine on that part and even the tiny odd bathroom wasn't a problem. The decor was very cool and I absolutely loved the history there. My only problem was kitchen cleanliness. Yes there is a coffee pot but the lid was left open and dirt fell in from the exposed rafters. It looked like it had been gathering dirt for a long time. Also the wine glasses had so much grime on them nobody would want to use them. Dish soap and a sponge would have helped. In the pictures there is a microwave but I didn't see a microwave so I wasn't even able to heat my water for my instant coffee or cook my breakfast that I brought. Also, you can drive in the alley and unload your stuff before taking your vehicle to a parking garage. Wish I had known that before I got there. I would recommend it, but not if you need coffee or food."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing opportunity to stay on such a historic property! I stayed with my mother and we are sure to have memories that will last us a lifetime! Airbnb is as described on listing, however, as this is an antique cellar there is a strong smell of mildew that was very overwhelming, particularly in the back rooms. It was wonderful waking up under the brick archway in the morning, but bed was old and uncomfortable. Bathroom was hard to access as most of it is taken up by stairs. We ended up leaving after one night for something more comfortable. Happy we tried it out though!"

Dinner at Cuba Libre included a banana split with fireworks and breakfast at Cafe Ole was tasty. On checkout we were greeted by a walking tour who asked if the place was haunted. Good location… would return again.🇺🇸😊

Stayed a few nights","This is an unfinished cellar. Damp and smells musty with cobwebs. Saw multiple cave crickets. Bed is difficult to get in/out of due to being in a small nook.
Bathroom is tiny and hard to get into- it’s up steps and you will need to stoop over. Sink and mirror are small. No places to keep toiletries. Low ceilings (I’m 6’ and my partner is 5’5, we both had trouble). Steps leading down to unit are steep.
Anyone with accessibility issues will NOT be able to stay here.
Above is a family with small child(ren) that run around and dogs that bark- that’s what children and dogs do, but not much insulation to cancel noise.
Getting in the unit was easy. Key was in a lockbox on door. TV and Roku. Air conditioner and dehumidifier. Was fun to walk by tourists and blow their minds as you entered a cellar on one of the oldest streets in America. Check out procedure was simple and straightforward. Patrick was responsive when we ran into issues. It is an incredibly unique experience."

Stayed with a pet","Pros:
Excellent location; it's a historical place that was cool
Lots to do, and a walkable neighborhood
Just right for perhaps an adult/2 staying for a short visit if you don't mind a dark basement with no light and tight space
Cons:
- Not baby friendly/dog-friendly - tight space to bring a stroller down the stairs into the main door (tight for big suitcases too). Heads up! The step-down directly leads to the main entrance and you can trip if you have heavy luggage. Once you keep a travel crib, the path to anywhere is essentially blocked off (as described, it is a tight space inside as well)
- There are gaps in the flooring by the nightstand where my phone fell and got stuck in the wooden plank (there would have been no way to retrieve it if it fell through the gap)
- Heads up about the low-ceiling transitions! from the living room area that leads up to all other areas (bedroom area/area which has the bathroom)
It was definitely worth the weekend $$$ we paid"

It was only a ten minute walk max to almost all the historical sites in Philadelphia. Our host was incredibly helpful and allowed us to check in early due to our early flight which helped a ton. You wouldn’t expect a wine cellar from the 1700’s to be outfitted with modern tech but it felt like we were in a small studio apartment, complete with Wi-Fi, TV, streaming services and more. Great experience and would definitely recommend to anyone"

Located on a beautiful, historic street close to other historic landmarks of Old City, this is a once in a lifetime stay as far as American historical value goes.
As was expected, so not a surprise for me but should be noted before booking, it’s a converted wine cellar so shorter people will feel right at home and taller people will need to maneuver more carefully.
Overall, a beautiful, quaint stay in a great spot in the historic area of Philadelphia!"

Overall, we’re glad we picked to stay here and would recommend it if you’re up for the adventure. It’s walkable to all the historic sites. The bathroom is small, the bed is just a double, and the ceilings are low so if you are (or are traveling with someone tall/large), this is probably not the place for you. Also, the shower had great water pressure and stayed hot which was awesome but if having a really nice bathroom matters to you, this is a wine cellar and the bathroom is itty bitty."

If you’re looking for a historic apartment and something a bit different then go for it, it’s fine for one or two nights. If you’re staying a little longer and want more comfort and peace then I’d recommend against it."

Keep in mind that this is an old, historic building and a real cellar! We found it exactly as described and the pictures were accurate as well.
That said, if you are a very large person some of the spaces may be quite tight (especially the bathroom). I am overweight myself and it was fine for me, but be mindful.
Again, the pictures are accurate and totally expected for a historic place such as this! If only these walls could talk! I’d recommend this stay, especially for couples or singles wanting to enjoy the city by foot."
