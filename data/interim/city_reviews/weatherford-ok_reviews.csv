Stayed about a week","I absolutely love Coleen’s Landing. I have stayed here three times now while away from home on business. I recently had to extend my stay in Weatherford, but the dates were already booked by others for this fabulous place. The new guests will be thrilled, but I was selfishly disappointed as I had to check out and change locations. I’m not sure if I will have the need in the future to visit Weatherford again, however, if I do Colleen’s landing will be my first choice! The Christmas decor was an extra added bonus. Thank you!"

Though a small unit, the spaces are well laid out and don't feel cramped at all. Barbara has put a lot of thought into providing everything one might need while staying at her place and was willing to provide what we may have found lacking. She was very responsive and informative, and made sure our stay would be pleasant. We would not hesitate to rent here again, if ever we would need to be in the area in the future."

The bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was pristine and lovely. I was initially worried about staying with my pup in a place with no yard, but there are plenty of green spaces nearby to walk, and Strayhouse was so pup friendly. The chai latte (they brew it in-house) and breakfast croissant next door were also amazing. We couldn’t have had a better experience."

Strayhouse Kitchen & Coffee and Longbell Brewery are on the same property also which is super convenient and delicious. Overall, loved my stay!"

Stayed one night","Geoff’s place was cool and fun. I loved the vintage look and we especially enjoyed listening to the Eagles on the turntable! The apartment was immaculate and comfortable. I was a little unsure of the location at first but once we got settled, I felt perfectly safe. There’s an alley that runs between the apartment and coffeehouse so be aware that you may hear a delivery truck in the early morning hours. I personally wasn’t affected by any noise from it but my husband did hear it. Also be aware that there is quite a large step up to the front door. Neither of these are deal breakers, I would definitely stay again and I recommend this space to others. The coffeehouse next door is great and so convenient! I believe Nicole served us and she accommodated our request for a specific breakfast croissant. It was huge and delicious! The raspberry lemonade is quite tasty too! You won’t be disappointed by booking Geoff’s place!"

The next morning we went to the cafe side and it was so relaxing- the food options were healthy and delicious! Also got a great latte there. Again our puppy was allowed and they brought a water bowl over for him.
The studio is the coolest. Set up really nice and killer bathroom!!!! Walk in huge shower with great pressure and heats up quickly. That fancy toilet and all amenities you need!
We highly recommend this place for ease and comfort!"

Wow was this such an upgrade—definitely worth the price and extra drive. Even better than the pictures. Spotless, roomy, cozy bed/linens, beautiful shower, and everything we needed in the kitchen. The area was quiet and black out blinds were wonderful to sleep in. Street parking only which seemed questionable at first since late at night it was like a ghost town but it was safe and upon waking in the morning I was delighted by the quaint town. We enjoyed coffee and an absolutely delicious lunch next door. Would highly recommend Strayhouse!!! I wish there were more Airbnbs with such quality and attention to detail!"

The kitchenette is well stocked. The bed was very sturdy & comfortable, the lights had dimmer switches, the linens were fresh, and the neighborhood was very quiet at night.

Stayed a few nights","The host forgot to update my check in time after agreeing to accommodate my earlier check-in, so I couldn’t unlock the Airbnb when I arrived.
The split heaters never heated the space adequately, even when turned up quite a bit on heat setting. We used the space heaters that were provided.
Our water was shut off without warning or notice for a short period of time due to construction, which was very inconvenient and unsettling to suddenly have no access to water.
The entrance to the Airbnb was missing a step, the wooden step pictured in the description was not there making the first step up around 14-15” if I had to guess. Inconvenient and not safe for tenants with decreased balance and/or mobility.
The entrance to the Airbnb is located on the side of the coffee shop drive-thru. There is no signage indicating to drivers that pedestrians will be entering/exiting in this area.
The host replied very rudely & very distastefully when I asked about an amenity. Won’t be staying here again."

Stayed with a pet","the absolute best shower iv ever taken , the bathroom is it's very own vibe , also the coolest toilet iv ever used , seat always warmed with a bidet also my first experience with one of those lol loved it! the bed was firm I was scared it would be uncomfortable but I've never slept on a memory foam mattress before and I was pleasantly surprised at how well I slept. this place is amazing , once you walk past the gate it feels like you're in your very own secret place outside and Inside...I would go as far to say this place was magical. I was traveling through for work from Arkansas to New Mexico and will be heading back in a month in which I will probably book this place if it's available. My favorite Airbnb so far ♥️ p.s. my my little old lady puppy (shes 17) loved it as well , being pet friendly was a huge bonus !!"

Beautifully designed, lots of extra details. This is NOT your average road trip over-nighter. This place left us relaxed and rested, and a bit pampered, too!

Every tiniest detail is aesthetically pleasing: the linens, the lighting, the scent of the dish and hand soaps--the place is a modern charm. There's two AC units which can get you as cold as you'd like. The unit is much bigger than the pics can capture. And every review is right on about the bathroom.
Geoff was immediately responsive when I had a question (even on a holiday). Without question, this is my new go-to when traveling to the SW. Oh, and Strayhouse is a serious artisan coffee shop--my espresso was sweet with no bitterness."

Stayed a few nights","First of all, the rental is an older trailer home. You can tell it’s older- but it’s CLEAN and that’s what matters. Jami was beautiful to work with. While we were there the washer sprung a small leak and she offered to do our laundry or provide laundry services if we needed. The rental is very homey, this kitchen has everything you’d need- plus is MASSIVE. The water heater ran long hot showers which was very nice after sitting all day in the cold while hunting. Plenty of extra towels, pillows, blankets, etc. The area is very quiet and we felt safe during our stay. There are a few things that could be upgraded which I believe Jami said they’re working on soon. I noticed she offered a crib/packnplay which many other bnb’s aren’t so thoughtful. The couch in the living room was SO COMFY and was a nice nap spot for the turkey coma from thanksgiving. lol.
Otherwise, it’s a great deal and we will be staying with Jami again when we can!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a 3-5 star place this is NOT it....needed alot of maintenance loose door knobs, doors would not stay shut due to missing pieces of the door knob, all ceiling lights was missing globes, shower was very dirty, stove and oven had not been cleaned in long time which caused a bad smell in the kitchen, water stains on the ceilings, every mini blind had broken slates, sofa cover had some kind of liquid stains, all hand soap bottles was empty, none of the mattresses or box springs had bed bug covers, all carpet needed cleaning....it was my 1st time using AirB&B and the place was very poorly maintenanced and cleaned....the only reason for staying was I was 2 mins for my daughter and grandbabies otherwise I would have not stayed there....Be Aware"

Stayed with kids","if you are traveling off the I-40 and need a place more private and less expensive than a motel this is a good bet. I liked it because I had my family with me and did not have all the issues of hotel noise and the regular riff raff you find in the halls at night.
the couple who run this air b&b are young and seem to be utilizing this second property the smart way. the beds are very comfortable and the kitchen has all the things one would need to make any meal.
the neighborhood is not one for tourists, I'll say that but it's nice because it is very quiet. this is not part central or anything.
if you need a bar or entertainment of some kind Weatherford is a college town and not 9 miles down the road from here. if you are visiting students but need a break this is a good spot."

Stayed one night","If you're driving cross country there are some areas where there is just nothing, freeway exit accommodations. This is one of those areas so it was good to have somewhere to catch a few zzz's.
It appears to be an older prefab home in ok condition, although when I first walked in, it did feel a bit unlevel. The gate to the property didn't close properly so be careful if you're bringing pets.
There is no dedicated office as stated. There is a SMALL vanity area in one of the bedrooms that they refer to the office space; it was too small for me to spread out and work efficiently. Also, there was no printer provided so between the two things, I wasn't able to complete the work I had scheduled for the evening. :(
Had I known this in advance,
I would have planned my route/stops differently and stayed else where.
Also, I wasn't able to spread out in the living area to do my work because my travel companions wanted to watch tv and the one in the living room was the only working one. The tv wasn't operational, the host came over pushed a bunch of buttons but said she really didn't know how it was hooked up; my hubby figured it out.
The beds were ok, new sheets. The floor air vents blow right up under the bed covers yet it was too hot to not have it off.
All in all, not a real restful night. I will pass them by next time."

The decor reminded me of my childhood- Hardy Boys books galore, miniature shuffleboard, that was a hoot, built in spa, fireplace and decor that defines what a ranchhouse is all about. Books, movies galore, antique items throughout, even has postcards available. WOW, this place was amazing, wished I could have stayed a few more days just to browse inside the house. Three beds, 2 bathrooms, a well stocked kitchen and everything inside was immaculate and well organized.
I would definitely recommend the Lazy B to anyone out there, you will not be disappointed one bit."

The bed was very hard, my wife had to move to one of the other beds in the house which were the opposite in comfort, very soft. Having said that barring sleeping in that particular bed we would stay here again and again when we’re in Weatherford."

It’s a great place for a staycation or just some relaxation during R&R, or if you’re just in town to visit but don’t want to deal will all of the thrills of the city.

The house was much bigger than I expected and included a huge master bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. There were a lot of activities for the kids to do inside too, such as board games, a rope ring toss, and foosball.

There is plenty of room to spread out, lounge, and interact. The rooms are large and spacious with plenty of storage for bags and belongings.
The kitchen had plenty of dishes and appliances for our family of 5. LOVED the dual function coffee maker as it's a bummer to find just a single-cup machine when you need a whole pot! Large table seating with bartop too makes the kitchen a very usable space.
The Christmas tree was set up and made a great backdrop for some family photos!

Stayed a few nights","This place is marvelous. It is close to town but in a rural setting that is very quiet. Derrick and Tracy are very friendly and helpful and respond to emails immediately. The house is roomy with everything you could need, from comfy recliners. To a jacuzzi tub to 2 BBQ grills. It would also be a great place to bring kids as they have an abundance of games, books and movies. We wished we’d had our grandkids with us. It is a perfect location to visit Rte 66 sights. All in all, a wonderful place."

Group trip","Our family of 5 adults loved our over-night stopover between 2 long days of driving. The home is spacious. clean, welcoming, and has everything needed for safe and comfortable accommodations for couples, friends, or families with children. This airbnb is full of amenities and charming decor! You could easily stay here long term! Due to staying on our tight travel schedule we could not take advantage of the options, but we did slow our roll out a bit to visit the sweet horse. We hope we will be lucky enough to stay here again some day!"

Stayed a few nights","We booked this property based on it allowing pets. My sister brought her dog and when she let it out in the back yard it came back in full of sand burr stickers and some other kind of weed. The back and front yards were full of stickers. So if you bring pets be prepared for that. The bed my sister slept in was very hard and uncomfortable for her. Could be more seating in the living room if you have more than 3 people. Also had some issues with red ants. They tried to get rid of them, but they kept coming back. The home was in a great location for us visiting my dad in the assisted living and also convenient to wal-mart and fast food places. They provided all the necessary linens and it was tastefully decorated in a western theme. They were very responsive when notified."

It was comfortable and we slept well.
We got in late after dark and found the doors to the back yard were not locked and the gate to the back yard was open. We closed them, locked them, and moved on.
There were multiple hairs in the bathtub.
Other than that everything seemed clean and comfortable. I would stay here again."

If you are driving across the country or just want to have a fun family getaway, this is the place and host you need. The game room is a unique touch that provided some levity and brought back childhood memories for all of us. Loved the place but the host made it a home away from home. 🥰"

Stayed with a pet",This is our second time staying here while passing through Oklahoma. You can’t beat the price for what you get. The biggest perk to us… a king size bed that is SO comfortable! It’s hard to find king beds (especially ones that are comfortable) at airbnbs. there is a very large fenced in back yard which is great for dogs. Big tvs with Netflix which was really nice. Decor is very cozy and cute . Good location just off the interstate. It has a lot of neat extra things we just didn’t have time to enjoy. A large game room in the back which has a pool table and arcade games. Very clean and well stocked with anything you could need

We greatly appreciate that and ate at Lucille's Roadhouse because of it. We come up to Oklahoma a few times a year and we will stay here again when we do."

Make use of the well-equipped kitchen but be sure to ask where everything is located. We discovered some fun stuff at the end of our stay. Overall this house was beautiful and comfy!

You are within a mile of I-40 and are also very near the Gen. Tom Stafford Air and Space Museum which is quite interesting and worth a visit if you are in Weatherford. Her patio set up worked great for us because we were able to grill out and watch a Thunder game after work! You often do not get this luxury when on a business trip so it was greatly appreciated. We found Gail to be extremely responsive and helpful whenever we had a question. When working in western OK in the future we will likely be staying at Gail's place again.

He was willing to work with me to meet with my son to ensure we could gain access to the home when we got delayed on the road, but when that didn’t happen, he explained in detail how to get in and was willing to leave where he was to meet me if I had trouble (which I didn’t).

Stayed with a pet","Ken is a lovely host who communicated well and met us upon arrival to explain check in and show us around. He was always available through Airbnb messaging if we had a question. The space was clean and homely with little extra amenities. It was quite windy and cold during our stay so we didn’t get to enjoy the outside spaces, but our daughter enjoyed watching the cows in the fields outside our window. Our only complaint was the color of the bath water, which Ken explained was due to iron in the pipes. It seemed a shame to have such a nice soaking tub marred by older pipes. We would also bring extra drinking water if we were to stay again due to the metallic taste. Otherwise, the place had everything we needed for a one night stay on a long road trip relocating across the country."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I stayed in Ken’s lovely cottage during our cross-country drive. Provided just what we needed to rest & relax a bit, and served as our home base to explore Clinton and the surrounding area. This is a great house with all the amenities and comforts you may need.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
Thank you!!"

Stayed with a pet","This lovely home was SO CLEAN I did not want to touch anything!!! The Host, Ken, was so accommodating and met us at the property to ensure we entered the home easily. I felt as if we were coming home to visit family! Beautifully decorated, lots of space to roam outdoors. We loved sitting on the deck. There is a golf course just a golf ball’s throw from the house; so bring those clubs! The Master Bathroom was so inviting with its Soaking Tub. Friendly cows live onsite and were happy to great us at their fence. This home is really special and super dog friendly! Though we were not traveling with children; it would be a treat for them too!
Ken told us about an amazing restaurant that is a hidden gem! People from all over the world dine their because of the incredible food, hospitality and location. And, guess what? The restaurant is literally within minutes from this home. But you’ll have to book your stay to find out about it! I’m not telling!! Too much fun!!"

Both bedrooms are nice. The location is quiet and still close to I-40. Washer and dryer were welcome after a long drive. The only issue I encountered was the bathtub faucet was not working but I am sure Ken will have that fixed before the next guest.
I was moving with with my two pups and two kitties and really appreciate hosts like Ken who realize pet owners can be responsible guests.
Really recommend you stay here - we definitely will the next time we are passing through!"

Stayed one night","Ken’s place was just the stop we needed on a long road trip with our cat and dog. Our golden puppy absolutely loved the incredibly large yard space to roam, and we loved the beautiful touches within the spacious cottage with stunning views of the plains outside the windows. Ken was super accommodating right from the start, greeting us when we arrived to help with check in and offer recommendations for the area. We would 100 percent stay here again if passing through the area and would recommend everyone else do the same!"

Stayed one night","Why would you stay in a hotel, when you can stay here? Such a cute, cozy home convenient to I-40 in a stretch where nice places to stay are limited. Ken was a wonderful host, answering questions and working to accommodate our travel schedule. Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were spacious and the kitchen had everything you could need. There is a golf course nearby where you can stretch your legs for a lovely evening walk. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","Ken’s home is absolutely beautiful and Ken himself was extremely friendly and helpful. The house has quick and easy access off the highway, it has everything you could need and more! Everything in the home was extremely clean, the kitchen had everything we needed to make a delicious meal, the beds are extremely comfortable, and the bath is the best bath I have ever taken. We stayed here as a stop on a cross country road trip and this was our favorite Airbnb along the way. Wish we could have stayed more than one night, highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","What a well appointed and very beautiful cottage, you will not be disappointed. If your stopping in Clinton, Oklahoma you need to stay here. Plenty of room to park and even has a larger barn if needing not to unload and hide ur personal items. The hosts Ken & Vanessa Met us at the property and gave us personal tour and also let us know we were the 1st ones staying at there property and what a little gem!!! This place has been remodeled and is very tastefully done with all the little details. It fit our Family of 4 needs perfect, 2 king beds, just off the interstate a couple miles, so it safe and secure and most of all quiet. Wish we had more time to visit and go exploring and they are right down the road from a golf course. We ate at Lucille's Roadhouse which was was route 66 theme and the food was great. Again we were just passing through on our trip to Florida for 1 night and we loved it!!"
