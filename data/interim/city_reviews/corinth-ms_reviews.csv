The house made a great place where we could relax and visit between the different events. The location is beautiful, quiet and private. The house is elegant yet very comfortable at the same time.

I'm so thankful we did.
Tammi was a precious host and her home is absolutely gorgeous.
Spotless clean and so Peaceful.
We have already talked about renting it again just for a weekend getaway because it was so amazing and we didn't feel like we got to spend enough time just enjoying the beautiful home.
I would 100% highly recommend it to anyone. We look forward to staying again.
Thank you Tammi for a wonderful experience and for sharing your gorgeous home with us. It was a absolutely perfect weekend, all the way around."

New kitchen, nicely tuned up bathrooms. Charming “Shabby-Shiek” decorating to go with the vintage house.
Lots of great cafes and restaurants on Main Street and tons of fast food options on all the highway routes into the town.
If you love history and charming old Southern towns, this will be a very memorable place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","The location itself was perfect. The house has tons of charm, unfortunately it seems to be in disrepair. Some of the things promised on the website weren’t there on the property. The back yard needs major maintenance. There was not a fire pit as advertised. The back door was spongy from leaking and there was a mold smell throughout the whole house. The kitchen was beautiful but needed to be cleaned. The drawers had old stuff from previous renters and food crumbs in them. The shower had a razor that had been used in it. The front porch was not maintained. We removed the cushions as they were so dirty. The American flag honestly needed to be removed it was in such poor shape. On arrival we did not receive instructions on check in with keypad code or any response from Kelly until I contacted airBNB. She was quick to respond after but it was 4pm Corinth time when we were able to check in. All in all, wonderful location. Hope it receives the maintenance it deserves."

Stayed with kids","Visiting family in Corinth. We rent houses every year when traveling. I specifically searched vrbo and Airbnb sites for a home that was downtown Corinth so we could walk to the shopping. When we arrived the location was perfect, it was easy to check in. The walkway to the back door needs some attention. Entering the house the musty smell was overwhelming for me. Hubby talked me into staying. The house decor was cute as shown in pictures. I had to sweep the floors they were dirty. The blankets on couch were dirty so I washed those so we could enjoy them.The beds were clean. This house needs to be sprayed for bugs. Hubby was on the couch reading as a spider crawled on him. There was a spider in our daughters bed, a spider and big cockroach in the tub, ants too. No string lights in backyard as described, but that back space is unusable anyway. Location was great, but from the smell, bugs and it not being super clean it wasn’t worth the price. City is safe to stay in."

Stayed about a week","The home was nice, but there were things that were things that were not there that were offered. like a grill, and fire pit. I did ask for it twice, and never got it. the place was kind of clean, meaning the stove was filthy, the pots and crock pot was filthy. there were coffee grinds in the coffee maker. my wife and sister took time and scubbed them clean. that back door handle didn't work, so you could come in, but you couldn't use to go out. when I let her know, I was told if I didn't feel safe I could just leave and she would give me a full refund. kind hard to do that when we booked it for 7 nights. also the back door trim was falling apart at the bottom. also the swing in the back yard has a huge tear in the part where you sit, making it unusable. Also in the first bathroom
if she got a new cleaning lady, and did some small maintenance around the house it would be much bettershower the paint is peeling really bad off of the window. I would also suggest dressers in every room not just one room. also in the back bedroom there is a huge hole in the closet. and she might want to get a person out there to check her attic, there is either mice or a small animal living up there. we paid a lot of money to stay here, and was very disappointed in what we got for the money. Don’t like to be ugly, just stating the facts. however afte.r we cleaned up and bought some supplies it was a nice location. and could be a great home to stay if she got a good cleaning lady and did a few maintenance on the house."

Amber was also a very gracious host who allowed us a late last minute booking and check in.

The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, and there was lots of room between this house and other houses. Rooms were impressively furnished, kitchen/living room were extraordinarily cozy, and the view from the back porch was outstanding.

We enjoyed the front & back porches and the lovely quiet country setting. Easy safe Parking at the door. Lots of small touches, ceiling fans, lights next to the beds to read by & our own thermostat! (no misery being stuck too hot or too cold)There were Comfortable attractive furnishings, lots of natural light and plenty of easy to use window coverings. It is close to Cornith with good restaurants, (not always the case in small towns) There is always a moment of trepidation when checking into an Airbnb. Is there going to be something I missed in the listing, or maybe an unwelcome surprise? It felt wonderful to pull up and walk into such a lovely place. The host topped off the visit with a carriage ride & showed us the old Church across the street they recently renovated for weddings. Can’t wait to go back. Thank you! Thank you!"

The cottage is very comfortable, clean and updated, but the owners took great care to preserve the history of the place - like stepping back in time, but with all modern amenities and decorated just beautifully. Corinth is a short drive away and a great place to get lost in on a Sunday afternoon. Jessica is extremely responsive, kind and accommodating. We want to return when the pond out back is finished! 5-stars and you also will sleep like a baby.... Thanks, Jessica!"

We appreciated the Christmas decor this time…it made the cabin feel even more cozy. Everything is exceptionally clean, and they provide all of the extra you may need (towels, laundry detergent, spices, coffee, shampoo and soap, etc.) My boys love to pet the neighbor horses and to make s’mores at night in the fire pit. We made the quick trip to Shiloh to explore the military park (about a 25 min drive). This is a great place to step away from the business of life, and just relax."

Stayed with kids","The Oakley House in Phenomenal!! The pictures are gorgeous, but this place is so much more amazing than what can be shown in pictures! There are thoughtful touches all through out the house, it is incredibly clean, very private and secure and beautiful both outside and in. You can really tell there was so much time, effort and care put into creating this amazing, quality home. It was such a relaxing stay for us, close enough to town to go to dinner, shopping, etc. but private enough to really feel like you really got away from it all to relax and rest. We can't wait to come back again!!"

Stayed a few nights","We are local to the area (about an hour away) This is a wonderful place to escape the kids for a quiet setting. Close to everything you need. You are 15 - 20, even 30 minutes away from some very cozy home cooking style restaurants! Corinth is rich in history and if you are like us, and don't mind being an hour away from everywhere... then you have many many more options for a great travel experience using this location as a great hub.
We also have experience staying in a very old log cabin that has been modernized. This cabin, is hand down the best. Our experience was excellent! Great cell coverage and even during weather related issues with the wifi, my swap over to hotspot data was flawless. We used the internet for some light work and travel planning and location gathering info. We have stayed in the ""sticks"" with no coverage and it just makes life hard to plan a nice vacation on the fly. This place, no issues there!
Enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","The Oakley House proved to be the perfect quiet retreat after spending time in the area visiting Shiloh National Battlefield and Corinth area Civil War history. The porch was a relaxing place to hang out, play checkers and ring toss, or just rock in the rockers. One fall night we enjoyed a fire in the fire pit - even the firewood was provided! The grill and sparkling clean modern kitchen made it easy to choose to enjoy dinner at ""home"".
But the best part about this rustic yet modern log cabin was the detail that Jimmy-Jill thoughtfully provided. No skimping on anything. Bath towels were thick, soft and thirsty; soft warm throws were there to cuddle up in the oversize comfy chairs and watch the inside gas fireplace or satellite television on the flat screen TV. The wifi worked flawlessly.
Checking in couldn't have been simpler. The rural location is conveniently only a few miles from Corinth and other local attractions.
Rent the Oakley House, you'll be glad you chose it for your getaway! THANK YOU Jimmy and Jill."

Stayed a few nights","My parents, sister, & I spent the weekend at King's Cottage while in Corinth for my daughter's wedding reception. Christy quickly sent the itinerary which included the code & easy to follow house rules. She even had the outside light on for me since she knew it would be a late arrival. The cottage is tidy & in a peaceful area. Most restaurants and shops are within 4 miles. This made it convenient for my elderly parents to have a nice and near place to stay both before and after the reception. My parents had never stayed in an Airbnb. They repeatedly commented how they liked the cottage so much more than a hotel. We did not have the time in our schedule to use the board games or books. With a longer stay, they would have been a welcome form of entertainment. I have recommended it to a couple with a Corinth December wedding to use for their out of town family members. I recommend it & am already looking forward to staying there again. It was a relaxing, temporary home away from home."

The first thing I noticed was the adorable decor. Every corner of the Airbnb was thoughtfully adorned with charming pieces that added personality and warmth to the space. From vibrant throw pillows to unique wall art, it was clear that the host had put a lot of thought and effort into creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
Not only was the Airbnb beautifully decorated, but it was also very spacious. The furniture was arranged in a way that made the most of the available space, and there was plenty of room to relax and unwind after a long day of visiting family.

The cottage was beautifully decorated and it was a lovely retreat while my husband and kids did Civil War sightseeing to their heart’s content at Shiloh and Corinth. It was lovely to read in the living room and drink coffee on the porch. In the evenings, our family has dinner together in the kitchen (we live in the midwest so barbecue take-out was a treat) and hung out together in the cozy living room. The sleeping arrangements were great for our family of 5.
Mary Kate was very responsive to our questions. There were also thoughtful touches in the house—my kids loved the snacks.
The location was very convenient for walking downtown (a must for me because my husband and kids mostly took the car). I was happy to get some early Christmas shopping done (including at her lovely shop) and enjoyed excellent food."

Group trip","This cottage was perfect for my 4 granddaughters and me. We were in town for my granddaughters graduation so we came in early to visit with family. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and drinking coffee in the morning. Guests were able to hang out with us on the porch. (there is a sweet courtyard with lights and a grill, but it rained so we did not get to enjoy it).
There is an ample supply of linens, towels and coffee. Washer/Dryer in large laundry area.
I do want to say that this is an older building with a lot of character. Don’t expect perfect, but do expect cozy comfort and sweet peace. You can curl up with one of the many throws and enjoy one of the books that are scattered throughout the rooms.
There are many things to do in the area and quite a few good eating places."

The neighborhood was lovely. The front porch swing in the morning was so peaceful and I enjoyed watching the sweet lady across the street work in her yard and she was so friendly. I also shopped in town and meet the other neighbor. He owned the house next door but lived across the street. Such a friendly neighborhood. We felt very safe. You are close to everything in town and you will definitely feel at home. We loved our stay. I would definitely recommend this beautiful cottage and we definitely would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","Corinth is one of my favorite places to visit - some might say it is because I still consider it home since I was raised there over 35 years ago. The usual trip ""home"" consist of me staying with family but this time my husband and I decided to try out The Cottage to see if maybe we would have a different experience. It was something out of a story book, magical. We started our morning off inviting the family over for breakfast (the kitchen is stocked with all the necessaries), then took a walk downtown admiring all the historical houses, the library, the church we were married in, and then found ourselves at the fire station on the big red trucks. The Cottage is located within walking to Borrum's Drug Store, the home of the worlds best slug burger. I cannot wait to go back and stay again. Next time, I will spend at least one day just swinging on the front porch swing."

Wasn’t able to find a few things like a scrubby for dishes or oven mits, and the wifi wasn’t working well during our stay but that was no biggie as we just wanted to unplug.

The property is beautiful. The house was clean and comfortable. It has a log cabin feel with all the amenities. Bret is great host and very responsive. We highly recommend this place to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","Top 3 Airbnb experience for me. I was reluctant to leave, which has only happened a few times. After David explained the history of the house it made sense why love is the prevailing vibe here. The kitchen had a generous supply of snacks and drinks. The recliner was very comfortable and my favorite spot. The back yard was serene and full of birds, making the screen porch my second favorite spot. Great location from which to explore Corinth and the Shiloh battlefield (20 minutes away). David and Kim provided many brochures for local attractions geared toward my interests, and also numerous restaurant recommendations. I enjoyed Pizza Grocery in Corinth and Hagy’s Catfish Hotel on the Tennessee River near Shiloh. For a unique dish local to this region, try the Slugburger at Borroum’s Drug Store in Corinth."

We will definitely reserve this house again when we make our next trek to Mississippi.

This home is amazing, though. It's an older home, and has a great blend of old and new. The bed was comfy. The decor was excellent. The sound system sounded phenomenal. My son used to run sound for bands. He's very particular about audio stuff. He was very impressed with the sound system.
I felt like I was stepping back in time to a simple way of living. We truly enjoyed ourselves and had a relaxing time. There is so much to do in Corith, which is about 15 minutes from the house. We enjoyed learning history in person!

All of our family lives out of state but even if they didn’t, we would have done that because it was perfect being able to all stay together. We hung out on the wonderful porches to visit, laugh, eat & enjoy the beautiful surroundings. She has plenty of seating outside & inside. The kitchen is perfect….very large island to set out food for serving. Our families can’t wait to come back in 2 years to stay for our other son’s graduation!"

The home is absolutely beautiful with its attention to detail and smart decor from the old oriental rugs to the fine linens on the beds and the antique furniture. Part of us are from Florida so we brought plastic pink flamingos to put in the back yard where we played ring toss. Outside we investigated the barn and took pictures of the hydrangeas planted around the house. Inside we laughed and enjoyed the warmth of the home as we reminisced about our younger days. When we decided to take a field trip into the big city (Corinth), we locked ourselves out of the home when we returned to Heart Pine Hall. Jessica came to our rescue!!!! Thank you to hour hostess! We would not hesitate to recommended Heart Pine Hall for your next reunion…"

Plenty of space for the kids fo run around - the kiddos loved exploring the outside area and we all really enjoyed swinging on the bench swing outside. The beds were a bit squeaky, the walls are thin, and the living room TV is a bit too small for the space but besides that, we enjoyed our stay!
Also- a highlight that we all loved was how easy it was to find. We checked in pretty late but the place was so easy to find because the home has a beautiful outdoor lighting system! It was an amazing sight."

The firm mattresses were perfect for our liking and having 3 1/2 bathrooms was so nice. It's located on a very peaceful property with a wonderful porch complete with double porch swings and ceiling fan above which really helps in the heat. There are pretty lights in the yard and on the wall for nighttime. It's located only 15 minutes from Corinth, MS where there are adequate grocery stores, shops and restaurants. Shiloh National Battlefield is about 25 minutes away for those who are Civil War history buffs. There are several State Parks nearby for hiking and other activities. If we ever find ourselves in the area again, we would definitely go back!"

Stayed with kids",We enjoyed this beautiful home and all of the lovely touches made it feel extra special. Jessica was a great host and gave us a lot of suggestions for things to do and places to eat. We took our son to Shiloh and spent time exploring and riding our bikes. We had a great lunch at Haggy’s Catfish hotel (we got it to go and parked by the water to eat). We could not have asked for a better weekend of relaxing in this beautiful home!! Thank you Jessica for helping to make this such a lovely getaway!! We can’t wait to come back!

Group trip","Heart Pine Hall is an absolute GEM. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this place is and how it exceeded every expectation we had. From the fresh flowers, homemade muffins, and fireplace, this place could not have been more inviting. If you are looking for a luxurious stay in a small town in the countryside then this place could not be more perfect for you. Great communication from Jessica and clear directions on check in and out made this booking so easy. One of my absolute favorite places!! Highly recommend. We plan to return in the near future."

Stayed one night","While on a work trip, my coworkers and I were so lucky to have found Heart Pine Hall! The home is simply stunning - from the spacious kitchen to the warm furnishings, and expansive porch area. Even the pecan tree by the driveway is majestic. Alas, this was a work trip, not leisure, but I enjoyed wrapping up the day's paperwork at the dining table by the fireplace. Beds were comfy, towels fluffy and communications from Jessica were warm and helpful. We would love to stay here again the next time we're in the area!"

We cooked all meals in the kitchen, played football outside, built a fire in the outdoor fireplace and enjoyed the nature views. Last year we saw turkey and deer in the backyard. This year we saw deer walking around in the early morning. We absolutely love it and will return."

There is Dollar General 5 min away, but you won’t not find meats or vegetables there. I would stay there again. If you need wi-if, make sure you ask if it’s functional. We were able to log-on, but it was not connected to the internet. We left a message with provided contact number regarding the internet, but did not get a call back."

While the property was wonderful to stay at - spacious, clean, cozy and stocked with anything/everything needed for our stay I’d like to highlight the host Vera. Her generosity, communication and thoughtfulness far surpasses any other host I have encountered. She took time to bake fresh muffins/cookies, ensured there were dog supplies for our 2 four- legged family members, spent time speaking with us on the phone after our ETA changed and left a newspaper article related to a special family event. Thank you Vera for making our stay great!"

Vera deserved 5 stars on her first guest and will only get better from here! Location is right near the heart of Corinth and anything you might need. Handy man is quick to respond and help as well. Vera goes above and beyond! Thanks again Vera!
