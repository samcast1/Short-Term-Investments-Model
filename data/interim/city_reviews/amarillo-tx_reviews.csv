Stayed with a pet",the super chief box car was our favorite place to stay out of 3 stops kn our trip. the 20 minute drive to the canyon was great and its not far from a convience store if you need quick stuff. the boxcar has been remodelled in a very tasteful way. we appreciated some of the original componets that they left with the touches of modernism. the fenced front porch area was great to let the dogs out however there is no grass in the fenced area so you will still need to walk them outside the little patio yard. it was quiet and peaceful and had great views to west and sunsets. we would love to come stay again if we are ever that way.

Patio with Adirondack chairs was awesome. Also the fenced in patio was very dog friendly. We could sit out and enjoy the evening without worrying about our dog wandering off.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for 5 nights, 4 days - AWESOME The railcar/cabin is EXACTLY as pictured. On the edge of a ranch expanse--- uninterrupted prairie views to admire. Earth and sky---and the occasional mare and foal if you're lucky. Husband was skeptical about the cabin climate (insulated?, etc....) stayed perfectly cool entire time and when cold- faux fireplace not only warmed it perfectly, but added ambiance. Just chilled in front of an LED fireplace and looked out the beautiful picture window with a hot cup of tea.
Perfectly situated between THE canyon and Canyon or even Amarillo. Breakfast each morning in town-- either at Buff's or Ranch House--- hiked the canyon and spent the evening eating dinner in Amarillo. (Husband's favorite was Big Texan so that was the spot) But the locale of the cabin made everything very driver friendly.
Becky our host was super responsive, but otherwise stayed gone. Perfect.
Clean, beautiful, relaxing-can't recommend enough and hope to return ASAP!"

The box car, “The Super Chief,” was spotless and so unique! It was a last-minute booking during our Colorado road trip, but we’re already planning to come back!
It’s just a short distance to Palo Duro Canyon, which was a fantastic day trip option during our stay. We loved sitting on the patio, stargazing by the fire pit and heater. Such a cozy and memorable stay!"

The unique experience of sleeping in a converted train car was absolutely charming and exceeded all expectations. The cozy interior was thoughtfully designed and provided all the comforts we needed after a day of hiking. The location couldn't have been better, with quick access to the park, Canyon as well as Amarillo. Our dog had a blast exploring the area with us, and we appreciated the pet-friendly amenities. Our hosts were incredibly accommodating and made sure our stay was perfect. We highly recommend this one-of-a-kind Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable adventure in Palo Duro Canyon. We can't wait to come back!"

The views from the giant picture window are great. I watched some storms roll in one evening. Becky’s place also has a pretty big and clean patio area. Perfect spot to tuck away from the wind."

Stayed with a pet","I stayed here with my husband and mini aussie when we came to town to hike in Palo Duro Canyon. The boxcar was so cute and such a unique find and it was perfect for what we needed. We love being able to hangout on the patio and watch the sun rise/set everyday and it was only a 15 min drive to Palo Duro. We chose to bring a griddle to cook on inside but they have a blackstone you could use outside. If you’re not wanting to cook though, there are plenty of restaurants within 10 min. There’s also a Walmart nearby if you’re needing anything big/food, but Becky was so great and provided a little bin of snacks and another in the bathroom with things you might need like sunscreen, bandaids, etc. which was so thoughtful. I highly recommend this to anyone stopping through or wanting somewhere t stay when going hiking!!"

There so many treats and amenities that it felt like home away from home. the private patio was additionally beautiful and spacious.

We were traveling and did not plan to stop here but the highway closed due to a storm and Becky was so incredibly helpful to get us setup here last minute. Truly nothing more you could ask for in terms of a hostess.
The place is incredible! It is such a perfect use of space - the design is excellent, incredibly clean, and beyond comfortable.
We are also traveling with our dog who could not get enough of the land, the closed in deck, seeing the horses, and the views out the big window . Her sweet farm dog, Lucy, also came by to check on us in the morning.
Even in a crazy storm, Becky’s place was incredibly inviting and comfortable. We will without a doubt stay here again when traveling through the panhandle :)"

Stayed with a pet","A must stay if looking for a place in Amarillo or Canyon! The Super Chief Boxcar is full of well-thought out details, top notch finishing touches, and offers great space, both indoors and outdoors.
You will be treated to a unique Sunrise each morning, that will be sure to set the mood for the great day ahead! At evening time, an equally unique Sunset to the West, which you can enjoy from the Adirondack chairs on the porch, or right from the cozy living room!
Your sleep will be blissful as you drift off, Stargazing up through the skylights in the super-comfy bedroom. Or, if you are lucky like we were, bask under the beams of a Full Moon throughout your peaceful slumber.
We pass through Canyon often, and look forward to our next stay in the Super Chief Boxcar! Thank you, Becky, for being a gracious and accommodating host, your property is beautiful!"

The outside patio area is under rated in my opinion. Very nice and peaceful outdoor seating area. Outstanding bonus that we were able to park in the garage. Could not have had a better experience.
The next time we are in Amarillo, I will definitely seek to stay here again. Thank you Ally."

Stayed a few nights","Really lovely place in a quiet neighbourhood, Ally went beyond what could reasonably be expected regarding amenities and friendliness.
We stayed at over a dozen air bnb s in the last month and this one was probably the best.
I cant stop finding good things to say about it - as a final touch theres a really good Restaurant in walking distance, the lazy gator.
If I ever come back to amarillo I would definitely stay here again."

The mattresses here were extremely comfortable and were good for my back. We were in Amarillo for our son’s wedding and had items in the bed of a truck and it was very convenient to be able to park in the garage so we wouldn’t have to unload them for the night. I would highly recommend staying here and wouldn’t hesitate to book again.

This residence is very clean, up to date and convenient to many local restaurants. The furniture is in great condition and is comfortable. There is an enclosed garage for you to park your car in. The host is very responsive and helpful, even stocking the refrigerator with bottled water, ice and snacks. And another reason to like this location and host is that on checkout, Ally does not have a long list of chores for her guests to do before leaving, like so many other places do. We really enjoyed our stay here and recommend this location if you need a very home-like place to stay while in Amarillo. Thanks Ally!"

Being from the Texas panhandle, we know Amarillo quite well.
I say that so others will know that it is honestly located in one of the nicest areas of Amarillo.
Love the town and the genuine down to earth people located in the Amarillo area!
Highly recommend staying here! Can’t say enough good things about it. Ally was one of the best!

Kitchen was well stocked for easy preparation of meals. Fridge was large to hold all of our groceries and drinks for our 4 night stay. Paige responded to our request in a timely manner. Enjoyed watching movies in the main living area as well as the projection screen in the spa-pool area. What a treat!

Stayed with kids","My family and I really enjoyed this place. But there were a few things that didn’t mean our expectations. We couldn’t get most of the TV’s to work. (Only the one in the master bedroom worked). The pool had a bunch of floating stuff from their plants that are near the pool. We had scooped them out as we swam.
We also didn’t like that we had to pay $400 extra dollars on top of what we had already paid bc we had day visitors. I can understand if it was refundable, but it wasn’t. We cleaned up and did everything expected of us. Other than that, it was an amazing get away💖 and I recommend your family staying🥰"

Stayed with kids",The only issue we had was the extra bedroom we downstairs if the poolroom was to hot to stay in and sleep in due to it’s location in the pool room which had to stay at 80+ degrees. We had a minor issue with a toilet backup in the pool room that eventually leaked down into the extra bedroom. But we notified the host and she was quick to respond and asked us if she needed to send anyone which was great but we took care of the toilet issue so no worries. Other than that the house had an amazing layout and we all had a great time.

Stayed with kids","An amazing place to stay in Amarillo. We booked last minute as a place to stay and gather with local family for a funeral service, and it was perfect. The beds are very comfortable, there were so many towels, and everything we needed was stocked in the kitchen. The pool was perfect entertainment on a cold January day for my niece and nephew, and we had a family video about our grandmother who had passed up on the projector screen when we shared pictures and told stories after the services. It was really an amazing spot.
The house manual is incredibly detailed, which isn’t easy with multiple tv/projector/sound systems, and we were able to work all of the tvs and speakers. Checkout instructions are clear and easy. Checkin was a ring code setup just for me.
One of the king bedrooms is very warm because it is in the spa deck, but Paige was sure to tell us this before we booked and everything was exactly as described. Would book again 10/10z"

Sometimes it’s hard to get away but also just need some time out of our home spending quality time together with nothing to worry about. This home was that for us. Clean, spacious, relaxing, calming, and didn’t even feel like we were near home. The set up was perfect and we appreciated the little details. The mineral spa room made it feel like we were on a tropical vacation and was a total boost for our souls during the winter stuck inside due to the cold."

The pool is perfect for relaxing and not too deep for kids to swim in. Watching a movie while floating in the pool has altered our idea of movie night forever. :-) We had a few questions regarding the spa area, and the property managers and owners were very quick to respond and help us. The bedding was very nice. As an FYI, the bed in the owners' suite is firm. The beds in the other two bedrooms are softer. There is a good assortment of comfy pillows. We didn't use the basement bedroom, so I can't speak to that one. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay in a very lovely home!"

Stayed with kids","First, this place is simply gorgeous. The owners did not leave out even one detail. It was nice arriving to home and having the music playing throughout. It was so welcoming. The beds and amenities were the best that we had encountered at an AirBnB. They thought of literally everything. My only call out for future guests would be to make sure those in your party know the rules and that you keep the doors closed in the spa. When I told my family that spa needed to stay at a certain temp, they just thought not to touch the thermostat but never thought about doors being left open. Even so, the host and manager were kind. I was freaking out that it changed and they were very kind.
Paige, the manager, was so responsive and actually called us before we got there to check in. The owners responded to our questions and even left a little gift for us. Beautiful home & great hosts. Thank you for making our family weekend special."

The pool and hot tub was a great amenity and all of the signage and instructions left for us made it really easy to get around and get along with the entire home. Truly a healing environment from the second you walk in. We catered in Rosa's, had a cake made by The Ruffled Cup, and hired Amazing Hands By Monica Venske to come to the house and give massages to all of us. I just can't say enough how incredibly necessary it is to disconnect and have downtime. This house made it all possible. The showers are so upscale and huge. The kitchen was big with lots of counter space. The smell when you arrive and the oils and diffusers available to keep that spa environment alive. The gifts and fruit basket. The fridge by the pool. All of it contributed to the convenience and comfort. I loved this experience and so did Mom!!"

As tenured airbnbers this was our absolute favorite place!
So impressed with all the details throughout the house that kept it on theme without making it cheesy.
The hot tub under the stars was fantastic and breathtaking.
The location was gorgeous, serene, and secluded without having to drive too far outside of a major city.
We had fun playing the provided mini golf, laying out in the hammocks, rocking in the chairs on the wrap around upper deck porch, and gathering around fire pit. There was also a grill and a tent provided, that we unfortunately didn’t have time to use. Ches provided so many amenities that it was easy to stay-in and vacation there without just making it a landing spot after driving to other destinations on our getaway.
Ches was the perfect host, was excellent at prompt communication, and you could tell he wanted to make sure all his guest have the best time at his “Saloon”.
We already want to be back!"

The outdoor space is just as charming and was so peaceful and quiet, which is what we were looking for. We enjoyed laying in the hammocks, the hot tub and we were able to grill while we were there. The property is just as described, but even more lovely in person! Chesley was an amazing host! Welcoming, great with communication and he provided clear instructions for everything. We would definitely love to visit the Sunset Saloon for a longer stay in the future!"

Stayed one night","Chesley's Happy Saloon tiny home was just as promised. It was very thoughtfully decorated in a Western theme and had lots of amenities to make the stay comfortable and relaxing. The skylight above the bed where one can look at the stars, along with the cozy electric fireplace in the loft bedroom, lends to a contemplative ambience. The outdoor fire pit would be great for making S'mores with the kids. Too bad I didn't have them with me, but hopefully on another trip. The tiny home is in a quiet area where the stars are your company. It makes for a great stay! I hope to make another stay there. Chesley is a great host! He communicates well, is responsive, and obviously takes great care of his place. He was a pleasure to deal with."

How to even fit into words how much we loved this place will be a challenge. Ches’s place was amazing and more than I had even imagined! His attention to detail around the place as well as with the reservation and stay its self was phenomenal. My husband and I throughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and even wrote a song together while there (musicians). We have already started planning to come back when it’s warmer and we can utilize more of the outdoor amenities besides just the amazing hot tub. I’ve also started sending the link to the Sunset Saloon to other friends in this area as well as those farther away that have started a “wish list” of unique Airbnb locations they want to visit. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay; from the location, amenities, cleanliness and responsiveness of the host than what received at the saloon!"

The country western aesthetic is so much cuter in person and the pictures already look great. We definitely want to come back and stay again. It was so peaceful and at night you can see rabbits on the property. The stars were also crazy beautiful out there because of the lack of light pollution.
So peaceful and warm. 10/10 stay for sure and I’m recommending to everyone. I hardly ever write long reviews but this was worth it."

Everything was clean, tidy, and even better than I thought it would be. We had up to 50mph wind gusts two days/nights, so it wasn’t ideal for being outside, but once the wind died down, we hung out on the patio and it was great.
Coffee in the morning watching the sunrise and a glass of wine at night watching the sunset and seeing the stars was a peaceful break I needed. My kids have asked to make this actually trip."

Stayed a few nights","The Sunset Saloon is very cool! Very peaceful place to relax and getaway. The only downside is it is farther from Palo Duro state park and Amarillo than we thought based off the listing. Palo duro is about a 35/40 minute drive and depending on where in Amarillo you’re going it’s 45 minutes. Not a deal breaker but was farther than we were hoping from Palo Duro. Otherwise the stay was great, lots of little wildlife around and beautiful view of the stars on a clear night. Ches was super helpful and quick to answer any questions!"

Stayed with kids",Absolute gem! - one of the best AirBnB experiences we’ve ever had! 100% worth the drive being a little outside Amarillo. You will appreciate the seclusion and quiet under the stars at night. I couldn’t believe Ches had only been hosting for a month. His place was more refined and thoughtful than most AirBnBs. I hope this place gets features in the magazine because it is clearly a work of love for the host and his attention to detail pervades the experience. We are absolutely coming back and I am recommending it to everyone.

The decor perfectly encapsulated the essence of a Wild West saloon, transporting us back in time with its authenticity. Chesley's exceptional hospitality was the cherry on top, as they consistently went the extra mile to ensure our comfort.
Nestled in a peaceful location, the tiny home provided a perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The upper-level patio became a sanctuary for stargazing, enhancing the charm of this unique getaway. Strongly recommend this unique Airbnb for a truly memorable escape."

Stayed one night","We were lucky that this place was available at the time of looking. Reserved the day off and was confirmed immediately. I did however did not realize to check my email for the code for the key pad but the host answered my call immediately! (Sorry about that again!)My wife and I were traveling with out 4 month old daughter and a U-haul trailer and needed a space to park where we felt it would be safe too. The barnaminium was in a great private location on the hosts property. And after a long drive seeing those soft fresh cookies was such an amazing touch. My family and I were very comfortable in the space and happy to see the trailer was safe as well. Very private, never saw hosts and felt safe as I saw cameras on the property. I cant say enough so I'll leave it with it was perfect for us and what we needed."

I found the barn ideal for travelling into Amarillo from the West - after a long day's driving, it is easy to find and nice that its before the town. Inside, the barn is totally quiet and peaceful and the perfect place for sleeping soundly. The beers in the fridge and the freshly baked cookies were the icing on the cake, and I enjoyed these while watching the sun set from the porch."

The kitchen was very well-equipped, and the outdoor area looked lovely but we didn't have time to enjoy it.
We enjoyed looking through the book of photographs with marvellous views that was left on the breakfast bar, Jim Davies is a skilful photographer - We love a sunset! We also met Lillie the Labrador who was fab."

They had all the comforts- different thickness of bed pillows, super soft blankets, dryer sheets, good blow dryer, mugs in the freezer/beer in the fridge, snacks, and a free pic of a local artist’s sunset sky behind a barn. This was my first airbnb where the dishes didn’t have to be rewashed before I ate off from them, as they had a dishwasher. Everything was labeled so you could find it easily. There are charging cords with 4 adapters by both sides of the bed. Definitely worth the money and I would definitely rebook. Thanks for having us!"

The quality of the fixtures and fittings is on par with any high end hotel and all the little extra touches that they have thought of were so appreciated and made the stay extra special. Joe particularly liked the iced beer glasses and just had to give them a go. If you forget your toothbrush or other toiletry items don’t panic there are spares of these items offered. We are just sad that this was only a one night stay as we were just passing through on our Road trip USA.
We booked very last minute and Michael and Terri accommodated us.
The location is so peaceful and we would definitely stay again if over this way again."

It is stocked with snacks, clean and comfortable (they have a white noise machine), and the patio is the perfect place to spend the morning (I’m sure the evening is nice too, but I pulled in around 10pm).
About 10 minutes from town it allowed me to keep my bikes attached to my car while making it so picking up food, coffee, etc the next morning was still easy. Love this place!"

The animals there have no fear, there was times when i didn't even realize 6 deers watching me from less than 10ft away. Rabbita occasionally jump out of the bushes to surprise you. The property is so quiet i saw more animals than people. The barn was so nice and cozy. Would stay again"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great price and cozy stay! You feel right at home and end up not wanting to leave. The backyard view is amazing! It is very close to many things to do in Amarillo.
The only thing is I wish I knew that the Airbnb was so close to the owners house. It is connected to it on the same driveway. But don’t let that scare you, it is a amazing place!! The owners keep to themselves you don’t even see them or run into them. I just didn’t want anyone to get caught off guard like we were.
We are already planning our next trip and we are planning to stay there again. It is one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in!"

It was in a lovely and quiet neighborhood with big beautiful trees and there were groceries & restaurants just 3-4 minutes away. The beds were extremely comfortable and great pillows too. When you’re not in your own bed this makes a huge difference! The decor was so cozy, but still modern and very clean. Just wish we could put this place in all the cities we’re stopping through and it would be perfect!
One other thing was they had a closet full of fun toys and our 3 littles had a blast! That was special because you can’t pack many toys on a road trip!"

Stayed with kids",This was a fantastic place for our family to gather for Christmas. It felt like we were right at home. There was never a time when we didn’t have whatever we needed- Connie has thought of everything! I hope we are able to reserve this home again in our future stays in Amarillo! Thank you for a wonderful place for good memories!

Stayed a few nights","In my wife’s words, this place is so cute”. We came in that evening and the porch lighting was on and welcoming. What stood out the most were the simply and kind gestures. The temperature was unusually cold for that time of year. We were given access to the garage to park our car and the use of the gas fireplace. When stepping into this property it felt like a home; “our home”. The Christmas decorations again another touch making the property into a home. We look forward to staying at this home again in the near future when visiting family in the area."

Stayed about a week","I travel each week for my profession and I must say this is one of the best AirBnB’s I have rented. The communication between Connie and me was prompt and helpful. The check-in was easy and I actually had to call her late at night because my flight was delayed and my GPS took me to the wrong house. She helped me to find/identify the house late at night.
The house itself was comfortable and felt very homey. Every detail was thought of by Connie. The bed was comfortable with nice pillows. The bath towels were soft and fluffy. I loved the warm blankets in the living room, especially since the temperature was in the low forties.
I just cannot express how great this place is. I will definitely be back."

A cute little table in the dining area just for the littles, pack and play ready to go, and the bunks in the room adjacent to the master are perfect for those traveling with small kids.
Super clean, super comfortable bed, everything you expect with good AirBNBers. These people are pros.
They even changed the front door code to match my phone number to make it easy to remember.
100% would rent again."

Super clean, quiet area, awesome outside patio area especially at night with the lights! Bedrooms and bathrooms were spacious and had great linens and unexpected toiletry items you may forget to pack! The best part for me was the house was super kid friendly and as a mother I was able to actually rest and enjoy the time staying at Connie’s because there were toys, a kid table, TVs with accessible kid shows when you need that moment, and room for them to run around on the back patio. Thank you Connie for having such a wonderful home that made me feel at home!"

This is a fantastic home clean with all the amenities and supplies we needed.
We are very pleased that the home is no pet and no smoking as I have allergies to both. I would like to see AIrBNB have a filter to allow us to request no pet and no smoking homes.
Thank you for a wonderful stay. We’ll be back!"

This was our first time to Amarillo and we thought the location was perfect. It was not too far away from the grocery or restaurants but far away enough to feel secluded. If we are ever in Amarillo was will definitely stay at the Blue Quail again."

From a welcome sign with our name on it, to makeup wipes, granola bars, sidewalk chalk for the kids and cold water- there is nothing these hosts haven’t thought of.

The boys stayed out until 10:00 pm exploring the rocks and cliffs. We saw Quail, a horned toad, and lots of other critters. The cottage was perfect for us - spacious, very clean, well decorated, modern, private, and offering all the comforts of home. After two weeks in the mountains, we thought our vacation was over, but it turned into another night of making memories with beautiful views and in a unique cottage. Thanks Colby!"

Even though we didn’t use the laundry facility it was an extra we thought made this property a set up!
And my two youngest didn’t want to leave the adorable bunk loft to even eat during our stay. A wonderful place to relax, enjoy family time, and experience the beauty of the Texas panhandle!"

We wish we had planned to stay in the area longer and had more time to enjoy the cabin- but this was a layover for us on a longer road trip. It was a perfect layover- there was everything we needed and more. We loved the look of the cast iron stove and the colorful animal paintings. The changing room was a game changer with four kids- it was the perfect place to store everyone’s gear and get everyone ready in the morning. Colby was a prompt and polite communicator. If we pass thru this way again, we will definitely be stopping at the Blue Quail!"

It is close to a small airport, we heard air traffic occasionally but not a nuisance. The house is an easy drive to most everything in Amarillo, 15-20 minutes to downtown. Local grocery store (Walmart) is within 5 minutes. Living area and beds were comfortable. Alek was very quick to respond, friendly and helpful."

The most important extra for me was the access to the garage. That is why I chose this home over others. I had my two grandsons with me, and it was a very secure feeling to just drive in late at night, close the garage door, and be able to come and go to my car with it safely enclosed. Easy access to Walmart, gas, The Canyon, and the DCI competitions was a plus, also.
We will definitely stay here again if we get to come back this way!"

Darla is a very gracious host. She responds immediately to all messages and keeps in touch to ensure we have everything we need.
The surrounding area is quiet and peaceful with many grassy areas to walk our pup.
The cottage is exactly as pictured on the Airbnb site. It is spacious, with a fully equiped kitchen, nicely furnished living room, and very comfortable king size bed. Most importantly, it is spotless! Also, it was quite handy to have a full size clothes washer and dryer in the unit to catch up on our laundry. Overall, highly recommend."

The fenced-in dog area was a very thoughtful added feature! I was able to play with my doggo and let him burn off some energy there. The kitchen was well stocked, and our host set out snacks and had coffee and tea k-cups at-the-ready! It was obvious that this host truly cares about their property and the comfort of their guests.
Everything we wanted to do, from dinner at the Big Texan, spraying graffiti at Cadillac Ranch, a visit to the Route 66 Visitor Center, visiting the Amarillo Museum of Art, hiking at Palo Duro Canyon, and playing with our dog at the John Stiff Memorial Dog Park are all less than a 30 minute drive from here! There are lots of great food places like Big Jim's Pizza, and of course all the favorite food chains within a 20-30 minute drive.
Highly recommend! Thank you, Darla!"

Darla is very responsive to messages and phone calls. The kitchen was squeaky clean, but missed having some coffee creamers. I wish I asked to see if the backyard is accessible from the building, as you'll have to go via front door to go outside to access the backyard. Also wished that there's a motion sensor light so I could see in the dark as it's quite dark in the dog run. It's a chain link type fence. I couldn't tell from the pictures of the listing. Hope this information is helpful for other travelers with dogs, but if you don't care about it, or just humans, her place is perfect!"

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I (and our Cockapoo pup) drive to Phoenix each year, and we always spend 2 nights in Amarillo. This was our first stay in Darla’s ‘Cozy Country Cottage’ and it has easily become our favourite Airbnb in Amarillo thus far. We enjoyed it so much that we have already booked a return stay in May.
Darla is a very gracious host. She responded immediately to all messages and kept in touch to ensure we had everything we needed.
The surrounding area is quiet and peaceful. After a long drive, we enjoyed relaxing with a drink on the front porch. Entering the cottage, we immediately felt at home. This ‘cottage’ is pleasantly more of a cozy home than a rustic cabin. The vaulted ceilings in the living room and the master bedroom give the place a spacious feel. The recliner sofa in the living room was clean and very comfortable. The king size bed felt like a cushiony cloud with soft white sheets, and we slept very soundly. Most importantly, the place was spotless. Highly recommend."

The kitchen is well equipped and the refrigerator is a Kenmore brand that we like. My husband was quite impressed with the home. It was like a gem, a rare find. The area is quiet and peaceful. It is outside of the busy city streets. I like the fact it is all on one floor, so bringing in our luggage, food, etc was easy. We wish we could stay longer to enjoy the house and porch swing more."

It was so pleasant and peaceful, such a treat for us! The bed slept comfortably. The bathrooms were very clean and all the accommodations were complete, she seems to have thought of everything. We felt very welcomed and would definitely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","I was moving across the country so it was a pit stop for us. Very comfortable for our needs. Everything about the place was great. Darla was very responsive and everything was listed out instruction wise. The only less than great part was finding it. The directions to the property were off. You had to go to where the address was then down a dirt road and then to the circle drive where the house was. In the dark it made it rather difficult to find.
Otherwise very worth the price."

Stayed with a pet","My gal and I had been on a 2 week road trip through the southwest and back again, and wanted to spend the day at Palo Duro. When we arrived, we were so happy to see how wonderful this house was.
It's tucked out of the way from Amarillo, but super easy access to both Palo Duro and the always fun Cadillac Ranch.
The house is immaculate, and has all the amenities you and your family will need. Quiet and peaceful, with an amazingly comfortable king bed, you'll enjoy sitting on the porch swings listening to the ducks and turkeys and roosters across the courtyard while inside the house is perfectly quiet.
Jump on this place if you can. You won't regret it, and the hosts leave little goodies all over the house for you to enjoy.
Will absolutely stay here again on our next trip to the panhandle!"

Everything that we would have available at home was available to us here! Every appliance was in tip top shape and having tvs in each bedroom and the main living area was such a bonus! The front porch with the beautiful outdoor furniture was so enjoyable to us! We will definitely return! We hope to making staying in Darla’s place a tradition! If Spotless and immaculate is important, this is the perfect place!!!"

My husband and I included Canyon, TX in our road trip so we could go hike at Palo Duro state park and we wanted somewhere peaceful to stay. The Boxcar was clean and quiet. There is honeysuckle planted around the property and we were lucky to be there while it was blooming, it smelled amazing. The hottub was great after our day hiking. We watched rabbits and quail from the patio in the mornings and evenings. There were neighbors closer than expected from the pictures but that was the only minor downfall. It was still quiet the entire time we were there."

Stayed one night","Staying in this beautifully converted 1904 refrigerator boxcar was an exceptional experience, offering a stunning view of Amarillo's plains from the comfort of a modernized, rustic interior. The indulgence of a hot tub under the expansive Texas sky, both day and night, was a true highlight. The shower room stands out, with its original refrigerator wall and floor that retain the boxcar's historical charm.
There are two minor points to note about the shower room: firstly, managing the levers to adjust the shower temperature can be a bit tricky, and secondly, the stylish custom-made shower head delivers a straight downward pour, which might not suit you if you prefer to keep your hair dry. Despite these nuances, the boxcar's charm and uniqueness make it an essential destination for anyone in search of a retreat that's far from the ordinary."

Stayed with a pet","This was such a lovely, peaceful place to spend the night on a long road trip. I usually end up in Lubbock or Amarillo since the hotels are nicer than most small towns, but those are pretty boring cities and, with pet fees, get pricey for my frugal budget.
Brian's boxcar was about the same price, but under a giant sky with a ton of privacy including an awesome private hot tub!
Best of both worlds, there was still a nearby town with a giant grocery store a short drive away."

Stayed one night","I had an incredible stay at Bryan's Boxcar Airbnb in Canyon, TX! The clear instructions he provided made check-in a breeze, and his attention to detail in outlining guest expectations was much appreciated. The boxcar itself is a treasure trove of history, and the peaceful, private setting creates a serene atmosphere that's perfect for a getaway. Bryan's hospitality (he responds quickly) truly made this a five-star experience. My husband and I stayed on our way out west, and we truly could not have asked for a more unique experience. It snowed while we were there, and looking out to the pasture from the hot tub with snow falling all around was remarkable! Wonderful experience."

Stayed with a pet","A unique stay that we appreciated. I was worried about its remoteness but the property is less than 15 minutes from Canyon that has a great selection of restaurants (highly recommend Mickeys on 5th Ave). But if you wanted to cook your own food, there is a hot plate under the cabinet. And of course the grill, which we didn’t get a chance to use. We didn’t use the hot tub so can’t comment on that. A heads up to other tall people, the queen bed will not be comfortable for two tall people. One? Yes. Two? No.
Overall it is a great property, great host, and was what we needed for a quick stay as we visited Palo Duro."

I don’t think the pictures do the space much justice but I was a bit surprised to see how spacious it really was, everything extremely neat and easy to find, and a very comfortable bed.

The property does feel very safe and secured, we were able to enjoy our nights in the hot tub with the occasional visit from the rabbits.
Again we are very grateful to have spent our first wedding anniversary here and we hope to spend some more in the future here!

Stayed with a pet","What a cool space! Private and off the beaten path with the enormous Texas sky above. The space is unique and has such a cool history. It is clean and everything is well-apointed. The linens are clean and the bed is very comfortable. We enjoyed a cooking a steak on the grill and then soaking in the hot tub under the stars. Keep in mind that you are in the country when you book. The panhandle winds are there, but the box car is situated as a bit of a wind break. The good thing about it is that you don't even need a towel when you get out of the hot tub! The flies made their presence known during our stay, but it was not unbearable and the host has made sure that there is a fly zapper and old-fashioned fly swatter for use by the guests. If you want a unique and comfortable stay in the Texas panhandle, book this with confidence."

It was cloudy upon arrival and we only had it uncovered for a short period of time while 1 of us used it and the cover was immediately replaced. We read the stay instructions and followed them all including respecting all requests. I almost took a picture of the cloudy water for fear of being blamed for it, but I had too much faith in the hosts. Cool place but wouldn’t recommend staying with hosts who are dishonest."

The flys were relentless and there were bugs crawling everywhere we looked inside. The boxcar has such great potential.

Stayed one night","Unfortunately we did not end up staying the night. Upon arrival around 1am, we immediately had several strange interactions with the neighbors including hearing voices very closeby on our property which was isolated with no nearby neighbors. When we called the host to ask about something strange we encountered, he gave us a vague answer that left us feeling more unsettled. This along with the swarming bugs all over the front door left us feeling uncomfortable, and since we needed a good night's sleep, we just decided to stay in a hotel. The host never followed up with us afterward, but communication prior to that was good. The place did seem very accurate to how it was described. I believe it would be possible to have a good stay there, but our experience just left us feeling weird."

Stayed a few nights","We really loved the setting and idea of this stay. As international travellers we were keen for the remote setting and experience, but felt that a few things could have been improved.
-The towels provided are very old and need replacing.
-There are only a couple of mugs available and one of them had a handle broken off completely, and knives are blunt
-I had asked for the fold out couch to be made up on booking, this hadn’t been done.
-I had asked if the washer and dryer were available for use and was told they were. On arrival they were set up with washing liquid pre-added for the end of stay wash. We completed our washing but also had to empty the lint filter on the dryer as this clearly hadn’t been done in a long time and posed a fire hazard.
-the wifi didn’t work for us (password wasn’t accepted), which we did communicate at the time to our host
We were also a bit surprised about the tasks we were asked to complete to vacate, given the cost of the two night stay."

Stayed with a pet","The experience was unique and that is what we were looking for. Unfortunately, the area had experienced lots of rain lately and then a heat wave which was the perfect storm for flies. During our stay we were unable to use the hot tub or sit outside do to the number of flies (hundreds) that would swarm and bite you. They would also enter the boxcar every time the slider was opened and the next 40 or so minutes was spent killing flies. The towels provided were extremely thin and worn (should be replaced. Cleanliness could be better, but again you are located on a ranch and in West Texas. We are in the midst of a 60 day road trip (all stays in AirBnb’s) and I felt the cost for what we experienced was overpriced compared to where we have been and where we are going. Canyon is close as well as Palo Duro. This was one of the stays my wife and I were so excited for, unfortunately the fly situation (out of Brian’s control) put a damper on the whole stay."

He spent half the time exploring every detail of the construction of the original car and how it was turned into the house it is today. We both throughly enjoyed the peace and quit of the location, and the best part was the stargazing at night from the hot tub while also getting to watch the lightening from a storm WAY off in the distance.

Stayed a few nights","The boxcar is in a lovely remote location in a wide open field; there are other houses and farm buildings in the distance, but nothing super close. It was very cool to be out on the Texas plains! The bed was comfortable. Amenities are basic, especially for the price (e.g., old/thin/kind of musty towels; minimal toiletries; guitar was missing a string). You have to take your linens & towels to a separate building and start the washer on checkout, despite a cleaning fee.
We had an extremely windy thunderstorm during our stay; water leaked in around the windows, door, and A/C but not into the main area of the boxcar itself.
Accessibility notes: the hot tub cover is *very* heavy (which is needed because of how windy it can get). We were able to use it without a problem, but if you have any mobility issues or constraints, you may not be able to get the cover off. Watch your footing near the bed; there are sunken metal areas next to the bed and it would be easy to trip"

There was even a guitar at the location for guests to play, which was a pleasant surprise."

Stayed with a pet","Great experience at the boxcar! We arrived with a storm in the distance. After a long day on the road, a dip in the hot tub was the perfect end to the day. As we got ready to go inside, the storm clouds made for an amazing sunset.
The boxcar was well furnished and comfortable. The shower was awesome and unique. The layout is minimalist, but perfect for a night on the plains.
The storm rolled through, and the wind moving around the exterior of the boxcar made it sound like you were rolling down the tracks, but there was no movement at all in the car itself.
We only stayed for a night, but would love to come back for a longer visit to explore the canyon lands more fully.
Thanks for a great stop/stay Brian!"

Stayed with a pet","When we checked into the Airbnb, it was filled with giant moths and flies. There were over 60 moths swarming around; we had to run out.
After a 11 hour drive, all we wanted to do was sleep and maybe spend some time in the hot tub. Instead, my party spent the next 3 hours killing and swatting the infestation. We hardly slept because we just felt icky.
This was an awful and disappointing experience."

Stayed with a pet","We chose the boxcar because it was different & the idea seemed pretty neat. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with everything it had to offer. It was the perfect space for 2 & had everything we needed for our stay. We loved the rustic boxcar theme & we were so glad to have picked this place to stay in. The host left great instructions and there was nothing to assume. We will be back soon!
For those who are in town to visit Palo Duro Canyon, this is a perfect location and is only perhaps 12-15 mins away from the canyon. It is also located maybe 5-7 minutes from the town of Canyon & its gas stations/grocery stores/etc."

Due to the nature of our visit, he extended our check out time which allowed us to get proper rest. An excellent stay, will go back to show Fiancé some day!"

Stayed one night","This was great for a quick staycation and definitely held up to the privacy and quietness it promised. The stars were absolutely beautiful as there is little light pollution. The bed was comfy and the shower setup is pretty cool- definitely a good experience. While we enjoyed our stay— the Hot Tub, being a big reason we chose to stay here ended up being a big reason for disappointment. The patio area to include the hot tub really just needs some TLC. The poor repairs to the hot tub and the floating bits of paint/whatever the material the cover is made of was off-putting, even after we thoroughly used the net. The topper is extremely worn and the underside of it has material quite literally chipping and falling into the tub. In hopes these are addressed soon, this is a really neat place with a lot
of history and is absolutely worth the stay!"

Stayed with a pet","I arrived at night so I followed the gps and it took me to a house. I messaged the host and right after, I think it was the host that ran outside to let us know how to get there. I didn’t see any directions saying to go to the next driveway and follow it back. Maybe there was and I missed it? After I checked out, I realized an hour later I might have dropped my credit card on the property so I messaged him to see if he could let me know. I never got any response back. Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay. Great location for photos, serenity, scenery, etc. the place smelled great and seemed clean. The shower is awesome and got hot fast!"

Stayed with a pet","Overall, this was a lovely stay. The boxcar looks like the pictures and reading the history of it was neat. The inside was spotless and very cute. The bed was comfortable. The shower was cool, and had plenty of hot water for two quick showers. The hot tub was a fun amenity and perfect to get in after two days of hiking A few flags - the hosts weren't the quickest to communicate on the app, so if you anticipate needing anything, I would make .sure to ask in advance. We asked the night before we left if we could leave our things at the boxcar until 12 (checkout is 11) so we didn't need to leave valuables in the car for our last hike, but didn't hear back before leaving. You are asked to take the sheets to the wash/start the washer and take out the trash. Finally, as the pictures show you, you are surrounded by fields. So, even though the place is very clean, there are traps to catch mice/bugs/etc. under the sink/by the trash. Not a huge issue, but I'm very sensitive to things like that"

Group trip","We had a wonderful care free time! We have friends who rent as well and they told us that they prefer their clients let them know of any details to help them evaluate the cleaning staff or performance of the appliances. We found a few dirty pans that may have been the result of previous quests not rinsing dishes well enough prior to putting them in the dishwasher or the house cleaners not catching them when they unloaded the dishwasher. The kitchen had ample tools to prepare food, pots, pans, dishes, knives etc… but needs a can opener. There were a few areas of wear that is normal, but didn’t take away from the comfort and fun we had! Great house, we’d love to visit again, thank you for providing a wonderful stay away from home!"
