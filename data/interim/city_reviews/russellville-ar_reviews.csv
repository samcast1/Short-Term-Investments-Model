I’d definitely recommend staying here for the price and how beautiful the place is. Bringing your kids is even better because of the rooms and places to sleep. Thank you Rudy for a safe and very comfortable stay"

If there was to be one negative it was low water pressure, but that seems to be normal for the area, and out of the hosts control.
Great house, responsive host, will stay again if we come back to Lake Dardanelle."

Stayed with kids","Quincy Cove was in a nice, quiet neighborhood right in the middle of town. Great alternative to a hotel when traveling with kids. Our boys loved the bunk room and used the large empty garage space as a playroom. The only thing I would mention is there were no washcloths. I must have missed that in the listing. So, throw your own in your suitcase or make a quick trip to Dollar Tree for a 5 pack and you’re covered. We had a great experience in this home and already have it booked for 2 more work trips."

Stayed with kids",The place was absolutely beautiful. It was simple but just what we like. It was right on the water so at night it was so peaceful to sit out and listen to the crickets chirp and our kids had an absolute blast exploring the backyard! It was super close to the lake so we were able to enjoy it all morning come in for lunch and then go back and enjoy it even more that evening!! Great host Larry was very friendly and answered any questions we had. The place was very private no one bothered us at all so I definitely recommend if you just want a peaceful get a way or if you want a peaceful getaway and enjoy the lake both!

Stayed a few nights","BEST PLACE EVER ! We stumbled upon the Tri-Peaks area last year and fell in love with it .So much ,that we decided to spend our 25th anniversary here. Larry's cabin was perfect choice for our get away .Beautifully situated on lake with stunning views where we peacefully watched varieties of water fowl ( including white pelicans ),boats and even eagles fly by.The cabin itself was so cozy and fully stocked with more than you could imagine .Cabin is centrally located to so many attractions. I don't know of anywhere else you can be fishing 1 minute and 15 minutes later be sitting atop a mountain ( Mt. Nebo ).Larry is the nicest person ,suggested restaurants and checked in on us periodically to see if we needed anything ( which we didn't since he literally thought of everything!)He is genuinely about making your stay the best .We stayed for 5 nights and wish we could stay longer .We will definitely be back !"

He even pre filled the fire pit and it was super easy to light and enjoy. I had plenty of privacy and beautiful views. I could have stayed on the deck the entire time. One of the most enjoyable Airb&bs I’ve stayed in.

Group trip","This place is a perfect example why I love Airbnb. It was quite literally, a home away from home with everything we didn’t know we needed.
We made a group trip for my husbands 30th birthday party, only 6 of us ended up coming but this house was absolutely perfect for the relaxing weekend we were looking for. We came for a golfing trip, but got so much more. The house had everything we needed, from cooling off after our day on the course to being able to cook breakfast and grill when we wanted. All the beds were comfortable, great showers, air, TV, grill and fire pit. And the cornhole and yard darts were just a plus. I was really worried about not bringing any “other” things to do while in the house, this made our nights so much more fun! Highly recommend for a relaxing weekend get away."

The location is convenient to Russelville restaurants, the Ozark National Forest, and the Hot Springs and Ouachita National forest areas. We drove to all and came back at night to this great house. Arriving, we were greeted by two rocking chairs on the front porch. Inside, the house was immaculate, tastefully decorated, and completely updated. Very quiet inside. Edward and Bonnie provided every amenity, including fresh fruit and snacks and every kitchen utensil or appliance you might need. The coffeepot accommodates both drip and pods, so perfect! Plenty of plates, bowls, cups, and flatware. New appliances, including laundry. Pods were provided. Plenty of towels and washcloths. Our kids enjoyed the firepit outside. It was too cold to use the grill and patio, but those would be great in warmer weather. If you're looking for a home base to explore Arkansas, this is it!"

We can definitely recommend this accommodation and would gladly come back anytime. Thank you for everything."

Our host provided us with a travel crib for our baby and set a fire in the outdoor fire pit one evening for us. It was great hospitality provided to us and we would go back again if ever in the area.

Stayed a few nights","We made this trip for the eclipse. We were drawn to the idea of a farm setting, hoping there would be open skies in the event that predictions of overcrowding were true. Property was well kept, landscaped, and encourages time in the outdoors. Our hosts did so many extra things to make this a meaningful experience. The barn house was clean, well appointed, all the basics for kitchen/lt meal prep, comfortable beds, right off a Hwy just outside of town. On request, Thomas set up a campfire we used one evening. They asked our interests and made lots of suggestions for our 4 day stay. Even made a run to a restaurant for us the day of the eclipse when town swelled with visitors. Can’t say enough about this lovely stay. I highly recommend this listing!"

We enjoyed visiting with the horses and the chickens every day. Every place in the barn was spotless and was as if we were the first ones to ever stay there. We didn’t mind the trains running by. The kids loved it and I thought it added to the vibe. If we are ever in the area again I won’t think twice about where we will be staying. The Hale Homestead is perfection. The most magical Christmas we’ve had in awhile. Thank you again Thomas!

The place was beautifully decorated, and all the decorations were practical. I really appreciate how open and the space is, it invited people to sit and chat before heading off to bed. The horses were very friendly and like to come watch us when we drove up. If you have a medium size family stay here, you will be ecstatic you did. The only thing of note is trains come by frequently and they are close. We didn't mind but it is something to note if you are sensitive to such things."

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place to stay. Not quite as out of the way as a lot of these types of places but very easy to find off a main road which gets you back into town quicker. Place was clean and very well decorated. In fact, it led us to make a few decisions regarding our own place while we were there. As stated in the description, the train does come through and it does like to blow its horn. Outside of that there really isn't anything negative to say. We would have liked to spend some time on the deck or using the fire pit, but the weather did not cooperate for our time there. Nevertheless, we can always come back and I'm sure we eventually will. Don't hesitate if you need a place in the area or just want to get out of the city for a few days. Nothing here disappoints."

There is a train that comes by periodically - it's a little loud, but I did get used to it - and it didn't cause any issues for me. There is plenty of parking for your truck/boat/trailer. The house is right in the host's backyard - they are extremely nice and I only saw them when I arrived and when I left. I was out most of the time pre-fishing - so I wasn't home a whole lot except to sleep and shower. 10/10 recommend. Would def come back again!"

Stayed with kids","Juan‘s place is a beautiful recently remodeled home with all of the amenities you could possibly ask for. My group had a spacious living room with which to socialize and watch TV along with two bathrooms and three bedrooms that offered plenty of privacy from one another. All of the appliances are brand new smart, home appliances. It was kind of funny having the TV notify us that our laundry was done or that the stove or oven was turned on or warm. It’s a wonderful place that we plan to reuse for our travels next time we are in town. Thank you so much, Juan, for all the hard work you put into the place and being such a great host."

The only small issue was a few of the coffee cups had stains in them from a previous guest. I just rewashed them before using them. Otherwise the place was spotless and well appointed. I will stay here again when I visit Russellville.

We were close to all the hikes we wanted to do, and we look forward to our next stay.🩷"

The bed was comfortable. Larry greeted us and was very quick to answer our messages and also to give recommendations for places to eat. The restaurants are about 6 miles away. Larry had lots of helpful notes in the cabin and the cabin had everything you could possibly need. There are bikes you can ride, a laundry room off the kitchen, nice coffee pots. Plenty of heaters, even a small heater to warm the bathroom. There are chairs on the deck. They really thought of everything. We loved our time there and would definitely stay there again."

It felt more like staying at a friend's house than a bustling hotel. The setting was so quiet and peaceful. We really enjoyed listening to the water and birds while setting on the deck. I bet it would be even nicer during the warmer months. There was a fire pit that we didn't take advantage of but was really cool. My only problem with our stay was it wasn't long enough or warm enough outside
to enjoy all the nature. Larry's place is definitely on our go to list from now on. Thanks Larry, it was great!!!"

Stayed with kids","Peaceful cabin and beautiful location. My family had breakfast on the patio every morning, and enjoyed the sunsets every evening. Every time we went outside we were welcomed by the cutest furry cat. For the cabin being somewhat connected to the home, we had plenty of privacy.
I loved how well prepared the cabin was. There were ice packs in the fridge, shelf stable food, water, paper towels, plates, sun block, beach towels, a first aid kit,… I could go on. Anything we could have forgotten at home, this cabin had it.
I loved all the notes Larry left so we could know where everything was, and how to use things properly.
One thing that also stood out was when I first arrived and was having tire issues, Larry told me the right place to go to get it taken care of, and even checked my tire pressure! We felt provided for! The experience we had at this cabin exceeded our expectations.
Walmart 5 miles away.
Plenty of places around the area to explore.

It was clean, it was beautifully decorated, there were instructions for everything, and there truly isn't anything that Larry hasn't thought of in his cabin. His thoughtfulness to detail and everything a person may need while staying is extraordinary!!! I was extremely impressed! His property is gorgeous and peaceful!! I can't wait to stay again!!"

Stayed one night","I did not do much due diligence when I picked this place. I found out I had to do some work while traveling and it was right where I needed it to be so I picked it without much thought.
But what a delight. Beautiful water views and the cabin was cozy and extremely well equipped. I am not sure I have ever stayed at a place with more little amenities than this cabin. Washer and dryer helped me catch up on laundry too.
I have added this to a bookmark and whenever I travel I 40 through the area I will be stopping here from now on if it's available.
Such a much more restful and productive stop than if I had stayed in a box hotel on the interstate.
Can't recommend enough!"

Without one doubt this little spot takes the prize. This is so well thought out from the design and furnishings to the fact it had almost anything you could think of stocked in case you forgot something. They have bicycles to fishing poles. The view is breathtaking. We ate our meals on the deck and had our morning coffee there as well. Larry is an amazing host. Quick response time, we arrived lamps was on, ac was on and tv was on. It honestly felt like we were home. We only planned a cpl day stay this time. Planning on trying to get a week in come spring. We enjoyed relaxing outside and slept great on the king sized bed!"

He had a fully stocked kitchen with everything we could possibly need. There were extra pillows and blankets too. Cable TV in case you didn't want to watch the water outside. A hammock to relax by the water. Even fishing poles! Ms. Kitty was also very sweet. Larry was really respectful of our space. I started a conversation with him and was delighted to hear more of why he hosts people at this cute place. Overall, I would go back in the fall especially and try out the bikes, fishing, hiking around, local diner, etc."

Stayed over a week","My husband was in town for work and stayed here for a month. The place is brand new and is exactly as described. He felt very safe and had no problems whatsoever. While it appeared to be mostly college students residing here, it was very quiet. He worked nights and needed to sleep during the day and never had a problem. It is small as pictured but perfect for 1 or 2 people!"

Stayed with kids","So many good things to mention about Gary’s place. The first thing that comes to mind is COMFORT. Everything was so comfortable - the beds, the blankets, the couch, the chairs, everything. The shower was amazing - great water pressure and plenty of hot water even after three hikers washed away the day’s adventure. The kitchen was well-stocked (and we made every meal here) and there was even laundry soap, dishwashing detergent, full sized bottles of body wash, shampoo and conditioner. It felt more like we were staying at a friend’s house than a rental.
The second thing I have to mention is LOCATION. We’re from Houston where it’s flat flat flat and we wanted to do some hiking that was strenuous but within a days drive. Gary’s place was perfect. We went up AR-7 to Twin Falls for an amazing 6 mile hike. We went a little west to Mt. Nebo for a wonderful day of hiking loads of trails. And we went to Petit Jean State Park and hiked all over the place. It was always such a nice drive home in the evening. We never felt it was too far of a drive to anywhere we wanted to go. And the traffic was non-existent. The grocery store 1.5 miles away is FULL of amazing organic food, too!
Gary was also very responsive and his place exceeded our expectations by far. I cannot stress it enough - if you need a place to stay while you’re anyway near Russellville, stay here. You won’t be disappointed. We hope to be back in the summer to hike some more."

Plenty of utensils, dishes, and appliances to cook meals. We appreciated the supplied coffee. The bathroom was also stocked with the essentials.

1) we wanted affordable stay
2) it was conveniently located next to food joints and main roadways.
3) Very responsive in answering questions - they went over and helped me with sight seeing tips when I asked for it.
4) check in was simple and easy
5) place was well equipped with furnitures and amenities and kitchen appliances. Coffee tea and treats too
6) Although spring beds were a little uncomfortable for my back but hey, I paid a very reasonable price for the place and received tons of amenities, so no complains.
Overall I would recommend his place and would highly recommend Gary as a host for his hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","This is a clean, comfortable and attractively furnished house that we're glad we booked. It's easy to get to and well outfitted with amenities to enhance a traveler's stay. Every conceivable kitchen utensil is available, but those who like to cook should note that the kitchen is not stocked with any cooking oil or spices. The house can comfortably sleep up to 4 people, two to a bed, but the small bistro style table and chairs in the kitchen only seat two. There is another table for two on the small front porch. The Wi-Fi is unpredictable but Verizon cell coverage is strong. Bottled water and complimentary snacks are a welcoming touch. The host is gracious and responsive. Parking, accessible in front of the house, is slightly angled in a way that is peculiar but manageable. All in all, this Airbnb is a good choice for a couple who needs some space. Also, we recommend the Salvadorian restaurant nearby. Yum!"

Very nice clean and tidy place with absolutely everything you could possibly need, and the yard is great for your canine companion.
Didn’t use the AC as the weather was really nice and the ceiling fan was perfect but it is of a good brand and very new as are all the other appliances.
I definitely recommend this place for solo travelers with a dog, really comfortable in all aspects.

Stayed a few nights","This was a clean and tidy studio that had peaceful surroundings and all the amenities you could want. It's near the lake and grocery stores. The bathroom is technically in the kitchen so if there's more than one of you, be aware of the close quarters. This is a studio, so no separate rooms. The bed was large and comfortable. The A/C was cool and there's a big fan if you want more. There's also a ceiling fan over the bed and a vent in the bathroom/kitchen. Lots of lighting! That was a blessing! The fridge is huge with an ice maker! Make sure it is actually ON however. Someone had turned it off and the host didn't notice. We turned it on and it was noisy in the night because it's right by the bed, so we figured out why someone had turned it off. My daughter appreciated the full body mirror. There were so many innovative details that we were really impressed with. This place is sharp! The trees and mossy back/side yard were glorious!"

I was able to do my laundry, get all my huge bandwidth work done and even enjoy a lovely meal in town with live music!!
I will definitely be staying here again on my next cross country trip. (Fingers crossed it will be available, but a spot this great will good up fast)"

Note: if you’re like me and prefer a very dark room to sleep in, think about bringing a sleep mask! There are lights outside & in the garage that shine into the windows at night—not extremely bright, but noticeable. Nothing negative, just worth mentioning! I would definitely stay here again! :)"

Don’t bring a lot of refrigerated items unless you have a bugger ice chest that’ll stay cold for your stay. The mini fridge does exactly what a mini fridge is supposed to do, keep mini thing cold! So if you have a lot of refrigerated items, bring something you know will keep it good and cold for days on end."

Was able to park the boat under the awning and plug-ins on either side to easily recharge the boat batteries. Reading room/office very peaceful with fast internet. Didn't use but had a great bunk room that could sleep up to seven. Other two bedrooms with queen beds. Bed comfortable. Bathrooms well equipped. The house is in close proximity to Lake Dardanelle and within 15 miles of Lake Atkins. Both excellent fishing lakes and the reason for our visit. Sat in the gazebo which also had a fan for these hot summer nights. We were very pleased with this stay and highly recommend the Brown Stone Cottage. Would recommend for families or groups needing a large property close to outdoor activities and restaurants."

Very clean, loved opening the blinds and letting the natural light in. Also enjoyed the mirrors on the closet doors (didn't have to go to the bathroom for the mirror). All communication was responded to quickly and super friendly. No issues at all while at the house. Thank you for hosting my family!"

Berrie didn’t mind us moving some things around so our kids wouldn’t damage her nice things. Overall she was very accommodating. The house was clean. The internet was fast. Berrie was a fantastic host. My family and I appreciate her so much. We were going through a difficult time with remodeling our home and being displaced out of our home due to the water damage we experienced over the big freeze. We are grateful. She has a huge family room and living room plus lots of bedrooms with beds. The beds were actually comfortable. She also had a huge back yard for the kids and our puppy to play in. Great place.

The den was a luxury which provided office space when needed to work a bit. Kids loved the den too because they like this kind of separate” hide out” space.

I received a fast response to a couple of questions I had, and once the dogs knew who I was, they would greet me at the gate when I went out on to the back deck.

If anything was wrong, they had no problem getting it fixed and were very pleasant to work with"".
My tenant has been staying at the Airbnb since January. We knew his stay would be for several month but never thought it would be 5 months total. Mary was quick to respond to all messages and very easy to work with when booking and paying for the upcoming month. I did my best to give her as much notice in advance of my tenants extended stay and she was extremely easy to work & always very pleasant!!

We didn't even have to go out on to the main road to get there! The accommodations were just perfect in terms of what we needed for few days. We like the comfort and space of an Airbnb but didn't need an excess amount of space and what not so this was a right fit for us. The bed was extremely comfortable, as other guests have mentioned and the hosts were SUPER accommodating and communicative. Would highly recommend."

A heads up for anyone with animals, there are multiple dogs on this street who are let out off leash. We came across 4 on two walks. This has nothing to do with the host as her dogs are in her fenced back yard, but know that you may come across an unleashed dog."

There are a lot of little thoughtful details throughout the house, like power outlets where you need them. I especially enjoyed the little patio which opened to a beautiful backyard. The unit is next to the family's house, yet completely separate and private. The entry is through a garage, where you may choose to park your car.

It had everything I needed including plenty of blankets and pillows, towels for showering and I was so happy to see you had a hair dryer. the couch was super comfy to sit on and use the Roku TV to relax in the evening after a long day of hiking. The extra bonus Mary's cute dog Max who played with my pup on numerous occasions and loved to be petted. I was happy to have the garage to park my car in and it was nice to have it in there for when I was unloading and loading up at the end of my stay.

Stayed one night","Perfectly neat and easy place to stay, park the car in the garage, and get some sleep on our road trip. iMaps took us a weird route out of way that isn’t at all the fault of the location or host. Just be aware. We just needed it for the night to stay off of our road trip, but had we needed it, with the amenities, there was everything we needed to stay longer with nice fridge and mini range. Comfortably slept two adults and 3 small children. Easy access so we could slide in in the middle of the night. Never saw hosts, but she offered kind flexibility with our check in and check out. Clean clean clean and that’s what I appreciate the most! Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","The pictures and description are absolutely accurate. It was beautifully clean. It is definitely handicap access. While that was not something I have to have, I appreciated it for those who might need it. The fact that there’s a private garage in which to park was a bonus.
Finally, there communication with me was excellent and very responsive."

Stayed one night","Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, Mary's place is all that you could ask for in cozy, comfortable accommodations. From the sparkling clean bathroom to the thoughtful extra's in the kitchen, it is obvious that a lot of time and love was put into this space. My stay was memorably pleasant and relaxing. Were I to visit Russellville in the future, I would stay there in a heartbeat!"

Stayed one night","This was my first time booking an Airbnb and I think this place spoiled me!
Mary just gives you the garage code that morning and you just whip your vehicle into its own garage. It was raining so we were extra pleased with the parking situation! And then the apartment had EVERYTHING we needed. It was awesome! thanks so much."

Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderful accommodation. You pull right into your own garage parking place to enter into your private apartment with a kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. The unit was sparkling clean, modern, and decorated very lovely. It was very private and we did not feel intrusive to our hostess’s family in any way.
This unit is also handicap accessible if you are needing that amenity. We didn’t but I would think it a lot of people might.
We were very pleased. Thank you, Mary, for a great place to stay. It was a wonderful value also."

Stayed a few nights",I loved the location and everything about place. It is nicely decorated inside with a full kitchen. The bed is extremely comfortable for my tastes. Having a nice clean garage to park a bike(s) in with a pavement all the way to it (no gravel) and paved driveway up to the garage. While it was a little difficult to find initially; the isolation of it was great because there were no sounds from outside. Even the two very friendly Labradors never made a sound except for playing with each other on the wooden deck. I never heard them bark once. I will definitely be booking this place again should I ever plan a trip to this area of Arkansas.

Stayed one night","I had a wonderful experience here. The little house was sparkling clean and extremely comfortable. The bed was very comfortable, especially the sheets. I didn't use the little garage but there is one that locks. there was plenty of room outside for my truck and trailer. Everything was great! By the way, the home is in a very quiet upscale neighborhood on a dead-end street"

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful retreat to rest in between hiking adventures in the river valley and the Ozark National Forest. Mary’s place afforded privacy complete with your own parking garage! Her place was in a very nice neighborhood, beautiful lawn, super clean, instant hot water, and even had a dispenser in the shower full of shampoo, conditioner and soap. The a.c. was super cool after a hot day outdoors. We will stay here again!"

Stayed one night","I had a wonderful experience during my stay. Everything was clean, the bed was very comfortable and I forgot to pack shampoo and was relieved that had a few travel bottles to choose from. I loved the little kitchen and was happy to have a coffee pot, which saved me from making a stop after leaving. The hosts are incredibly friendly and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a small quiet place to stay that is more ""homey"" and affordable than a hotel."

Stayed one night","This is a lovely place to getaway with a significant other or a small family. It was in amazing shape, and the owner thought of everything. I was surprised to find things that any traveler could forget. Shampoo and even a hairdryer. It was quiet, and had just enough room for me and my significant other. Everything works well, and I didn't have any bad experiences. The bed was very comfortable. My favorite thing about this place is the chalk board on the wall. It has all you need to know and I loved that the owner really cares about the guests. The price is amazing for what you get! I would choose this over a hotel anytime! I can't wait to stay here again! Number one place on my list for sure!"
