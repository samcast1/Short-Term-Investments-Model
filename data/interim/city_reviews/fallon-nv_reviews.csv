Stayed with kids","We were visiting my new granddaughter, son and daughter in law. This was our first time using an Airbnb. I am so glad we went with this option instead of a hotel. Their home is so comfortable and was clean with all the amenities needed for our stay. My favorite perk is the location in town, pretty much within walking distance to the downtown area. We were also able to have my son's family over for dinner. It was so nice to have the option to fix our own meals and not eat out every meal. The kitchen is fully loaded! The only thing missing was getting local channels on the TV for local news but you can stream anything if you like. I will definitely use their home when we visit again."

There is a keurig coffee maker that takes pods and ground coffee, a blender, large toaster, small waffle maker, and plenty of other kitchen appliances. Make sure to message the host before bringing anything for the kitchen. Parking is also easy and plentiful and the location is close to everything. It was one of my favorite properties yet."

This rental gave us a chance to get our family together for Christmas given it was close to the Naval Base where the oldest son is stationed. The younger son was granted his request and he flew out making it an awesome family Christmas. Lorretta & Heather's home was perfect for such an event. It was warm, inviting, & nicely stocked with all the essentials. We had a wonderful time. Thanks for the memories, ladies!"

My family enjoyed playing Uno, taken from the stack of parlor games found in one closet. The central air-conditioning worked marvelously and hot water never ran out - though we did not run a test to check if it would or how long it would take!"

Stayed a few nights","Our host was terrific and very timely in communicating and answering questions. We corresponded by email/text messaging, which was nice. The advertisement was true to its description and even better in person. The home was excellent, super clean, tastefully decorated, no clutter, and super comfortable. The sheets were fresh and clean. Beds were really comfortable. The bathrooms were really nice and clean too. The same was true everywhere else in the house. All the amenities of a nice hotel were there like little shampoo bottles, clean towels, and even a mini tube of new toothpaste. The air conditioning worked really well too. The yard was great and there was lots of space to park in the back. The location was great too, being right off the main street of Fallon. Overall, I highly recommend this place. We will definitely reserve Lorretta and Heather's place again for our next year's trip to Fallon. Thanks again for letting us stay there."

She provides a priceless binder of information about her home and the surrounding area around Fallon; the suggestions guided us to an amazing breakfast place on a nearby farm where we ran through meadows and played with goats while our food cooked.
We were left with full privacy as we never even had to pick up a key, conveniently receiving a door code via text message."

Stayed a few nights","Lorretta and her daughter Heather are gracious and lovely hosts. They are easy to communicate with. The house was immaculate, and even had fresh flowers all over. The house seems practically new and all the systems are in top shape (kitchen, heat, air conditioning, washer/dryer, wifi). The living room and kitchen and dining area are open and provided a great place to hang out and swap stories after being out all day. When Lorretta heard we had car trouble, she came over and offered to help. We already had the problem solved, but that was just sooo sweet. When you stay, be careful not to make much noise in the driveway, as the neighbor works graveyard. She was very nice about it when she told us about as we were chatting on the front porch."

Stayed with a pet",The home is very clean and spacious and just perfect for a family get together where you have people flying in to Reno and traveling by car to Fallon. It is easy to miss it on the road due to the bushes between the house and the road. A few maintenance items needed resolving but no show stoppers. Nice decor. There are three thermostats and only one is in service; it would be good if the inactive ones were so labeled. I recommend leaving the fan on at night to better equalize the temperatures as the house is a rambling ranch style. Comfy beds!

It is a little cramped for 5 people but we made it work.

It took 6 tries for us to unlocked it on the first day and then we had no idea how to lock it until the 3rd day. There was no instructions on how to use. A real key would be much appreciated. We also had nothing but issues getting the house to a good temp and keeping it at a good temp. It took 3 days to get the house up to a comfortable temp, then it got so hot we had to leave the door open to cool it down. My kids and myself both ended up getting pretty sick. There’s also no where to hang anything anywhere in the house. We needed up buying a drying mat for the kitchen as well as an over the door hanger, we also had to leave a day early."

It is noted in the air bnb description that there is a dog on the property however note there are 4-5 dogs on this property, which are behind a gate, and bark a lot. I have no issue with friendly dogs and was happy to see them when I first pulled up to the property. However, only 2 of the dogs are friendly seeming and 2 of them seem very aggressive and will snarl and try to bite through the gate as you walk by. The one small dog was particularly aggressive and barked nonstop for the first 3 hours after my arrival. It was a bit unsettling as the small dog was very bothered by my presence and I was nervous it would squeeze through the gap at the side of the gate and attack me as I was unloading my car. The barking began again in the morning at 6am and continued nonstop until I left two hours later."

It didn’t hinder our sleep. The coffee was good. The surrounding area is dry desert but it’s not too far from Virginia City. The neighborhood view is mostly mobile homes and a few looked in need of repair. Overall it was worth being close to where we needed to visit. Carrie was very responsive."

Stayed with a pet","So, I feel compelled to write an honest review. As a host myself, I think Airbnb users deserve to know what they’re paying for. I would not recommend this place. My wife and I almost had to find another place to stay in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, the cohost occupies the adjacent space that shares a wall in the bedroom of the unit. From about 10pm until the morning hours, they had very loud music playing (think booming through the walls). After a long day of travel, the last thing I wanted was to be kept awake by loud music, especially from the cohost. I sent a message to the host through Airbnb, sent a text message to her phone, and called her phone several times. She never responded to me (and still hasn’t). There was no number listed for the cohost. We finally resorted to banging on the walls, which is not something anyone looks forward to doing when paying for a restful night. This complete lack of hospitality soured the entire experience."

Stayed a few nights","Carrie's place is proof that downscale and modest doesn't have to mean dumpy or boring. She's transformed what's basically a section of a doublewide into a cute, craft-filled little home away from home in the high Nevada desert. It's a little ways from away from anything that could be considered a tourist attraction (Virginia City, the closest, is a good 25-minute drive), but after two days in Las Vegas, that was just fine with me."

Stayed a few nights","Carrie is a gem hidden out there in Stagecoach! She was extremely communicative and kind throughout my stay, and even installed a window unit in the apartment as I was concerned that it would be in the 80’s one of the days I was there and I have an old dog who overheats easily. The place was beautifully decorated and she had many thoughtful touches throughout. I loved the big, cozy blue chair in the living room. Initially, I was a little concerned that it would be too “close quarters” to her because it’s an apartment attached to her house, but it didn’t end up being an issue. My dog used the side of the front yard to potty, and there is also a dirt road just down the street from her (about a quarter of a mile down the street on the right) where I was able to take my dog to run each day. When you arrive, don’t be alarmed by the house before her that has a little shack in the back - that’s not where you’re staying! I almost had a heart attack initially, but her house is the (much nicer!) next one down on the right. Hahaha! Have a wonderful trip!"

The people in the neighborhood are friend. Very communicable to places like Reno, Lake Tahoe, Carson City. There is only a microwave and mini fridge, but the Smith's grocery store has great food in the deli for dinner and lunches. I had never been to this part of Nevada and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. Easy check in and out and Carrie checked in on me to see how I was doing."

We knew of the area, since we're familiar with Fallon area, so was convenient for us visiting family, but I can see the immediate surrounding properties could be a turnoff for some. The only other thing that wasn't disclosed, but could be a turnoff is that this place uses a well for water. And the extremely strong smell of the sulfur/rotten egg is really off-putting. Hopefully some improvements could potentially be done in this area as the place is so cute and perfect besides that. We had an amazing time here. thanks Delilah!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Hadley’s place is a lovely home in one of Fallon’s nicest neighborhoods. Overall, I do recommend. However, there is one downside. What should be a quiet residential street seems to be used by all the locals to bypass downtown with its slow speed limits and traffic lights. This, combined with the lack of soundproofing in modern construction, means that all the bedrooms had a lot of traffic noise late into the night. Fortunately we brought a white noise machine with us and had no problem drowning out the sounds. The hosts, as well as other homeowners on the street, would do well to petition the city to install speed bumps or some other traffic mitigation measures to keep extra traffic off what should be a lightly used street. Other than this the home is definitely one of the nicer ones in the area, was spotlessly clean, and quite comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","The house was very cute just like the pictures. The master was perfect. The other two rooms could have used tvs and dressers. The 3rd bedroom could us better beds they were geared more
Towards children rather than adults. We came to stay for 4 days because Banner hospital has been hosting clinicals for our nursing college . So 4 of us nurses shared the house. It would have been nice if each room was equipped for adults equally - tvs and dressers. But over all it was a nice experience. Kitchen was perfect and living room was cozy. One of the girls chose to sleep on the couch because it was more Comfortable than the kiddie beds . Hot tub was very nice also. Decor was very cute and up to date. Close to Walmart and Safeway and restaurants."

All for the same price you’d pay to rent a hotel room. Everything was super simply and beautifully decorated and sparkling clean - I could even tell the floor has just been mopped. In a quiet and quaint neighborhood within a quick stop off the freeway. Will 100% stay here again!

We also had a hands-on tour of the farm and met Mystic the donkey, the Guinea Hens, her cows, horses, and chickens. It's a lovely spot to stay any time.

We found trash in the bathroom as well as used towels.
The worst though was that the bed sheets and blankets did not appear to be clea ed and we found ""active"" stains on the covers. it was enough to make us not sleep in the bed for the night.
There was also disappointingly no coffee maker for the morning, though it seemed something to expect or at least make note of that fact somewhere.
In all a disappointing service for the price."

Stayed with kids","Overall this place was simply not cleaned. This is not a dedicated Airbnb & it felt lived in, but not in a fresh or comfy way. The smell and state of the house reminded me of a bachelor pad. We expected to be able to use the garage given the picture of the open garage on the listing but it was locked and not available for guests.
Kitchen:
There was nearly a full freezer/refrigerator full of food. Had to consolidate it ourselves to separate our things. Dirty dishes were left in the dishwasher. All the soap/dish soap in the house was watered down & sponges were dirty.
Bathroom:
Toilets weren’t cleaned; one wasn’t flushed, the other had poop stains inside. There was hair on the floor and in the showers and dried toothpaste in the sink. There was a used washcloth & body scrubber left in the showers.
Rooms:
Toys & clothes haphazardly thrown in the closet. All mattresses covered in plastic which made for a hot and uncomfortable sleep.
Note: This was not a last minute booking!"

There was hair in the bathroom and showers, leftover trash in and around the bathroom garbage, soiled rag in the shower, dirty floor mats and the sinks were dirty. I ended up sleeping on the couch as I was there one night and wasn’t sure if the sheets were cleaned or not. Overall comfy house and great location, but they really need a new cleaner for what’s being charged."

Quiet neighborhood with little vehicle or human traffic. Fresh towels in the dryer. Home was clear of clutter and was welcoming. ONLY thing the family and I feel was misisng was a coffee maker or Keurig. Back patio provided a nice sitting area. Driveway is large and fit our vehicles easily to keep them off the street. Would recommend staying here and will certainly stay again for the next Fallon stay. Daniel's communication was excellent as well. Very accommodating and responsive. Thank you!

There were a lot of personal items, including in the refrigerator in the freezer in the cabinets, including alcohol in the freezer. There was toothpaste in the master bathroom, both sinks I went to put my hands on the counter, and they were dirty, it took me about an hour to clean up and then I let the owner know letting them know about the cleaning issues to talk with the staff and he replied he was the staff my bad for not really looking at the pictures. Well I guess. I don’t remember not being told that I would not have access to the master bathroom closet, or any closet to hang any clothes in. The closets were full of stuff which I had to move around. The glass table was cracked. The dining room table was completely stained because I had no choice because of a funeral. I would’ve not stayed for the money it’s not worth it."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first experience renting an Airbnb. We are really glad that Garrett was our host. Even though everything was done online, Garrett felt familiar, friendly, and supportive. We are planning to use this venue. Every time we go to visit the brand new great grandson, that we welcomed into the world during this visit.
We would recommend this location and Garrett as a host to anyone. Can’t say enough good stuff about him."

Stayed about a week",The house was just what we needed. My daughter started a new job in Fallon before her new house was ready. We enjoyed the tidy little place in the midst of the chaos of getting her moved in.
