Stayed with kids","We booked Alan’s place for the weekend so we could be as close to Tallahassee as possible for FAMU graduation. Alan’s arrival and departure instructions were very clear and the home was as described and matched the pictures. The surrounding area was bland, although very quiet but I expected this because Albany, GA is a smaller, rural town/community."

Group trip","We stayed here with a group for a local conference. The host was very responsive and nice, and the area felt safe. However, inside it looked like it hadn't been deep cleaned in months and could have had a better cleaning job overall. It was generally okay (clean sheets, etc), but the cleaners definitely didn't do a thorough job even after we requested they come back to clean again (dusty vents, dirty corners, sticky cupboard doors, etc). The place could just use a thorough cleaning and some touch ups to make you feel more at home! But again, overall good experience with the host so hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future guests."

Stayed with kids",I must say this home exceeded expectations area was indeed SAFE lol code entry was easy. but be sure to have the code because you will indeed get locked out if you don't have the code handy. the beds was comfy bathrooms was spacious and clean good lighting and closet space . nice i would say if you have kids you will need entertainment for them being that its only a tv in the master and the family area the kitchen is spacious and clean. great touch with the coffee maker and soap and shampoo dispenser in the shower. the couch bed was super comfy the overall place was very comfy very welcoming and felt like home

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay at Alan's Town House (TH). The atmosphere is peaceful with safe surroundings. The check-in process was super easy. Once entering the TH it was beautiful and looked exactly like the picture. It was very clean and we did feel at home.
The bedroom mattresses were very comfortable with adequate closet space.
The kitchen was equipped with what was needed. The countertops, refrigerator and microwave was clean. However, the front burner on the stove top could have used extra cleaning. It seemed as if something had harden on it and when turned on it smelt like burning hair. The cute littler k-cup coffee maker did not work at all. Overall, we enjoyed Alan's TH especially hanging out on the back patio. We would love to revist during our next trip to Georgia. YEAH!"

The home is centrally located near Longhorn, Walmart, Roses, convenient stores and to Celebration of Praise, Joy Temple Church for Holy Convocation. Don’t try and book it for next year, because it’s mine during that time. 🤣💕

Stayed one night","My family and I travel often and I can honestly say this is the CLEANEST/Nicest AirBnB we've ever stayed at. First of all, everything in the unit is brand new - furniture, linens, décor, etc., this is always a big deal for my wife. We needed a quiet place in a SAFE neighborhood that could accommodate our entire family and this fit the bill perfectly! The unit is actually managed by Alan (not some corporate real estate team) and getting in with the keycode was a BREEZE. The WiFi was blazing fast, parking for both of our vehicles was completely adequate, 3 minutes to Chick-Fil-A, Buffalo Wild Wings and a variety of other great restaurants. We had plenty of room to spread out were able to cook meals with the cookware provided. This would be perfect for long term stays as well. Alan responds instantly with any questions and recommendations for the area. I do not have enough good things to say about this AirBnB; I'll definitely be back!"

So many things were provided and we felt right at home. We had a couple special requests that Kaitlyn very graciously accommodated. She responded quickly and was very helpful! We would definitely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","Quiet neighborhood, great location. The mowing service at 7 am on our last morning was unfortunate, but in their defense, it was going to be a hot day and I am sure they just wanted to get the job done. The gated entrance is narrow, so keep that in mind if you have a large vehicle (the turn can be tight). We enjoyed the deck for morning coffee and the beds were decently comfortable, but the pillows could use some updating. I brought my own pillow, but my daughter complained about the pillows on her bed being uncomfortable and ours were older and mismatched. The house itself is generous in size, with two rooms to lounge in.
The fridge was stocked with some water bottles, which were greatly appreciated. Although we did not need them, the house did have laundry facilities.
The owner was responsive to our messages.
The wifi barely works, so don't plan on relying on it.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to visit again. So much quieter than a hotel!"

Its tastefully decorated and the updates to the house are great. Kaitlyn was an amazing, proactive communicator and had great recommendations in the area. The house was ideal because it has two big living areas, a big dining room, and the bedrooms are off down their own hallway and you can close doors to that hallway if you have some who are earlier to bed (and ideal for us, staying there with our almost 2 year old). Speaking of, it’s a great house to stay at with kids in every way (yard, open space in the house, the fact that it has a pack and play and high chair on the ready, etc. etc.). We would love to stay here again whenever we visit family."

I loved all the helpful signs/labels that were put throughout the home; the host seems to have thought of everything a guest might need. We have a family of six and it was a perfect fit. Everyone loved it.
Beforehand, I was wondering how it would be to enter through the backdoor. Seemed odd to me ahead of time. But, it is actually just how the neighborhood is setup. Driveways are all in the back. So, entering through the back door turned out to feel totally normal and private.
If I ever end up back in Albany, I'd definitely stay again. Hope you enjoy as much as we did!"

After addressing this to Kaitlyn, she admitted that another guest had brought it to her attention. The house has 3 doors but you're only allowed to use the back door.

Stayed over a week","I know this will become THE place to stay on Airbnb in Albany very quickly. The location is central to the major hospital system Phoebe and close to the mall. The house had all amenities one needs from washer/dryer, to Airplay ready television to a blender for smoothies! The shower in the master bathroom is so relaxing too. The bath and soap products were all high quality. The house had keyless entry. The Wi-Fi is fine but the city in general has Wi-Fi issues everywhere at certain times at night which has nothing to do with the homes particular Wi-Fi.
The stove is electric and I cooked plenty. No deep frying allowed which was no big deal for me. Comfortable couches and bed. I felt at home.
Kaitlyn is one of the many reasons you will be rebooking here. She is on top of everything from communication to safety to checking in with you.
It was an excellent experience and I plan on rebooking here next time I am in town."

It beautifully matches the photos and in the perfect location for all the things we came to Albany to do. Ms. Tammy was a wonderful host and even continued to communicate even after checkout when we thought we’d left some items in the home! We plan to come back next year and would ABSOLUTELY stay here again!"

Stayed one night","This house is ideal for college students and young single friends. It’s conveniently located and furnished with arcade games. The pool would be a nice bonus in the summer. However, the layout and decor are a bit bizarre, with evidence of renovation on a shoestring budget. The kitchen is very sparse, with one measuring cup, one wine glass, and a drawer containing a dirty glove. One light fixture had burnt out bulbs and wires hanging down, while another was full of dead bugs. A door fell off the hinge, which we notified Corey about and he quickly apologized and promised to fix it. Although I wouldn’t bring my family here, my colleague and I enjoyed discovering the random oddities of this home."

Group trip","Overall nice small home, stayed with family for funeral in the area. Dining room furniture old and broken, needs to be replaced. Pest control needed, there were roaches in the kitchen and in the master bedroom closet (which is on opposite side of house from kitchen). Wi-Fi is really slow. Master bed is really comfortable, has foam topper that's amazing. Beware bedrooms are small and there are 2 twin beds (bunks), 2 full beds, and 1 king bed. There is no sleeper sofa and the living room is small. Actually sleeps up to 8 people comfortably. Had a nice experience but a little more investment in the property is warranted to ensure good quality Airbnb location. Gloria is a very nice host."

We told her about some edible fruit she didn’t know she had which was very exciting for me because I haven’t seen them in a very long time they where muster-dimes I might be wrong with pronunciation of the fruit but they put you in the mind of grapes most people from the south know what I mean 😂 but she let us pick some which made my day I the circumstances that we was there for a funeral but it brought a little sunshine for us and it’s the little things we must appreciate. But I tell you the cutest spacious little home away from home I will definitely book again in the near future thanks again, Mrs. Gloria for the great over and beyond hospitality I pray nothing but prosperity for you and you family have a blessed and wonderful day!!!!"

I will recommend your Airbnb to my friends and family if they are ever looking for a place to stay in Albany. I could not find any garage cans so I could take the trash out that’s the only thing that was wrong but everything else was wonderful.

We were in town for a family reunion. Some of our family members stayed at the local hotels, but we were lucky enough to find this beautiful pet friendly home! Gloria was a great host and responded quickly to any questions we had. The home was stocked with all the essentials and she even left a basket of goodies for our arrival. The neighborhood was friendly and peaceful. Every room was clean and well stocked. The beds were so comfortable. It was like sleeping on marshmallows! Our dogs favorite part was the screened in porch with a ceiling fan after walking the large backyard.
Thank you Gloria for providing such a wonderful space! ❤️"

The neighborhood was very quiet & in a very safe location. I will stay here again when visiting Albany. The back yard is huge grandkids loved it. It even has a baseball hoop.. Gloria was extremely responsive. All appliances worked great.
There were plenty of utensils,plates & bowls. I especially loved the t-fal frying pans. Huge tv in living room. We are sports nuts. Loved the ceiling fans also.
Plenty of towels & wash cloths.
She even had a beautiful basket filled with all kinds of snacks & energy bars Extra roll of toilet paper also. Kitchen cupboard had lots of quick meals & snacks,Keurig cups,creamer,sugar & artificial sweetener.
I own a bbq catering company out of Florida & was in town feeding 150 people.
Gloria's home was perfect.
I can't say enough about her home. It was perfect for our stay."

But when we went to cook breakfast Saturday morning water was coming from the floor. It was like every time you step somewhere in the kitchen your feet was wet. So I don’t know if it’s some pipes leaking under the house but that was the only down fall.

Stayed a few nights","Overall we had a good stay. The owner was responsive to a couple issues we had, so we appreciated that. Some work was being done to the house when we arrived, and the workers left the floors a mess (after the cleaning service had just finished cleaning everything). We notified the owner and he immediately sent the cleaning service back to clean the floors again. That was great!
Nice furnishing. And having 3 bathrooms was great!
The bed in the master bedroom is VERY high off the ground — it was level with my waist. Just letting you know in case you are older. There is a step stool to climb in the bed, so that at least helps. I just usually jumped. LOL! It's comfortable, just very high.
One slight negative........some neighbors nearby have roosters. They crow non-stop starting around 5:30am. As long as you bring a small fan or have an app on your phone to create some ""white noise"", you can drown out the roosters and still sleep. I didn't bring a fan, so after they woke me up the first morning, I downloaded an app to drown them out so I could go back to sleep."

The photos do not due it justice! The attention to detail was wonderful. Anything we needed was available then some. We appreciated the water in the fridge, coffee and snacks provided. As well as a bar of soap as we had forgotten that at home. We know better when we go to Airbnb’s to bring that but luckily it was available.
Sara was very engaged with and responsive when needed. She also provided some great restaurant locally recommendations.
The location was very quiet and peaceful! We even took mid afternoon naps has it was a rainy & dreary weekend.
We definitely would stay here again if we find ourselves in this area. As well as tell friends who might need a space of such."

I was exhausted but immediately met with the relaxing sounds of the sprinklers hitting the pool water as the motion lights literally guided me to the front door of the guest house. My room was very spacious and super clean. The decor was beautiful and calming. The shower was amazing and I fell right asleep in the bed surrounded by comfy pillows. I had plenty to choose from on the TV. The kitchen area was nice and had a full size refrigerator and microwave . Sara left nice snacks on the counter that came in handy when I got up in the middle of the night. My favorite thing in the house though might have been the all in one toaster/ air fryer that I used to warm up my breakfast before leaving.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and I wish I could have stayed another night to rest and relax. I travel that way often since my daughter plays softball at Albany State. Sara’s place is now at the top of the list for when I need to book again!"

Stayed a few nights",The property is very well maintained. The home was clean and had everything you need for a quick get away... including restaurant menus. The lake is right outside the guest house which is right on front of the pool. It's the most beautiful pool I've ever seen... made of stone. The bed is extremely soft and comfortable.... you just got to drown the humming noise that occurs often right next to the bedroom. We'd definitely return to this property when we're in Leesburg. The hosts are very welcoming and allows plenty of privacy. Great job Billie and Marie.

Stayed one night","The place was beautiful and Marie was really great! I love the way it’s decorated and the landscaping is amazing. There is a lot of personal space for the price!
The only downside to this place was the noise. Specifically, there is a noise (I think for the plumbing) that happens every 10-15 minutes and it woke us up all night. The bed squeaks on the right side so movement also wakes you up. Then, at 6:30 am one of the neighbors was shooting guns for over an hour. (I’d assume that it’s probably a rare occurrence.) I understand that these things are unavoidable for Marie, but if you aren’t a deep sleeper you might have a hard time sleeping through the noises. If noises don’t bother you when you’re sleeping, you will LOVE it there! ❤️"

They will leave you alone if you want but I found them to be so friendly that, I was hanging out with them half the time. it’s a beautiful view and I went kayaking on the river several times."

Stayed one night","I don't know what I enjoyed more...the pool, or Mrs Marie's BEAUTIFUL landscape. Her property is kept absolutely immaculate, with some of the most creative combinations of flowers. She was so welcoming when we arrived, & gave us a brief tour & the lay of the land, & then our total privacy. Cozy, but efficient use of the small space..it was perfect for my fiance & I for our short stay. Had everything we needed & then some. We had the pleasure of watching the reflection of the full moon over the river at night..& if it wasn't for a fear of the unknown gator population underneath the swampier areas, we would have ventured out on the kayaks she had available, at no extra charge!! The pool looks like something out of a magazine, & felt AMAZING after a sweltering hot day. Will be looking forward to visiting again when in the area!! 🩶"

Stayed a few nights","Where should I start!
I guess I should start with your hosts- They are AMAZING! You will not find kinder people who will make you feel like family immediately.
The little house is comfortable and has everything you could need! It is decorated with class and attention to detail is evident. The amenities are well beyond expectations!
The outside- WOW! I only wish we had the chance to visit when it was warm enough to enjoy the pool and river... I am not going to ""tell"" and ruin the surprise with the pool- the WOW factor will be yours to experience! (insert a jaw drop here)...
Not sure what is with the review about the bed- I came home last night and climbed into my previously loved bed, I miss that cloud soft, oh so comfy hugged feeling bed. SERIOUSLY -I did think how I missed it after a very long ride home. That being said I am willing to take that long ride back, just to see them and stay in this incredible place.
You will love it!"

Beautiful sunset surrounded by nature was the perfect start to our trip. We headed to Providence Canyon the next morning for hiking which was only about an hour away.

The house itself was smaller than expected. You can cook but then hand-wash all the dishes in the bathroom sink. Unfortunately the bed in the room was very uncomfortable. Host was accommodating and bought a topper to help but we couldn't sleep there another night because the mattress itself was the problem.

The property allows for a grassy view for morning coffee and toss a football on game days on Saturdays. There is enough room to entertain and have drinks with friends as well prior to an evening out. You will surely enjoy your stay. Thanks again Gail!

She had extra toiletries in the bathroom and the TVs were easy to work in every room! I brought my dogs with me and the yard was perfect! We sat out on the back porch both nights enjoying that springtime weather! You cannot beat the quality for this price! We (the dogs and me) will be back soon!

It was clean and well maintained. The decor is lovely. Ease of access. Great communication.
My only wish was that checkout be a little later than 10am, but the timing worked out as I had a meeting to get up and out for. But my friend, who was traveling with me, could have stayed while I went to my meeting.
Overall, I loved it and would definitely stay here again. I actually recommended it to a family member that will be in town this weekend."

Stayed with a pet","This was a lovely place. It was exceptionally clean and had all we needed for our night’s stay. The little extras Jackie had for her guests really made us feel at home. We loved the back yard for our dog and there were even amenities for dogs such as poop bags, tennis ball, and a comfy dog bed. The little sitting area in the back yard was private and comfortable too. The decor of the house was not a typical rental’s decor. The light fixtures were fun and everything functioned as it should have. The neighborhood was quiet all night. The parking was adequate for a flatbed trailer we were pulling although narrow and long so back up experience is needed but worked perfectly for us. Jackie was prompt with responding to our reservation and check in was simple and hassle free. We highly recommend renting this place if you are spending any time in the area."

Stayed with a pet","We were supposed to arrive at 7 pm from New Orleans, but got held up and did not arrive until midnight. I texted Jackie and she said not to worry. When we arrived the living room light and the porch light was left on for us.
The bed in the room we occupied was so comfortable. It beat the beds we have been in at different hotels easily and we had the best sleep that we have had on our trip.
The place is stylish and welcoming. If we are ever in the area we will stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","Great place! Very quiet, peaceful area. The house was very clean and comfortable. My dog was immediately at home here. Fenced in back yard was AMAZING. More Airbnb’s need this! the biggest thing was the attention to detail, and thoughtfulness in the house. There was an umbrella by the door in case it started raining, a spare dog leash, makeup wipes etc. more than I’ve come to expect from Airbnb’s basic tiny tube of toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner. Probably the biggest thing was a filtered water station!! Was not expecting that, great touch. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights",By far this was the best Airbnb property in Albany Georgia. I have booked several homes in the area for my Dad and I but none of them could compare to this one .the home was just like the pictures. Very clean I would definitely book this house or any other property by this house again. It was the decor for me!! Worth more than the price.

This beautiful home was exactly what was needed after 3 long..hot days post track meets. Even though, it is a pet friendly home, one would never know that fur babies were ever in the residence. The residence was clean to perfection.
I will definitely utilize this property again if given the opportunity."

Stayed with a pet","Jada's Place Too was exactly as described by Jackie. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. I needed a quick getaway for one night, with my pups. I live in South Alabama, so we stopped by Kolomiko State Park/Blakely on our way to Albany and on our way home. We enjoyed spending time, in the fenced in backyard. There was a section of the fence that was damaged, so the top of the fence was lower. I placed the garbage can from the alley in front of that area, during my stay. There is a full kitchen, but is lacking some items (bakeware/colander). I choose to cook when I travel, so I always take aluminum foil with me. I was able to improvise and everything worked out fine. We stopped by Hilsman Park on our way out of Albany. It was a nice place to take my pups on a walk, and not very far from the rental. The park is located in the Garden District which has older homes, sidewalks and the trees form a canopy over the road. I would definitely visit Jackie's rental again."

Stayed a few nights","My family and I (party of 3) stayed at Jada’s place for two nights and it was an absolute pleasure. The home was immaculate, well maintained, absolutely beautifully decorated and it had everything that we needed. The mattresses on the two queen beds were super comfortable and the seating in the living room and den were more than adequate. There was even an oversized chair in the den that folds down to create more sleeping space.
The home is located in a safe, peaceful neighborhood and it sits on a wide street lined by trees with long arching branches so the views were quite scenic and there was plenty of space for parking. Also, it’s proximity to Albany State University (just a few minutes away) was a plus for us.
Finally, Ms. Jackie responded to messages within minutes which we appreciated. I have to return to Albany for graduation in two weeks and would definitely return to Jada’s place if I was traveling with fewer people. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

The backyard is peaceful, and we enjoyed the small office space separated from the living room.
Jackie is so friendly and I highly recommend her and her properties!"
