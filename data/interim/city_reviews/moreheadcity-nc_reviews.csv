Stayed a few nights","My husband and I spent a quick weekend at Steve and Marcy’s airbnb. Nothing but positive comments from us! Easy to check in and out. The instructions were beyond clear. Very easy to find the Airbnb. The location is perfect. I’m walking distance to many Morehead city attractions on the waterfront. Short drive to anywhere you need to go in the area. The Airbnb was perfectly cleaned and spacious. I felt like I was at home. AC worked great, bed was comfy and a huge bathroom to get ready in. It was so quiet at night. I felt very secure on the property! Before we got 20 minutes down the road after checkout, we booked our next stay with Steve and Marcy! Thank you for the recommendations and the conversation. See you soon! If this airbnb is still listed, book now!!"

Their communication, check-in process and cleanliness of their place is incredible. Their place has become a home away from home for us and we are so grateful for their hospitality. We look forward to any opportunity to stay with them or suggest their place to other friends who will be visiting the area. For this specific visit we really appreciated them allowing our 9 year old grandson to join us for a sleepover the last night of our stay as we are 1200 miles from him and do not get to see him often. That made this trip all the more special and really made his day."

Steve and Marcy were also perfect hosts and checked in on my as a solo traveler to ensure I am doing well. All communications are also easy and timely. It was also central to access of so many nearby tourists attractions, Atlantic beach, Harkers Island and even a drive out to historic New Bern. Glad I found this home away from home!"

The bed was very comfortable with nice linens, and it is a safe/quiet environment. The yard is beautiful. They are extraordinary at gardening! The outdoor space is very peaceful and relaxing. You can easily walk to the sound, a fresh market, and restaurants. (There are several recommendations and menus compiled in a handy binder. We tried one of their favorites and it was excellent). Parking is on-street but very easy, and right by the driveway.
Two great options that we didn’t have time to enjoy (because of our schedule) are bicycles available for use upon request, and a very handy outdoor shower.
Everything was communicated well and all was easy, including check-in and check-out. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","This lovely place has so many wonderful attributes! Marcy was so helpful in suggesting restaurants and activities— even called for a reservation for us to get a cart tour of Beaufort. The room is so comfy and pretty with soft bed, couch and rocking chair — plus snacks and fresh flowers.
They responded quickly to every message and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The location feels totally safe — we didn’t even lock our door — and less than 10 minutes from beaches, Beaufort, restaurants, and boat rides. We would not hesitate to stay here again."

The apartment was very clean and well appointed with thoughtful amenities. They even have bicycles for the guests to use. My husband and I took the bikes to dinner one night; the property is in walking distance of several good seafood restaurants. I highly recommend Promise Land as a place to stay.

Stayed a few nights","Even better than the pictures! There are so many thoughtful touches in this Airbnb. Steve and Marcy definitely gave us our space but were very helpful with anything we may need. I personally think this Airbnb is a lot bigger in person than how it looks in the pictures. We loved how it was so close to Atlantic beach (5 min drive), and how we were also so close to nightlife in Morehead city and Beaufort. Most restaurants in Morehead city we’re less than 2 minutes down the road from us. There also is a sound side beach you can walk to! Next time we plan a trip here I am definitely going to look to see if this place is available for us again."

Stayed a few nights","Steve and Marcy are great! They are very friendly and willing to help with recommendations. The place was very clean and comfortable. The outside shower was an added plus especially after a day at the beach. The location is close to Atlantic beach (right across the sound) and the downtown restaurant area of Morehead City (no more than a 5 minute walk). This was my first bnb experience and it left me with nothing to complain about. I would say if you are planning to stay for more than a couple of nights, it may be a bit harder to get by without a full kitchen."

Their place is a great location, clean and very lovely. There were great little touches we didn’t expect - fluffy towels, snacks, water and fresh picked flowers. The bed was extremely comfortable and great bathroom. A good location to walk around town or to see the water. The yard is nice with flowers, chairs, outdoor shower and bird feeders.

It's cleanness is outstanding, the carpet is so clean you can walk bare feet. It has everything, coffee, snacks, a lot of towels, shampoo, hand soap and lotion... whatever we needed - we had it. I personally loved their adorable back yard, it is very pretty and organized. A cop of coffee on the porch was a nice start of a day and a glass of wine at night overlooking the sunset was a great way to finish it. I can't think of anything to suggest to bring with you. The hosts are great, you can reach them anytime you have questions."

Steve and Marcy were very accommodating and easy to reach if we had a question. They had bikes available to use & provided water for us which was a welcome touch each day. Small frig and kitchenette was perfect for our wine/snacks we brought and enough room for our leftovers from dinners out. They also had wonderful suggestions for places to eat or drink around town and left their recommendations and notes on menus available in a binder for us to check out. It's your own little tree house to come ""home"" too. Very comfortable, clean and well stocked with essentials too!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Steve and Marcy's place exceeded all expectations! The apartment was clean, cozy, safe, and was private enough it felt like it was its own property. The amenities are everything one needs for a few nights stay, a comfortable bed, hot shower, TV, and controllable A/C. Not to mention, the aesthetic of the place inside and out is very homely, beachy, and not at all overbearing! There was never anything that made us hesitate or think twice about our stay.
Steve and Marcy were wonderful hosts. It was easy to get in touch and communicate with them, and they gave us wonderful suggestions for places to go and things to do on our trip. The location is prime, walking distance away from the center of Morehead City, and only a short drive away from Atlantic Beach and Beaufort, which weren't crowded nor overly touristy. For any couple who is looking to get away for a few days, I would HIGHLY recommend this stay!"

Steve and Marcy are good people providing a great service at a reasonable price. They're personable, but not overbearing. I know North Carolina may not seem like the south to some, but to a Michigan guy like me, they personify southern hospitality. And I mean that in the best way possible."

Easily accessible by Lyft or Uber within 10 minutes to great restaurants and the beach or walking distance to both if desired. Communication was a breeze. Both were very responsive to text and inquiries. If suggestions are needed for eateries, Steve and Marcy had plenty.

We got to use the brand new grill and all the linens seemed to be brand new as well. We were able to walk to Downtown Morehead and enjoyed meals there as well as well as watching fishing boats come in with their catches. This is the perfect area downtown. It’s quiet but close enough to walk. We also really enjoyed the front porch with its rocking chairs and swing chairs. It felt like we were in a Norman Rockwell painting! We will definitely be back!!

It was nice having a washer and dryer and coffee provided. Scott was great until after check out. The very first message I sent him when requesting to book was that I would be traveling with service dogs. I offered to provide paperwork to which he said no need since my reviews were great. After checkout, he requested fee for pets and sent a smart message asking did I not see that dogs weren’t allowed. I sent a screenshot back of my first message to him and he apologized stating that he forgot. Next time, I would recommend checking back through messages before sending guests smart messages accusing them of wrongdoing. Other than that, the place is great."

A quick drive across the bridge and you’re in Atlantic Beach or you can drive 5 mins and be in downtown Morehead City. The spiral staircase to get to the upstairs bedroom is cute but might be tricky/dangerous for little kids or people with mobility issues. That was not an issue for us but worth noting. The driveway is huge and actually had plenty of room for us to park our 22’ outboard boat overnight before we left, which is not always the case at beach houses. We would definitely stay again. The host was super friendly and responsive."

Stayed one night",All I’m gonna say is this was the best trip my husband and I have taken ever ! We normally stay in the NC mountains but my husband surprised me with a mini vacation for my birthday and decided to try a different location. We absolutely LOVE the mountains but as soon as we left Dans place I was already looking at available dates for a future trip! Very relaxing place and we rented electric bikes and we’re able to ride those EVERYWHERE we went ! Stay here at Dans and I promise you won’t regret it !

You can always tell about the care of a place when you see what’s under the pillowcases and sheets and when I took them off at the end of this day everything was really white and good, clean condition.

Dan was a great host. When I booked, he sent all the necessary information and another full email of restaurant recommendations and a town to do. I did not, but the restaurants were on point.

Inside was spotless and great for our guests and us. Our pup loved the sun room and cooling off on the tile, and really liked playing in the backyard. The house keeper was friendly and even offered him a toy which became his favorite pastime on our mini-cation. The host had great recommendations on places to eat which came in handy. Plenty of things to do in the surrounding area. Beaufort is a beautiful small town with great coffee and small shops. Next time we hope to get over to some of the islands and do some fishing. Fort Macon is also a great place to visit. This was an excellent experience and we will be back!"

Location wise it’s perfect to be close to the downtown shoppes and restaurants but also far enough that it’s peaceful and quiet when you’re hanging at the house. The property was extremely clean. She answered all of our questions in a timely manner. If you are from out of town, The Friendly Market was a great stop for food items and The Front Street Grille in Beaufort was our favorite for tuna tacos on the deck. I would recommend this Airbnb to my closest family and friends! We really enjoyed it."

Moorehead City has great restaurants and I enjoyed wonderful seafood every day. The house is cute and comfortable. It made a great base and has a fenced yard. I walked a lot and there are some nice walks in the area. I went walking on a beautiful beach at Fort Macon which was so quiet and dog friendly, less than a 10 minute drive from the house.

Stayed with a pet","This was our second stay this year at Paul's place. We love how it is close to everything especially the sound. It was wonderful to meet Paul and Sandra this visit, Paul gave us fishing tips, where to go, the best bait to use and even gave us towels to use for fishing. We love the house, has everything we need, even a fenced yard for our 96 pound fur baby. We love it so much we will be back in the fall but this time for two weeks. One week is just not enough to see and do everything we want. Plenty of family restaurants in the area to eat at and my favorite place- the Waffle House for a pecan waffle (we don't have them in New Jersey). One must see for visitors- Fort Macon, the history in the area is amazing. We even found time to walk around the town of Beaufort and checked out the Maritime Museum. Thanks for everything Paul and Sandra. Looking forward to talking again soon. -Jody and Bill Stewart for New Jersey"

The beds were comfortable for our taste and the screened in porch was an added bonus. It is on the main street so you will hear traffic noise but that's to be expected. The hosts were great at communication and made sure we had everything we needed, they made it a point to say hello and introduce themselves. Hands down we will stay here again if there is availability!"

The space was perfect for our small family and included everything we could possibly think of or need. Little details like the restaurant recommendation list on the fridge was especially helpful since this was our first time visiting the Crystal Coast. The location of the home is perfect for just about anything you could need, being right by the bridge to Atlantic Beach and having the grocery store right down the street and the endless ice cream shops to choose from. My son enjoyed being able to play in the backyard and having it fenced in is wonderful."

We had a great paddle board on water 3 blocks away for a great week of fun and relaxation. A short drive/crossing of bridge and a couple miles South is a great often free public oceanfront beach parking area for day trips. The house is simple, always clean, and host fantastic. Can’t ask for much more. 3rd trip staying here and will be back. That says it all."

The bathroom is fine, okay water pressure. You can park in the driveway. The yard is fenced and you are allowed to have pets, so that is great.
The only negatives are pretty minor, for one the only coffee maker is one of those coffee pod deals, and there weren't even enough coffee pods for both of us for the time we were there. We had brought ground coffee and cream for ourselves but we couldn't use it because of that. The other thing to know is that the house is on a big main street so there is a fair amount of noise.
All in all, a good experience."

Stayed over a week","Fantastic spot in Morehead. Five minute drive to Atlantic Beach and also close to Beaufort and downtown Morehead. The Airbnb worked great for remote work too - great WiFi and the screened porch is awesome. Know it’s on a busy street, so expect to hear traffic but nothing too crazy. Place was clean, and Paul was a super thoughtful and responsive host"

Stayed with kids","The place:
Fantastic getaway home. We will definitely book again and be back. Great host, amenities, and location. Felt totally at home while away. Hosts were super friendly, communicative, and helpful. The washer/dryer was a nice bonus to have for beach towels and suits. Kitchen was perfectly equipped and worked great for us as well as bathroom was well done with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Also there is a spot near the great sunroom to park a trailer out of the way if you have one. We loved being able to bring our fur babies with us and the fenced back yard was nice to have. Next door neighbor was super nice and even share her friendly dog’s treats (with my permission) to our ‘kids’ one day when they were out. The Wifi was great and back porch area with hose, and walkway kept beach sand out of the house. Small grill was available as well, but we didn’t use.
The area/what we enjoyed in town:
We walked to the great sound/beach bridge area (just 3 blocks away) two different days for some chillaxing) sand/swim time close to the hosue. A perfect morning or evening spot if don’t want to drive the short bit across the bridge to public beaches/shops. Across the bridge we took a right and went about 4 miles to a free ($10/weekends) park/public beach area/ lot (3C I think- look for red signs) which had plenty of spots, a portable toilet, nice walkway through mangroves to fantastic warm water wide beach area- and was just perfect for a day of sun & fun!). Atlantic Beach is super close to house, easy & just a fun trip past shops, Food Lion, and has access to some great restaurants. Speaking of: We loved Amos Mosquito’s (bridge/island side) and Snapperz Grill (3 miles down from house on Arendell St) for some reasonable $$ fresh seafood and drinks (great kids options too at both). We also spent 2hrs and just $30 at BB’s arcade having some funny with son and Dairy Queen for some ice cream just blocks away (walkable). Tip: most places close 9pm (perhaps COVID?) so go early to beat the crowds 5-6pm for things like PuttPutt or dinner. We also did a trip to the Beaufort waterfront area just north (12 min drive) and enjoyed the shops and snacks there.
We truly had a great relaxing time, perfect weather, and enjoyed this perfect place to call our home base. …Now to just figure out how to shift our careers, so we can move there for some year round living and family water fun. Thanks again - highly recommended and great value!"

Stayed about a week","The house is cute and close to everything. Atlantic Beach is a 5-10min drive, depending on traffic, and you can walk to the sound from the house in just a couple minutes, so we took our dog there for swims. Speaking of our dog, he enjoyed having a fenced yard to hang out in. Such a rarity for AirBnBs!! We highly recommend staying here. Paul and Sandra are very helpful and communicative, and if you need anything from them, they live right across the street!"

I washed and dried a couple loads of clothes and the machines were surprisingly quiet.
A train did go by 2 or 3 times that we saw, all during the day, so it wasn’t a problem. The road was a bit busy, but we never had a problem with noise.
We chatted with the nice neighbor and their dogs. Our dog wanted to play with theirs, no problems sharing a fence. Plus the neighbor dog wasn’t out much when we were and there were no issues with barking.
We plan to return and would definitely recommend this house."

My husband was eager to fish, and was pleasantly surprised by the close access to both the beach (6min drive) as well as the sound (radio island: 6min drive). Being off the island was a surprisingly convenient way to experience Atlantic Beach, and we will definitely be staying here in the near future!"

Everything was well stocked for us. We enjoyed sitting out on the back porch to eat / chill out. They kept the place very cool for us - which felt amazing after being out in the humid heat. I definitely would go back. Highly recommend the restaurants that are in walking distance - Catch 109 & Redfish Grill. And recommend going to Shackleford Banks to see the wild horses. Amazing!"

Every square foot speaks to the intentionality behind the design. From the ""just right"" sized kitchenette to the comfy bed, the work bar and everything in between, this space has a flow about it that is very accommodating with subtle yet refreshing modern twists. The host was very accommodating and responsive when we needed assistance and we couldn't have been more pleased with a rainy yet extra cozy Memorial Day weekend stay."

Stayed a few nights","Kevin was a very kind, professional and helpful host. His communication was helpful and very responsive. You get the feel that he cares about his guests and wants them to enjoy their stay. The studio was exactly as listed. The place was pristine and very comfortable. The aesthetic was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. I enjoyed sitting on the deck/porch. There was a booklet that gives local recommendations of places to eat and things to do all which are very close proximity to the property. Although the studio is attached to a home, it feels that you are truly in your own private space. At one point, someone who lives in the home was in the backyard watering her plants and she spoke and was very kind. Even introduced us to her sweet poodle. We were never bothered and it felt very private. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Promise Land Studio! The studio was exactly as described and very clean. The bed was also very comfortable and we slept well. Our favorite part of the place was the private porch. We enjoyed chatting on the porch together while enjoying the beautiful weather! The studio is also very close to downtown restaurants - we walked everywhere in Morehead city with our longest walk being 10 minutes. The place is very convenient to Atlantic Beach as well!
Kevin was a great host. Responsive, friendly, and clear. He answered all my questions and was generous enough to provide us a bottle of champagne, which was a nice plus since we were celebrating our anniversary!
Our only disappointment was that we missed hot tub season (December-March) so we will definitely be returning to enjoy the porch with the hot tub in the future! Overall, we definitely recommend!"

Although I am not a frequent air bnb user I did feel a bit awkward walking between houses to get to the back of the house. It was a bit chilly inside upon arrival and we did message Kevin to turn the heat up as we have a baby. He was very accommodating when it came to the hot tub as it was scheduled to be uninstalled and he changed the day so we could enjoy it. Unfortunately the weather was not permitting! Overall the air bnb was very well put together!

Stayed one night","We did a last-minute stay over after a beautiful day in Morehead. Kevin's place just happened to be available, and we jumped on it! I LOVE when a place smells as clean as it looks! It was easy to find with Kevin's thorough instructions and easy to get in. We did not anticipate a hot tub but were excited to find it. Unfortunately, we had some power issues that caused it to reset making it unable to use. None of that was Kevin's fault or the result of anything wrong with the space. Rolling blackouts were the issue. It did affect our stay though. My biggest wish would be to have a few more pillows on the bed. Otherwise, it was a nice, simple stay in a super clean home in a quiet neighborhood."

Words can not express how extremely wonderful our stay was!! I mean over the top. We told Roger we were coming to see our son, who is a Marine, to celebrate Christmas. The next text I received from Roger said a they had put up a tree for us. When we got there not only was there a tree but also, Christmas things everywhere. Roger went over the top to make our Christmas away from home the best ever.
My adult kids loved the screened in porch (especially since it poured rain the entire first day). I just can’t say enough about the house and the host Roger."

The kitchen was well-equipped, but there are also lots of places to go or get Door Dash/Uber Eats from. There were board games and video games (and yard games in the shed). There were phone chargers and other helpful items (toothbrush/paste, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc), just in case you forgot to pack something. The boardwalk near the house had some beautiful views. We travel with blankets and towels for our dog, but they had a supply of them there (and dog treats)!

I'd say the house all the amenities of home, but there were more kitchen gadgets available than I have at home.
There were more than enough towels, linens, pillows, blankets and anything else we could have needed.
The entire house was clean and organized and beautiful.
Roger left an informative book with details about the home and the town including local restaurants, places they like to go and area attractions.
Thank you Roger for an amazing getaway, we cannot wait to go back again!"

We love its proximity to the Morehead City waterfront with a number of great options for dining and watching the sunset. We also love its central location with quick and easy access to the Crystal Coast beaches and the charming village of Beaufort. We brought our dog with us on this trip and enjoyed hanging out on the screened porch with him in the afternoons. Roger is a fantastic host and a very kind person who responds immediately with answers to any questions that may arise. It is evident that Roger and Pete love this house and the neighborhood and so do we. We will return at the earliest opportunity for another stay in this magical place.

The cottage itself is totally charming! Comfortable, well equipped, well organized! The most comfortable beds ever! Super sweet octopus-mermaid decor. Not overdone, just surprising in many ways. And 3 TVs! Wow!
We loved being able to bring our sweet dog along, and found she was quite welcome. And we loved being able to go out the back door straight to a lovely boardwalk nature walk with her, mornings and evenings. And sunset over the marsh was gorgeous!
The neighborhood is quiet, and we loved having our afternoon Happy Hour on the screened in porch in front.
Roger was more than just quick to respond. He provided suggestions for restaurants and even things to do on rainy days, because we had a couple of those. Roger seems like the kind of guy you’d like to be friends with. I even sent him one of our vacation pics!
I would return here in a heartbeat!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I got exactly what we paid for, in a good way. The house was clean and neat, and I appreciated that the owners left initial use laundry soap, toilet paper, dish soap, etc.
Reading the comments/reviews left us with no surprises. For instance, the main road outside the house IS noisy at night, but it wasn't to the point that it woke and disturbed my kids.
It might have been a misunderstanding on my part, but based on the description, I was under the impression we could walk to the shore and spend time there. However, it seems you can walk to the shore, but private residents don't want you on that property. The beach is such a close drive though, so that wasn't really an issue!
The one incident we had was that the key pad did not work upon us returning from dinner. I called the owner and he was there within five minutes. Problem solved!
Overall, GREAT experience! We would return."

Beds were comfortable, linens smelled great and just helped with the overall clean feeling! House is cozy, was easy to relax and enjoy our family time. It is located on a busy road so we backed in the drive as much as possible and the train only came by one night for 3 mins, loud but not bothersome. No way would I pass this one up bc of the train! Daniel was very responsive but we didn’t really need him much, there were no issues! Great home, we will be back if we return to the area!"

Stayed with kids","Posting a full review to help other travelers. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Daniels place. The house had all of the amenities we needed. Daniel was prompt with communication, helpful & provided a guide for places to eat & visit.
The home was spacious, well decorated and had a great backyard space that we used for grilling. We also enjoyed watching movies with the surround sound & apple TV.
A few things to note: Having never been to Morehead City before, I didn't realize that the main road through town was actually HWY 70, a 4 lane highway with a train track running through the middle. Pulling out of the driveway with the traffic was quite a challenge.
If you are looking for a quiet stay, this isn't the spot, as traffic sounds & the train often rattled the windows.
However, if you are looking for affordable, cozy cottage close to the water - book this house! The house is centrally located. Its less than 15 minutes from most everything. My son loved Ft. Macon & the NC aquarium.
Also, not any fault of Daniel's, but something to note for those booking in the coming weeks (August 2022). There was construction happening on the neighboring house resulting in loud noises throughout the day.
This property also has a shared drive way, which is normally no issue, however the construction and piles of debris & trash from the neighbor were less than desirable.
The neighbor to the left was an older gentlemen & very friendly. He welcomed us, offered us great tips and places to visit.
Overall, after our stay, even with the noise, I would come back to Daniels place if we are ever in Morehead City. The home is well kept, centrally located, and a great alternative to hotels!
Thank you Daniel for being a great host, and allowing us to stay in this cozy cottage."

The beds are super comfortable. The kitchen is very well stocked. The hosts are responsive and helpful. The Apple TV and sound system made for some great family movie nights. So many amenities so close to the home.
This was a great vacation for our family! Helpful tips - if you are a light sleeper pack a white noise machine - we travel with Snooz machines and did not hear a thing once they were on. Go to Rose Seafood Market for the freshest fish in Beaufort! Enjoy the sunshine!"

Comfortable beds, kitchen well appointed; a good, solid place to stay and a good value. My only (very small) complaint would be that the house has *obviously* been smoked in, and the host has attempted to cover it up with strong cleaning solutions . It's tolerable and one does get used to it but still; the smell of cigarettes never goes away. In the end, the place was fine for a short stay."

Stayed a few nights","Ideal place to hang your hats for a few days. We were three adults, so we each had our own room. The place seems recently updated, and could use a few more hooks and towel racks…stuff like that. The room with the bunk beds needs another small table or chair near the bed for your phone, water glass, eye glasses etc. It’s clean and quiet with good heat and air, darkening curtains, good mattresses. The kitchen has nice appliances and is well stocked with dinnerware, but not many pots and pans. The kitchen table is very small considering it is advertised for six, but there’s a large living room with lots of couch space. It’s really very nice and priced right, we all thought."

The place also comes with a puppy named Piper Cub and she is precious. We loved the small details like free coffee and a little fridge in the room.
The bedrooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. We especially loved the outdoor showers."

house is in a quiet neighborhood. The bedrooms are well appointed and comfortable, and
although we didn’t use it to cook in, the kitchen was spacious and very clean. We enjoyed
meeting Surfie – she was laid back and made us feel at home immediately, and her sweet pup,
Piper. We had a great night’s sleep, which is what we desperately needed, and would

Easy 10 min drive. Uber and Ubereats were available when I needed it. Did not have any issues with that. The room was nice and big, very comfortable king size bed. The bathrooms were right there (there’s 2 to share between the 3 rooms) and Surf had little extras available in case you forgot something- even a curling iron! Surf is an awesome host and was very nice. Great communication. Her dogs are so cute and well behaved. They did not make much noise and there are doors and gates to help keep your space private. I would absolutely stay here again if I come back out to this area. Oh and the area itself is beautiful. Surf made some great recommendations for food and things to do. This place is awesome and so is Surf! Highly recommend a stay here."

Surf was responsive and quickly accepted my request for one of her rooms. I rented a lovely large yellow bedroom with easy acces to one of two bathrooms. It was quiet even with another guest. Bed was very comfy. And all the amenities were there. Clean. Fresh smells. Loved it. I had some back issues crop up and my gracious host helped me with luggage too. Such a sweetheart! She was lovely to chat with too. I felt fortunate to find this place. I will too if you opt to stay there. 💜

I was bitten 3x in my life but these dogs will not show any interest in you . The place is very clean, plenty of closet space for 2 adults and plenty of hangers available . The bathroom have even bidet, commonly used in France and some countries of Asia ."

Surf was very a very friendly and pleasant host: I arrived a bit later in the evening, and despite that, she took me through the house and gave me a thorough rundown of everything. As a person who went to Morehead City for diving, I'll say she was accommodating when some plans were shuffled around. The room itself was spacious and warm, and there were options for T.V. for late at night when I wanted to wind down. The price was quite reasonable, especially compared to some of the hotel rates in the area. All in all, I really enjoyed the stay and recommend this host to anyone coming into the area."

They came around to say hello and receive pets from anyone who offered (: Our room and shared bathroom were clean and colorful.

Stayed a few nights","I cannot possibly recommend Surf highly enough as a host. She has thought of everything and more to make her rooms comfortable and inviting.
It's little things like a coffee maker in the room to bath puffs if you forgot yours. Menus and maps are provided, detailed instructions and information are provided, you won't need a thing.
Emily and Diesel are amazing co-hosts. We love dogs, so their presence was a huge plus for us. They're both super sweet and friendly.
We're hoping to go back down to MC/AB, and if we do, we'll definitely be checking Surf's availability first."

Stayed one night","We got lucky looking for a last minute place to stay in Morehead City last weekend. We couldn't find a decent hotel that wasn't way overpriced, and we had never tried a BnB before. So we took a look at what was available on Airbnb, and chose Surf's home, location just minutes from downtown Morehead City and Atlantic Beach. We didn't know what to expect but Surf put us right at ease. From the beginning she communicated everything we needed to know about the 3 rooms she rents, and how things work at a BnB. She was always available, even suggesting restaurants that we tried out, and were excellent. There were all the amenities you would expect from a nice resort, and much more available to us. The house, a mid 50's ranch house, just like I grew up in, was spacious and very clean. There is a kitchen and living area that anyone can use. She has 2 dogs, Emily and Diesel, and they are very sweet. We hope to visit Surf, Emily and Diesel again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay! It completely exceeded my expectations. I loved the open floor plan of Surf’s home. It is spacious and very comfortable. I stayed in room 3 and my bed, oh that mattress is the best. I slept great! The room was just right. The most important thing to me was that every time I walked in from outside, you could just smell the clean! Surf keeps her home very clean and that’s very important to me. She would always have the trash taken out before the can was full.
Surf’s place is in a great location. Only minutes from the waterfront in Morehead or to the shopping centers on the west side of town. Very convenient!
Surf’s personal touches and her attention to her guests are amazing! She’s got a great movie collection as well. Surf’s local knowledge is priceless, if you want to know anything about the area, just ask her.
I would highly recommend staying at Surf’s. I stayed for 5 nights and had a great time! I felt like I was at home. I look forward to staying there the next time I go back.
Thx Surf!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a truly amazing AirBnB experience.
Surf provides so many little touches and amenities above and beyond what one woul d expect from a hotel of the same price. Excellent hospitality. If you are 't sure how you will like the shared space this is a great trial run as there are multiple bathrooms. There was one additional couple staying while we were there and I only saw them on e time in the kitchen.
Super convenient to the beaches. Fenced yard for your traveling dogs. Adequate parking. Really nice, clean, bright, airy location.
This was the perfect experience of staying at someone's beach house. Clean. Well kept. Well appointed. And too many special touches to keep up with. From soaps and shampoos to coffee with cream and sugar, the extra toothbrush and personal items that would otherwise cause a frantic late night trip to the drug store.
If you want to experience Southern charm and a real treat right in the heart of Morehead City visit Surf! Bring your well behaved dogs. Leave the drama and stress of the real world behind and have a true vacation."

She was fine with us leaving them out to play and romp in the yard while we were gone, which was an unexpected pleasant surprise. So almost like a doggy day care and Air BnB in one!

The rooms worked well for the three of us renting two rooms. And the layout would work well for someone who just needs a single room. Her dogs are sweet and get along well with visiting dogs. Surf is a wonderful host. She responds very rapidly to requests for information or with help in general. She even found the ring my daughter left and notified us right away - we were able to stop back and get it before we left town. Thanks Surf!"

There was a coffee maker in each room and a basket of toiletries in the hallway in case we forgot anything while getting ready for the wedding. The house is set up well for airbnb with 3 guest rooms and 2 bathrooms on one side of the house and the owners room on the other side. I highly recommend staying with Surf if your travels take you in or around Morehead city!

Stayed about a week","Fabulous, it was a challenge to leave!
This wonderful home has a very warm and welcoming ambience, a fantastic place for an outer banks experience.
Sit on the porch with your morning coffee or with your evening beverage of choice, relax and soak in the quiet neighborhood and birds sounds.
The host quickly responds and did much to help us change extend our reservation due to our circumstances. Very gracious."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at this lovely home! We had a very long day of traveling on the day we checked in, and when we walked into the house, it just felt so welcoming.
I really appreciate the fact that the kitchen was stocked with essentials. There was plenty of coffee and disposable plates.
The house is located on a quiet side street. There is a small public water view area a block away.
The only downside for us is that we won't be able to keep coming back after our baby gets a little bigger! The house can really only sleep 4 people."

We loved having coffee, snack time and evening talks on the porch while we met with other families in the neighborhood. A park is only 2-3 blocks away and if you have kids, the streets are perfect for bikes. The beds are comfy and the kitchen has everything you need - including two types of coffee makers. We will be back for sure!"

Stayed with kids","We traveled to Morehead City in mid September so my husband could scuba dive. We had a 23 month old and 8 week in in tow. This house was absolutely perfect! It had everything we needed for the week. It’s super cozy and quaint. The owners got back to us ASAP about any questions we had (ie best beach to take our toddler to). If you’re traveling with young kids, this is a great location & house! The street is very quiet and safe, great playground 2 blocks away, and the beach a block away was perfect for little kids. We’d 100% stay here again. It was our first family vacation with kids and we couldn’t have had more perfect accommodations. Ps - the coffee bar was a lifesaver for us! Do yourself a favor and book now."

Stayed a few nights","The host did a fantastic job stetting up the house the bed, bathroom and everything was clean, just not the roach I saw the moment walking in. The issue arose when the stairs to the upper level was locked off. This wouldn’t be an issue if this was stated instead of a private “entire home”. I state private because of why I’m writing this. We would have had a lovely stay, if we did not believe that someone was in the upper floor. We heard foot steeps, muffled voices a door close. Sounds which made us extremely uncomfortable to the point we had to leave early. The host assured us that no one was above, but I strongly disagree."

We enjoyed riding our bikes to the downtown area (restaurants, shops, piers, etc.) and walking around on some of the nearby streets. We were a very short car ride to Beaufort in one direction, and Atlantic Beach in another direction. We enjoyed watching the sun set at the end of the street. Beth was very responsive with any questions, and overall very helpful. We liked reading about the history of the house and seeing some of the family pictures through the years. We will definitely consider staying here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We wanted somewhere near the beach and hesitated about Morehead City being more inland, but it turned out to be better than we ever expected. MC is a real town with a storied past of fishing, boat building etc. (not just tourism), a great selection of good restaurants on the water, and an adorable historic district where the Teague house is located. Plus, we could see the splendid inner coastal waterway from the spacious front porch and walk to a ""hidden beach"" one block away for the first swim of the day. A 5-minute drive over the causeway got us to the gorgeous Fort Mason State Park Atlantic Beach, which by the by, has a fabu walking trail with all sorts of flora and fauna. Did I mention the house itself? Everything you need for a very comfortable stay. THANK YOU. This was a real discovery."
