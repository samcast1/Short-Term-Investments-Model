Stayed with a pet","Beautiful older home with all the character and modern amenities. Nice shower and bathroom. We checked in at ten pm and out at 10 am so we were not there for long but it was cute, comfortable, welcoming, easy access, great yard for dogs, and a very responsive host. Highly recommend."

Stayed with a pet","We are from WV and moved to South Carolina over a year ago. when we come back to visit with our dogs, we've always stayed in a hotel. Clara's place was perfect for us. The big fenced in backyard was perfect for our dogs to run and play. The kitchen and bathroom were modern and had exactly what we needed as far as utensils, linens, etc. The rest of the house was homey and comfortable. We spent our mornings eating breakfast on the back porch and checking in on the bird's nest that was there. We will definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","Felt like a cozy stay at grandma’s house, in the best way! Clara has thought of everything you could need and more. We got in late and the self check in was perfect. We were greeted by a welcome basket of snacks and waters. We took our dog and she loved the fenced in yard as did we. The house has the perfect porch for sitting and taking in the scenery. Parking was close and the area felt safe. Plenty of extra amenities you won’t be disappointed."

It's hard to find a place that takes pets and is so much more rare to find one that WELCOMES them. Thank you Clara and Frank for going above and beyond for your guests! We'll be back next year.

Stayed with a pet",We just loved the space!!! Felt right at home and the beds are oh so comfortable I know I slept like a baby. Space was clean and a great location. It was perfect for our dog he loved the backyard he explored every inch of it. It’s set up perfectly upstairs. We didn’t use the kitchen except to make coffee and tea but you have everything you need to cook a meal. My son says a 10 out of 10 he recommends this place. We will definitely stay again when we return to Clarksburg. You can’t go wrong with this place. I didn’t even mind the stairs to the second floor. Perfect place to stay!!!

Stayed with a pet","Had to book last minute for a family funeral in the area. From start to finish Clara was kind, respectful and responsive. Property is pet friendly and my dogs loved the backyard. It was so nice not to have to worry about the paperthin walls and noise of a hotel causing my chihuahua to be a nervous wreck. So many interesting antiques in the house, we especially loved the fireplaces. It is an interesting layout with only kitchen downstairs and all else up, but was convenient for our needs. Nearby FOP restaurant also serves a great breakfast. We really enjoyed the peace and convenience of this location, thanks Clara!"

Stayed about a week","This was my first time visiting stonewood wv, when I arrived the house was in excellent condition and considering I live far away I was allowed to check in early which was a huge bonus, there were even snacks! The neighborhood was very nice and cozy, the house was as well. Clara was a wonderful host and answered any of my questions right away which made me feel even better about staying in an unfamiliar place. There was even a paper with the history of the house and it’s ownership throughout the years which was very interesting to read about. She also provided a binder with a list of local restaurants/menus and activities. I stayed over the holidays and she even wished me a happy new year which was very nice of her. I would absolutely recommend staying in sweet sisters manor, and would definitely stay again. Originally I was only staying for 2 weeks but I enjoyed the peace and quiet so much I was able to extend my stay and Clara was kind enough to allow me to do so without hesitation."

Stayed with kids","This place was fantastic! The house had everything we could've needed. I do a lot of cooking and always take certain kitchen items with me that you don't often find in rentals, that was not necessary with this house. The kitchen is very well stocked. The house was very comfortable and nicely decorated. We loved the pellet stove in the evenings. The outside area offers ample seating options and bring right on the water was a blast. The only complaint we had was the neighbors dog. It barked anytime it was outside and just wouldn't stop. I'm sure there is not much the owner can do about this and it didn't effect our stay, just a little annoying. We would definitely stay here again and are trying to figure out if we can get back while the weather is warm this year."

Stayed with kids","Peaceful idyllic location for a family gathering. There are lots of nooks for each person to have independent time, and large welcoming spaces for games and watching movies. Fully stocked kitchen, outfitted well enough for a full Thanksgiving meal for 7 people! The wood burning (pellet) stove was cozy and warm and the river was gorgeous flowing by. It was too cold and too rapid flowing for boating or even fishing but there was plenty of other things to go. The memory foam beds were a great and there were thoughtful extras everywhere. Don’t miss out on the Valley Falls state park nearby. The views are exceptional."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful setting. House was very clean and comfortable. My 3 grandkids had fun at the river. I wish there had been more of a sheltered area where they could play in the water. The current was very swift and we were afraid to let them swim.
We enjoyed our stay very much.
The only criticism would be that I wish shampoo, soap and conditioner were provided. They always have been in houses I’ve stayed in before so I didn’t bring any. Required an extra store run.
With that aside, I would recommend this property."

Group trip","A great surprise! House was across river from the house our daughter was born in 52 years ago, and the church was the one my husband left to become a minister 50 years ago! We were there for family reunions and were so excited to introduce (or reintroduce) our grandchildren to our family and friends, and to the area! My husband has dementia, so this was a very special vacation to see all our family. The house was perfect for it, as our grandchildren loved the river. Comfortable, plenty of room for the seven of us. Kitchen easy to use.
We have rented dozens of houses in Italy, Mexico, Hawaii and many in California (where we have lived since 1983) but none as special as this!"

We spent the entire time kayaking, swimming and hanging out on the deck. The home is large and I would recommend for large groups as there is so much space and areas to relax. Beautiful locations and waking up to the peaceful river each day was my favorite. The hosts were very communicative and worked with us on multiple requests. Thanks so much for making our weekend unforgettable and relaxing!"

We never lacked for quality pots, pans or cooking utensils as we were there a week. The river was a bit fast for me due to rains, but a few in our group loved using the kayaks. Would definitely stay here again if we are in Fairmont.
Also, as a side note, we ate one night at the Dutchman’s daughter restaurant. If you are looking for great home cooking at reasonable prices, look no further. Their lemon meringue pie rivaled my grandmas!"

Stayed with kids","The property was near perfect. It was clean and the location was awesome, right on the river.
Owner communication was very good.
My one and only complaint is that there were renovations taking place. Most of it was completely tolerable, understandable, and turning out really well. The one incomplete renovation that I didn’t like was the exposed soffits at the roof which can lead to problems if not finished soon. I’m sure they’ll address that as soon as they are able.
Bonus- the living area has a HUGE nice leather couch that wasn’t there when the picture was taken.
Overall- it’s a beautiful property that they’ve done a great job updating. You can’t beat being right on the river. I recommend renting the place, as long as you are aware that, as the listing mentions, renovations are taking place (that theoretically won’t affect your stay at all)."

It was very cold, but I’m sure in warmer weather the outdoor activities would even take it up a notch.
Host was superb - provided detailed info and check-in/out were a breeze. Snow was predicted and she had ice melts dropped off for us.
There are minor things being worked on - mostly cosmetic and nothing troublesome, at least for our group. And that was made entirely clear in the listing.
Overall great stay!"

The beds were super comfortable and my disabled parents were well accommodated. Feels super private, but is convenient to everything. The train passing by, under the moonlight and by the river was magical!"

Lots of space to hang out with everyone and the upstairs has a place to hang out too if kids want to be away from the adults. The outside area was great. Really fun to take the kayaks and canoe out or have a fire at night. Definitely recommend staying here if you have a big group. Host communication was very prompt and informative. Such great time!

Stayed with kids","We loved our weekend getaway on the River!
We are a family of five, with three children ranging in age from 10 months to 14 years. Finding a space that accommodates everyone’s needs can be tricky, but this location was just what we needed.
The layout of the house was perfect. Open floor plans that provided plenty of space to move freely. Everyone had their own room and my 2 year old LOVED all the books and toys. I liked the use of the upstairs landing area; my kids could play upstairs while I was downstairs and everyone was heard. Bring a baby gate though if you have little ones who haven’t mastered stairs.
The kitchen was spacious and adequately stocked with pots, pan, and culinary equipment. We enjoyed cooking our own meals, making burgers on the deck, and s’mores in the fire pit. (We picked up groceries from the Kroger on the way in - about 20 minutes from the house.) The house does not have a high chair, so if you need one, bring it.
The aesthetics of the house is very appealing. Clean and spacious. Beautifully decorated. As mentioned in the post, the house isn’t finished; however, it’s doesn’t interfere too much with the stay. (There are some un-tiled areas, exposed plywood, etc. Nothing too major.) The master bedroom is spacious and comfortable. It has its own entry to the deck and it’s own bathroom. The bathroom has plenty of room. Unfortunately, the gorgeous bath takes too long to fill for it to be enjoyable.
One recommendation I would make is to install a stereo/speaker system. If you want to listen to music throughout the house, bring a portable speaker. We played it from our phones and it was fine, but a speaker system would add that extra refinement. There is a tv in the upstairs landing, but you can’t have the downstairs tv and the upstairs tv on at the same time. It may make more sense to move the landing tv to the bedroom.
We were very grateful to the hosts for giving us access to the canoes and kayaks. There are life vests for all ages. And easy, walk-in access to the river.
On Friday, we traveled 40 minutes to Tygart Lake and rented a pontoon boat. Definitely call the marina well in advance to reserve a boat. On Saturday, we went to Adams Street for the market and antique car show. Fairmont also has plenty of playgrounds for your little ones.
Overall, we loved our stay. Hosts were friendly and communicative. The house was clean and appealing. The river was easily accessible. There are neighbors immediately next to you, so it’s not a private getaway, but they were friendly and not noisy.
Thanks for a great time!"

Definitely check out the nearby waterfalls at Valley Falls and Audra State Park Rock City Trail. The Dairy Creme Corner has excellent and affordable food and ice cream, WildFlour restaurant is yummy as well. There is a local putt-putt golf place nearby too. Everything is within 15-30 min.
The house was clean and communication with the hosts was responsive and easy.
The were two things with this property that a renter should be aware of. They should not detract from you renting the property but I think are helpful to note. First, the house is quite noisy. The loft makes it hard to watch TV both upstairs and down and noise really carries overall. The steps are extremely loud no matter how much you tiptoe and every door in the house squeaks.
Second, the access to the river is a bit frustrating. The basement exit is private to the owners and there is no safe walkway from the front of the house because you have to walk directly on the narrow gravel road. This is fine, but for little ones, you will be constantly walking up and down to the house with them. I would also be wary of people with issues walking since it is a bit of an incline down the driveway.
Really fun and relaxing vacation with a home with nice amenities. Definitely recommend!"

A/C units (1 upstairs and 1 downstairs) worked very well during the hot weather and the wifi was very good. Kitchen has everything you need. Beds and bathrooms were nice, plenty of hot water, plentiful towels. Outside, we used the canoes and kayaks every day. The river was refreshing and clean for swimming. Water level was low so you can walk the entire river. (Recommend to bring water shoes as the rocks in the river are slippery.) We fished a lot and caught a few small smallmouth bass and rock bass. We used the gas grill and the fire pit for smores. Hosts were incredibly responsive before and during the trip. I highly recommend this house."

Stayed with kids","Sandra was a very good host and the property had a nice indoor pool, outdoor patio/hot tub. We were disappointed at it being listed as 5 Bedrooms which is what we needed but the 5th bedroom was actually a short single bed under the stairs and not a room. The 3 regular bedrooms were nice but they all shared one bath. The 4th bedroom had 3 queen beds and 3 single beds which made it awkward for multiple family/couple stays as it means all 6 beds (9 individuals) were in one room with one bathroom. The kitchen and first floor were very nice and spacious. We did have difficulty with operating the electric stove top in correctly getting the burners to heat per the dials. There seemed to be an odor in the bathrooms that may have been related to the septic system? Overall, we really did enjoy the house and the amenities and our host was very generous with stocking the kitchen which was very much appreciated. Sandra was also very nice/responsive to our pre-stay questions. Thank you."

Group trip",This trip was wonderful. My group went golfing and climbing in the area. The house was perfect and super relaxing to come back to and a great place to hang out. The pool was warm and relaxing and the living rooms were vast and lots of fun. Great communication with the host and easy to follow house rules. Really enjoyed all the unique features found throughout Moon Manor. Made truly unforgettable memories to last a lifetime.

Stayed with kids","We used the house as a base for a sports tournament in the area. It was the perfect alternato a hotel for our families.
The house was very clean and organized and had all amenities listed. The dorm style bedroom was great for the girls to have fun and be together.
We loved that we could cook, grill, and have meals at the house with plenty of seating for all. But we were also close enough to downtown Morgantown that we could go out for dinner as well. Walmart Supermarket was close by and had all groceries needed.
The host was very responsive throughout the entire stay.
The pool & hot tub & game rooms were great bonuses to this beautiful house! We definitely recommend and would stay again!!"

Stayed a few nights","The photos of this property do not do it justice. This home had everything we needed for our family of 8 including 1 year old twins plus our small dog. When we first entered the home we found the kitchen fully stocked. Our host had milk, bread, soft drinks, bottled waters, condiments, as well as pizza rolls. Those food items were extremely helpful as we definitely needed something to eat after our journey. Between our 3 teenage boys and pre teen daughter, they all found their own little space in the home. They dispersed between the workout room, music room, pool and hot tub. All of the beds were plush and comfortable. You will not be disappointed booking this property. It literally has everything you need for a large gathering or if you're looking for a home with an indoor pool. Thank you Moon Valley for an incredible last minute getaway experience for my family. What a wonderful way to really kickoff the summer."

Group trip","Sandra was proactive in letting us know the details a couple days out from our check in. Had kitchen stocked with some staples like cereal, milk, condiments, fruit, waters and sodas. That was a first for me and very much appreciated. Had a couple questions while at the home and Sandra responded within 10 - 20 minutes. Plenty of space for large family gathering. We had 9 one night and did not feel cramped at all.
Everyone commented on the bedding - how plush it was, loved the mattresses and comforters. Absolutely no complaints!"

Group trip","My family stayed at Moon Valley Manor for cousin's birthday, and my graduation. The home was absolutely amazing and was the perfect place to stay for our celebrations. The host was very responsive and helpful. The check in and check out process was easy, and they were flexible with us for check out! The hosts also provided us with some basic food for the kitchen which was very nice! Unfortunately, the pool heater was broken during our stay, but the hot tub was wonderful as well as the ping pong table and the very spacious living rooms. We loved that the guest book was a guitar, and my dad is a musician so the guitar and piano got lots of love! This home is PERFECT for family gatherings, and I cannot express how wonderful our experience was!!"

They were quick to respond as it was a pretty last minute change of plans with inclement weather creeping in. They were amazing hosts and left us eggs (from their own chickens), butter and bread at our arrival! Jeff checked in with us and was so friendly and offered us a travel sized toothpaste when we forgot ours. The house feels like a home right away. Incredibly comfortable bed, front and back porch to appreciate the nature, and a very modern bathroom. Wonderful stay, so relaxing, I will definitely be back!"

We loved sitting out on the deck at night and listening to owls hooting and looking at the beautiful sky. Everything was as described. Was a very lovely clean home with beautiful views. We got to meet Jeff, who was very nice and asked if there was anything we needed. They left a dozen fresh eggs and a homemade loaf of bread in the fridge for us which was very nice. There is not a lot close by to do but if you want to go to the mountains for some peace and quiet and just to relax, I highly recommended staying here. It's lovely.

We arrived late on a rainy night so it was very dark when we checked in but it was still a simple self check-in process. We enjoyed sitting on the covered porch while we listened to the rain on the trees before bed and then again in the morning. The personal touches add to the coziness of their place. The fresh bread and eggs were welcomed in the morning with breakfast before we were back on the road. Wish we could have stayed longer and will likely enjoy a trip back another time.

My husband said he would love to go back because there was a lot to explore in the woods on the property. We thought the price was low for what all the benefits. Thanks, Jeff and Faith! We loved it!"

Plan on coming here to destress and disconnect from it all. There isn't much to do except enjoy nature nearby. The house was amazing and perfect in every way. The bed was super soft and there were plenty of blankets. Everything in the kitchen was stocked to cook. The shower was epic with plenty of hot water, but the biggest sell was the back deck with the beautiful view. I recommend cooking at home and staying outside on the deck and enjoying the weather. The mountains are so much cooler during the summer than everywhere else."

Everything in the home was as described & they even had some fresh homemade bread in the fridge for us to enjoy. The location was perfect especially if you just need to escape from reality for awhile. The closest store was about 20 mins away so my only suggestion for people who haven’t been to the area is the buy your groceries in advance!

The hiking listed on the property were not well maintained out of the four trails only half of one was passable. The others were overgrown and a potential snake/tick risk. This was really the only down side, otherwise the stay was great. Dog was cute and friendly when introduced."

Everything was clean, and getting in when we got there, was very easy. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishes. You can park your vehicle fairly close to the door, so you don’t have a long way to carry your luggage. You do have to travel on some narrow and rough back roads ( part of them gravel roads) to get back to it, so smaller cars with low clearance will want to be cautious and use warrior fork road to come in. The hosts were very responsive, friendly and very accommodating! We will definitely keep this place in mind for the future!"

The fresh bread and eggs in the fridge was a nice touch - one I never expect simply based on previous reviews. Definitely a good thing we brought some extra food to prepare because it is a bit of a drive back in to town.
Regarding WiFi: It was pretty decent. It was stable and solid enough for surfing and keeping up with our online responsibilities.
If anyone has concerns about the roads, I can confirm the route from Mannington is just fine. There were a few pot holes in the last half mile or so, but overall the road was okay for sedans. :)"

The view was really pretty, but be mindful, you're definitely a hop, skip, and jump away from town (gps says 27 minutes from the closest grocery store). The cabin itself was super clean, and the bed was really comfy. The owners provided us with bread, cooking oil, and some fresh eggs. My only wish was the couch in the living room was a little bigger, but it's not a deal breaker."

Stayed one night","As many other reviewers have said, this is an idyllic place to get away from it all. The cabin could not be nicer and the view is indeed “almost heaven”. If you’re looking for a couple of days chilling out in the mountains then book without hesitation!
If you are looking for a brief overnight stay then it doesn’t work as well. “Remote location” is something of an understatement. Be sure to have all the food and fuel you need with you as there is nothing around for miles and the roads are challenging. We didn’t understand this and didn’t plan well but thanks to the fresh eggs left for us we had a fantastic breakfast for supper. 🙂 Also one quirk is that there is a door between the bedroom and living room for privacy but not between the bedroom and the bathroom. Decide if you’re comfortable with that. 😉"

We were greeted with a huge smile that never left her face (even when she didn’t feel well) to the eggs we were given (which were delicious). Sitting by the pond & enjoying the birds & the frogs. The house was supplied with everything you need. All you need is yourself & groceries that you may want to bring! Inside there are outlets with usb C & A ports. We drove an EV & Heather was so nice to let us use her charger. There are lots of parks & activities to do within a reasonable driving distance & restaurants in town. You will also get to see beautiful mountains & will come across some deer (they stay out of your way). Overall, incredible Host, spotless Home. Peaceful & private! Wish we could have stayed longer!

We witnessed the sunrise, painting hues of gold through the mist and over the pond cradled by the hills. Heather has meticulously attended to every detail, both within and outside the cabin, creating an ambiance of serene beauty. Our only regret is the brevity of our stay. I would love to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","I don’t want to be that guy, but I was displeased with my stay simply because this Airbnb wasn’t up to my standards. The king bed was in a room that could only be accessed by going outside and up some stairs. The WiFi was available but didn’t work well, I couldn’t watch Netflix or even use my phone. There was a dog in the neighborhood that barked throughout the night and the bathroom didn’t seem as clean as I would like and the water had a funky smell to it.
If you’re going with the intentions of disconnecting and being in a cabin this Airbnb would be great. But I was in West Virginia for a wedding and this Airbnb did not suite my needs."

The place was exactly like the photos, he had clear directions on things to do and things they offered! The river was BEAUTIFUL and I love how you can hear the river from the porch and even inside! Carl and I had amazing communication from the time of booking until we left! 10000% would recommend !!!"

Group trip","Nature's Getaway was probably the best AirBnb experience I've ever had. David is a great host. We were in town for my son's graduation and he was very accommodating to our schedule. The house is very well appointed with a very nice basket of snacks and toiletries. To top things off, when we returned from the graduation ceremony, they had left graduation balloons and a congratulations card. We were blown away. The setting is incredibly private with a beautiful pond and fire pit. All of this is just a few minutes off of Interstate 79. It has 4 queen or full sized beds and a set of bunk beds. There is a large dining area and outside patio for gathering. It would make an ideal place for an extended family or group of friends to spend a weekend and take in a Mountaineer game."

Stayed a few nights","We couldn't all fit in my brother in laws house for Thanksgiving so we had to find a place close to Maple Lake. It is slim pickings when it comes to BNB's in the area, but we found Jesse. For once, the place was actually larger in person than it appeared in the pictures. It's not a million dollar, marble countertop type of place, which you can tell by the pictures, it had a cozy cabin feel. Internet great, beds great, sheets and towels great. Apple TV on a big screen in the family room. Bathroom and shower are dated and have a bit of a college rental feel, but you can tell he is re-doing the place to fix it up and the hot water and water pressure in the shower was superb! Nice and safe neighborhood. We wish the weather was better so we could sit on the porch outside. It felt like we were staying in a friend's house for the holiday. Would rent again in a heartbeat while visiting family. Great central location for getting coffee and shopping."

I think we were the first visitors this summer (based on the guest book at least), so some of the outdoor spaces were super overgrown (and not really explore-able due to concern with snakes), but we did get some good use out of the firepit and main walking path!"

Group trip","Sean and Tracy's place provided us with an ideal setting for a peaceful weekend getaway with friends and family. The house is wonderfully situated, offering stunning views of the mountains and valley. The house was clean and it comfortably accommodated six guests, with all the necessary amenities and a well-equipped kitchen. The only drawback, I can think of, was the absence of an outdoor grill, but aside from that, our stay couldn't have been better.
Sean was incredibly responsive, promptly addressing all our inquiries and providing us with valuable recommendations for local restaurants and hiking trails. His helpful suggestions enhanced our overall experience and made our stay even more enjoyable."

Stayed with kids","The Holler was breathtaking. We live outside of Philadephia in a much more congested area, and from the moment we arrived, we felt like we never wanted to leave.
Sean was extremely responsive with suggestions on what to do in the area down to offering a map showing us how to navigate the property and also telling us about local community events and places to eat. It was more than enough room inside for our family, and we especially loved the vintage furniture. I have a vintage furniture shop myself and truly appreciated the mix of mid century modern with newer items.
The colorful king bedspread was my favorite!
We forgot our bug spray while we explored the property and Sean had extra inside to use! Comfortable furniture, very clean space, and the most peaceful stay we have ever had. This was our first time in West VA but will not be our last.
Thank you Sean for making this such a memorable trip for our kids and having us at the Head of the Holler! We cannot wait to book again"

Heather was the best host - letting us know we could check in early, showing us around the property, and even gifting us some fresh eggs. I became fast friends with Winnie, and seeing him at the door was a highlight of being there.
It was so lovely falling asleep with the windows open and hearing nothing but nature. The bed was very comfortable - and the frogs lulled us to sleep with their songs.
We will definitely be back - as it was a great landing pad as we took in some of the wonderful sights the area has to offer."

We were going to be early, but I planned to kill time until check-in. She went out of her way to get a place ready for us hours early AND upgraded us to a larger place, free of charge, since our traveling circumstances changed. The cabin was adorable! It was super clean, comfy, and the views were beautiful! Upon check-in, Heather had freshly picked flowers for us and a hand-written card, welcoming us. She also brought us farm-fresh eggs to cook during our stay. She made sure to check in on us via message, seeing if we needed anything. She even went out of her way to turn the lights on for us when we forgot. We often saw her out and about on the property and she was always SO kind and helpful. We loved taking in the scenery from the rockers on the porch and also playing with/loving on her pups! We will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","I've stayed at Heathers place before, and both times it has been a lovely little getaway. We live within an hour of here, but it's worth it to dedicate a night to sitting out in nature. The peace and quiet on Heather's little patch of land is incredibly refreshing.
The dock is lovely, and where I've spent most of my time when I've come. To sit by a fire and listen to the wildlife, drinking some wine, you can't beat it.
The small cabin is adorable, clean, and cozy. We brought food to heat in the oven and microwave, and both worked, and Heather even had a cookie sheet.
Fairmont is a small place, so you may want to swing by somewhere for groceries on the way in.
Just make sure you have good company when you come, be it person or a book. It's an incredible piece of land, and Heather is an absolutely wonderful host."

Stayed a few nights","To say this was one of our best Airbnb experiences is a total understatement - Heather's tiny farmhouse is an absolute gem that we were so lucky to find for our weekend trip!
The surrounding area had a lot of fun activities (hiking, geocaching, fishing) and the weather really treated us right during our stay. As we got to exploring the Fairmont area more, we kept finding ourselves itching to return to the tiny farmhouse for the peaceful environment it provided. On our last full day, we opted to keep our errands short so that we could spend most of our time at home, building a fire and watching the sunset on the surrounding hillsides.
The experience we had was nothing short of excellent, and we are already making plans with friends to return for a longer stay. While the place itself was lovely on its own, it wouldn't have been nearly as perfect of a stay without our host, Heather. Heather is accommodating, kind, and proactive, and we can't wait to visit her and the pups again soon! ❤"

Stayed one night","Heather came through like a super star. I booked it later in the day, and knew there was a chance of it just being too late. Heather responded, we agreed on an arrival time that gave her enough time to clean, and she confirmed the reservation.
The GPS address she lists was perfect, got us right to the front gate. A warning about getting there though: it's paved roads all the way there, but it's hilly, and a bit narrow in places. If driving in the winter time, do be cautious.
The tiny house was ADORABLE. It felt very cozy and immediately we were able to relax when we saw it. Heather ran the heater for us earlier in the day so the house was a lovely temperature when we got there.
Heather came out to show me how to light the pellet stove on the dock (HIGHLY recommend) and made sure we had drinks and snacks. Heather was so delightful, and I sincerely look forward to coming back soon to spend another night. Thank you so much for sharing your slice of heaven with us!!"

The place was cozy and comforting. Can’t say enough good things. Rural but not too remote - easy road to navigate in my low-clearance Prius, even at night.
Thank you, Heather! :-)"

It was nice she had so many items that would be easy to forget on your trip. The doggos are a great part of this stay. They are so sweet and we loved when they visited us. The rocking chairs were my favorite part, watching the birds eat on a chilly fall morning. Heather also let us help ourselves to some yummy apples and provided firewood."

Stayed a few nights","Don't think twice, as soon as you find availability for your dates book this heaven place. So peaceful and quiet. We have never spend this much time in our airbnb. This place is amazing. Glad we booked for two days. Get your fresh eggs for breakfast. Spend time at your porch or relax on the hammock. Watch at night fire flies (First time we have seen them live) Walk around, have a drink at the pond. Heather is an amazing host, her tiny house has everything you need. She also offered us to charge our rental car, which was a Tesla. The only thing I can complain about is there are no bug screens and we had to use AC at night which is very noisy. We would prefer the fresh air. I don't think this is an issue for everybody. Stop reading reviews and book this place, before it's gone:)
Thanks again for having us Heather."

Stayed a few nights","Easiest 5-star review I've had the opportunity to write! Heather's place was so charming and peaceful, and it's clear she's put a lot of love into her property. Getting there was easy, and Heather made check-in a breeze. As a solo traveler, the tiny house was perfect - the fully-equipped kitchen was great, the futon comfy, and I so enjoyed sitting on the front porch with a cup of coffee at sunrise and watching the fireflies at dusk.
The location makes it an ideal basecamp for adventures in the surrounding area - visiting Morgantown, hiking or climbing in one of the parks or forests, or venturing a little further afield. That said, the farm is so serene and lovely that just staying on the property itself is a vacation.
I think that perhaps the highlight of my trip was the host herself - Heather was incredibly warm, welcoming and communicative. Sitting on the dock at sunset with a glass of wine, good conversation, and the company of three sweet dogs was such a memorable treat!"

She had the air conditioning running, everything was very clean, and she was excellent with communication the whole time. She even brought me some food on the first evening, although respected my interest in privacy.
I particularly liked the detail in all the photos on her listing. I was able to plan what food to cook based on what spices and pots and pans I saw pictured in her kitchen cabinets. I highly recommend Heather's lovely cabin!"

Stayed with kids","The drive from Pennsylvania was absolutely beautiful- through mountains, the sky and clouds so close you feel you could touch them.
The house was easy to find, about 10 minutes off the major highway. All roads, though definitely “back roads,” were very well marked. The GPS on my Waze app led us directly here.
It truly is a beautiful location. Sitting on the porch in one of the rocking chairs or laying in the hammock is truly relaxing. The sounds of nature and the beautiful wind chimes are magical.
Inside, the house is perfect. The couch easily pulls out into a bed that is very comfortable! The kitchen and fridge were stocked with items that we had not thought to bring, including fresh eggs from Heather’s farm.
The water pressure is strong and it gets hot quickly. The appliances are perfect- easy to use and very utilitarian. There is storage for our bags and clothes.
The sky at night is incredible- so very many stars can be seen this far away from light polluted cities."

I was backpacking so had limited access to transport and technology so Heather went above and beyond what regular hosts do. The cabin is nestled in the most beautiful scenery imaginable, incredibly peaceful, like the old-fashioned America I had come to seek. The cabin was spotless and cosy, fully stocked, warm and airy. It was like a story from an old book: the organic farm, Heather's three hopelessly wonderful dogs, the chickens, the cardinals and fireflies, the windchimes, the old tractor, the meadow grass, the pond and dock, the most caring, generous host you're ever likely to meet. Regenerative, special. Thank you Molly, Winston and Juniper. Thank you, Heather. If I could put time in a bottle..."

Stayed a few nights",Pleasant Valley Retreat met our needs perfectly. I appreciated the nice shower head and plenty of towels. My very tall son appreciated his own queen-size bed. His little brother liked the bigger-than-ours screen tv. My husband liked that it was so close to the interstate exit and still peaceful. It was immaculately clean. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone.

Stayed one night","This place was at my midway point in my travels. There were several reasons why this place caught my eye on the Air BnB site. The space was free of clutter, the wood floors, and the reviews of past visitors. The place matched the description and then some.
When I arrived a herd of cows moseyed over to see me. They settled on the hillside meadow across from the place for a few hours. This added the the peacefulness of the surroundings.
Indoors, the place had a calming affect. Great bed, super clean rooms, a nice sized bathroom well stocked and great towels, the back lounge area had a comfy couch where I unwound from my 6 hour drive.
I wish I could have stayed longer. I will definitely be back as this is one of my favorite Air BnB stays!
I was able to spend a little time chatting with Kari and Brad, a truly lovely couple, on their porch in the morning.
I was able to see the small waterfall on their property. I only wish I had more time spend next to this natural water feature."

Holiday decor was a nice touch as were all the thoughtful snacks, creamer in the fridge (huge one for me) and s'mores-making station. Bed was comfy, bathroom was large and very clean, heaters and wifi were great, and the location is really lovely, quiet and rural, while not being too far out of town (and a pretty drive out). I saw some deer grazing, and everything was beautiful in the snow. Also, easy access from main road onto a smaller backroad to arrive. Parking in drive right in front of suite. I'd stay again anytime I'm passing through."

Their Airbnb space is extremely clean and nicely appointed. Everything that you could need is there. I was traveling for a work event and the kitchenette was perfect. Thank you so much for some yummy snacks and for providing for my love of coffee!
What a peaceful setting, it’s quiet and in the country, so it was perfect after several long days of work to be able to come back into such a relaxing environment! I was also quite fortunate to arrive and be greeted by 14 deer in the side fields!
I really can’t say enough about how comfortable they made me feel and how clean and comfortable the space was! I highly recommend and would absolutely return again!"

The hotel lacked all the wonderful aspects we found at Kari’s: easy checkin’, personal touches, snacks, QUIET, great communication. Yes, the Farmhouse, is off the beaten path but well worth it. 15 min to Morgantown, WV, and a bit more to Fairmont, WV, on a gorgeous windy road was easier than navigating the registration process at the big name hotel. I’m a big fan of simplicity and sincere human connections. This gem had it all. Sincerely, Nancy from Whidbey Island, WA."

The apartment is attached to the main house, but also feels secluded because it has windows facing out to a large garden and backyard. Kari and Brad have thought of everything, from snacks to coffee (with fresh cream and milk!) to little s'mores kits to an electric water kettle to bathroom supplies. Everything was so clean and organized, and we only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the space. We were touched by how thoughtfully everything was arranged for our stay!

I felt right at home, and they went above and beyond with the little touches that made it all the more comfortable… coffee/tea choices (with ALL the fixings), snacks, light breakfast choices… even though we didn’t get to meet while I was there (it was a busy weekend for all), I knew she was only a message away and was ALWAYS responsive. This will be our new place to stay when we are in the area… if you have the chance to book this Airbnb, do it. You won’t be disappointed!

The check out was at 10 am with no room for flexibility which made it feel like we were running against a clock on the last morning given while we were cleaning up. Otherwise, great stay!"

It's very comfortably furnished and has a lovely view of the river. We enjoyed watching the Canada Geese floating by. We've already booked for next Christmas and this will be our first choice whenever coming to the area. Heather was also fabulous to work with, very responsive. We really appreciated her clear instructions posted around the place too."

However as a person who would like to reunion with the family, that was everything. Kitchen had all things that we needed. Barbecue was very useful, we spend almost more than half day with bbq. There was a place just 7-8 min by car, we went for walking. That was amazing view, and weather. The sunroom of the house is very good. We would stay forever at that sunroom. Had our breakfast and tea time there."

Stayed a few nights","Heather’s Haven was beautiful and inviting from top to bottom. Being situated on the Tygart Valley River, the water view was great and access to that water was easy for my wife to take her kayak out. Heather’s house rules pay off in how clean and well-maintained the interior of her B&B is. Everything you need is at hand, so all you need to bring are food, clothing and toiletries (and firewood, if that’s your thing.) Heather provides a guide to area restaurants which was very helpful (Murial’s Italian Restaurant was amazing - FYI, ask for outside deck seating.) There are two queen beds to chose from (we chose the soft mattress over the firm) in case you have a preference of firmness. Our only warning would be for anyone with mobility issues as the front steps could be a challenge. We had no problem with them ourselves. Heather was very responsive and made the stay easy with her instructions. Thanks for the wonderful weekend stay!"

This space is beautiful, peaceful and serene. The view of the river was wonderful! I spent much of my time reading and reflecting in the lovely sunroom. Her cabin is one of the cleanest I have stayed. Heather has thought of every possible amenity to make your stay comfortable and welcoming. From the personalized welcome sign to her talented eye for interior design and color and stocked kitchen. You will not be disappointed. Heather is super responsive and helpful. We stayed in the area for an extended family graduation party. This location was super convenient to downtown Fairmont and to family in Farmington, WV. There are also several options close by for dining or pickup up necessities. We are thrilled to have discovered this gem on the Tygart River, and will definitely return. Thank you so much Heather for opening up your lovely home!"

The weather was a little less than cooperative over the weekend we stayed (100+ heat index and intense storms), but the house made that almost inconsequential. You have constant views of the river from inside, or plenty of places to hang out outside. The dock is nice for hanging out on the water and watching the boats roll by, and there were a lot of them cruising around. It's clean, it's cozy, it has everything you need for your stay, and the host is great with communication and the personal touch to make your stay worthwhile. Honestly would not think twice about staying again. Thanks for having us!"

Heather’s Haven is the perfect way to disconnect from the daily grind we so often find ourselves a part of. Heather’s is perhaps the cleanest and most well organized home we have ever visited, yet it still remains welcoming and comfortable. The warm wood tones of the interior spaces, along with the tasteful decor make it feel so much like “Home” and not just a place to stay. And, I can’t say enough about how helpful and accommodating our host, Heather has been. Definitely an overall 5 Star experience.
Thanks for everything, Heather!

Stayed a few nights","We had such a wonderful time. If you are looking for the “cabin in the woods” experience I highly recommend. It was close enough to town to be able to get groceries and such, but far enough away that you really feel “away from it all”. The house is gorgeous and the amenities are perfect. Sooooo much better than a hotel stay. I will say, it is a tin roof, I’m not a light sleeper so it doesn’t bug me, but when it rains you hear it. I find it calming, but the cheap foam ear plugs would be all you would need if you are a light sleeper- again I found it soothing because I love the sound of the rain. The sun room was by far my favorite part. Coffee and watching a calming river, I could relax all day.
And of course I should mention the owner. She was great to work with. She was so kind and honest and upfront. If you have questions just ask her and she’s quick to get back to you.
All around 10/10 will definitely be coming back again!"

Stayed a few nights","Let me first explain that less than a week before we arrived, my husbands mother passed and it was our 5 year wedding anniversary. Heather was very accommodating and understanding, as well as prompt with her communication. I would have given 5 stars, however the house rules were posted on bright neon paper and posted in multiple places throughout the cabin, as well as in the listing and again during the check in communication. I can only assume that Heather had previous issues, but we both felt like we couldn’t relax. We wore slippers when in the house but were constantly worried about the floors or water from the shower leaking. The view was relaxing and the near by Valley Fall State park was a great stress reliever and had wonderful views. Lastly, the bed was very uncomfortable and I ended up on the couch one of the nights. The place is beautiful and on the water and would be a great retreat. I think we were overwhelmed and were unable to relax."

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I had such a blast and it was so needed. It was easy to get to, communication was easy and fast response time, and the location was so ideal. Not far from town but tucked away right on the lake in a quiet neighborhood. The house was so cute and we loved the cabin feel. We had everything we needed for cooking and entertainment. I’m not a local but we wanted to try our hand at fishing while there and she sent me the info I needed for a weekend fishing license. The weekend flew by way too fast but we’d definitely love to come stay again if ever we are out that way!!! Definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a weekend getaway with a water view for a totally reasonable price!"

Stayed a few nights","Heather's Haven was the perfect getaway spot for my family. It is in a peaceful location on the river, yet within 5 to 10 minutes of plenty of dining and shopping options. It is also only about 20 minutes from Morgantown, so a great location for a WVU football weekend or if you're coming to visit a student there. It is a beautiful cabin with everything that you need. We spent two nights and enjoyed fishing, playing on the river, sitting by the firepit, and relaxing! The sun porch is the perfect morning coffee spot. We rented paddleboards from Wood's Boat House just down the river (they were the nicest people!) which were so much fun and exhausting for the kids! Everyone had a nap afterwards. The washer/dryer at Heather's Haven was a much needed amenity after playing in the river! LOL! We tried the Dutchman's Daughter and Muriale's and had excellent meals from both. We did take out from Dutchman's Daughter and ate at the picnic table by the river at Heather's Haven. We dined in at Muriale's. Muriale's salad and bread would be a meal in itself! Go hungry! We also went to Pufferbelly's for ice cream...great soft serve and friendly people! We hope to return to Heather's Haven for another getaway, maybe a WVU football weekend this fall!"

We were transfixed by the view of the Tygart River from her front room, a perfect place for a glass of wine or morning coffee. The space is thoughtfully appointed and so comfortable, we would have enjoyed a longer stay. Heather is a terrific host. When questions came up, she was quick to answer. Highly recommend."

Stayed about a week","We had a great time on our trip to Heather's place. The place was well stocked with everything you needed. The kitchen had everything we needed including a blender, keureg, and crock pot! We brought our kayaks and fishing poles and loved it. It was very peaceful and rejuvenating to wake up with the river right there and have tea on the front porch. We stayed here with our kids and there was plenty of room - make sure you know the upstairs is an open area so there aren't separate rooms. Heather has privacy screens if you want them but we didn't bother. One of our kids slept on the couch downstairs and the other one in a bed upstairs. Worked great for us. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat. highly recommend a hike at valley falls state park and coopers Rock state forest. we also loved the pepperoni rolls (a local favorite) from the County Club Bakery - hint get the sauce with peppers from there and bake them in the oven with mozzarella cheese and sauce - yum!) and we also enjoyed Murialle's for Italian. The young man at Coal County Mini Golf was great. We also quite enjoyed our visits on the dock from Robert the neighborhood cat. Check this place out. You will love it!"

Stayed a few nights","This was an interesting stay. While we thought the place was nice, there was a lot of stairs. making it difficult to bring up luggage's etc. when we got to the rooms we were extremely disappointed when seeing the beds. one room had a 5 inch mattress on a metal bedframe with no box spring or anything to cushion you from feeling the metal bars underneath you. and then the second room had a box spring but the mattress was cheap and broken. it ""v'd"" in the middle of the bed when 2 people laid in it. making it extremely uncomfortable. all pillows sucked. we contacted the host and asked if he would do something because my mother was sleeping in the recliner downstairs because it was so uncomfortable to sleep in the bed. the host then acted as if he was going to get some mattress pads to fix the problem, and when we said we would be there for him to bring them he said he was absolutely not doing anything for our stay and we could leave. RUN FROM THIS RENTAL. host was rude and is unhelpful."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time at the townhouse. It was well appointed with two large bedrooms that were both ensuite. Included was a Keurig coffee maker & well-stocked kitchen and bathrooms. A full-sized laundry is on-site. Check in was easy & check out was simple. The townhouse has one parking space (not including the garage) but there was overflow space nearby. It was a quiet place (except for our 17-month-old granddaughter).
Access off I-79 is very easy & US 50 is just a few miles down the road. The nearby amenities are very good with 2 gas stations nearby, one with Dunkin Donuts. Within walking distance are Meagher’s Irish Pub and Mia Margherita Coal-Fired Pizza. Just down the road is Mountain State Brewing. Highly recommend all 3.
Andrea communicated regularly and was quite helpful. It is a great alternative to the noise and expense of the nearby hotels.
Highly recommend."

Stayed one night",Absolutely loved my stay. This beautiful log cabin is located at Lambert's winery. I was able to stop by the winery for a glass of wine after a long work week. Beautiful location and property. Wish I could of stayed longer. The cabin was perfect and cozy. Pristine throughout. Loved my stay so much that we will be booking again for my husbands birthday come July. Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home with me.

Located in a great spot to be able to see all the hidden treasures of Weston too. Would definitely recommend and can't wait for a chance to come back again."

Toured the winery the next day which was also lovely with beautiful surroundings. The staff was very kind to show us around and provide a wine tasting. Their descriptions of their wines helped us choose some to take home! We enjoyed our relaxing time and conversation with the staff and Mrs. Lambert and hated to leave!

The living room and bedroom were set up well and comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was great. The back porch was fantastic with the hammock chairs and the great view and we used the fire pit both nights we stayed. This was our first time staying in West Virginia rather than just driving through and we are glad to know about this place should we find ourselves in the area again.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely FIVE STARS across the board to this location and our host, JB. Unfortunately, we got called to another job and had to leave much earlier than had planned, so we missed out on our two days of R&R while there. The cabin was cozy, the surroundings are beautiful, the place was very well kept, clean, had all amenities, spacious grounds and campus to enjoy the venue, winery, attractions, etc.
Nothing to do with their place, but just a fair warning for any T-Mobile users; their map is inaccurate and there is no cell service there. But no fear, JB has wifi in every cabin and it works great!
We sincerely hope to come back again soon and maybe next time, enjoy some down time to relax while there. This was a working trip for us as we were there as photographers/videographers for a wedding this past Friday.
We highly recommend the cabins, the winery, and the venue for any getaway, wedding, event, etc."

There are some lovely touches to this cabin that make it so much better than usual: all of the dishes match and are high quality; the pillows are amazing; the bed is adjustable and comfy; bedside lamps and table on both sides.
It's a couple's retreat in the best sense.
The winery being mere meters down the hill is just bonus icing on this cake of a cabin."

I took a chance and booked it for a surprise birthday getaway for my boyfriend and am so glad I did!! We were both very pleasantly surprised upon our arrival!! They offer two different rental cabins and a treehouse!! We stayed in Cabin 1 which has a covered porch on the back. The cabin was impeccably clean, extremely roomy and ultra comfortable. We were even able to bring our dog!! Cooper Bradley loved it just as much as we did and he even made a friend in the neighborhood dog, Romeo (such a sweety!!) We stocked up on wine, ate at great restaurants in the area, had a bonfire at our cabin and couldn't possibly have enjoyed ourselves anymore.

We are back for good. Dora's place has EVERYTHING we want.
I had a small problem with the door code - made one call and got it figured out quickly!"

There are 2 living rooms, 2 dining rooms (enough for a place setting of 16 people), and 4 porches! It is so spacious and comfortable. There's a fire pit outside and a huge stack of wood for a peaceful evening. Who would want a hotel over that? I am recommending it to everyone I know! We will be booking again, for sure!"

The layout of the kitchen and the first dining room made it so easy to prep food, feed the hungry kids (after a day of swimming) at the large counter/island while chatting with adults and then having our own diner at one of the two beautiful dining rooms. There was so much room for our group of 10, from the multiple sitting rooms/living rooms, areas upstairs, numerous porches and the lovely yard where we enjoyed a campfire every night with wood provided. The location is perfect; so close to ice cream, kayak rentals and the AWESOME Tygart Lake. We LOVED the lake. Wonderful stay!!!"

Due to pandemic WVU was late in finalizing graduation weekend plans. I explained this to host and she worked with me to confirm actual dates needed. Check in was simple. The house was clean and ready for guests. The outdoor spaces were beautifully maintained and we used all of them. Great property for multigenerational groups.

The hosts worked with us on early check-in (free) and late check-out (small fee) and were really great about both. Would come back to the property and the area.

Group trip","We had an amazing stay! The location is perfect, just minutes from the marina yet far enough away that you aren’t disturbed by anyone. The pictures don’t do this place justice.. There was plenty of room and the house has everything that we could have possibly needed. The master bed was very comfortable which made each night so restful. We will definitely be back for another long weekend this summer!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay! The cabin was extremely clean when we arrived. There was more than enough room for our family of 5 to spread out, but definitely big enough for two families to stay if needed. The beds were so comfy! We loved the fire pit and sun room. We also spent a lot of time rocking on the porch swings and watching the birds. We saw a giant wood pecker which was fun for the kids. The house had everything we could possibly need and I had no trouble cooking meals in the kitchen. I loved that I could look out the window and see the kids playing from the kitchen. Thanks Dora and Shayla for thinking of everything and giving us a break during these stressful times!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect place for a getaway in nature. This place had even more space than we expected and the park and multiple trails were less than 5 minutes away. There is also a Walmart only 10 minutes away, so you’re in the peace of nature but not too far from convenience. The beds were super comfortable and we loved the outdoor porch spaces to enjoy the stars and sounds of nature."

Group trip",We travel from Guatemala to Pittsburgh. We had taken the best choice for this house. It is a beautiful house. It has nice views. Our stay was during Christmas and New Year and the weather was cold but inside the house you have all what you need.

Stayed with kids","My family like many live far apart. Instead of traveling 8-10 hours each we decided to meet half way! It so happened this home was in the perfect location! There were 10 of us and we all fit just fine. The kitchen was so clean and easy to use (we made thanksgiving take 2). Every morning there were white tailed does up by the door close enough to touch! There is a very steep hill in the backyard that if you’re brave enough you can see the lake and a gorgeous view of West Virginia! What amazing way to view a state that the news and world would have you believe is dying as we speak, And I can assure you it is not!"

Stayed a few nights","This was, by far, one of the best escapes we have ever had! The home was an absolute gem- tucked away in the woods with access to everything. The home was spacious and had every perk you could possibilities think of. We loved walking the grounds, watching the deer wander through the yard and exploring the local sites. We did not want to leave. This home is perfect for large families or your secret hide-away. The beds we heavenly and the great rooms were spectacular! We enjoyed a fall fire, coffee in the deck and front room with cathedral ceilings and windows that opened up to nature. Well stocked! No detail was overlooked. Best bargain available and a very quick, charming drive to West Virginia University! Don’t pass this opportunity up!!!"

Group trip","I would highly recommend this place. The house was beautiful, with an amazing view. The kitchen was well equipped, more than what we were expecting. This place is so close to grocery stores and places to eat and yet very secluded. We enjoyed outdoor firepit and and spend time watching stars during our visit. We had cell phone coverage at all times and wifi worked pretty well. Overall we loved the place and would love to return."

Stayed a few nights",If you have a desire to explore West Virginia this is the place for you! There were only 4 in our party but this home can house a good size crew with room the spare. We hope to return with our grand-kids. If you plan to take one of the scenic trains in this area you need to book early!! Dora and Shayla are great host!!!

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this perfectly clean and spacious home. It was so comfortable and in a perfect setting right near Tygart Lake State Park. There was plenty of space for everyone in the family to relax and spend time together. The outdoor spaces were perfect at Dora's house, as well. We enjoyed coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings on the porch swing on the lovely front porch. We visited WVU for Fall Family Weekend while we were there and also ventured down to the state park to take a look at beautiful Tygart Lake. The beds were very comfortable after a full day of activities. The Wi-Fi signal was good, which my son's enjoyed. The kitchen was spotless like the rest of the house and was fully stocked with dishes and cooking utensils. We were able to cook dinner and two big breakfasts with no problem. I am looking forward when we can return to this beautiful home for some R&R and family time in the future. Thanks again to our gracious hosts!!!"

Group trip","What an amazing stay! You only had to think about something and there it was! This home is A+ and so clean and comfortable. We traveled with 9 and there was space for everyone. It was typical winding “country roads”, from WVU to our stay, but gorgeous and worth the extra mileage. Dora and Shayla were the best hosts! Stay with confidence and treat yourself to this amazing opportunity to stay in one of the best appointed Airbnb homes ever! Please care for it and preserve it for it gives so much joy."

Stayed a few nights","This lake cabin exceeded expectations in every way. The place was so clean and inviting it was easy to feel at home. There was nothing we couldn’t find or needed further than what was available at the cabin. Everything was so thoughtful. We are sure to stay here again very soon!
(There’s a puzzle on the open cabinet in the living room that kept us busy the whole stay..)"
