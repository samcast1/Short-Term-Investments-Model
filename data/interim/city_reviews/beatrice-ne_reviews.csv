The house had everything we needed: comfy beds, good WiFi for our younger son to do a bit of remote work, kitchen with the extras we needed to prep our own meals. The neighborhood was quiet and a nice place to go for a walk. I’m not sure when all 4 of us will be back for a visit, but we’d definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","It is a nice house with plenty of room for 8 people. However odd it seams, my favorite thing about it is the selection of mattresses. As someone with a bad back, mattress selection is important for me. There are four beds and they all have different levels of firmness. No matter your firmness preference, there is likely a bed in the house that will work for you. The house is clean, the neighborhood is quiet, it’s easy to find, and it is very private"

Stayed one night","This little cottage was exactly what I'd hoped for on a long road trip. We had our own private kitchen, bath, living room, deck, and bedrooms. We got in somewhat late, and though the owner's place was the house next door, we did not need to disturb them to get in. The beds were covered in beautiful, country quilts and were SO comfortable. The bathrooms had lots of soft, fluffy towels. The kitchen had everything we needed. And on a hot August day, the air conditioning was much appreciated. Thank you so much for the oasis in the miles and miles of corn and pavement in our day!"

The shower made a very loud screeching noise when in use and the house was a bit dusty, but other then that we weren't there long. I didn't understand why it cost more for 4 people compared to 1, but I assume that's a airbnb thing. It was a cute, little country house that reminded me of visiting my grandma as a child."

It’s a small place but had everything you need including a full size fridge and stove, and directv. It’s decorated to the time of the cottage’s age: 1940’s which was a nice touch."

The comment was made that this was like sleeping in someone else's grandma's house. And I suppose that is what it is.
Seriously it was a great value and a great house in the country to stay at. I wish I could have done a long weekend here and had some time to sit on the porch and watch the grass grow. We loved it.
The wifi wasn't super fast I think is my only complaint if I had to have a complaint.
Thanks again."

The drive from Omaha was beautiful- highly recommend “skipping highways” and taking the scenic route! There’s nothing relaxing about I-80.
When I walked in, my first through was “wow I should’ve brought friends!” This space is LARGE!
The space is super clean, remarkably peaceful and as others have mentioned, the industrial kitchen is hard to beat.
I came with just my pup- and a desire to relax and unwind after too much time in the city during all this. The stars were incredible, the sunset over the fields was incredible…there is something so reassuring about an open sky and crops.
The bed in the master was so comfortable! This is an incredible Airbnb. Book it!"

The nearby Homestead National Historical Park was also well worth a visit.

I loved the rustic hunting themed lodge and the sleeping quarters were perfect for the amount of guests . the kitchen was available for us to use and we were provided clean towels and washcloths. two bathrooms with two showers made it so convenient. the country setting and the history of the lodge made it a unique experience for everyone. I would highly recommend this place for the wonderful welcoming hospitality we received . anyone needing to stay and needing more than two beds. not set up for young children and the sleeping quarters are upstairs but still way more enjoyable than a hotel.

Stayed a few nights","Cub Creek Hunting accommodations are well set up for hunters, but also a nice place to stay for families. Very convenient to Plymouth (5 miles), Dewitt (7 miles), Beatrice (10 miles), Diller (13 miles), Wilber (14 miles), etc. We came for Christmas and were able to visit family in the area, and have plenty of space to host at our rental, too. The downstairs space has a well-supplied kitchen, bathroom (with shower), living area and 2 round tables that is convenient and cozy even though shared with the hunting business. The upstairs with 2 bedrooms, bathroom (with shower) and game room with pool table, is private and secure. Note that the bedrooms are all upstairs, so you must be able to do stairs if staying here. Each bedroom has 2 twin beds and 1 full bed. The decor is charming and comfortable, but with the log-style bedframes the Full-sized bed is quite small for 2 people used to a Queen or King. Hunting groups will appreciate the separate beds, though. Also note there is no counter space in the upstairs bathroom, so women with lots of beauty products will have to do some juggling. But the shower is very nice. The hosts live in a separate house on the property. They are very welcoming and communication was great. I highly recommend this property."

Group trip","We had a wonderful time at Cub Creek Lodge hosting our families Christmas with over 25 people. We had plenty of room for everyone to stretch out. Our hosts had the shop area heated with a corn stove so we were able to expand out into that area. They have plenty of tables for activities that ranged from eating brunch to our first annual gingerbread house design competition. They also have some nice sturdy round tables for playing cards. The teens were able to play a little basketball in the shop or get away upstairs to play pool. There were several couches for those that needed a relaxing spot to nap. The kitchen was great. We were able to put together or finish some dishes in the stove and had plenty of storage space for leftovers between meals. There were lots of outlets for crockpots also.
As for our overnight stay...we found the lodging to be very comfortable. They have lots of comfortable couches. The beds were fine and everything was very clean. The towels were fresh and plentiful."

The kitchen is equipped like a restaurant so we were able to cook some elaborate wild game dinners. Perfect venue for hunters with dogs.

They have hunting packages available depending on the time of year. We visited Vala's Pumpkin Patch one day and went to the very informative Homestead Memorial in Beatrice the next. Very enjoyable experience here."

Stayed a few nights","The kitchen, OMG, 6 gas burners, stove, and a giant grill. This is closer to an industrial kitchen than I could have imagined, including the industrial 3-basin sink that was super deep. Comes fully stocked with dishwasher, tons of plates and glasses, cutting boards, cast iron pans, and all the stuff others have left behind or that was stocked there. There were so many condiments and spices! There was fish fry, pop tarts, and saltines plus more left by others. We left our bread crumbs for breading meat. :)
There are two cushy couches downstairs and a cushy couch and loveseat upstairs with the pool table. Downstairs are two large round tables so you can seat everyone for meals at the same time. There is a TV downstairs and one upstairs with the pool table. One bedroom has a TV. I believe the shop area had one too. Free wifi was offered as well.
Both bedrooms are upstairs, each with a full and two twin beds. I found the bed to be firm, but still comfortable. The temperature was good. Pillows were fluffy.
One bathroom up and one downstairs. Each with toilet, sink, and large shower. The water is scalding hot if you aren't careful - -seriously, be careful. This is a major benefit in my book! Fluffy towels and washcloths were stocked. There was even some body wash in the showers in case you forgot yours. There was hand soap at the sinks and reasonable quality toilet paper. (I really despise it when people don't leave hand soap in the bathroom because who is going to remember to bring that?)
The ""shop"" area has a basketball hoop and a dart board and more seating. It also has another industrial 3-basin super deep sink. The front porch has a large picnic table and two chairs that sort of bounce/rock.
We weren't there to hunt, but we saw deer, rabbit, raccoon, and probably coyote tracks. We walked the path between crops and mucked about in the tall grass by the trees (no one ended up with ticks or other pests without using any bug spray).
The owners live on-site but in a completely separate house. They gave us all the privacy we wanted but were right there if we needed anything. Very kind and accommodating. They made getting there and checking in easy.
The Sun Mart grocery store in town is bigger than we expected for a little town, but they had late hours, were easy to find, and had a decent selection of things."

Stayed one night","""The Loft"" - A Novella by Daniel Brodecky
""Where are we supposed to park, on the street?"" Lizzie said. ""I guess anyplace is good, it's Wilber Hun"", laughed Danny. Lizzie had a charm about her that honestly only he could probably understand. Perhaps it was because he was never very particular to begin with. ""Maybe we are supposed to park by the garbage cans?"", said Lizzie as she began to squeeze the Ford into the narrow space between the utility pole and the faded pink, blue and brown garbage cans that lined the rear of the building.
Outside they could hear faint speech, cars on the highway as they made their way down the dark alley towards the door. ""Okay babe"", said Lizzie. ""You're better at this than I am."". Danny smiled, knowing she was right. He carefully entered the code on the entry handle keypad, turned the dial, and gently pressed the door. ""Dammit!"", Danny said. He tried again with as much luck. ""Jesus let me do it"", Lizzie sighed.
""To be continued..."""

Stayed with kids","Lovely place. Furniture and finishes are unique. My husband wanted to take pictures for ideas on how to do some finishing in our place. It is probably better for people without small children. However, we did stay with our grown children and small grandsons and did ok. There is currently no lock on the bathroom so no privacy if you have curious little ones. The stairs are definitely steep and a little slick. If you are more than 5 foot do not stand upright in the loft. With that said our stay was wonderful. The beds were great. The town quiet, friendly, and wonderful to walk. Judi was excellent in communicating with us. You feel like she is the friend you haven't met who invited you to stay at her place while she was out of town."

Our stay had everything we needed and we were impressed by how nice the rustic look was from the kitchen, living area, beds, and bathroom. The Loft was a fantastic place to stay, but the location was even better! Only a one minute walk to Hotel Wilber, the bowling alley, and the bars on main street, so we can't imagine how we could have made the weekend trip any better. We plan to make a return trip soon and will encourage family members to ""Czech"" this place out too!"

The cabin was very clean and stocked with everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and we rested well. Judy’s cinnamon rolls are amazing! So is Judy! You will love her. She is a very loving host who will give you all the privacy you want but is easily available to meet any needs you have. She communicates well and fast. I highly recommend booking her place. This was our fist visit to Nebraska and we were glad we came.

Be sure to approach from (Hickory Road) and avoid several miles of gravel roads. My GPS took the shortest route, but not the best. Location is only a half mile off of paved road (Hickory) and much easier access to US77.

The host’s attention to details ranges from fresh cut flowers in a vase beside a dish of delicious homemade cinnamon rolls or blueberry muffins to noticing the guests forgot to close windows on the back porch, causing her to mop rain water off the floor, before they return from an outing. (Judy, sorry again about that.)
Treats of various snacks and a gift bag of scented oil goodies await you, making your stay even more delightful.

Pros- close to town so you can run in for supper or anything needed, very clean and super cute cabin, pond is nice and we caught several fish (catch and release) owners are incredibly nice and breakfast was provided!
Cons- with their farm machinery right there it was pretty loud until evening both days, the a/c unit in the bedroom is also very loud so sleeping was hard! the dock and paddleboat were not accessible due to a recent storm so that was a bummer as we had our kid with us.
Overall it is a very cute little place to stay! you could literally just bring clothes and food and have a great weekend. Make sure to include bug spray also, we ended up with a lot of ticks on us after going around the pond to fish!!"

Stayed one night","If you want seclusion and to be able to see the stars, this is a great place to stay. Has the feel of a log cabin with all the luxuries. Enjoyed it greatly. Only problem was figuring out how to heat the cabin, and some of that was our fault. We thought the wall fixtures were for cooling only, but they also heat. Once we found that out, the cabin which was cold when we woke up, warmed up nicely. No fun taking showers in cabin at 60 degrees F. Maybe displaying a sign that says the wall units are for heating and cooling and the pellet feed stove is a secondary heating source, would have helped. But no complaints overall. Will be returning. Arrived too late to take advantage of the fire pit, but plan to next visit."

Check out was flexible as well so it gave us more time to soak in our last moments in the very secluded cabin! Will definitely book again when we come back out!

The cabin was clean & smelled just like a cabin should! The atmosphere was relaxing. We unplugged & relaxed! Once morning came, the scenery was even more stunning. So glad we got to stay, we will be back! Thanks again!!"

The cabin is adorable and well kept by the hosts, complete with a wood pellet burner and extra pellets. We had plenty of utensils to cook/eat with, heaps of clean blankets laying around and showers that didn't run out of hot water. It was a spectacular winter getaway - we got out of the driveway and road just fine, but be prepared if weather is inclement or snowy as the road into the cabin is gravel with some slight hills.
PS: Make sure to stargaze as you sit around the fire pit... it is a breathtaking sight!"

Stayed one night","We were looking for a quiet getaway for a late anniversary celebration and this was absolutely perfect. The cabin is located inside a little shelter of trees in a very quiet area. We literally heard no traffic or sounds outside of nature the entire stay. I would recommend packing slippers, the floors are a beautiful wood and not particularly cold, but I’m a bit of a baby so I’d wished I’d had slippers! 😀
The pictures truly don’t do this cabin justice. It’s a very cute space. The wood pellet stove made it very cozy. There was plenty of space should we want to return with our kids. It was very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with equipment. We felt that the space, cleanliness, and amenities made this an incredible value. We brought in all our own food since there isn’t a nearby grocery store (to our knowledge!) It would make a great space for anyone looking for a quiet getaway with their significant other, family, or friends.
Derek was very communicative and flexible and happy to answer questions. We will definitely recommend this to others and may return for future getaways!"

And a fire pit ring setup and a big open mowed yard for our kids to play. Great halfway point for us on our way back from KC vaca to our central NE home. Thanks Derek!"

Derek was great to work with, very timely with all responses, kind enough to turn the air on ahead of our arrival and even left farm fresh eggs for us in the fridge!! Great host and cabin!!"

The whole decor of the cabin is nice. Sitting outside around the fire was a nice add with sounds of nature all around. Derek left fresh eggs and home raised beef for us to use which was yummy! Can’t wait to come back for a break from our busy lives for a relaxing getaway. Thanks Derek for being a great host and accommodating us with the trailer. Look forward to our next stay!

Nice tv with good streaming options. Lots of really cozy towels in bathroom. That’s a pet peeve for us with some airbnbs. The only downsides were no USB charging stations- not a biggie, just bring your own. The second was the neighborhood. The house is next to a commercial/industrial area on one side. It was pretty quiet but not the vacation setting we expected. Still would highly recommend."

We came to Beatrice to visit my sister and the house was only four blocks from downtown making it easy to get out and about to find food, etc. The house was adorable and very clean! Mattresses were extremely comfortable and house was easy to find and get into. James and Rhonda responded quickly to my one question I had and were very helpful. There aren’t a lot of houses right their close. House is behind an industrial building of sorts and you park next to an alley. Made us feel a little exposed at times but we had zero issues. The high or across the street was… friendly lol. He was often in his garden, shirtless, and with his very large dogs. He did say hi and we had no issues with the dogs and we never heard them bark from inside the house so it wasn’t a big deal at all! Overall this space had everything we look for when renting an Airbnb and it was way better than staying in a hotel across town!"

Stayed a few nights","It was an amazing experience, I stayed a couple of times. I would have loved to stay more for
Often the hardest part being an overnight nurse is the check in and check out. Most places have a difficult time bc of cleaning before new guest. I felt really bad w/me being so tired my last stay I misunderstood my checkout time. I felt horrible. I was late checking out and did not realize bc I had work. I was thinking I was leaving the next day. I woke up with a text from Rhonda & James checking on me if everything was okay bc housekeeping notified them I was still there. Oh my gosh!! I was so embarrassed and confused! Realizing I made a mistake and misunderstood heck out and had to be at work in 30 minutes. Luckily they were very kind and understanding, I offered to pay any late fees for overstaying. I said I would be out in ten minutes. I fortunately am a very clean person and bring all my own & try to leave a place better than I found it. Loaded up sent a text I left & off to work I went❤"

Stayed one night","my experience at this RV retreat exceeded all expectations. With its warm and inviting atmosphere, attentive host, and idyllic setting, it's the perfect getaway for anyone seeking a peaceful escape.
The RV itself was a cozy haven, tastefully decorated and thoughtfully equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was comfortable, providing a restful night's sleep after a long day of travel. Despite the compact space, every amenity I could think of was available.
Judy was incredibly responsive and accommodating. She checked in with me after arrival and stocked the RV with coffee, snacks, and delicious cinnamon rolls. These little things are soooo welcomed when traveling.
I arrived late and couldn't fully explore the outdoor amenities, such as the picturesque pond, kayak, and amazing patio & grill area. It's a place I definitely would look forward to revisiting in the future.
I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to fellow travelers."

Not to mention her delicious homemade cinnamon rolls. Judy was very responsive and just a text away during our entire stay. She had great recommendations for adventuring into nearby Beatrice or for exploring the national homestead monument both a short drive away. There were plenty of activities available at the pond, including kayak, paddle boat and fishing equipment to enjoy or if you are looking for a more relaxing weekend, a lovely covered patio and fire pit right next to the water. It really was a little slice of heaven. I highly recommend taking advantage if you have the opportunity to stay here; you definitely won’t regret it!"

Best to arrive before dark and locate during daylight hours. Nicely decorated camper. 3 steps into camper, 2 steps from main floor to bathroom landing, and 1 more step up to bedroom (be mindful of the last step, as there is only 1 foot clearance at the end of the bed before the step down). Host left nice muffins and rolls for breakfast! There's a nice patio above pond, a dock on the pond, with stairs going down to dock (no hand railings on patio, stairs, or dock).

I was concerned there might be a lot of bugs but that wasn’t an issue at all. Tim was in heaven sitting on the dock catching bluegill & catfish! Judy delivered cinnamon rolls & blueberry muffins for our breakfasts & they were delicious! We explored the area & took Judy’s suggestions to check out a pottery shop in an old church, also visited the Homestead National Monument, so glad we did! We ate supper Saturday night at the “Black Crow” (We we’re glad we made reservations) it was excellent! This was our first Airbnb experience & it was perfect in every way, we will be back!!

Don’t think for a minute that it can’t be great because it’s a fixed up 5th Wheel Camper (there is also a cabin/cottage)—pass it up and it will be your loss. I’ve been staying in Lincoln on business for 3 months straight (Both in Downtown & Haymarket). There’s nothing wrong with them but when you want a break from the muffler & siren noise and the College Bar scene, look here! This was the needed respite for my soul. Judy is a tremendous host, ask about the homemade muffins. I will be back for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","We needed a little get away from the chaos of our everyday life... this was perfect! Not too far away, or over expensive. The lake and patio provided a relaxing escape and the quaint town of Beatrice provided the perfect amount of shops and entertainment.
Judy had great hospitality welcoming us with a smile delicious baked goods and suggestions for things to do amd places to eat.
Our second day she brought us homemade cinnamon rolls which melt in your mouth. The camper was cozy and felt spacious. The decor and essential oils made it feel homey and comfy.
We will be booking again in the future! :)"

Stayed a few nights",The place is super cute! The sunrise was beautiful and I enjoyed watching my church service on the dock with a nice cup of coffee. We enjoyed the outdoor patio and fireplace at night and board games were perfect to fill some time. Judy's baked goodies were delightful. She was super sweet and friendly and quick to ensure our safety during a sudden storm with very high winds. We will definitely be back for a relaxing weekend again in the future. Thank you Larry & Judy!

Stayed one night","What a relaxing experience we had at Judy's camper on the pond. Larry made a wonderful fire for us to enjoy our beautiful evening visiting on the patio enjoying frogs croaking and stars in the sky and just peace and quiet and surrounded by farmland. Judy makes All her guests homemade cinnamon rolls! ...custom ordered, with or with nuts and or raisins! She says, it is called air bnb so you should get breakfast. She has made a fabulous retreat by the pond. The camper looks as if it was decorated by Joanna Gaines, so cute! Totally enjoyed our stay and the hosts are such kind people."

Stayed with kids","This was a perfect weekend getaway for my husband and I with our 11-month old baby. The location is great for an escape from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to the small town of Beatrice for dinner/drinks/groceries.
Judy was very easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. The camper is right in their backyard, but they were very considerate of our privacy. Larry came down and started the fire for us both nights, and Judy was always nearby if we needed anything.
Despite being an old camper, it is very well maintained. Judy remodeled it last year and it is so cute! The air conditioner worked very well, and we had plenty of hot water. There was lots of storage space for our things. We felt like we had plenty of space, even with a portable crib set up in the living room area. Judy had the camper stocked with all the basic necessities for cooking and grilling (salt and pepper, oil, butter, foil, cooking untensils), and even provided s'mores fixings and a few snacks. She also baked delicious cinnamon rolls and muffins for breakfast, which she dropped of the night before to avoid waking us in the morning.
We used their propane grill one night and had no problems. The patio area is a shared space, so you will potentially have to share it with other Airbnb guests if someone is staying in the Cabin, as well. We very much enjoyed sitting out on the patio and taking the paddle boat out on the pond. We applied bug spray before going out, but never noticed any mosquitoes.
This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had, and I know Judy strives to make that true for all of her guests. We definitely recommend!"

Judy is so thoughtful, not only making sure you will have everything to make your comfortable but also going out of her way to make your time at her home special. We were lucky to be able to stay in the camper on our honeymoon and were greeted by a special note, bottle of nice wine, and chocolates. Not to mention the fresh cut flowers, snacks, supplies to make smores, and she makes the best homemade cinnamon rolls.
The camper is clean, comfortable, and well stocked with anything you may need. The patio area and pond are a little slice of heaven and I wish we could have spent more time on our trip. Hoping we will get a chance to return for many more visits to this special place where we were treated like family."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time at The Pond! Peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, and very comfortable. Judy went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and she even helped me get in touch with a babysitter so my husband and I could have a date night out. The breakfast cinnamon rolls and banana nut muffins were delicious, and we were able to easily cook our meals in the camper and also on the gas grill on the patio. The camper felt very spacious to me, although a very tall person might feel cramped. I caught several little bluegill and three nice catfish over our stay. Our 14 month old daughter loved the swing set outside and it was nice that the drawers are child-resistant, so she could walk around in the camper without too much worry about what she could get into. But be sure to latch the door properly!! She took a tumble out the door (100% my mistake) but thankfully it was a fairly soft landing and she was not hurt. All in all a fantastic value and we would definitely like to come back sometime."

The patio is so peaceful and the morning view of the sunrise is worth waking for. If you have time take a stroll all the way around the pond. You might be pleasantly surprised by deer.
Campers have quirks so listen to what Judy has to say when you get there and you will enjoy your stay. We weren’t able to get the stove lit so if you want to use it be sure to ask about it ahead of time. We had other things to eat so we just didn’t pursue Judy about it."

The space is immaculate and cozy to say the least. Do not worry about the small stuff, Judy has already thought of it. All. Of. It.! Fresh baked cinnamon roles, dishes, toiletries, trash bags, tin foil, baggies, games to play, radio, welcome note, book to share your memories with her, lighted pathway, all the makings for s’mores , fresh cut flowers, and the list goes o & on. I don’t want to spoil it for you. Think of it as you are going to YOUR other home....amazing!! That’s just the beginning... Prepare yourself to be lulled by Mother Nature’s concertos in stereo at dusk. You will have access to front rows seats as you sit back and watch the dancers perform on the water. While the stars and fireflies steal the show; indescribable. Don’t just take my word for it, experience it for yourself! You won’t want to leave!!!
P.S. Thank you Judy & Larry for an absolutely amazing and relaxing experience at The Pond."

The inside was more spacious than I had expected. Plenty of space for the two of us, we never felt cramped I there. The view of the pond over looking endless rolling hills at night was so beautiful, especially since there were so many fireflies beyond the pond it looked like glitter was erupting from the fields for hours. This is just the perfect cozy quiet and peaceful place to have a great time. We also caught TONS of fish in their stocked pond. Judy also recommended plenty of local restaurants and events in town for us to check out as well. She is an amazing host and her cinnamon rolls are delicious! Staying for just one night did not seem like enough, we will definitely be back!!"

She was incredibly hospitable, and seems to have thought of everything a guest might require, including cookware, additional blankets, toiletries, and even items for making s’mores in their patio fireplace. The pond was lovely, and my wife and I enjoyed a trip on the water in their paddle boat, and spent some time lounging in the water-side patio. In addition to the cozy bed and incredible hospitality, Judy took the time to make fresh cinnamon buns, which were enjoyed as a nighttime snack, and as a morning meal. Truly a fantastic location and exceptional host."

We were offered a parking spot in their shop when there was a possibility of hail as well as entrance into their home if the storm got out of control. Thankfully it wasn’t anything major, and we were able to enjoy our stay. I would highly recommend a stay at the pond to anyone looking to unplug. We hope to return!"

Judy and her husband are warm hosts and there are lovely touches including an outdoor sitting area and baked goods. It’s close to town and interesting historic sites. Five stars without a doubt!"
