Stayed about a week","The atmosphere is sensational.
Much care and zeal on the part of Gabriella.
He left personal hygiene kits, water, soda, many towels. The apartment is hyper equipped.
This season that I did in the US, it was the best we got.
I hope to return again and again.
Parabens, Gabriella"

Stayed over a week","I selected Gabriella place because I needed my privacy and it was exactly what I was looking for. Check in was so simple and the place very clean and beautiful with all the necessities.
The staircase was a kind of a blessing to me as I‘ve not been able to exercise my body for a long time and I enjoyed going up down the stairs. I had a chance of meeting Gabriella hubby and he was search a lovely person. The biggest Walmart was 5mins drive,Burlington coat less than 15mins for those who would like to shop around.I will definitely visit again. Thank you Gabriella for hosting me.May God richly bless you and your family."

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful weekend retreat! The apt was immaculate, and the bathroom seemed recently updated. The living room featured a 75in TV, perfect for unwinding. Mary paid close attention to the details of her space and it showed.
Only a few things kept my rating from being 5 stars. When I booked here, I had no idea how busy of an area it is, directly off of rt 9 and essentially in a shopping plaza. I appreciated some of the convenience, but would have preferred to have a clearer sense of the area, as it isn't represented in the listing or photos, and was less private than I expected.
Also, I tried to take a bath, and the push drain stopper would not entirely close and I ran out of hot water while filling the tub, making the 5min in the tub, less than relaxing. The furniture was quite dated and the bed was not very comfortable on my recently injured back.
Mary was kind enough to extend my checkout time, and if I could have stayed another day, I would have! Definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","It was an overall good experience, although it was difficult to adjust the thermostat because it seems to stay locked. This is on route nine which is a very busy main street that runs from Boston in way past Worcester so if you’re looking for a quiet and peaceful, it’s not exactly that with the traffic but if you’re looking for a place you can step outside and walk to 75 shops and restaurants within five minutes that are all lined up right there then this is your spot, Mary was very responsive. We had some problems getting in the door upon arrival with the lock unit not working properly but other than that everything seem to go fine. Mary is very responsive, polite, friendly, and I needed a late check out because I got stuck on something and she was accommodating, which I appreciated"

Stayed a few nights","The location was perfect for our needs, but it's definitely on a busy and very bright road/shopping center. The blinds don't block ambient light, so bring an eye-mask if you need darkness to sleep! We had a very short stay so didn't use the kitchen at all. There weren't any food staples provided (condiments, oil, etc), but a Trader Joe's is right in the plaza if staying longer and interested in cooking. Laundry detergent and a nice big washer/dryer were excellent!
The host is super responsive. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment proved very good base to take day trips from. It is roomy, clean, bright and comfortable. The weather was very warm during the visit and the a/c worked extremely well. The location very much in the middle of a commercial strip which is convenient (walking distance) to some chain stores/restaurants, but also means there is loud traffic directly out front through all but several hours of the night. A very nice park/beach is along a nearby lake, also within walking distance. Communication was excellent, and the apartment well appointed. I’d recommend it, so long as the location along a busy street would be acceptable to you."

Stayed a few nights","Mary and her husband were very rude and hostile hosts. I’ve already reported their behaviour to AirBnb. They called us “stupid,” told us to “shut-up,” and the man came way too close to my mom and was pointing fingers in her face as an intimidation tactic. She had to tell him to back off and not come any closer. All this happened because they felt we hadn’t left the place clean enough and were “trespassing” when we came to collect the phone charger that we had forgotten at the apartment within 1 hour of check out. First off, their sink garbage disposal wasn’t working from day 1. I wrote to Mary to let her know, and she said that they would get it fixed after our checkout. We had to dig our hands into the sink to ensure that the water went down (even then, not all of it would), but we still didn’t want to make a big deal about it and just enjoy our stay. Apart from the sink and the dishes that we couldn’t wash because the sink was BLOCKED, we left the place clean. Mind you, it is not the guests responsibility to clean the place before leaving. We paid an $88 service fee for a reason. Still, we were courteous - we made sure to not leave any garbage lying around and even folded the bedding so it would be easier on them to change it. When Mary’s husband told us that we left the place “a mess,” we asked “what mess,” to which he responded “you moved the furniture.” They had a coffee table in the living room which we shifted to make some more space, and that’s all. We didn’t shift it back upon checkout, however, that didn’t deserve such a volatile reaction. The sink situation was totally out of our control - it’s not our responsibility to fix that and the consequences of a broken garbage disposal system is unfortunately a dirty sink and dirty dishes. When we came to get our phone charger we were met with incredible hostility. The man told us that we couldn’t go up for a minute to get our charger and that we had to leave the property immediately or he’ll call the cops (?). He was trying to be intimidating but failed to scare us. I told Mary that we can just talk politely to which she responded “I don’t want to talk to you” and then called me “stupid.” We refused to be bullied like this and insisted that we go pick up our belonging and they are free to follow us. Mary’s husband told her to “watch” me while my mom and him went upstairs. I felt like some sort of criminal who needed to be “watched” which was so humiliating. Ultimately he didn’t allow my mom to go upstairs, but was fine with my uncle (who had come to take us to the airport) to go up with him instead. I’m not sure why they treated us that way when we approached them politely in the first place . We are 110% sure that the charger was left in a socket in the living room. I’m certain that our charger was taken because of some sort of grudge. Overall, we had a terrible experience here. We paid almost $800CAD to this couple, including an $88 service fee, to be treated so poorly. The location of this place is decent, but the hosts don’t know how to behave and because of that this place is not worth it."

The space is impersonal, so doesn’t feel super homey, and it does sit on top of a business, on a main road, in a strip mall. Convenient for Trader Joe’s or Chipotle, but a bit odd for me. Lots of road noise and brightness for light sleepers."

The apartment is also in walking distance to a bunch of other shops and a cool memorial bride (definitely worth checking out at night). As the other reviews said you're right off of the turnpike but noise wasn't really much of an issue during our stay. Overall it was a great price and location for what we needed, it was pretty clean and I'd probably stay again."

As others have said, it's right next to a busy road with lots of businesses all around. This was convenient, though, because we could walk to get food at Whole Foods or Trader Joes. I was helping my daughter move into Clark University, so the place was convenient. There are few amenities, so if you plan to cook you'll need to bring all the spices and oil, etc. The place was clean, roomy, and Mary was quite responsive to inquiries."

Stores as Trader Joe’s or Whole food at walking distance as well as diner or other places for hanging out.

She was friendly, as was her husband. Irene showed me my room and my bathroom. She provided me with a key to come and go. We chatted for a few minutes before I went upstairs to get situated before I left to meet up with friends. I returned around 10p, used my key to get in. Irene was in the kitchen, she greeted me warmly, I thanked her and went to my room. The bed was wonderful. Very firm and comfy. I woke up the next day, packed my belongings and headed downstairs. I spoke with John, thanked him for the hospitality and asked if I could leave my car in the driveway while I went for a morning walk. He was fine with that. I returned the key, thanked them and headed out. My main thing is feeling safe and I absolutely did! Nothing questionable about the neighborhood or my interactions with the homeowners! Great people, highly recommend!"

She had just about everything you could want in the kitchen to make meals, as well as extra towels, blankets, and pillows. I enjoyed the nature decor throughout and her laid back style. Lots of pretty plants added more coziness to the space. We always found parking outside in front of the apartment, and check-out instructions were very straightforward."

Stayed a few nights","Sarah is a lovely person. The home was really cozy for the two of us. Relaxing and comfy. Nice kitchen to cook and hang out in. Living room and bedroom were comfortable. She's done a nice job with things you wouldn't necessarily think of...like a mirror in the bathroom that tilts...it matters; it makes a difference. The vibe and aesthetic of design is consistent throughout which also helps you relax into it. It's not a jumbled/random design. Simple pleasures too, right?....like a brita water filter in the fridge. Checkout procedure was completely reasonable. We're fans...we'll certainly be back. If your visit to Worcester is WPI related, maybe for Homecoming or Parents Weekend or scouting out the college, this was a great spot. EASY to get to the school plus a nice grocery store along the way (plus a treat of a coffee shop if Sarah will share it with you). We'll stay here again."

And honestly, I have to say that this apartment has been the most peaceful and relaxing place I’ve stayed throughout all of those trips. I’m new to the Air BnB process, but have to say that this experience was much more enjoyable than the hotels downtown or a friend’s spare bedroom. This home is the prefect getaway after a long day of driving around and visiting with people. I was able to read, write and recharge before the next day of visiting.
The next time I’m in Worcester I’ll definitely want to stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","Stay at this gem of a place with a helpful, responsive host. The place is as serene and comfortable as the pictures. The bathroom and kitchen were immaculate with what you need for your stay. The linens and towels are new, clean, comfortable, and plentiful.
I initially hesitated to book the unit as it is her home when she is not traveling but the bedroom seems to be the guest room with an empty closet and bureau. Soon after entering, I completely forgot it was someone's home. The furnishings and decor are welcoming and surpass those I have encountered other stays. And there were beautiful plants everywhere. I felt like I was at home.
I crossed paths with Sarah and she is a motivated, disciplined and considerate person. she is pursuing a music career after slaving away in the corporate world. So, step up and support her ambitions by renting this wonderful spot. Despite how many houses there are on this street, I always found a space to park, within 2 car lengths of the home."

Union Station is close by for taking the train into Boston for a day trip. Sarah’s home is very clean and relaxing. Everything was as pictured in the listing. I’ve been in a few 5 star-rated places recently that were not clean and needed new pillows, etc., however, Sarah’s home is truly deserving of 5 stars!

Your space was lovely, eclectic and matched my choice of styles, completely. I could have not been more pleased.

Mom needed the electric blanket and that was also an extra for her!

The “extras” are a delight, from flavored coffee syrups to travel-size toiletries, toys for all ages, snacks and seasonings, extra pillows, comfy sheets, duvets and fun movie-night-in treats. The kitchen is supplied to help you cook a meal, and the home is beautifully maintained. We couldn’t have asked for a more ideal spot for our family to celebrate Commencement and be together. Thank you!"

Group trip",This house is very nice. Perfect for our family. It has been newly updated throughout. Very nice kitchen and bathrooms. Pretty neighborhood. Nice neighbors. Only 2 small downsides that kept me from giving 5 stars: (1) the smell of curry in the house was very strong and windows do not open so could not air out the house. (2) the house is not level. So furniture in the house is not level and sleeping in a sloping bed was interesting! But you did a wonderful job with the remodel. Very relaxing feel. All the amenities were such a nice added touch.

Group trip","A few words will not do this place justice….
I was absolutely blown away by how amazing this place was. Warm and cosy to start and super clean. They left slippers at the front door for us which was so lovely and then on looking around they had left travel size tooth paste, face wipes, hair bands, toothbrushes and floss in the bathroom which I as a person who wears make up and has long hair was a brilliant touch.
The beds were super comfy - desperate to know where those pillows are from!
The air bnb has a book with everything you need to know which was brilliant and super helpful. Lou rocs diner is the bomb! If you stay here defo visit as the breakfasts were AMAZING.
There was 6 of us staying here and we all loved it and had such comfy stays.
The pantry was stocked, I had some Oreo’s at 4am due to the jet lag and their English tea was amazing.
All in all when we come back we will stay here again.
Thank you so so much!"

The kitchen is fully stocked as well as the amazing pantry stocked with little snacks, cleaning products etc. Oh, and the bathroom even has little toiletries in case someone forgot theirs. The attention to detail was very apparent here! Bayram and Patrycja were extremely responsive and made our stay even better.

Also all the little personal touches from candy on the table to a fully stocked pantry with food and snacks for us and the kids to enjoy. The house was also fully equipped with anything you needed from tooth brushes to hair ties and everything in between. You literally just had to bring yourself and your clothes. Everything was clean and spotless and I’m the pickiest person when it comes to that so it shows how much attention to detail they give this home. We stood for an event but we plan on staying again in the summer time just because we loved it so much. We’re looking forward to it."

If I’m ever back in Worcester with a big group, I’m definitely staying here!"

We were staying overnight and attending a concert - the Uber ride to downtown was just a short 7 min drive away. We enjoyed making dinner (the kitchen is well-stocked with utensils and pots and pans), dining at the table, relaxing in one of the living rooms, and sleeping in the super comfy beds! The bathroom was surprisingly well-stocked as well, with toothbrushes, toothpaste, hair ties, and products! We couldn’t have asked for anything more!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful listing in a convenient location - five min from Clark university and less then five to the canal district and all the wonderful restaurants and theater/arts venues. Despite it’s proximity to the city center, it was in a very safe and pretty residential area. The owners were responsive and helpful from the get-go and remained so throughout our stay. We arrived and were happy to find a private driveway (a first for our airbnb stays in Worcester) and what looked like a very well maintained single family home. We got the real wow when we opened the door. Super comfy and clean, nicely decorated and with numerous touches throughout to make you feel at home. There are two TVs, lots of DVD movies, a foosball table, board games and cards, lots of snacks, beverages and candy in the pantry, all the coffee and accompaniments, and even extra toothbrushes, toothpaste and hair ties for those who may have forgotten to pack them. I can’t say enough. We were delighted. Will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Spacious and very clean. Felt as if it was our own home for a few days. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. keypad entry easy: Hoping password changes for each new guest. Home has no air conditioning, but also has no screens in windows. this is also a safety issue, since you have to open the windows to get air. there were no window treatments on the first floor which left you exposed to everyone outside and homes were close together. Appeared to be a safe area. The mattresses in 4 bedrooms were 6 inch
spring mattresses on all beds which were uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. With a few changes, the rating would be higher."

Moreover, we felt safe throughout our stay. The host has clearly ensured security measures are in place which provided us peace of mind during our visit.

The neighboring building also had lights on all night that shined into my bedroom even with the blinds down. Obviously this can't be controlled, but thought it was worth mentioning. Danielle was excellent host though - responded to my needs quickly and kindly and allowed me to park in her driveway to keep my work truck safe."

Stayed with a pet","Very spacious and comfortable guest house, in a lovely quiet neighborhood. The living room is a large sunny space where we enjoyed setting up our laptops and taking advantage of the high speed internet for work. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space for our belongings. The unit was very clean and the bathroom recently renovated. The yard is large, although not fully fenced for dogs. We really enjoyed walking around the beautiful neighborhood. Our host, Steve, and co-host, Pat, were very communicative.
I gave it five stars as the price reflects the age of the property, but it’s an antique. The kitchen could use updating. You won’t mind if you are eating out a lot, but it’s not ideal for cooking. That said, it was well equipped.
The down pillows and comforters add a touch if luxury, but be aware there are no alternatives to down if you have allergies.
All in all, we enjoyed our 11 day stay, and will definitely return."

The carriage House was very comfortable and accommodating for a long term stay. Steve made us feel very welcome and was very pleasant to talk to and helpful with suggestions about things to do in the Worcester area. The flowers around the property were beautiful and Steve encouraged us to cut some to put inside the house. We would highly recommend this peaceful retreat and would come back again !

Cottage is close to everything, and in a beautiful old Worcester neighborhood surrounded by nature shade trees and gardens. A must stay!"

The kitchen was well equipped, the bed comfortable, the surroundings delightful, and the hosts helpful but not obtrusive. We can definitely recommend the place."

Stayed over a week","Really cute and charming cottage with a fantastic location -- we stayed here for two weeks and the surrounding neighborhood is delightful and very walkable, which was a huge plus. The kitchen is fairly well stocked so you can do basic cooking and there's a washer/dryer which is fantastic for the longer stay. As noted in the listing, there's no AC, but the cottage is actually quite shaded so stays fairly cool and there are lots of windows and doors to open (and really beautiful gardens!). There is a path right in front of the cottage that all visitors/guests/workers at the main home use and there is a fair amount of coming and going, so that's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a private space, particularly in summer when you might have windows and drapes open during both the day and evening. Steve is really kind and friendly, and we loved seeing him around."

Stayed over a week","I spent two months in Steve's cottage when I first moved to Worcester and can highly recommend it for a long or short stay. The cottage is much roomier than you'd expect based on pictures-- a full three rooms (kitchen, bedroom, living area), plus a large bathroom. Sunny and simply but comfortably furnished. Fast wifi-- I worked from home about 50% of the time while I was there with no problem on many Zoom sessions. Neighborhood is safe and walkable. There's a CVS, Shaws (grocery store), several gyms, and many other stores within a 10 min walk. Also walking distance to WPI and a short commute by car to downtown Worcester, WSU, and many hiking trails on the outskirts of town. It was a great place to land while I got to know the area and I'd gladly stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","Steve's place was H U G E--bigger than I expected. It was a cute place in Worcester. We rode our motorcycles and stayed two nights. The second day our weather radars were calling for several severe storms passing through the majority of Massachusetts and we asked Steve if we could park our bikes in the garage to keep them from any high winds/heavy rain that might be coming. It was no problem and we were able to store our motorcycles in the garage during the storms. We had time to explore Worcester and even took the commuter rail into Boston. The box fan helped cool the room off when it got too warm, but a portable A/C unit may have been better (we tend to like it a bit colder, but it was very manageable). We had a great time and we will definitely consider staying here again if we find ourselves in the Worcester, MA area again!"

She is friendly, funny, and give you all the space will need. Very conversational and helpful.
If I were ever in the area again, or need a long-term rental situation - I will definitely stay with her.
Thanks for being awesome !!!"

Erika has the most well behaved friendliest puppies also. the only thing to watch out is you probably need a car to get around in this area but parking was not an issue in my experience. If you are like me who loves animals and a peaceful place, you will enjoy your stay and have no trouble working from home during your stay."

The accommodation is spotlessly clean and located in a very quiet neighbourhood next to some beautiful walking tracks through woodlands. In the house, Erika has thought of everything in order to make the use of the property and its facilities effortless. There were fresh eggs and home baked banana bread every morning. I will definitely seek this property out again for my next visit to Worcester. Thank you Erika!"

The decor of the house is charming and whimsical, and very appealing to me. But by far the most enjoyable aspect of my stay was interacting with Erika herself. She is very friendly and welcoming, prompt in her responses whenever I asked questions on the Airbnb app, and is such an interesting person to talk with. She even made breakfast for me and another guest while I was there, including a delicious home-baked loaf of bread. I hope I will get an opportunity to visit Erika’s home again, and I wholeheartedly recommend her place for any traveler looking for a place to stay in the Worcester area."

There are a lot of stairs leading up to the house, and in the house itself. They are sturdy and well maintained, but some turn 90° corners without a landing.

The shared bathroom was nicely labeled to separate your things from others as well as items that were available in case you forgot something.
I enjoyed some nice tea in the evening when I arrived. I absolutely loved listening to nature as I read in the living room.
The room had an AC unit which I did not use as I felt the temperature was perfect upstairs. There is also a half bath close to the bedroom. I will definitely stay here again when I return to the area.

Stayed over a week","The house was spotless clean, my room was just right for one person, very comfortable mattrass and thick comforter excellent. Many lamps and an overhead light! Unheard of in American households. There was a substantial desk and chair, one could work there comfortably. Heating was necessary in the room because it was still the end of April. I think that the ground floor could have been a bit warmer but it is very hard to keep warm a large area (kitchen, dining and living room). It is matter of habit. Everyone in the house (only three people in three rooms) had a lot of space in kitchen cabinets as well as the fridge. The house is nicely decorated. Erika is a great host, does not hover but she is very pleasant to talk to. The only downside -- and that is not her fault -- are the potholes in the street. Don´t try to enter it with a sports car (as my friend would have done if I had not warned him emphatically) :-)"

The house itself is very cozy. The kitchen is absolutely beautiful and the shower felt great. It just rains buckets of water on you in this nice claw foot tub. I wish I could take the shower with me. The mattress was extremely comfortable and the sheets were so soft. There was plenty of space to put all our belongings for the duration of our stay - dresser, two night stands with shelves, hooks.
We felt free to come and go as we needed to. Erika and her roommate were very friendly and accommodating. Don't hesitate to ask for suggestions for places to eat or anything you might need! There were two sweet dogs (Elliot and Gracie) and a loving cat (Monty). They didn't make any noise and were just as friendly as the people. The house was VERY clean and always smelled great (I specifically remember the Christmas tree smell from the candle).
We both agreed we would stay there again in a heartbeat if we spent time in Worcester again. Much better than a hotel room and the price was very affordable."

I loved the the old school New York and vintage Italian poster art decor. Very nice. Would definitely recommend. James is very responsive and does whatever he can to ensure a positive experience."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to stay during my son’s graduation from WPI! The room was cute and well-appointed, with some really nice touches like bathroom cubbies and snacks. The bed was comfortable, and the room even included a mini-fridge. On commencement day it was only a 15-minute walk to campus, through a very pleasant neighborhood. If I ever return to Worcester, this is where I’ll stay!"

Stayed over a week","James is easily the best host I've ever had on AirBNB. He's always very responsive to any issues that would come up, and was quick to correct them.
I always felt right at home in his place. The bathroom was professionally cleaned frequently, and was always squeaky clean. The place was accurately represented in the listing.
The historic house sat on the corner of Elm Park, which is great to walk through. If you attend WPI or any of the other nearby universities, you'll have a wonderful commute to class through Elm Park.
Another interesting feature that I've never seen elsewhere is the snacks that James has for sale at a reasonable price. This is a godsend when you're too lazy to go to the store, which I often was.
Parking in the area is easy. I've never had any issue finding a spot on the street. It's not too crowded, unlike some busier parts of Worcester.
I've been staying with James for several years, and I never encountered any crime in the area."

Stayed about a week","This was an excellent Airbnb stay. The first thing that I noticed was the great decoration of the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. A lot of Worcester memorabilia and just a really good feel.
The cost was much lower than similar stays in this area. The place was very clean and fully set up for both business and vacation travel. Elm Park was directly across the street and was a great place for unwinding at the end of the day. The house was very close to several universities and there were numerous places to eat within a 10 minute walk.
I will definitely come back to James' place again, and would recommend it to anyone.
Thank you for the stay, and I will see you in the spring."

Stayed a few nights","An apt. with a boho vibe & 3 BnB rooms. James was very friendly & accommodating. He has 2 adorable dogs who DON'T BARK! I barely knew they were there. If you have severe animal allergies it might be an issue but I didn't notice anything. The common rooms: kitchen, bathroom (shared), and living room (under renovation) were cold but the bedroom was toasty warm. The 3rd floor location could be problematic for people with mobility issues as the stairs are narrow and a bit rickety in places.
Great location across from 1 of the oldest public parks in the US. (listed in the National Register of Historic Places.) In the winter people go skating. In warmer weather playground & picnic areas are popular. A very good supermarket is 2 blocks away. Both the WPI campus and the Art Museum are within walking distance (@ 20 min). Nearby on Park are nice restaurants, on Highland my favorite cafe/bakery, 2 local pizza places & other eateries. Good choice for long or short term stays."

2.) The Apple TV remote had no batteries leaving us unable to use the TV.
3.) The window had no screen in it
Overall if it wasn't for the above, this was exactly what we were looking for. James did reach out and apologized when he noticed the issue with the broken bed upon him going to clean the unit."

Stayed one night","This place may be the single most thoughtfully put together airbnb I have ever stayed in. James very clearly put his time into ensuring that his guests would have every convenience possible in his cozy apartment. From smart placed plugs, USB connectors, warm lighting, welcoming plants, cubbies in the bathroom for each room, to toiletries dispensers in the shower. To top it all, he set up a super convenient self-serve ""snack bar"" in the kitchen where you can get small snacks and cold water and simply venmo him your total which was life saving after a very long day out and about!
The whole space is stylish and filled with love. From plants to cute dogs. Communication was always great. The location was incredible as well! Located right on a fantastic park packed interesting art and a nice walk to the downtown area. Free parking in the driveway and the street. Great price as well!
On future trips to Worcester, we can't imagine staying anywhere else!"

He took care of the tidiness and cleanliness of the apartment very carefully and frequently, and did so very politely even when the guests can be messy. His kitchen is particularly notable since he has a great collection of not only utensils and cooking utilities, but also decorative pictures that make you feel like being in an Italian gourmet restaurant. The house is close to Price Chopper supermarket if you want to buy your own food, and also close to a variety of restaurants on Park Avenue if you want to eat out. I definitely recommend James’ place for your stay in Worcester."

Stayed a few nights","James' place is a victorian curio cabinet of oddities. It was fun to browse the decor around the place--good taste, for sure! The location is GREAT, close to everything, really, and right across from a beautiful park. We stayed on the fourth of July, and I watched fireworks from the third story window. The room was super duper clean. My only complaints are that the room was ten or more degrees hotter than the rest of the house, even with a fan, so be aware of that on super hot days. We stayed during the heat wave and it was miserably hot. Also, the bed is not comfortable in the room we were in. Both my bf and I had sore backs the next day. Overall, though, it was nice. I'd definitely stay here again on a day with cooler weather!!"

It is a safe & sound neighborhood near to all- yet quiet, as well as laundry in-house. James was a great host, personable, attentive & accomodating-always asking if we needed anything, ..a pure gentleman with a heart of gold. We had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying at this one of a kind Oasis,...a true ""home a away from home!"""

It was so fun to find her place which is basically on the 17th hole of the course! He celebrated his 40th birthday with a few friends at the air bnb, playing at 3 different disc golf courses nearby and it was absolutely perfect for them. They loved the privacy and proximity to Maple Hill and 2 other beautiful disc golf courses. Jessica was a wonderful host - she was super responsive before and during, very easy to coordinate checking in, provided recommendations for local restaurants and went out of her way to ensure they were comfortable. My partner and his friends had a wonderful week and have already talked about making it a yearly tradition to come back to Jessica's place to enjoy the incredible disc golfing in this area!"

Group trip","Our group had a great time at Jessica’s. Amenities were as described and the outdoor area was even nicer. Plenty of parking, even for a pick up truck. Great response time on any questions we had. The location was perfect for our trip and the disc golf we wanted to play. I plan on booking all my trips to the area at Jessica’s. Thank you for the opportunities to enjoy your beautiful home!"

Stayed with kids","This was a tremendously happy and positive exeprience. We have two little kids, 4 and 1, and they loved the property. The hosts are quite possibly the nicest individuals have experienced with short term rentals. Everything from the appropriate kid toys in the apartment to the cleanliness. They showed our kids the chickens ( which we named cupcake and taco) and talkd all the wonderful gardening and history of the property.
The beds were very comfortavle. Soft linens and plenty of pillows.
I hope we have a reason to come back one day!"

The property is so beautiful and quiet with lots of birds and wildlife, and the space itself is adorable! There were many thoughtful details and special touches. Beautiful hikes and Worcester are just minutes away. The bed was incredibly comfortable! Jessica was so accommodating and responsive, everything about it was easy! I'm really grateful to have stayed there. I hope to return in the warmer months to see the garden and trees in full bloom!"

Stayed with kids","Jessica welcomed us right when we arrived. She was friendly and showed us the apartment which was just as described. It is an older home and she decorated it as such which I loved.
It was nice for everyone to have their own bedroom. Two bathrooms are always a must for us.
I noticed right away how clean it was. We have stayed in homes that have not been cleaned well, so I was very happy.
My son and I went on a nature walk on the property. We saw a little waterfall in the yard and said hello to the hens. We hiked through the woods in the back where we saw a beautiful pond.
Jessica was super responsive and even sent me a message to be careful one night because it was icy and she noticed we weren’t back yet. I thought that was very kind and thoughtful. She also lent us some sugar when we ran out. 😉
We all enjoyed our time at Barred Owl very much and have saved it as a favorite. It was quiet and in a prime location for our travels."

Stayed a few nights","The room is clean and beautiful, with complete kitchen facilities. It is equipped with coffee, tea and snacks. The heating in the room was sufficient, but it blew directly towards the bed at night, making people feel hot and dry when sleeping. The building is charming, nestled in the Latin American community and within walking distance of the art museum.
Check-in Experience: The check-in instructions provided the apartment door code, but not the room door code. Jonathan was gracious, polite, and promptly provided the necessary information after a quick phone call. A hairdryer was missing initially, but Jonathan swiftly rectified the oversight upon notification, for which we were appreciative. Upon check-out, Jonathan seemed to have lost an electronic key and consulted me, which left me a bit puzzle. I hope that the monitor can help him solve such problem. Nonetheless, overall, it was a relatively pleasant stay."

The self check-out instructions were simple and straightforward (no lengthy list of chores!), which I appreciated. Since I had originally been looking for a hotel room, I really liked the relative anonymity of this process. Jonathan was responsive by text, but otherwise gave me my privacy. I had a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The place is well located and has everything you need but the hygiene in the accommodation is precarious. Apparently the person who does the cleaning does not do their job well and is not being supervised.
The first day when I arrived, the sheets were not clean, I had to ask the host to change them, the walls were spotted, you could see hand marks and other dirt stains.
There was a bad smell in general but especially in the kitchen, apparently the electric oven was dirty from long ago and the leftover food was smelling bad, in addition to the zafacon that is in the same kitchen was more than half full of trash of several days.
The heating above all at night makes noise, sounds like hammer bumps inside the radiator, apparently needs maintenance because it looks like a very old system.
Overall I didn't have a choice, I had a busy schedule during my stay in the village so I could tolerate the conditions but wouldn't stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay at Joseph's place. It's a great deal and his place was very clean, quiet, secure and comfortable. Check in was extremely easy and Joseph was very responsive to all of my inquiries. I was only in for a couple of days for a wedding and it was very convenient. I didn't have a car, so I took a 7 minute Uber from the train station. The train was an hour and a half from Boston Logan about $27 on weekdays and only $10 on weekends. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a hassle, so if you are exploring the town, shared ride is the way to go as everything is nearby and pretty easy to get to. If you have mobility issues, this may not be a good choice for you as there are stairs and they can get a little narrow carrying up and luggage. If you are on a budget and want a clean and secure place to stay I would definitely recommend Joseph's place 🙂 Happy and safe travels, fellow adventurers!"

The place is situated on a fairly busy street by an intersection so you will have to contend with some noise but the A/C helped drowned it out and I came prepared with lemon balm extract (natural sleep aid). Might play it safe and bring ear plugs next time though, but maybe that’s overkill. Depends how heavy of a sleeper you are.
Room was spotless, never even seen the other people staying in the other rooms although I could hear them come in and out. Host left a towel and a bottle of water for me, which I was grateful for, great lifesaver to help my hangover the next morning."

The desk was nice to work from during the day and the location is close to some beautiful parks, as well as restaurants. I had a small work emergency and had to cover part of a coworkers shift on check out day, and Joseph was gracious enough to let me work out of the common space for a few hours past check out time. Thank you for a lovely stay."

The light don’t work in refrigerator, an he was mad i Improvise by using a one single burner… then tried to accuse me of cooking in my room which is dangerous then tried to blame me for electric issues in which, I took a shower in the dark multiple times operating off of the light shining through the window.. Also for some reason he thought insulting BLM would get under my skin… when I offer to fix the stove which is only $50 an then he tried to charge $20 extra on side for guest limited to 2hrs max ..Never again …"

Stayed a few nights","The description simply said cozy room with shared bathroom. From my perspective, it is a room in a shared co-ed apartment and cozy is a euphemism for small. There was barely enough space to unpack my luggage and store it. There was no mention of the fact that it is a second floor walk-up with a steep, narrow staircase.
I have sleep apnia and need a CPAP machine to sleep at night. It was necessary to place the machine on the bed next to me at night as there was no stand or other place for me to put it. I also had to go out and buy an extension cord in order to reach the only wall plug, which was located on the opposite side of the room.
Finally, there was no mention of the parking situation until after I was checked in. There is no off street parking, and no parking on the street in front of the building. Parking is only allowed on one side of the adjacent streets. It was necessary for me to park about a block and a half away and walk back and forth in one of the coldest weekends of the year. People need to be advised of these things before they commit to rental."

I don’t appreciate how he did not try to help the situation or even send a sincere apology. That is very unprofessional I told him how I felt about the room and how I felt as if it was very unclean and he have not asked how he could make it better. I also tried to request my money for the day i did not stay there and it was declined. Also be careful because it is likely that the pictures probably wont look like the actual room."

The house did not have potable water to drink, I communicated with the host and he asked me to drink the water from the kitchen tap because he said it had a filter, only the water had a dark hue. Overall the house is expected, but there are many things to improve overall."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Joseph’s place was good overall. The place was sparkling clean at all times and Joseph and his dad are great hosts. Checking in was very easy and there’s the option to keep luggage after checking out, which was very helpful. On the other hand, there are a couple of things that other travellers should keep in mind before booking a room at Joseph’s. The house is located on a street that’s quite noisy. I heard sirens and other loud noises almost every evening. In addition, the Wi-Fi connection was not good and I had to contact Joseph often so I could get internet access. Joseph eventually gave me access to a more steady network. Also, my room initially did not have AC, but Joseph’s dad installed an AC unit a few days into my stay. Lastly, be aware that there’s a religious service on the first floor on Sundays, so one might hear gospel music upstairs, which I didn’t mind, but I know other guests did."
