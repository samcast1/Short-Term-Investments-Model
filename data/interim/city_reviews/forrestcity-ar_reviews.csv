Stayed with a pet","Nicholas's place was such a great place for our family. We were driving through and his house comfortably accommodated our family of 5 and small dog. The town is small and we were arriving late so we didn't see any open stores or restaurants. however, his place has water and other snacks that saved us from whiny, hungry children! This will be our go to place if we pass through again."

Stayed one night",Sarah was a great host. My husband was stranded and I found Sarahs cabin. She was quick to respond and very accommodating. My husband was exhausted so we asked for an early check in and Sarah was very accommodating. She responded immediately and we couldn't have asked for a better host. The home/cabin was very clean and my husband said the bed was the best and most comfortable he'd ever slept on. He loved it so much he said he was going to take me for a weekend getaway. He also had a 40 foot trailer that Sarahs place was able to accommodate for parking. We will definately stay here again. Sarah is the best. Thank you for entrusting us with your home.

The property was very clean and nicely laid out. The area can be walked and the neighbors we met were friendly.
The unit is advertised as a tiny home and that’s what it is. The pictures are very descriptive. Sarah was very helpful and responsive to all questions. This is the second time we’ve stayed here and would consider again if we traveled through here in the future. Thanks!"

Stayed with a pet","Worked out really well for us. Just a few minutes off of I40. We’re traveling and we’re looking for something just like this to take a break. The place was clean and cozy.
We were able to walk our pups on the property (no fence) with no problems. We met a few others staying there and all were very friendly. Food places within a few minutes drive.
There’s mention of highway noise but after driving for 8 hours, I really didn’t notice much or didn’t care.
Our truck was parked next to the cabin which made moving our bags inside fast and easy.
The cabin and property is simple and basic which is great for a restful, convenient night for travelers. We’ll be staying here again on our return trip. Glad we found this. Thanks!"

Stayed with a pet","Nice spot for solo or coupled travelers, not far from necessities such as groceries and gas. Wifi was good with Verizon and never cut out. A/c was marvelous and all appliances worked. Tv with subscriptions was a nice addition. As noted in the description it is the closest structure to the interstate so there will be traffic noise although it didn’t bother be much especially with the option of white noise. Immaculately clean, goodie bag and cold bottled water waiting was a huge plus as was the pet bed and bowls for my 4 legged friend. 1 critique I have is in regards to the sign hanging on the door, it knocks on the glass with the wind/passing cars and sounds like someone’s out there frequently. The 2nd critique is to do with the trash, no kitchen trash can and no bin on the property. There’s a dumpster a few houses down and you are to bring your trash over yonder. Inconvenient especially with the cleaning fee being taken into account. Overall my cat and I enjoyed our stay here and would return + recommended it to a friend. The host, Sarah, is very kind and responsive. No regrets."

She had the temperature set at 68 and that was absolutely perfect walking in to it already set and ready for us. Kitchen is fully stocked for cooking. We walked into a little dog bed and water bowels for our boys. They loved it & so did we. It was very comfortable and perfect for what we needed. Walmart and food places aren’t but 5 miles away. It’s not far off the interstate either. Truly a great stay! We would stay again.

We were truly very happy when we walked into the Airbnb and was amazed at how beautiful and comfortable her tiny home was. We will definitely use her Airbnb again during our travels dates if it is available. Sarah kept us updated with regular email reminders which were absolutely helpful. We thanked Sarah for her wonderful Airbnb home. It's cozy & lovely.

Stayed with a pet","We were very happy with our stay. We only stayed one night at the TINY HOUSE, but we slept well!!! It was very quiet, clean, private, and the beds were great!! The lofts would be great for young kids. Our teenagers still liked the uniqueness of them and happily slept in them. We had our pets with us, and we were grateful to find this place that easily accepted them. The host was always quick to respond!! Very friendly and helpful!! We would definitely stay here again if driving through!!"

Stayed with kids","This is one of the smoothest and most satisfying experiences i have had on airbnb. The cabin was also one of the best stocked and thoughtfully prepared I have seen. There were toddler cups and plates, dishes, cookware, coffee pot, and noise machines by both beds.
We really just needed a place to sleep while visiting family and so we booked this last minute. It is near a train track and not the most scenic location, but we knew that when we booked it. But for what it is advertised to be and what we needed it was perfect.
Communication was fast and polite and we really didnt have any need to contact the host. We didnt notice any road noise or neighbors at all. It was nice and quiet.
I would recommend if you need a base camp near Wynne for any reason."

I am from Wynne but moved to Alabama a couple of years ago and this provided the perfect, peaceful rest space that made you feel at home but away! It is so cutely decorated and had a log cabin feel inside. Also, a very proactive and accommodating hostess in Sarah!
Highly Recommend!!!"

Sarah was super helpful and responsive when we had an issue with the WiFi connection. She went above what I would have expected to call the internet company and get it settled right away. We would definitely stay again when back in town."

Stayed a few nights",Sarah was very responsive and helpful with any questions. The cabin was exactly as described and pictures were accurate and not misleading. Check out was a breeze the place i had spent the previous 2 nights in hot springs had left me wondering why i was even paying a cleaning fee with all of the chores i had to perform the morning of check out but it was like that at all here and im not saying to take advantage of that treat it like its your own and dont leave it a 💩 hole. If the occasion were to arise that i needed a place to stay in this area again i would hope this place is available. Oh and the water and snacks Sarah was kind enough to put out was a very nice touch along with many others!

Stayed with a pet","The Robin’s Nest is beautiful. There were 5 (4 adults & 1 child) of us, a dog and a cat - and we had plenty of room. We never even felt crowded. The ladder to the loft is a little sketchy but it held up to 200lbs+. There’s over the door towel hooks in the bathroom but nowhere in the home to hang up clothes. The place was clean but there were dead flies and beetles in the bathtub and window sills. Kitchen has all the pots, pans, utensils & dishes you’ll need to cook. All the ‘cleaning supplies’ were in the bathroom and accessible, which is great when traveling with pets! The vacuum did an amazing job at cleaning up the pet hair! Sarah also had 2 pet bowls, a feeding mat and a pet bed, available for our use. That gets ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ from us!!! I’ve never seen a host go out of their way to accommodate pets. GREAT ADDED TOUCH! Sarah was very quick to respond to messages. Even though we were in a “Tiny House Community” it was very peaceful and quiet."

My only critique was the many cleaning requirements on top of paying a high cleaning fee. I would say the cleaning fee should be less or the requirements of the guest should be less. Switching laundry to the dryer while trying to hit the road on time was tough.

We were driving through town that night and needed a last minute place to stay with our 5 children and family dog. They were very responsive and helpful. This place was simple and has all the basic necessities. Plenty of room for our large family. It was also very clean. Its was a calm quiet neighborhood except the local train tracks. Our only complaint was the constant train horns throughout the night. Our family had a hard time falling asleep/staying asleep. We are not used to that sort of thing. But besides that it was good.

Stayed one night","I want to say this is a great place. However, my expectations and my wifes expectations were not the same. Having spent many summers camping with the Boy Scouts this cabin met all my needs. A roof over my head, a comfortable bed with clean linens and a place to shower. I typically don't ask for much myself. My wife on the other hand was a bit freaked out because ther was no ability to lock the door from the inside. There was some dust build up in places. But nothing out of the ordinary for a country cabin. We did have an issue with the hot water in the shower. Cy did offer to come over to take a look at it. However, we made due as we needed to get on the road. Let's just say it brought back a lot of memories of Summer Camp. Cy and his family are great people and I appreciate what they are doing and the location their cabins are located. It's a very unique and peacefull place. I'm looking forward to hopefully be able to stay there again next year when we make our trip to Florida again."

We also got to take a look through the museum and write our names in the guest book. The amount of work they have put into such a neat museum is incredible.

It was a nice place to rest up and recharge for the night. The location is right off a main road and conveniently located to I-40. I saw a review that the place is located in a ‘rough area’, but that’s definitely far from the truth. This location is in a nice area and you can tell by the homes that surround (there’s a mansion right around the corner from Renee’s place). Some reviews mentioned they didn’t feel safe because the home is located right off the main roadway, but I felt safe and left all my belongings in the vehicle overnight with no issues. The host also left a couple of water bottles and cocktail drinks in the fridge for us which made a nice touch to our stay as we unwinded during the evening. My wife and I make an annual trip to Southern TX so next time we make the trip we’ll definitely be booking this location."

Stayed with a pet","The place was super cute and had all the things you need. Just the location feels unsafe, especially for your vehicle. You have to park right off of a busy road completely exposed. My husband and I decided not to stay here after we got to the location because shortly after we got there someone in a car parked close by, watching us. And right when we started driving off they also drove off, so we likely barely avoided car theft. Anyway, the place itself was super cute and nice, but the location makes it hard to stay there."

Stayed with kids","Things I wished I knew before booking
Pros:
* 3 ""bedrooms"", 1 bath and a kitchen
* Clean
* One of the bedrooms uses a ""blowup mattress"" as the bed. I somehow missed that when I booked.
* Include 1 fan that works well for one of the rooms that does NOT have AC.
Cons:
* Next to noisy main road
* The provided Door lock password was incorrect. I had to call to get the correct one. Thankfully she picked up and gave me the correct one.
* Kind of misleading description of 3 bedrooms since the main bedroom is one room with the kitchen
* The main room is the only one that has AC, the other two rooms don't have AC and the provided small fan rattles and is pretty useless in the 2nd room. We put the big fan in the doorway to the 3rd room to blow some of the cool air from the main room.
* Not in a ""neighborhood"" it is next to businesses on either sides on main road.
We will not be back."

Stayed one night","Evening shade is conveniently located place for travels from TX when you need an in between stop. Just a short jump off the highway. House has items needed for a stay and preparing food although we did wash some of the dishes before use as the cleanliness of the dishes was questionable on a few items. Pay attention to the pictures, upon arrival we realized it is setup like an efficiency apartment and the main bed is in the living room and that the sofa pictured is in a “tv” room. The tv room and the second bedroom have no ac vent located in them so you can’t close the doors or you receive no ac/heat in those rooms. We actually ended up setting up the air mattress for our son in the main room with the other bed and closing off the 2 excess rooms. All the linens were fresh and clean and with the minor adjustments we had a comfortable nights sleep. There were also waters and a couple of other types of drinks left in the fridge as a nice touch. Renee was a responsive and helpful host."

Renee was promptly responsive to a pre-booking question and and the message i sent about a late PM arrival. The porch lights were ON for ua! One of my sons chose to go to sleep on the sofa instead of the air mattress due to the long drive we had put in. We used the water bottles Renee left in the refrigerator and had plenty of space for the groceries we had in the car. There were more than enough towels in the bathroom and plenty of hot water — which is SO important to teenage boys! The wifi was also great, which is important to the parents waiting their turn to shower after two teenage boys"

The beds were pretty soft, so we found that they were a bit tough for two people (both couples reported rolling towards the middle all night). But then again, this might be perfect for some! Just wanted to mention it.
Our host was gracious to add a pack and play for us so that we didn’t have to bring our own! It smelled heavily of cigarette smoke, however, so if that bothers you make sure to bring a crib sheet of your own."

The only tv is in one of the closed off rooms with a couch, and not many people can be in there at a time. The pull out couch was broken and left us short a bed. For our family it was a tight fit. The house was clean and the air conditioner worked great and there was plenty of hot water. There was limited area attractions. It works for a stop on a road trip, but we would’ve been bored for more than a quick stay. The house is close to the highway, and makes for a good place to rest.

Stayed with kids","Nice place to stay over night on our way to another state. It was comfortable and clean. Only issue was the fold out sofa, there was a note saying it was broken and to not use it so our daughter slept in one bed, our oldest son slept on the sofa but our 11 year old son didn’t have anywhere to sleep. He slept in a chair and I pulled another chair up for his legs. The place is beautifully decorated and comfortable, it’s a place we would stay again, especially is the sofa bed is working. Thank you for an overall great experience with Airbnb!"

Stayed with a pet","It was a decent place to sleep and shower during a road trip. We only used one bed, the main bed, and it was a bit worn out, so you end up rolling into the center constantly, making it a bit uncomfortable, especially for two people.
The traffic/road noise was the only real issue for us, but we are also used to our quiet secluded lake house, so we were not used to hearing alot of noise at night lol. If your looking for a clean and safe place to sleep/shower, this is definitely a good place with a convenient location when traveling."

Stayed with kids","This little house met our needs and at a great value. We needed a one-night stop while driving our four kids (4 and under) across the country, and getting an expensive one-room hotel nearby versus this house for half the price was an easy choice. Plus, we needed a full-size fridge and a kitchen since we don’t eat out when traveling, and it worked out quite well. Just note that, in the summer at least, the separate bedrooms do not cool down unless you open the doors (the air-con unit is in the main room only), although Renee did have good high-powered fans available in each room. The main bed (where we slept) was quite comfortable, though, and we weren’t bothered at all by the unshuttered small windows near the roof, like some reviews have mentioned. We slept very well! Thanks, Renee!"

Hopefully the host will take some feedback on being properly stocked for every guest, but otherwise it was great & felt cozy & safe. Also hope they will change out the shower head— if you book a stay & it is still the small one be warned you will want to use the little silver lever to make it softer so it doesn’t have so much harsh pressure. I would’ve enjoyed a warning about that or for it to have just been softer. Again everything was very clean & nice overall! Just a few small things I thought I would mention in my review for others planning a stay!"

Stayed one night","The owner seems to be a nice woman and is very responsive to your communication. The house is located in an older run-down area of town and the house is very old. It was reasonably easy to get to but is located right on the main road that is active all night long. If you are a medium to light sleeper you may want to look elsewhere. The house is clean but very dated. It is in need of serious updates including replacing the old metal, single glass windows that have bars over them and makeshift locks (think piece of wood) and a front door that does not close securely. The 2 main beds have 2 inch foam mattress covers over the mattresses. It may be to lengthen the life of the mattress but for us it wasn't very comfortable.
Overall, for the value, we have stayed at much nicer and updated Air BnBs."

Stayed one night","If you’re just stopping to sleep then this is definitely a good, affordable option! We never felt unsafe and had all of our basic needs.
If you’re sensitive to light, however, something I would take into consideration is that it was pretty bright in the first bedroom. So, if you are trying to sleep in, it may be difficult. Also, the other rooms do not seem to have AC circulation. However, there were plenty of fans to make up for this (and clocks, quite literally everywhere— which we thought was funny).
There are 2 main beds: One queen, one full sized. There’s also an air mattress (we didn’t attempt to use this), and a sofa bed that was unfortunately broken so we kept it folded. Because of this I would say it sleeps maybe 4-5 depending on whether you have small children that could comfortably share a full sized bed.
Since we are a 4 person family, we made use of the sofa-bed as just a sofa and were able to sleep everyone and enjoy our stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Very close to 40. Easy parking. It’s between two businesses and I thought it was a fun roadside store, then I realized it’s my Airbnb. Inside is clean with lots of fun art- if you enjoy funky clocks, this is the place. Bed in the bedroom was comfy.
Had a side door to let my dog out of but no fence though so FYI. The yard was quite muddy because of a recent rain but it didn’t look muddy until I walked out into the yard.
There was quite of road noise due to the close proximity to the house to the road and also the windows are older. There’s also a kennel/vet next door and there were dogs barking - especially in the morning. If you require absolute quiet time sleep or have a dog that barks when other dogs bark, then maybe this ain’t for you…. But otherwise, go for it if it suits your needs!"

Sara is personable, thoughtful & considerate of guests privacy & preferences and gave lots of good input, when I asked, on local things like small farmers market in Wynn (5 min drive) as well as local independent businesses for coffee, restaurants & more! Sarah does so many sweet and welcoming touches such as a tiny white noise machine (for the road noise) in the bedroom, an abundance of clean towels, colorful pots & pans, a variety of coffees and teas, creamers and even samples from small local independent business owners! She even took time to help fix a convoluted mess with my reservation change that really only had to do with Airbnb‘s complicated process! Sarah is way more than a super host!✨ I’d recommend this sweet, safe, friendly Tiny Homes village to anyone visiting this area of Arkansas!"

Group trip","Linda’s home was amazing.
We were in town for a family reunion and found this Gem. 💎
Lots of parking, easy to find, easy to get in.
The landscaping was beautiful. Plenty of space for the activities provided like grilling, corn hole and lounging.
The inside was very nice. Clean linens, a fun cohesive theme. There were items for everything. This home was fully stocked. I’ve stayed in Airbnbs all over the world and this was by far the best stocked Airbnb I’ve been in.
The living space was comfy. My group loved the giant Tic tac toe game. The beds were very comfy and the linens were fresh.
There was a thunderstorm while I was in town and the host reached out to us before it even started to ensure we were situated and to give details for an emergency plan should we need it. We didn’t need it and the carport provided great shelter to watch the lightening.
All in all. When I come back to town I will stay here. I wouldn’t even look for another spot.
10/10 great stay"

Stayed a few nights","We (myself, my nephew, and his two sons) recently stayed at this property while in the local area for our annual duck hunting trip. I can sum up our stay with one word - phenomenal. The property was far better than advertised and Linda, the host, was superb. Clean, well appointed, and conveniently located are just a few of the many superlatives I could mention about the house. Any amenities you would expect at your own home you’ll find here. As far as the host, I can’t think of a higher compliment to pay to her other than to say, she made us feel like family. If we’re in the area again, this property will be our first choice."

while all were

Her place was spotless, it turned out we had several mutual friends.
We lived in Forrest City, 15 minutes down the road from Linda's place, for 35 years.
I practiced pharmacy in Forrest City and Hughes, AR during those years. My wife, a public school educator practiced in Forrest City, Hughes, and Wynne during that period. We were in town from St Louis Area to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Graham Memorial Presbyterian Church. It was a memorable experience, Linda's hospitality made it more so."

Building is concrete flooring is concrete and the building is cold. My opinion is it needs another heating unit, cooling is prob fine in summer.
It’s quiet but close to road."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at The Little House. It was a great getaway location for my family, which includes two small children (ages 3 and under). There was plenty of space for them to play outside while we sat on the porch and enjoy the beautiful weather! It's about a 25 minute drive to Village Creek State Park, which is a beautiful place to visit but with the the amount of outdoor space we had to explore at the location, we were happy just hanging around and relaxing there!
Communication with Kim was great. She was extremely responsive and was very quick to answer any questions or take care of any needs we had during our stay. Check-in and check-out was a very smooth and easy process. I would highly recommend a stay here and we will definitely be returning!"

Games were everywhere and we felt very comfortable. Air purifier (we bring dogs)-so glad she offers this. Cooking utensils were Fabulous! Fire pit, chairs, and grill -we loved it. Cabinets for days in the kitchen that feels so big. Coffee, creamer, breakfast foods, other essentials that you need for cooking that you usually forget about, she has it all. And there is plenty of food. !! 2 entrances to inside the house and a huge garage with kids toys, high chair, playpen, bag-o, 70” TV and sofas with a mini split a/c-heater in it. -We will be looking at their other places and planning our Thanksgiving soon.

Also, the basic cleaning was adequate. There was quite a bit of dust on lamps and tables. The king bed is in need of being replaced and the sheets were thin and worn.
There was a dryer full of linens and towels and a dishwasher that needed to be empty!
It feels like this home is a work in progress, and with a few tweaks can stand out!
Veronica was very easy to communicate with and even had a lovely ‘grazing box’ of incredible goodies from a nearby farm that was such a treat!

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed our stay. It was a nice quiet place with everything we needed. There is golfing and what looked to be a really nice park nearby. Unfortunately, the heat and having to work kept us from exploring more. There is a decent selection of restaurants in town and we were able to get food delivered. Veronica and her husband were so kind and got the place ready ahead of check-in time so that we could have a place to cool off after losing power after a storm. We would definitely book this home again."

Veronica is an amazing hostess that has a personal touch for making you feel at home. We will be staying again on our way back through and hopefully able to explore the area a bit more!

Stayed with kids","I’ve never repeated a stay at a rental because there’s so many places to experience, however we made an exception for Ittelegna as this was my families second time we’ve stayed.
The first time we booked as an overnight stop on a road trip in March and we’re caught off guard at how much enjoyed the serenity/isolation/charm. We had hoped to take advantage of the pool, but it was just too cold at that time. We said that if we ever were in the area that we’d come back for more than a night and when it was warmer.
There had been quite a few upgrades since our first stay two years ago (a much more impressive patio area equipped with a tv to Netflix while kids played in the pool, grill area that had gas coal and a blackstone AND a hot tub). Needless to say, we took full advantage.
Sandi and Jon are great hosts. Warm, welcoming, and easy to communicate. The fresh eggs are also a nice touch."

Stayed with a pet","Wow! This takes the cake for nicest Airbnb we’ve stayed in.
We were on a cross-country road trip with our dog, and were having a hard time finding a decent place until Sandi & Jon’s came up. They were immediately informative, kind and helpful.
The place is amazing. It’s in the middle of cotton farms which just adds to the privacy and ambiance. The inside is clean, updated and spacious. The outside is a mini jungle (in a cool way) surrounding a pool.
Would love to stay again!"

Every positive review I read prior was fulfilled and then some. If you are looking for a family getaway, a weekend trip, a private vacation… basically any occasion—this is your stop. We couldn’t have thought of anything more to ask for that they already didn’t provide. Beautiful gardens and spots to lounge outside. Gorgeous pool. The private hot tub was an awesome bonus. And if nothing else the unique views of open farm land sunsets through the trees will win your heart. Just go here. You won’t regret it."

Other people were usually using the outdoor areas, and I expected a little more privacy in the pool area for what I wanted to be a secluded couples retreat, but I had never rented a guesthouse so I understand. We definitely did not think it ruined the experience of this extremely relaxing getaway at all!
We loved every minute! Including our time with the friendliest farm cat! Would definitely recommend! ❤️"

From Sandi baking us cookies to celebrate our 15 year anniversary, to giving me the biggest hug! The home was spectacular! They provided snacks, drinks and some many little things in between. The pool was wonderful. The convenience of board games, Netflix, Alexa to use made it feel like home away from home. The scenery is indescribable. The beauty of the sunset, the tropical plants that surrounded the home. I was speechless and in awe the entire time. I loved all the little touches, and swinging in the hammocks under the stars was magical. We will be back. I can’t say enough."

I definitely want to come back and stay longer to enjoy it all. They had bikes so I rode around the whole back property so my dogs could chase me and they loved it.

The kitchen is fully stocked with all cookware, coffee and utensils you might need. Our weather was not so cooperative- we really wanted to sit outside in one of the many cute seating options, but it was not to be. For those of you who are sensitive to smells, there were numerous air freshener plug ins that I needed to unplug because they were irritating my eyes but once I did that, I felt better. We were in the area to see the Jonny Cash boyhood home and to visit Wilson. It was worth the drive to this Airbnb to not stay in a boring hotel."

However the listing said it had 4 beds and when we showed up it only had 2 (one king, one sofa bed) which was unfortunate and the place was a bit smaller than we expected so finding a place for our baby to sleep was kinda difficult. But the place was nice (they had a Keurig, nice amenities, beautiful pool)! The shower however doesn't have a curtain and there is a giant mirror in the shower which was kind of uncomfortable. Overall a good place just wanted to inform of some quirks!"

The pool is amazing and the grounds are gorgeous. Everything is beautifully decorated with wonderful personal touches. I wish we had booked for at least two nights! While it was completely family friendly, it's also so romantic. I hope to come back with my husband! It felt like a home away from home and Sandi and Jon were so welcoming and made sure we knew they were around if we needed anything. The tire swings were a hit with my children. It is remote so I highly recommend picking up food before arriving because you won't want to leave after you arrive! Thank you for creating this beautiful and relaxing escape! We hope to see y'all again soon!"

Stayed with kids","The pictures don’t actually do this place justice! Absolutely gorgeous homeplace.
We just wanted a place we could relax and the girls could swim before school started. So glad we chose here!
Art and Sandy have thought of everything you need to relax on their property, which is literally like a resort!
We felt like we were on our own little island getaway.
The guest house is absolutely spectacular, with all the amenities and such charm!
Tree swings, bikes, Cornhole, so much to do.
The pool is Beautiful, with all the floats and toys you could possibly need. The kids swam, while we hung out and watched TVand relaxed in the Hammocks and sofa poolside under the veranda.
We would love to come back, even in the fall.
They are wonderful, attentive hosts that you can tell have thought out all the details...and enjoy hospitality.
Bugs are pretty bad after dusk, but wouldn’t keep us away! And they provide the bug spray, plus everything for fire pit and s’mores!
Thanks, Art and Ssndy!"

You will not be disappointed.
Worth every penny.
A first time on a shared property and was even better than we expected! By far the best amenities we’ve been offered which made it even more worth it for us. The fresh eggs were delicious and it was great to have all the extra coffee things so there was no need to leave in the morning—Or ever ;) Tons of thoughtful touches to keep the kids occupied as well. Would absolutely stay again."

The garden, the pool, the wild flowers, the chickens - it transports you to a magical and peaceful place. I can't wait to bring other friends and family back with me to experience this place for themselves. Thanks for all the inspiration (my back yard has a loooong way to go), wonderful conversation, and superior hospitality."

The decades spent creating this oasis is evident upon entering the property. Sandi’s decor is the perfect compliment to Arthur’s craftsmanship. The southern hospitality is amazing. The property is very clean and the pool is amazing. Sandi and Arthur definitely took time and thought of everything with this property. We will definitely be spending more time at this property and you should too! Don’t wait another second. Book this property!

The beautiful pool is as everyone has described, an oasis. And the home is so neat! Beautifully decorated and built with such craftsmanship- you can definitely spend some time admiring all of it.
Sandi and Art’s hospitality is unmatched, and they’re people who are so pleasant to be around and seem to really enjoy what they do. I would definitely recommend booking their place!"

If you’re looking for a place to relax and just unwind and not have to worry about anything this is your place! It is conveniently located to West Memphis which could easily take you only 20 minutes. The amenities are awesome. Sandi and Jon are the sweetest. I’m definitely looking forward to staying here again!

They have lived here 40 years, working to create this special place, and now share it with travelers like us. If you are passing through on 40, this is 100% your stop, look no further. Can't recommend enough. A+++"

Stayed with kids","What a dream!! Absolutely took our breath away. Hosts have truly thought of everything; best hospitality we’ve ever seen. Kids were beyond thrilled with the s’mores kit; couldn’t get them out of the pool! [It is indeed shared with the hosts, but their visitors weren’t present very long and Arthur only used the pool when we weren’t around.] Toddler loooved watching the chickens; got to participate in feeding/egg collecting too! Bed is heavenly; A/C worked brilliantly during high temps and all other amenities superb. Our only complaint was a result of the location itself - a very rural area, alas the bugs were quite fierce in the evening (pro tip: pack appropriate clothes and max strength insect repellent). Everything about this place has been lovingly crafted (not to mention it was originally built for their daughter’s wedding)! We would love to come back and would do so in a heartbeat!!"

You might think your lost driving past corn and soy bean fields , but just wait . They are gracious host. The house had easy parking and great comfortable bed. Beautiful sunsets. Pool is gorgeous , it rained while we we there so didn’t get to use, but did sit on back porch and listen to rain on tin roof . Lovely"
