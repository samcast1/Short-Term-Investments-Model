Stayed about a week",We have stayed at both river properties and can’t say enough good things about them. The location is great. The home’s lay out worked perfectly for our family and our holiday gathering. The kitchen is perfect. Nothing beats the view of the water while cooking. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The local farm and neighborhood dogs always make it feel like home. Would come back without a doubt if the home is available next time we come to Washington.

The pictures do not properly reflect the peacefulness and beauty of the surroundings, the sunsets, the sunrise, the horses across the street!!! Just beautiful!!! The home itself is decorated so tastefully, with an amazing kitchen to cook in. I would definitely stay here again and the price is appropriate for what is provide.
Thank you to the host for all the provided amenities and welcoming environment."

Group trip","Positioned right off of the Pamlico river in a serene atmosphere, the accomadations exceeded our expectaions completely!
This gorgeous home was equipped with everything and more that one would require for their vacation needs while still providing a “home away from home” feel.
The home was comfortable, spacious, tidy and beatifully decorated throughout. From the very comfortable bedrooms to the huge open kitchen, living room and backyard overlooking the river which was THE show stopper with its beatiful view of the water. Perfect for watching the suns breathtaking setting in the evenings and rising in the mornings Truly ideal for those who love to fish or enjoy listening to the water while sitting on the dock for a moment of peace and tranqulity.
The host was very gracious and mantained excellent communiation anytime we needed to reach out with questions. We were told to make ourselves at home and that is excatly what we were able to do with great ease. 5 Stars All the Way!"

I went into town to check out the hotels, and it was so scary! For not much more, you get this private Little piece of Heaven! I stayed at some pretty bad Airbnb even have shampoo or silverware, this place has everything you could ever need! Host was so ridiculously responsive and kind, really was better than staying at 5 star hotel, this was by far the best house/ experience I’ve ever had at Airbnb ,thank you!"

Stayed with kids","The downstairs of this place is completely updated and very modern. We brought our boat and it was so nice keeping it right outside at the dock. We used the nearby havens garden boat ramp. I LOVED that you could take the boat down and dock it at adorable downtown Washington NC.
It rained most of our visit unfortunately or I'm sure we would have gotten a lot of use out of the back patio. The view of the river is awesome.
We were sad the hot tub wasn't up and running but still kept ourselves entertained.
Loved the pool table!
Highly recommend the NY style pizza at marabella and their peanut butter cake!"

The bedroom with the trundle bed was a little misleading. We thought the 2 single men could share that room - lol! One of them had to sleep on the couch because it was a very small space! Other than that, it was perfect. The inside is beautiful and the bathrooms were nice. I would definitely recommend this house if you’re coming for a similar event!"

Hosts were extremely responsive to any questions. Guest book had great suggestions and info about the house and area. Fully equipped kitchen. Beautiful private gardens — front and back. Backyard is huge and fenced with a large screened-in porch.
Home is perfectly located in historic, downtown Washington. Easy walk to shops, restaurants and waterfront.
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will come back again. If you have the opportunity to book Neil and Natasha’s place — do it!"

I was thinking the outside would be a bit different but there’s no place to sit out on a balcony or enjoy any scenery or Main Street. People were very loud in the alley in the evening off and on between 9pm-midnight so that was a bit annoying but other than that, it was very quiet when in the bedrooms. It was nice having coffee, sugar, and creamer there for the morning. Overall, this was a great place and location. It was super convenient to be able to walk to restaurants and shops!"

The location is fantastic. Right by multiple bars, breweries and restaurants.
The host was very communicative and did a great job with all the information to check in and out easily. Set up is great with dispensers of soap, shampoo and conditioner for your showers. Even left complimentary bottles of water for us. This is a great host!
Excellent value as well. We were in town for an ECU football game. Hotel prices in Greenville were ridiculous and we love Little Washington anyway. So we stayed in this apartment and it was perfect! We will definitely plan to stay there again."

They were very respectful and responsive. The home was stocked with supplies and even included a welcome basket and waters. They have tried to plan out every need. We even met them on the water boating, and they spoke. The home itself was plentiful for the 8 of us. Highly recommended, if you need a quiet place to watch the water or a family get away, make sure you book this best secret in Washington."

Check in couldn't have been easier with the code being sent just before check in and with very clear instructions. The house was clean and cozy. It has personal touches to make my family of 4 feel incredibly comfortable. Kate made herself available for anything we needed. She was kind enough to let us know about minor repairs that were happening prior to our arrival in case it affected our stay. I appreciated her being proactive and it turned out the repairs didn't affect our stay after all! We had two small kids with us and I highly recommend this house for families. There are 2 living areas so one for the kids and one for the adults! My husband was taking a virtual class while we were there and the wifi worked perfectly for that. We will be back when we go back to NC in the future! Thanks Kate!"

Kate thought of many little touches that made it more comfortable: a good supply of coffee, paper products, detergent and other little amenities meant we did not have to run to the grocery store right away. A cute little screened-in front porch for morning coffee was an added bonus. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Washington!"

Stayed with kids","This has been the absolute BEST Airbnb experience we have ever had. We needed a place to stay for a month while waiting for our house sale to close. Without a doubt, this is the best place to need to be for a month and we got lucky being able to book it for as long as we have. The host is marvelous and so accommodating. The house is exceptionally well equipped and the host even went the extra mile to provide us plenty of additional items due to our longer stay. I cannot say enough about how generous they are and how nicely appointed the house is. The house itself is comfortable, clean and a home away from home. It’s been the perfect place to relax during a stressful time. Better than expected!!"

Stayed a few nights",Very nicely restored and furnished house. We enjoyed our stay and would return without reservation. The neighborhood is the weak point. It consists of modest homes on small lots dating from the 1950s. Most are well maintained and occupied by working class families or retirees but many are seedy. It isn’t an area that provides picturesque views or invites leisurely strolls. It is a short drive to downtown and the residential areas close to the river if you want that.

Stayed one night","The Kracked Pot is an experience and destination in it's own right. The building has so many unique features, for instance my ""room"" was a suite with a large sitting room that used to be the front parlor I imagine, the floor had an inlaid wood Greek Key design border, a piano, and leather Arts and Crafts furniture. My adjoining bedroom was also spacious with a big, comfy bed, the original tiled fireplace, a 1920's vanity, small frig and private bathroom. While decorated with antiques, art and lots of cool objects to discover, it is not cluttered, stuffy or fussy, it's a very relaxed atmosphere. There is a lush garden with a dream hot tub, best jets I've ever used. William's ceramic art is throughout the house and gardens, his work is unique, I was amazed and hope to buy some one day. There are books everywhere, and when I met Thad he was carrying a stack of them. All was super clean and well run, with thoughtful amenities and clear instructions on how to use them (which I missed reading on my first stay, but they are there ;) ). I could go on and on, but the best part was William and Thad themselves, like visiting wonderful uncles or cousins whom you haven't seen in a long while and you regret not having done so sooner. I could have just hung out at the house and had a retreat for several days. But I did go out and Lil' Washington is a charming riverfront town that feels like stepping back into simpler times where people wave and love to shoot the breeze, met some very nice people in such a short time, and there is a long boardwalk along the water to take an evening stroll. Looking forward to returning, you should definitely make a stop or stay awhile, an amazing property and wonderful people."

My husband didn’t have a car for the day while I was photographing a wedding and he was able to do a bunch of things on foot in downtown then walk back to the AirBnB for the night. William kindly accommodated an earlier check in time for us too. They have thought of all the details including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, and water for guests! This definitely has more of a feel of staying in a room in someone’s home in the sense that you walk through spaces with their personal belongings etc. but also felt private, and once in the room felt more like a private bed and breakfast room. We enjoyed our stay!"

Every time we walked through the house, there were more cute trinkets to see. The hosts were super kind, and I think this was the first time I haven't at all minded having pups around in some degree. They're so cute and well-behaved. The tub and outdoor space was an oasis, and the little touches and attention to detail were great. The room was immaculately clean. My allergies had no complaints at all. Kitchen was nice and easy to use for a quick caffeine fix. The perfect spot, thanks!"

It is what you hope for and expect in an exquisite AirBnB. The architecture and floor work is something you only see in magazines, and the history of the home goes back over 100 years.
As future residents of Washington, we spent literally hours just chatting and learning so much about Washington. They are a wealth of information of past, present and future of this amazing town. We will continue to stay with them in the future and have already recommended them to multiple friends and family. I can only wish all AirBnB experiences be the same in the future!!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay with William and Thad (and their besenjis) was amazing and completely restored my faith in the private room in a house set up.
I had recently had a very poor experience renting a private room in a house only weeks before our stay here and was very hesitant to book a private room vs entire place again but I took the chance and I am so glad I did! our experience was nothing but positive.
The house is stunning, pictures don't begin to do it justice, it's beautifully decorated and the room and bathroom were private and more than accommodating. the bed was comfortable, and the jacuzzi was one of the highlights of our days.
William and Thad are both welcoming and friendly and accommodating to sit and chat if you'd like, or completely give you your space as if their house is yours for the time your their. I was more than pleased with our stay and will be booking with them again when I'm in the area."

We bonded over our mutual Australian adventures. He is truly a Renaissance Man and has wonderful stories and charming conversations to share if you are interested. He was incredibly knowledgeable about local Washington, NC attractions and we learned LOTS about the small town that Cathy visited as a child when visiting her Grandmother. Who knew there was something here other than Grandmamma??
Our Private Room in his home was spacious and well appointed as was the ensuite bathroom. Talk about a GREAT night's sleep as well as wonderful eclectic, engaging décor! The location of his home is perfect for a walk to Main street and a car drive to other wonderful attractions in the Beaufort County area.
We would DEFINITELY come back and encourage others to do so! He gets a 10 out of 10 in our books!
Thanks so much!

Come and go as you please...enjoy the hot tub when things cool off in the evening...nap in the privacy of your room with its own bathroom. Walk or bike (bring s bike!) everywhere you need to go in Washington. And take their recommendation to go for a hot air balloon ride with IBX Balloon Rides. You won’t regret it! I’ve stayed in a lot of Air B n Bs....really good ones. This was more than a place to stay. It was an entire experience with hosts that see welcoming people as a way of life, not a business. Likely my favorite Air B n B ever. Seriously. Stay. Here."

Stayed a few nights","William and Thad greet you as if you are long lost or awaited family. Their home is historical, gracious and a treasure trove of delights waiting to be discovered. Check-in was easy, the room was amazing, as was the hospitality which was both warm and genuine. Being dog people, we were especially delighted to be accepted and welcomed by the fur-babies too. Our room was all we hoped for after booking, a haven of peace and restoration in between our activities for the weekend.
Just a few blocks from the water, their home is an excellent location to just park your car and walk Washington as you discover, explore and visit. We enjoyed the freedom to explore the garden and house and William was very generous with his knowledge and time. We look forward to staying again when we are in the area."

Stayed one night","Coming from SoCal, visiting Charleston to welcome our 3rd grandson, we decided to go on an impromptu quick 2 day road trip to find my Great-Great-Grandfather’s home. This was were my father spent many summers. It’s now a Historical Home in Hamilton NC and my family’s name is on a plaque one the front porch. We needed a last minute place to stay. We were more than fortunate to not only discover the sweet little hidden gem of an old town, Washington (SC) also known as “The First Washington” or “Little Washington”, but more so William and Thad. I Love AirBnB and it’s because of hosts like these two were look forward to staying at many more. Everything was beyond what we had expected. If I wrote everything I could this would be too long to post. Just “GO”!!! We will for sure be back and if ever I win the lottery I’d seriously invest in this old town that is destined for return greatness!"

We came for a quick day visit to get out of town and decompress, and came back soooooo relaxed. William and Thad gave us good tips about the area and what to do, and were extremely thoughtful while creating privacy as well.
Very cool huge historic house, extremely well maintained. AND the puppies were adorable, sweet and quiet. Thank you both!!"

Stayed a few nights","Will and Thad’s Airbnb is something to write about! All the good feelings I had about picking their place came true. At the mere mention that I was coming to Washington, NC as a possible new place to move, Will offered to put me and a well known realtor together for an overview of the city. That ended up happening and the realtor and I hit it off and we went to look at properties twice.
Their home is a treasure in the architecture and in Will and Thad’s amazing interior design in each room. My room with an ensuite bathroom was large and beautifully furnished, the claw foot tub that also had a shower, every amenity you could conjure up and a very comfy bed.
Will has mad culinary skills and each day breakfast was different and so very fresh with 5 star service in a gorgeous dining room...not anything to be rushed. Will is a massage therapist and I had a truly memorable massage..treat yourself!
Go out of your way to stay at Will and Thad’s...I will definitely be making a return stay!"

So many things to compliment but we especially enjoyed having coffee each morning on the screened in back porch. It was the perfect start of the day! We were close to restaurants and the water front. We enjoyed our time and look forward to booking another few days very soon. We look forward to our next peaceful stay at the cottage on 2nd Street.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Suzanne’s place in May and loved it. So when we had reason to return to the area again, we immediately checked if there was an opening for the dates we needed and made a reservation. Because we had stayed here before the need for communication was minimal but, when needed, Suzanne is prompt in responding. The house is a delight - a mix of historical accuracy and modern convenience, tasteful decor, and comfortable furnishings. It is well kept and spotlessly clean. Everything that a guest should need is provided. Because of the weather we did not use the screened porch or the hot tub on this visit, but enjoyed them on our previous visit. The neighborhood is quiet and we enjoyed a pleasant afternoon walk down Main St. There is a very nice guide with clear instructions regarding the house and helpful information about the area available in the house. Suzanne’s place easily tops our list of the Airbnb’s where we have stayed."

Parking is right in front of the house and the neighborhood is quiet with many cute older houses. The house itself is perfect for one or two couples. There are two bedrooms upstairs with very comfortable queen beds and a renovated bathroom that has an excellent shower. Downstairs is a parlor, living room, kitchen dining area and screened in porch that are well maintained and very comfortable. We did not use the hot tub or fire pit but they looked to be well maintained and in working order with several towels available on the porch and wood in the shed. I will definitely book this again the next time we visit."

Wonderful architecture and interior design, and very comfortable throughout. We spent a good portion of our time on the screen-in back porch, enjoying good books and conversation. The neighbors waved and made us feel at home, asking where we from and to enjoy our stay. The back-yard was private and the hot tub was a perfect end to the day. We strolled the downtown, enjoying the great shops, including Breaking Bread and the adjoining Pirate Waters Outfitters where we got the perfect taste of southern hospitality and an explanation of the famous Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament playing on the radio.

Everything from the welcome basket to the guest booklet, to the basket of towels for the hot tub . . . showed thought and consideration for their guests. We were simply looking for a nice place to stay while visiting family but found this to be a wonderful get-away as well. The quiet surroundings made the screened-in porch our favorite place to relax. The location is ideal - within minutes of the downtown shops and restaurants and the beautiful waterfront area. Suzanne is a top-notch hostess.

Visiting family brought us here this first time, but staying at The Cottage adds incentive to coming back."

Views were great and she gave a helpful guide for everything while we were there. She was flexible on the checkin time too, which was very helpful because I had a guest coming in from out of state and arrived a little early.
Overall we enjoyed it and would definitely stay again. Next time we will plan it when it’s a little warmer and can take advantage of the outdoor area more."

House is beautifully decorated and comfortable for our party of 6 and 2 german shepherds. We were there in February for a fairly rainy weekend so we could not enjoy some of the amenities centered around then pool and water but these would only add to the stay.

It’s an old house but nicely decorated with modern furniture & appliances. One thing that definitely caught my attention is most air bnb uses cheap toilet paper and soap but not this house. They didn’t go cheap on household items which is a plus for guests. It’s the little gesture like this that counts. The place was very clean, spacious, and cozy. Our dogs enjoyed the big backyard. Will stay here again if we come back to the area."

We were wanting a place where we could park our cars and walk to places and that’s just what we got…to the waterfront and to shops and wonderful places to eat. Downtown area is so quaint and beautiful you could just sit there all day. We even came across a man who had a baby goat walking on a leash! One of the cutest sights you’ll ever see! There’s also a place very close to home to where we could walk and get freshly made food and desserts called Carryout by Chrislyn….some of the best key lime pie you will ever find anywhere! Delicious food and awesome staff! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back….Christine & Ed thank you so much for sharing!

Home is in the historic district, on the waterfront side. It's close enough walking distance for an able body to enjoy all of the downtown conveniences. Home is equipped with everything you could need for cooking. Tankless hot water was a treat. AC worked surprisingly well as most of these older homes are not insulated like todays'. Every bedroom had ample sleeping space and ceiling fans with double curtain rods to draw black out curtains for sleeping at night, the beds slept great! The backyard was nice for our pup, we brought along a cable and attached it to the back fence (since it states in the description the fence isn't complete, its a hard mesh near the driveway); he really enjoyed the big shade tree and watching cars go by. After a lot of fun in the sun, our kids tuned into the guest access to Netflix and HBO. Overall, it was a lovely stay and I'd certainly stay again!"

A quiet neighborhood that’s a short walking distance to the riverfront. We drove into Greenville that is not far, a nice drive through the country.

Stayed a few nights","Overall experience was very good. I will be asking Bob to alert future renters to not open sliding doors off back of dining room. Hundreds of flying bugs swarmed into dining room and kitchen. Maybe, more outside insect spraying is necessary. Believe it or not we used vacuum hose to suck them up !!!!
Clearly they were attracted to inside lights.
Fair amount of work to get ride of them, but lots of laughs doing it.

The location and amenities that come with this place are unmatched. The boat ramp and dock are 50 steps from the front door and the tee box on 1 is maybe 200. Great golf course after a fun day hunting. Ate dinner at the restaurant and everything was top notch.
We will definitely be back either as another fishing weekend or as a place stay while visiting my son at ECU"

I have never had the opportunity to visit Washington North Carolina.
But this is truly one of the most beautiful cities I have ever had the opportunity to visit. The waterfront walk And the historic homes are amazing
I hope if you have the opportunity to stay at Kevin's place take the time and go for a walk.
So many lovely shops &restaurants.
Thank you again Kevin and Barbara

They have everything you need even a little fan for white noise if you're a fan person.

Stayed one night","Kevin’s place was such a wonderful experience! In the heart of downtown—and a quiet, comfortable nights stay-bed was extremely comfortable! It is a studio space, with lovely original art, and lighting to highlight the detailed pieces. I so enjoyed it, as I am an artist, with a ‘Studio House’ Airbnb, with several works from local artists. This will be my first choice accommodations the next time I am in the area.
Thank You!"

Stayed a few nights","Access to the Loft was a breeze. I will say, we were lucky that the parking spot on Main Street directly in front of the Loft was available when we first checked in so we could easily take our things upstairs. The actual loft space was the perfect size for two people and had all the amenities you would need. We really appreciated the tea and coffee available to us. The only issue we had was in the bathroom. The bathroom door opens immediately to the bed. You could reach the bathroom door while laying in bed. The shower did not appear sanitized as there was an orange-ish mark on the floor. The shower head is moveable which is great because it’s a small, corner shower. There is a bed bug protector on the mattress (which is the first thing I check anytime I’m staying anywhere) so that was a green flag! Overall, a pleasant experience and if you asked me if I’d stay again the answer would be yes. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is right downtown. Large open room. Clean. Great area to walk around and a lot of restaurants right there. The single stairwell up to apartment was kinda scary coming in at night time. The door locked at the bottom and at the top was a door to the apartment. The door had a glass window that kinda made me feel uncomfortable staying alone. (Although there is a door that was locked at the bottom of the stairs too). I put the room divider screen in front of the door in case someone tried to come in. Not necessarily any fault of the owners and nothing really wrong with it just made me a bit nervous by myself. But I never saw anyone that looked sketchy outside around the apartment. The parking can be a little tricky since it’s street parking and it’s a busy area with restaurants and stores around. When I had to park down the road, so then I had to lug all of my bags, down the road and up the stairs."

Stayed one night","I decided to stay at this loft instead of a hotel for my business travel. It was a great choice. I was only there for one night, but the amenities were well apportioned. I was able to walk to a local restaurant to meet my colleagues for dinner and that was a nice bonus.
The hosts have outfitted this more like a hotel than a straight Airbnb, which was great for me. There was a hairdryer, cleaning supplies, chilled water in the fridge, and shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower, even Downey Wrinkle Releaser! Just a number of nice touches that made this the perfect choice.
The only call out I would make is there are 20 steps from the street level to the loft. Might not be an issue but good to know for carrying luggage, etc.
I would definitely rent this space again and would love to come back for a longer stay sometime!"

Stayed with kids","Exemplary!
When we first stepped in, it immediately felt like home. The hosts have thought of literally everything. There are lots of table and desk space, the wireless connectively is perfect, and the entire place is generously equipped with snacks, sparkling waters, brand-name beauty and cleaning products, excellent cookware, cups, napkins, towels, linens, blankets, and more. In addition to literally feeling like home it is private and secluded, yet still right at the core of downtown and the waterfront.
Additionally, the host was quickly responsive to me that I almost missed his phone call!
This is the place to grab if it's available."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking to stay downtown, this is your spot. The space is tiny, but perfect for an individual or couple. The amenities are extremely clean, the furnishings and decorations unique and eclectic. The owners ensure you are provided essentials above and beyond, from granola bars to sparking water in the fridge. The downtown location is perfect for any events Washington offers year round. Two downfalls, which are frankly out of the owners control but I feel need to be noted so future renters are aware :
1. Parking is limited during the day. Washington has small parking locations for the amount of day to day traffic that they see. Main Street parking from 10-7 is almost impossible, which leaves two options the back parking lot or the waterfront parking lot. Point to this comment—— expect to walk a distance upon check in.
2. A steep/narrow staircase is your entryway to the loft. Anyone with weight or health issues may have problems with this."

Lots of great restaurants to choose from. Be sure to check out Val's Gourmet Baked Goods on Market Street...we stopped in and got a small quiche and a couple of apple Danish that we had for breakfast in the loft! The Loft is very comfy for 2 people and has everything you could possibly need. The bed was very comfortable, and there were extra blankets and towels in the closet. Coffee (really good organic coffee), individual half-and-half and French Vanilla creamers were provided, plus sugar, sweetener and teas. The Brita water pitcher was nice to have to be able to fill our water bottles before heading out for the day. Our favorite spot in the Loft was the sitting area near the front windows that overlooked Main Street! We sat here for breakfast and cocktails! Would highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!!"

The linens good; great natural light, clean light and airy, so comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with all you would need. Loved all the extra little touches, make up remover clothes, coffee, snacks, and the hoe like feel. Convenient to everything. Our only regret was that we wished we’d could have spent more time at The Loft just relaxing by ourselves! We were so busy on this trip. Thank you for being so nice to us. We will be back for another visit and will plan to stay longer."

We didn't want a huge house, but this one had a nostalgic feel that appealed to us when we were looking, and no upstairs to climb. It would be nice if the driveway was a concrete slab to keep the mud from getting on the vehicle and shoes when it's raining, but all in due time, I suspect. Our overall stay was comfortable and pleasant, and we had no problems or issues. ☺️"

This is the kind of place other AIRBNBs should aspire to offer. The water was a block away, a friendly diner next door, a bakery across the street, and several places to sit and enjoy the day."

My husband and I planned to go to Washington - less than an hour and a half away from our home - to visit the waterfront, shops, etc. We decided to stay overnight to celebrate our anniversary since we had a babysitter. Ellen was very gracious in accepting my last minute request. The apartment was in a wonderful location, just a couple of blocks from the waterfront. It was super easy to find with ample parking. The directions for check in were clear. The apartment was small, but tidy and cozy. It was perfect for the two of us. We were able to park the car for the duration of our stay and walk to the shops and restaurants, not to mention the beautiful waterfront. We really enjoyed our stay and recommend it for 1-2 people looking to relax and unwind."

Stayed a few nights","The location of ""The Caboose"" could not be more perfect for being removed from the main commerce area, but so close that walking is your best option. Great view of the river and steps away from the ""Riverwalk"" to all the offerings of the waterfront community. Mary Anne is a wonderful host, because you will have everything available to you for amenities for your stay, and she is also a wealth of the local information and a great tour guide to supply you with the information of where to go and what to do! I couldn't imagine not having Mary Anne as a source for navigating the city of Washington, she is an additional gift to the community with the use of the AirBNB if you so choose. Only wishing the best for Mary Anne and Justin with the future of ""The Caboose""! Bring your walking shoes and take the walking tour with Mary Ann, you won't be disappointed! A bit of history and a lot of personality :)"

The convenience of a kitchen is nice. The outdoor patio is my favorite part. It was easy for me to invite my friends/family to come by and visit with me which mean that I didn't have to run all over town to see the friends and family that I wanted to see. I was able to entertain outside just as if I still had a home in the area. Added bonus, my friends didn't have to clean their house for my visit. The sleeping accommodations could easily handle more than just me and my son. A queen bed for me and a double futon for him were perfect. There is also another double futon. The fridge was stocked with creamer and water. Coffee pods were provided (as well as chocolates). My favorite stay yet!"

We changed our honeymoon plans from Portugal to staying in caboose, and getting to know the area. We are so glad we did. The town is wonderful, charming, and full of amazing people.

The main bed was too soft/bouncy for me but personal preference. We'd stay there again for sure.

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend staying a Mary Anne's history-filled Caboose-- clean, well-stocked, and private. Perfect location to access the quaint waterfront downtown area of Washington. Not only is Washington home to many wonderful restaurant options, shopping, and riverfront happenings-- we saw a pod of dolphins swim along the boardwalk. Enjoyed walking along the boardwalk each night after dinner, which conveniently ends back at the Caboose! The residents of Washington are some of the friendliest we've ever encountered. Everyone spoke in passing, and many engaged in lengthier conversations-- all very proud and happy to live in Washington. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Caboose and hope to return someday. Mary Anne is a top-notch super host! Stay at the Caboose-- you won't be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","This adorable AirBNB is even better than the photos and description. I loved that we could see the water from our windows. We got up every morning and walked along the boardwalk, passing the estuarium, visiting with turtles, fish, a heron (I think?) and friendly people out getting their exercise. The moored boats were beautiful and added to the ambiance.
Our goal on this trip was to see other walls than our home, to take baby steps toward traveling again after Covid, and to just relax and decompress. We managed to do that, and the Caboose was about 90% of the reason for this.
We highly recommend this cute AirBNB!"

The bed was super comfortable, the apartment well appointed, and now my husband wants a stove-top espresso machine after experiencing the bellman! Downtown Washington was a TREAT - beautiful sights abound with a thriving downtown. Great food at Washington Crab as well as a more upscale experience at The Mulberry House. Everyone in this whole town is friendly - we loved jogging each morning on the beautiful boardwalk and well-maintained streets lined with gorgeous historic homes (I loved the walking tour guide at the Caboose - we turned it into a ""running tour!"") Thanks so much for hosting us - we will definitely be back! Thank you so very much!!"

Stayed a few nights","Mary Anne’s Original Washington “Caboose” is exactly the kind of place we look for when we play what we call “Airbnb Roulette.” We like to pick a centrally located place with a Super Host in an area we don’t know and use it as a base of operation to discover the locale. This place was perfect in every way for our needs and exactly what we think of as the ideal Airbnb property for the kind of travel we enjoy doing. We want to be close to the locals, and we want to engage in the community where we are visiting. Mary Anne’s place is exactly as represented in her photographs and narrative. It’s fun, a little off-center, and clean and well maintained. Tucked near a corner at the end of two streets, right by the start of the town boardwalk (currently being reconstructed…coming soon!), this is a great place to just park and walk the downtown area. The Town of Washington is a very interesting place to visit, with up-and-coming shops and restaurants. Do be aware that most of town is closed on Mondays, and with the current pandemic, many businesses are still not fully staffed and reopened on their regular schedules as of mid-June 2021.
Having said that, come here and check it out! This is the spot you’re looking for to relax, unwind, and embrace a slower pace of life. We did several out and back trips during our visit, including visiting other historic nearby towns. In addition, we made it to Nags Head and Kitty Hawk (Kill Devil Hill) to visit the Wright Brothers National Monument. Let us save you some time; avoid the “back” road of 264. It’s not worth the extra “scenic drive” time heading up. Just take 64 etc. (follow your GPS) up and back. It’s a long but interesting day trip and will allow you to put your feet in the Atlantic Ocean.
Local favorites for us were Backwater Jacks (amazing fried oysters), and Grub Brothers (solid fried green tomatoes and a very interesting okra johnny cake kind of thing...), with a great beer selection and solid food as well. Shep’s Grill was a very acceptable breakfast spot (and he says his lunch is really good too…), and Mary Anne recommended The Bank Bistro in one of her newsletters available in the Caboose, but we didn’t get a chance to catch them open. Several new places are coming soon, including Two Rivers Brewing, which looks like it will be a fun spot once it’s opened. There’s also supposed to be a very good gin distillery in town, but, again for us, we were not able to catch it open. Come and stay here or in Mary Anne’s sister property, The Sleeper Car, next door. You’ll be glad you did!"

Stayed a few nights",We love supporting businesses that devote themselves to preserving and honoring local history and The Red Caboose does just that so quaintly! We loved it in the past as a charming & delicious coffee shop and now enjoyed experiencing its current transformation into a comfortable and spacious place to stay in downtown Washington. Our host was welcoming and a speedy communicator. And accommodations were sparkling clean and convenient. We will return!

Stayed a few nights",The Caboose was such a fun place to stay! Everything was exactly as described and the location was perfect. Having a convenient parking place is always a plus. The futon was the most comfortable one I have ever slept on. We would absolutely return if we head to Washington again.

Stayed a few nights",The caboose was just as pictured. It was very clean and had a nice coffee bar area set for us. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom was nice and big. We enjoyed all the pictures and train items throughout. Really enjoyed learning the history of the caboose. My brother-in-law and his girlfriend live nearby and were able to come over Saturday night and we grilled out and had a nice evening together playing cards. Had plenty of room for them. Looking forward to another visit with you!

Stayed a few nights","The place and especially the bathroom were much larger than we expected. Futon was very comfy. Everything was clean and tidy. Very close to downtown Washington. When we sat outside, everyone that passed ( dog walkers, joggers, neighbors) all greeted us with a ""hello"" or "" good morning"". Having a washer and dryer also was great as we were able to get our laundry done before heading back home and start the work week. Hope we get to head back soon and enjoy the caboose."

Stayed a few nights","First using Airbnb and Marybeth Anne couldn’t have made it any better! Her hospitality is UNMATCHED. Every time we saw her on the sidewalk or in the street, she always stopped to speak. She was just great! The Caboose itself was precious! It has everything you need for overnight, weekend, or longer stays. It’s big enough for our whole family and offered enough room for family time and privacy. It was only steps away from the boardwalk that wraps around to the estuarium. Restaurants and the water are walking distance and the neighborhood is so quiet. Mary Anne will likely get tired of seeing us because we’ve already discussed it and we will be back...over and over and over!"

Stayed one night","The place is adorbs! It's right at the end of the main street, steps away from a gorgeous boardwalk that will take you to the waterfront a short walk away. The history inside and out of this cute converted coffee shop (among other businesses in its 100 year plus history) makes staying here a delight. Make sure to take a look around as you enjoy lots of space, new amenities and then of course, don't forget the outside patio. I was even able to sit under the umbrella in the rain and enjoy the patio...can't wait to return with my boyfriend and enjoy cooking and hanging out in the spacious ""caboose"" house. Mary Ann was so attentive and accommodating...you can tell she enjoys being hostess...had some cool tips (go kayak the river for sure!...the outfitters are just a 8 minute walk away!) She's so lucky to have this great spot to help others enjoy the town of Little Washington...becoming more and more a ""hotspot"" in North Carolina every day!"

Stayed one night","We only got to stay in the caboose for one night, but our stay was perfect. The space feels spacious and clean. The best part was being a few steps from the boardwalk. We arrived when it was dark outside so this was a fun surprise when we woke up the next day! The boardwalk takes you downtown and through a cute park. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring here and 10/10 would recommend!"

Stayed one night","This property’s highlight for us was the washer and dryer.
The home was well appointed with touches such as coffee creamer, dryer sheets, and juice that made our stay streamlined and homey.
Mary Anne communicated with us throughout our last minute booking and allowed us to check out a bit late since she didn’t have guests moving in the day we vacated the property.
The property is located 220 feet from one end of the Boardwalk making it super convenient for accessing historic downtown."

The Airbnb service was seamless and Mary Anne was top notch!"

The myriad train-related prints and decorative items offered a homey and quaint atmosphere. Clearly, considerable thought went into these details. The location, near the terminus of the boardwalk, provided a regular flow of pedestrian neighbors, all very friendly and welcoming. Thanks for sharing, Mary Ann."
